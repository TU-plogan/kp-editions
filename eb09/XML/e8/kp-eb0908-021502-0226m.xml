                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Situation.—Soil and Climate.—Political and Civil
                    Divisions.</hi><hi> ENGLAND</hi>, comprising, with Wales, the southern portion
                    of the island of Great Britain, extends from 49° 48' to 55° 45' N. lat., and
                    from 1 45' E. to 5° 44' W. long., and covers an area of 58,320 square miles. It
                    corresponds in latitude with Northern Germany and the Netherlands. In shape it
                    is nearly triangular; and owing to its being surrounded by the sea on all sides,
                    except for a distauce of about seventy miles on the Scottish border, it has a
                    most extensive coast-line. The seas which encircle it are the German Ocean or
                    North Sea on the E., and the Atlantic Ocean on the W. and S., the latter
                    receiving in some of its parts the names of the Irish or St George’s Channel,
                    and of the English Channel. The coast is much indented, more particularly on the
                    Atlantic side, the total length, following the indentations, being estimated at
                    over 2000 miles.</p>
                <p>There are few countries more diversified in physical structure, or in soil,
                    climate, and natural scenery, than England. As regards physical structure, it
                    has been truly described to be in itself “an epitome of the geology of almost
                    the whole of Europe.” Nearly all the formations of the earth’s crust, from the
                    Silurian upwards to the most receut, are to be found, in layers more or less
                    thick, in different parts of England. The lowest geological formations, known in
                    general as Primary or Palaeozoic, are met with principally in the north and
                    north-west of England, in the counties of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and in
                    North Wales. The rocks of Cumberland and North Wales, belonging to the Lower
                    Silurian formation, consist maiuly of slaty and gritty strata, interbedded with
                    various kinds of felspathic lava and volcanic ashes, accompanied by numerous
                    bosses and dykes of greeustone, quartz-porphyry, and other igneous rocks. These
                    latter contribute greatly to give rise to that peculiar mountainous aspect which
                    distinguishes these districts. The next geological formation, above that of the
                    Silurian, is found in the Old Red Sandstone, and the so-called Devonian rocks,
                    which occupy extensive tracts in Devonshire, Cornwall, South Wales,
                    Herefordshire, and λVbrcestershire. Above these strata comes the Carboniferous
                    Limestone, composed entirely of sea-shells, encrinites, and other organic
                    remains, which formation, stretching from South Wales through the south-west of
                    England into Derbyshire, attains in parts a thickness of 3000 feet and more.
                    Next above the Carboniferous Limestone come the strata, all-important to
                    England, known as the Coal Measures, a term originally used by the miners. The
                    beds of coal, solid basis of England’s modern supremacy in arts, manufactures,
                    and, to some extent, political power, lie upon a peculiar stratum, which
                    generally, but not always, is of the nature of fire-clay. Coal itself is well
                    known to consist of mineralized vegetable matter, the intermingled shales and
                    sandstones still showing the impressions of trunks of trees, ferns, and
                    reed-like plants, and it is supposed that this fire-clay was the original soil
                    upon which grew the priceless treasure.</p>
                <p>The Coal Measures are covered by the Permian rocks of England, which complete the
                    geological formation to which the name of Palaeozoic or Primary strata has been
                    given. “During the time they were forming,” says Professor Ramsay, “this part of
                    the world suffered many ups and downs, accompanied by large denudations; but at
                    the close of the Permian period, a disturbance of the strata on the greatest
                    scale put an end to this great Palaeozoic epoch over all our area, and much more
                    besides, and from the Permian beds downwards to the Cambrian strata a large part
                    of what is now England was heaved up and formed dry land, to be again wasted and
                    worn away by sea-waves and rivers, and all the common atmospheric agencies. This
                    old land in great part consisted of what we now know as Wales, and the adjacent
                    counties of Herefordshire, Monmouthshire, and Shropshire, of part of Devon and
                    Cornwall, and probably the Pennine chain, and all the mountainous parts of
                    Scotland. Around old Wales, on three sides of Cumberland, and probably all round
                    and over great part of Devon and Cornwall, the New Red Sandstone was deposited.
                    Part at least of this oldest of the Secondary rocks was formed of the waste of
                    the older Palaeozoic strata that had then risen above the surface of the
                    water.”</p>
                <p>If, in the physical structure of England, the Primary strata form a highly
                    important element as containing the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Coal
                    Measures, the more immediate nature of the soil is determined by the Secondary
                    and Tertiary formations. Among the Secondary strata, none are more interesting
                    than the so-called “Wealden series” of southern England. Geologists are agreed
                    upon the fact that the Wealden and Purbeck beds represent the delta of an
                    immense river, equal in size to the modern Ganges or the Mississippi, the waters
                    of which carried down to its mouth the bodies of huge reptiles and mammalia now
                    extinct, or the semblance <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n227/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0227-0216"/> of which is to be found only in the tropical
                    regions. But if this much is ascertained, by the evidence of organic remains
                    found in abundance in Kent and Sussex, there is, and in all likelihood ever will
                    be, complete ignorance as to the shape and extent of the continent which this
                    great river drained, and of which England then formed a part. Professor Ramsay
                    surmises that “in size it must have been far larger than Europe, and probably as
                    large as Asia, or the great continents of North or South America.”</p>
                <p>The formations of the Tertiary or Eocene period lie all over England, the most
                    recent being represented by the alluvial beds of Norfolk, Suffolk, and South
                    Hampshire, and of the basin of the Thames. The whole of the east coast of
                    England, and a great part of the south coast, not only bear the mark of the most
                    recent geological changes that have taken place in this country, but are
                    affected by a continuation of them to this day. A long extent of coast-line
                    constantly undergoes alterations, in some instances the land gaining upon the
                    sea, and in others, rather less numerous, the sea upon the land. The whole of
                    Romney Marsh, in Kent, embracing upwards of 24,000 acres, formerly constituted
                    an arm of the sea, where vessels rode in deep water, carrying produce to ports
                    which are no more in existence. Lydd, or, as it is called in old records, Hlyda,
                    and Romney, though maritime still in name, retaining some of the ancient
                    privileges of the Cinque Ports, have become, through changes in the coast-line,
                    small inland towns; and the same has been the fate of Rye, Winchelsea, and other
                    places in that district. Again, the Isle of Thanet, in the northeastern corner
                    of Kent, has ceased to be an island at all but in name. The wide estuary of the
                    sea, separating it from the mainland, and through which ships in comparatively
                    recent times sailed from the English Channel into the Thames, using it as the
                    shortest road from the south to London, has entirely disappeared, leaving barely
                    a rill of water to mark its former existence.</p>
                <p>If the sea retreated on some parts of the coast, it encroached, and is
                    encroaching, on the firm land over a considerable extent of other coast-line on
                    the German Ocean, at well as on the English Channel. Ravenspur, once an
                    important town of Yorkshire, where Bolingbroke, afterwards Henry IV., landed in
                    1399, is now submerged by the sea waves; and Eccles-by-the-Sea, Cromer, and
                    other ancient ports in Norfolk have met with the same fate. It is a common
                    occurrence for the pedestrian who rambles over the Kentish hills bounding the
                    narrower parts of the English Channel, to find that the path he is following
                    suddenly comes to an end at the edge of the cliff, interrupted by a vertical
                    precipice towards the shore. The process of destruction, slow in some places, is
                    so rapid in others that it can be traced from month to month, and even from week
                    to week—the incessant roll of the tides washing away the soft Eocene strata
                    forming the base of the cliffs, and leaving the summits to roll over into the
                    sea. It is the same in Yorkshire as in Kent. Over a distance of thirty-six
                    miles, between Bridlington and Kilnsea, says Professor Phillips, “the materials
                    which fall from the wasting cliff are sorted by the tide; the whole shore is in
                    motion; <hi rend="italic">every</hi> cliff is hastening to its fall; the
                    parishes are contracted, the churches wasted away.” Many cliffs of the east
                    coast, from the Humber to the mouth of the Thames, are suffering from this
                    destructive action of the sea, in some places at an average rate of from 4 to 5
                    yards a year, or a quarter of a mile in a century.</p>
                <p>In conformity with the geological structure of England, its mountains lie in the
                    north and west, falling into undulating ground in the centre and towards the
                    south, and leaving the eastern districts, bordered by the German Ocean, a
                    uniform plain. The mountains of England may be looked upon as one principal
                    chain, often interrupted, however, and with endless ramifications, stretching
                    from the Scottish border, in Northumberland, down to the western end of
                    Cornwall, jutting out there into the Atlantic. The chain, traced in this
                    direction, commences with the Cheviot Hills, the highest summit of which is
                    Cheviot Peak, in Northumberland, 2676 feet above the level of the sea.
                    Stretching south-westward, the chain next merges into the mountain ranges of
                    Cumberland and Westmoreland, comprising Skiddaw, 3022 feet, Helvellyn, 3118
                    feet, and Scawfell, 3208 feet above the level of the sea. Within these ranges
                    lie the only notable lakes of England, the largest of which, however,
                    Windermere, does not cover more than eight square miles. After sending out
                    numerous branches eastwards into the county of York, the chain sinks to modest
                    elevations in Lancashire and Cheshire, but rises again in Wales, where it
                    attains its greatest height in the summit of Wyddva, the pinnacle of the Snowdon
                    range, 3571 feet above the sea. Partly lost in the Bristol Channel, and partly
                    ramifying through Gloucestershire, Wilts, and Somerset, the chain next rises
                    into high tableland in Devonshire—Dartmoor Forest, averaging an elevation of
                    1500 feet above the sea-level, forming its most elevated portion. The chain
                    gradually declines from Dartmoor to the Land’s End, and becomes also more
                    contracted in that direction. From the Dunkerry Beacon, on Exmoor, 1668 feet
                    above the sea, the mountain range goes sinking on to Carnwarth, in Cornwall, 849
                    feet; to Cara Brea, 697 feet; and, finally, to the famous headland of Bolerium,
                    the granite masses of which oppose the eversurging waters of the Atlantic, but
                    rise only about 60 feet above them.</p>
                <p>Essentially dependent on the configuration of the chain of mountains traversing
                    England is that of its rivers. As the mountainous regions are in the west, the
                    principal rivers flow away from them, towards the east, with but few exceptions.
                    Surrounded by the sea, and with a moist atmosphere, England has a comparatively
                    large number of rivers, though none of them of great length, their course being
                    in most instances the shortest allowed by the configuration of the island. At
                    the head of English rivers, with acknowledged supremacy over the rest, stands
                    the Thames. It drains an area of 6160 square miles, exclusive of its lower
                    estuary, calculated to embrace an additional drainage of about 4000 square
                    miles. Next, in extent of area of drainage, come the Trent and Ouse, the joint
                    waters of which form the Humber, carrying off the rainfall from 9550 square
                    miles of land, or about one-sixth of the whole of England. The Witham, the
                    Welland, the Nen and their tributaries, flowing into the old estuary of the
                    Wash, drain together an area of 5850 square miles. In comparison with the
                    drainage area of these rivers, running principally from east to west, that of
                    currents following an opposite direction is small; but several of them are
                    nevertheless of great commercial and industrial importance. Foremost among these
                    westerly-flowing rivers stands the Severn, the course of which is only a short
                    distance from the head of the Thames, the watershed being formed here by the
                    narrow Oolitic escarpment of the Cotswold hills. The Severn drains an area of
                    8580 square miles, being more than that of all the other westwardrunning rivers
                    together. Next to it stand the J∖fersey, which, with its sea-estuary, drains
                    1750 square miles, the Avon, which drains 1210 square miles, and the Eden, which
                    drains 995 square miles of land. In Camden’s <hi rend="italic">Britannia,</hi>
                    published in 1605, there is a list enumerating 553 rivers and streams, with
                    separate names, in England and Wales; but it cannot be said that there are, at
                    the utmost, more than fifty rivers that can properly be described as navigable.
                    The former importance of the rivers of England, connected with each other by a
                    vast network of canals, for inland <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n228/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0228-0217"/> navigation, has suffered much since the
                    introduction of railways; still they continue of great benefit for cheap, if
                    slow, communication. Of the highest commercial value still are the Thames, the
                    Humber, the Mersey, and the Severn, but these four principal English rivers
                    derive their importance mainly, if not entirely, from being arms of the sea.</p>
                <p>Affected by its insular position, with no part of its land more than a hundred
                    miles from the sea, and perhaps equally as much—though modern scientific
                    investigation has not quite set this matter at rest—by that most remarkable
                    current of the ocean known as the Gulf Stream, the climate of England is much
                    milder than that of any other country in the same latitude on the continent of
                    Europe, or in America. The mean annual temperature of England in recent years
                    has been 49'7°,—that of summer averaging 60 ’ 8°, and that of winter 39 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5°. The principal cause of this very high as well as
                    very equable temperature, contrasting to a marvellous extent with that of other
                    countries in like latitude, such as, for example, Northern Canada, is generally
                    ascribed, with but few dissenting opinions, to the constant flow of heated water
                    bathing the western shore of the island. The vast current of the Gulf Stream,
                    originating within the land-locked area of the Gulf of Mexico, where the
                    tropical sun is heating the waters as in an immense cauldron, after running for
                    some distance eastward into the open ocean, then turns direct to the north-east,
                    so that the first land it meets with, and which feels its effect, is the shores
                    of Ireland and England. The actual amount of heat so given to England must be
                    enormous, since the temperature of the Gulf Stream 13 at least 8° above that of
                    the surrounding waters of the North Atlantic. A recent scientific traveller,
                    making experiments in a voyage from England to the United States, found that,
                    while in the Gulf Stream the water was at sunrise always not less than 4° above
                    the temperature of the air, by a sudden change, on quitting the north-easterly
                    current, the temperature of the waves was found to be, on the average, 4° below
                    that of the air. England is thus in the position of a great hot-house, kept
                    above the surrounding temperature by never ending currents of warm air.</p>
                <p>But it is not warmth alone, but moisture, which the Gulf Stream gives to England.
                    Here, as in the greater part of western Europe, the prevailing winds are from
                    the southwest, bringing with them the warm, moist air of the great Atlantic
                    current, and discharging it in rainfall all over the land. This is strikingly
                    shown in the statistics of rainfall in England, which prove it far higher in the
                    western than in the eastern counties, and greatest in those parts where the
                    moist Atlantic air-currents are unimpeded by mountain ranges. In the extreme
                    south-west, in Cornwall, from 22 to 47 inches of rain fall every year, and the
                    average may be taken at 36 inches; while in the adjoining county, Devonshire, a
                    little further inland, the average is but 32 inches. However, the high range of
                    the Dartmoor hills causes a much greater variation in the amount of rainfall in
                    the latter county than in the former; for while no less than 52 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 33 inches fall on the summit of Dartmoor, only 19 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 87 inches fall at Sidmouth, lying sheltered to the
                    west. The same is the case further east, in Somersetshire, where 36 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 76 inches of rain fall annually at West Harptree,
                    facing the Bristol Channel, while only 19 inches fall at Taunton, shut off from
                    the moist gulf current by the Exmoor range. So it is everywhere, all over
                    England, with the general result that in the west, and more especially the
                    southern parts of it, there is more rainfall than in the east, the variations
                    also being much less in the latter districts. In Dorsetshire the annual rainfall
                    varies from 18 ’ 45 inches at Abbotsbury to 29Ό5 inches at Blandford, and in
                    Wiltshire from 18 ’ 14 inchesat Chippenham to 25 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    20 inches at Salisbury. Further eastward, in Hampshire, the variation is from
                    16'51 inches at Aldershot to 26 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 90 inches in
                    Woolmer Forest; while in Sussex, nearer the sea, it is from 18'18 inches at
                    Hastings to 32 ’ 79 inches at Chichester. In the metropolitan counties of
                    Middlesex, Kent, and Surrey the variations are no greater than from 16’22 inches
                    at Hampstead to 28 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 90 inches at Cranbrook. The
                    highest rainfall anywhere yet ascertained in England and Wales was at
                    Beddgelert, Carnarvonshire, where it reached the enormous amount off 101 ’ 58
                    inches in the year 1870. Lying on the western slope of the highest summit of the
                    Snowdon range, close to the Atlantic, the little village received a surcharge of
                    the moist air of the Gulf Stream.</p>
                <p>Co-operating in their influence, climate and geological formation have given
                    England a soil moderately fertile, yet adapted on the whole more for pasturage
                    than for agriculture. In Wales, and other parts of northern and western England
                    through which stretch the principal mountain ranges, the Silurian rocks, covered
                    on their upper surface chiefly with hard gritty and slaty material, difficult to
                    decompose by atmospheric action, form but little soil, so that the ground must
                    to a large extent remain untilled, leaving it at the same time well adapted for
                    pastoral purposes. Again, through the inland counties, from Northumberland to
                    Derbyshire, there runs another long tract of hilly country, composed of
                    carboniferous rocks, so constituted as to be unfit for ordinary agriculture,
                    except where intersected by stream-fed valleys. Further east come the bleak
                    moorlands of Yorkshire, which, barren in their nature, are being surrounded and
                    intersected by some of the most fertile tracts in England, extremely well
                    cultivated and thickly inhabited. On the whole, it may be said that while much
                    of the high-lying ground is fit only for pastoral purposes, the low lands are
                    more or less fertile, the extreme moisture of the air having caused the complete
                    disintegration even of such old geological formations as those of the Red
                    Sandstone. It is a somewhat singular fact that nearly all the districts of
                    England, where fruit-trees are grown in large quantities, lie chiefly upon red
                    rocks, sometimes of the Old and sometimes of the New Sandstone strata. There
                    cannot be a doubt, however, that, on the whole, the soil of England would be
                    very barren, repaying poorly the labours of the husbandman, but for the vast
                    cover of warmth and moisture received from the waters of the Atlantic, which
                    favours it as the sun of more southerly regions, and makes its fauna and flora
                    equal to those of any country in the temperate zone.</p>
                <p>The physical aspect of England has had little to do with its civil divisions,
                    which are somewhat arbitrary, and remote in their origin. The division of the
                    country into tythings, hundreds, and counties is generally attributed, on the
                    authority of Ingulphus, to King Alfred, but it is more probable that he only
                    systematized what already existed, in the general survey which was taken during
                    his reign. English county names occur in history before the extinction of the
                    Heptarchy, some of the smaller kingdoms of which, as Kent, Sussex, and Essex,
                    became counties under the new political settlement. At the same time, the
                    kingdom of Wessex was composed of counties with still existing names, Berkshire,
                    Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Somersetshire. Under King Alfred’s re-arrangement,
                    virtually that of the present day, as far as the larger divisions are concerned,
                    physical boundaries were frequently disregarded, which had its cause probably in
                    the existence of the older political borders, such as those existing during the
                    heptarchy. On the east coast of England, the divisions generally conform with
                    the physical features: the Tyne, Tees, Humber, Wash, Yare, Stour, and Thames
                    separate the counties of Northumberland, Durham, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire,
                    Norfolk. Suffolk, Essex, and Kent. The same, however.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n229/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0229-0218"/>
                <p>is not the case on the south and south-west coast, the smaller rivers of which
                    were disregarded in fixing the borders of Kent, Sussex, Hampshire, and Devon.
                    Again, the east-running Thames divides counties from its mouth almost up to its
                    source; while the westerly Severn forms not a single boundary, even for a short
                    distance, from its spring down to its sea estuary. Finally, the dividing line
                    between England and Scotland is mainly artificial in the west, while in the east
                    are the natural boundaries of the Tweed and the Cheviot Hills.</p>
                <p>Modern legislation has made few changes in the ancient divisions of England into
                    counties, or shires, and hundreds. Each of the forty counties of England and
                    twelve counties of Wales is still primarily divided into hundreds, although the
                    borders thus formed are little more than nominal, the hundreds having become
                    practically extinct as an administrative subdivision. Originally signifying a
                    district containing a hundred families, the division lost its meaning entirely
                    with the unequal increase of population, and at present, while some hundreds
                    count their population by hundreds of thousands, others have not gone far beyond
                    the number that gave rise to the name. At the census of 1871 the number of
                    hundreds, or their equivalents, for which the population was separately shown
                    was 818. In naming the subdivisions corresponding to hundreds, the ancient word
                    “wapentake” is still adopted officially as regards the counties of York,
                    Lincoln, and Nottingham,— Yorkshire, exclusive of the city of York, and
                    Lincolnshire being each divided into three parts, consisting of a given number
                    of wapentakes. In Cumberland and Westmoreland the hundreds are called “wards,”
                    while in Kent they are grouped into “lathes,” and in Sussex into “rapes.”</p>
                <p>Intimately connected with the division into hundreds in former times was that
                    into boroughs. The old Saxon borough, in fact, was nothing more than a hundred,
                    or a group of hundreds, encircled by a moat, a stockade, or a wall. All the
                    inhabitants of the borough, or burgesses, were freemen, bound to each other as
                    neighbours, sharing common burthens, and responsible for each other to
                    surrounding communities. As the boroughs grew in size and importance, the
                    hundred lost its former significance; still for a long time the original
                    principle was kept in view of having the same subdivision, organization, and
                    government for town and country populations. Many of the ancient boroughs have
                    now fallen into decay, while new boroughs sprang up in many parts of the country
                    with the rapid progress of population which commenced after the middle of the
                    last century. In 1835 a great change was made in their constitution, and the
                    limits of many were enlarged by the adoption of new boundaries. The change was
                    the result of the labours of a parliamentary commission appointed “to inquire
                    into municipal corporations.”</p>
                <p>The parliament ιry commissioners experienced, at the outset of their work,
                    considerable difficulty in ascertaining the exact number of corporate bodies in
                    England and Wales. Acting upon the best information they were able to collect,
                    they visited and instituted inquiries in 285 places. It was found that 16 of
                    them contained corporations of an exclusively manorial character; that 89 could
                    claim to be properly boroughs; and that the remainder, 178 in number, required
                    legislation to settle their rights and privileges. The latter, accordingly, were
                    placed under the operation of the Municipal Corporation Act, 5 and 6 Will. IV.
                    c. 76. Subsequently to the passing of this Act, two more old boroughs,
                    Ashton-under-Lyne and Hartlepool, were brought under its provision by the grant
                    of new charters.</p>
                <p>It was provided for by section 141 of the Municipal Corporation Act that any
                    towns, on the petition of the inhabitant householders, may have granted to them
                    charters of incorporation if Her Majesty, by the advice of the Privy Council,
                    shall think fit to accede to the request. The number of towns which thus
                    obtained charters has since 1835 been 45; but the provisions of the Act were not
                    universally adopted, and to this day a number of towns, some of considerable
                    importance, are still without municipal organization. At the census of 1871, the
                    total number of municipal boroughs was 224, containing more than onefourth of
                    the population of England and Wales.</p>
                <p>Claiming high rank among the municipal corporations of England, and forming one
                    of the most ancient and celebrated subdivisions, or jurisdictions, of the
                    country, are the Cinque Ports. The Cinque Ports existed as self-governing
                    boroughs from a very early time, though the exact date of their incorporation is
                    not known. It is stated in Jeake’s <hi rend="italic">Charters of the Cinque
                    Ports</hi> that in the records of the town of Rye there is a memorandum that
                    “the five Ports were enfranchised in the time of King Edward the Confessor.” The
                    five ports originating the title were Hastings, Romney, Hythe, Dover, and
                    Sandwich. To these were added the so-called “ancient towns” of Rye and
                    Winchelsea, which were placed, as regards rights and privileges, on the same
                    footing as the original Cinque Ports. Each of the seven towns, with the
                    exception of Winchelsea, had one or more “members,” or “limbs,” placed under the
                    mantle of its privileges, very important for many centuries, one of them being
                    an almost entire exemption from taxes levied by the king. In early times these
                    “members” were in a great measure dependent from their respective ports, but the
                    old connection has long ceased. Most of the old “members” are at present
                    corporate towns, and therefore completely independent, and only the few that are
                    not remain under the municipal jurisdiction of their parent ports. The still
                    existing privileges of the Cinque Ports, including jurisdiction of the south
                    coast from Seaford in Sussex to the mouth of the Thames, are of no great
                    importance, but they are favoured by a large share of parliamentary
                    representation. (See also vol. v. p. 786.)</p>
                <p>Unlike the civil divisions of the country, those formed for parliamentary
                    representation are mainly of recent date. Vast changes in the character of this
                    representation—the origin of which is involved is much obscurity—were made by
                    the Reform Bill of 1832; and others, scarcely less important, by the statute of
                    30 and 31 Vict. c. 102, known as the Reform Act of 1867.. By the latter Act, the
                    existing franchise was not only much enlarged, but new divisions of counties
                    were made for electoral purposes, while the limits of many boroughs were
                    extended, new ones created, and old ones excluded from the list. The new
                    parliamentary boroughs created by the Act of 1867 were Burnley, Chelsea,
                    Darlington, Dewsbury, Gravesend, Hackney, Hartlepool, Middlesborough,
                    Staleybridge, Stockton, and Wednesbury; a representative was also given to the
                    university of London, and additional ones to Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool,
                    Manchester, Merthyr Tydfil, and Salford. On the other hand, 4 boroughs were
                    disfranchised immediately by the Act, and 7 more in 1868, the year after its
                    passing, while 36 were reduced to one representative instead of two. In the new
                    division of counties made by the Reform Act of 1867, Cheshire and Lincolnshire
                    were separated into North, Mid, and South; Devonshire and Derbyshire into North,
                    South, and East; Essex into North-East, North-West, and South; Norfolk into
                    West, North-East, and South-East; Somersetshire into East, Mid, and West; and
                    the West Riding of Yorkshire into North, Mid, and South; with minor alterations.
                    These re-arrangements of parliamentary representation were more than justified
                    by the changes of population brought about by time. Within the parliamentary
                    boroughs the population increased 16'1 per cent, from 1851 to 1861, and 23 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 3 per cent, from 1861— 71; while outside them the

                    -</hi> 5 per cent, in the second decennial period.</p>
                <p>Much less systematic than the parliamentary are the judicial divisions of the
                    country. There is in all of them a striking want of coherence, even as regards
                    the administration of the laλv. The circuits of the judges do not consist of any
                    definite number of the county-court circuits, nor are the county-court circuits
                    aggregates of the petty sessional divisions. For the purposes of assizes and
                    jail delivery, there are in England eight circuits of the judges, besides the
                    jurisdiction of the central criminal court in London. The eight circuits of the
                    judges have received the names of the Home, Midland, Norfolk, Oxford, Northern,
                    Western, North Wales, and South Wales circuits, indicating the counties which
                    they embrace. Based chiefly on the old boundaries of hundreds, all tho counties
                    of England and Wales have divisions for the purposes of special and petty
                    sessions. By the authority of various Acts of Parliament, the justices at
                    quarter sessions are allowed to alter and rearrange these sessional divisions,
                    making them conformable, if so inclined, to the boundaries of poor-law unions.
                    The last census returns show that in 1871 there were 700 sessional divisions in
                    England and Wales, besides 193 boroughs with petty sessions, 97 of the latter
                    having also separate quarter sessions. For police purposes there were, at the
                    same time, 622 divisions, including 167 boroughs possessing independent police
                    control.</p>
                <p>Quite as early as the division of the country into hundreds was that into
                    ecclesiastical districts. But they varied much, both in number and extent, up to
                    the time of the Reformation, and there have been constant alterations up to the
                    present time. The ancient division of the land for ecclesiastical purposes was
                    exclusively into parishes, or districts containing a church; but as the
                    population went on increasing, and additional places of worship came to be
                    erected, some portions of the old parishes were generally assigned to the newly
                    formed districts. First known simply as chapelries, these districts gradually
                    acquired boundaries as definite, and as fully recognized by law, as those of the
                    parent parish. In recent years, the term parish has acquired a rather uncertain
                    meaning, being used in a twofold sense,—the clergy adhering to the old
                    signification of ecclesiastical district, while the poor-law authorities make it
                    the designation of boundaries separately rated for the relief of the poor. In
                    the census returns for 1871, the term “civil parish” was adopted for the
                    poor-law parish, to distinguish it from the ecclesiastical parish. The exact
                    number of ecclesiastical parishes was not ascertained at the census of 1871,
                    which only refers to “ecclesiastical districts,” 3000 in number; and in the
                    absence of other official information, it is difficult to calculate it, the more
                    so as new parishes are being constantly formed by the action of the
                    Ecclesiastical Commission, established in 1836, by Act 6 and 7 Will. c. 77.
                    According to estimates based on the returns of the <hi rend="italic">Clergy
                    List,</hi> there are at present about 13,500 ecclesiastical parishes in England
                    and Wales. They are grouped in 728 rural deaneries, with further division into
                    78 archdeaconries, 30 episcopal dioceses, and 2 archiépiscopal provinces.</p>
                <p>Besides the divisions already enumerated, there are various others of minor
                    importance, or not in frequent use. Of this character are the so-called
                    lieutenancy subdivisions, established to carry out the laws affecting the
                    militia. Within the boundaries thus formed, lists are kept containing the names
                    of all men liable to serve, under certain circumstances, in the militia of
                    England and Wales, so as to keep the force in permanency. A subdivision of
                    another kind is that of the country into highway districts. These divisions were
                    constituted under the Act 25 and 26 Viet, c. 61, which gave power to justices in
                    general, or quarter sessions, to form special boundaries, consisting of parishes
                    and places not within the jurisdiction of other boards or legal authorities, for
                    the better management of highways. The Act came into effect in 1863, but its
                    provisions, being optional, were not widely adopted; it led to the formation of
                    not quite 500 highway districts. Their extent and population was not given in
                    the census returns of 1871.</p>
                <p>In the introduction to the report on the census of England and Wales, the
                    registrar-general furnished a list of the various divisions of the country,
                    showing their complexity. He classed the whole of the existing divisions,
                    including those made for the special purpose of taking the census, into five
                    orders, as follows :—</p>

                <p>Commenting upon the extraordinary amount of divisions and subdivisions of England
                    and Wales, the registrargeneral remarks that “it is a peculiarity of this
                    country that nearly every public authority divides the country differently, and
                    with little or no reference to other divisions; each authority appears to be
                    unacquainted with the existence, or at least the work, of the others.” He gives
                    at the same time his opinion that “one simple connected series of subdivisions
                    of the country” would not only simplify the census takings, greatly disturbed at
                    present by “the multiplicity, entanglement, and want of harmony in the groups,”
                    but would still more be an aid towards reducing “the difficulties of local
                    administration.”</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">A rea and Population.—Vital
                    Statistics.—Emigration.</hi></p>
                <p>Until the beginning of the present century, there existed no other knowledge of
                    the actual area and population of the country but what was given in the vaguest
                    estimates. But there can be little doubt that the population of England and
                    Wales was almost stationary for centuries, owing chiefly to want of
                    intercommunication, which led to famines, more or less severe—it being a common
                    occurrence that, while one county, with a good harvest, was revelling in
                    abundance, the people of the adjoining one were starving. It is calculated, on
                    the basis of a number of parish registers, that in 1650 the population of
                    England and Wales numbered 5,450,000, having probably risen less than half a
                    million during the lapse of a century. In the course of another century, when
                    there was a feeble commencement of roadmaking, the increase amounted, probably,
                    to close upon a million, the calculated population of 1750 being 6,400,000. From
                    that time began a marked increase, and at the taking of the first census, in
                    1801, it was ascertained that the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n231/mode/1up"

                    miles, or 37,324,883 acres, numbered 8,892,536, being—if the former estimates
                    were approximately correct—an increase of very nearly 2∣ millions in little over
                    fifty years. This rate of increase was not only continued, but came to be
                    greatly exceeded in the present century.</p>
                <p>Since the first census of 1801, regular enumerations of the people of England and
                    Wales have been taken every ten years. The results of these enumerations are
                    shown in the subjoined table, giving the total numbers of the population at each
                    census, together with the absolute increase, and the growth per cent., during
                    each decennial period:—</p>

                <p>The increase of population throughout the century was larger in the towns than in
                    the country districts. This was most markedly the case in the centennial period
                    from 1861 to 1871, as will be seen from the following table, showing the
                    increase per cent, of the population in each of the eleven “registration
                    districts” mapped out' by the registrar-general. It will be seen that the
                    greatest increase was in the division, rich in manufacturing and mining
                    industries, embracing the northern counties and Yorkshire, and the least in the
                    agricultural districts of the south-western and eastern counties.</p>

                <p>England and Wales are at present more densely populated than any country of

                    proportion in Scotland was only 109, and in Ireland 169 per square mile, in
                    England and Wales it was 389 inhabitants per square mile.</p>

                <p>At the end of June 1877, the population of the 13 largest towns in England and
                    Wales, each with over 100,000 inhabitants, was as follows, according to the
                    estimates of the registrar-general, based upon the returns of births and deaths
                    :— London, 3,533,484 inhabitants; Liverpool, 527,083; M ∣nchester, with Salford,
                    500,397; Birmingham, 377,436; Leeds, 291,580; Sheffield, 274,914; Bristol,
                    199,539; Bradford, 173,723; Newcastle-on-Tyne, 139,929; Hull, 136, 933;
                    Portsmouth, 124,867; Leicester, 113,581; and Sunderland, 108,343
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>While the eight decennial census enumerations, from 1801 to 1871, bear witness to
                    the rapid growth of population in England and Wale3, the favourable vital
                    statistics of the country are no less distinctly shown by the annual returns of
                    the registrar-general compiled from the registers of births, deaths, and
                    marriages. These registers, in use, though not general, since the reign of Queen
                    Elizabeth, were formerly a part of the ecclesiastical organization, and
                    continued to be attached, more or less’ to the church till the year 1837, at the
                    commencement of which an Act of Parliament came into operation which provided a
                    far more complete machinery than that before existing for the exact record of
                    all births, deaths, and marriages. The new system—established eighteen years
                    earlier than a similar one for Scotland—which relieved the clergy from the
                    functions previously thrown upon them, was still more improved by subsequent
                    Acts, one of the most important of which, making all registration of births and
                    deaths compulsory, came into operation on the 1st of January 1875. It is
                    generally held that the present system is as perfect as that of any country in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>The following table gives the annual numbers of births, deaths, and marriages in
                    England and Wales for every fifth year from 1841—when the improved system had
                    been brought into full organization—to the year 1876 :—</p>

                <p>Taking the average of the whole period of 37 years, from 1841 to 1876, there was
                    one birth annually to every 29 persons, one death to every 45 persons, and one
                    individual married to every 61 persons. The highest birth rate was in 1847, when
                    there was one birth to 32 persons; the lowest death rate in 1845 and 1850, when
                    there was one death to 48 persons; and the highest marriage rate in 1853, when
                    one individual was married to every 56 persons.</p>
                <p>The proportion of the sexes born—not quite regular throughout the period, but
                    with a marked tendency to male decrease—was that of 104,811 boys to every
                    100,000 girls. The disproportion in the excese of male births has been
                    ascertained to find its equilibrium, through a higher rate of infant mortality
                    among the males, about the tenth year of life, and is finally changed, by
                    perilous male occupations and other causes, to the extent that there are 100,000
                    women of all ages to 94,900 men in England.</p>
                <p>The number of illegitimate births underwent a gradual decline in the period from
                    1840 to 1876, which was greatest in the last decade. The average annual number
                    of illegitimate births to every 100 births was 5’7 in the ten years from 1865 to
                    1874, and fell to 5 ’ 0 in 1875, and to 4 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8 in
                    1876. The rate of illegitimacy was highest in the agricultural counties, where
                    it increased in recent years, while largely decreasing in the urban districts.
                    The increase was highest in Essex, where it rose to 10 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 5 per cent.; in Hertfordshire, where it rose to 17 ’ 3 per cent.; and in
                    Rutlandshire, where it went as high as 23 ’ 5 per cent., so that in the latter
                    purely agricultural county nearly onefourth of all the births were
                    illegitimate.</p>
                <p>It seems probable that the decrease of illegitimacy in the urban districts is
                    much influenced by a constantly increasing number of early marriages. While in
                    the quinquennial period 1841-45 the proportion of males under age that married
                    was 4 ’ 3⅛ per cent., and of females 13 ’ 33 per cent., the marriage rate of
                    minors, undergoing a steady and uninterrupted rise, went up in the period
                    1871-75 to 8 ’ 15 for males and to 22 22 for females. In the ten years from 1846
                    to 1855, the proportion of males under age who married was 10’64 per cent,, aud
                    of females under age 33’47, while in the ten years from 1866 to 1875, the
                    proportional percentage was 17Ό5 for men and 47’09 for women.</p>
                <p>The rates of births, deaths, and marriages in England and Wales compare very
                    favourably with those of most Continental countries. While the average annual
                    birth rate in the twenty years from 1856 to 1875 was higher in some states, such
                    as Prussia and Austria, the annual death rate during the same period was much
                    lower, resulting in a larger actual surplus of births over deaths. As regards
                    the average marriage rate within the period, that of England and Wales was not
                    as high as in some Continental countries; but this again was more than
                    compensated for by a greater fecundity of marriages. Taking the total increase
                    of population within the century, England stands at the head of the list—France
                    being at the bottom—of all the states of Europe.</p>
                <p>The increase of population would have been still greater, but for the disturbing
                    element of emigration. It was soon after the cessation of the Napoleonic wars
                    that the emigration movement from the United Kingdom began, setting in at first
                    very feebly, and being directed almost solely towards the United States of
                    America. It gained intensity during the decade from 1841 to 1850; and, gradually
                    rising, reached its highest point in 1851 and 1852, in which years respectively
                    335,966 and 368,764 persons left the kingdom. After this there was a gradual
                    decline in the number of British emigrants till 1861, when it sank to 91,770,
                    which decrease was followed, with changes, by a further rise, and then by a
                    final decline, lasting to the present time.</p>
                <p>The following table gives a survey of the emigration from the United Kingdom to
                    foreign countries, in groups of years and single years, distinguishing two great
                    periods of rise and fall, from 1815 to 1852 and from 1853 to 1876 :—</p>

                <p>During the whole of the two periods, embracing sixty-two years, the total number
                    of emigrants that, left the United Kingdom was 8,424,042.</p>
                <p>In the returns of emigration issued by the Government, no distinction of
                    nationalities was made previous to the year 1853; aud it cannot be stated,
                    therefore, how many of the emigrants who left the country from 1815 to 1853 were
                    natives of England and Wales. In the eight years from 1853 to 1860 the number of
                    English emigrants was 195,684, and in the ten years 1861 to 1870 it rose to
                    365,115. In 1871 the number was 71,926, and in 1872 it rose to 82,339. The
                    number fell 78,968 in 1873, to 56,338 in 1874, to 43,867 in 1875, and to 34,612
                    in 1876. During the whole of the twenty-four years from 1853 to 1876 the number
                    of emigrants from England and Wales was 928,898, out of the total emigration of
                    4,961,350. The proportion of English emigrants was thus less than one-fifth, and
                    assuming the same to have been the case during the whole period, it may be
                    calculated that about a million and a half of natives of England and Wales
                    quitted the country in the sixty-two years from 1815 to 1876, which formed the
                    emigration period.</p>
                <p>The period all but closed with 1876, in which year the surplus of British
                    emigrants over returning immigrants was reduced to the small number of 17,822.
                    Since the year 1870, but not previously, tolerably accurate accounts were kept
                    of immigration as well as emigration, with the results shown in the following
                    table, which gives for the seven years from 1870 to 1876 the number of emigrants
                    of British origin, together with the number of immigrants, with the balance of
                    net emigration.</p>

                <p>The British emigration of 1876 was made up of 73,396 persons of English, 10,097
                    of Scottish, and 25,976 of Irish origin. Of the English emigrants, 34,612 went
                    to the United States, 6227 to British North America, 20,582 to Australia, and
                    11,975 to other colonies and other foreign countries. More persons of British
                    origin returned from the United States than went there in the year 1876, the
                    number of emigrants being 54,554, and of immigrants 54,697. On the whole, it
                    seems probable that the emigration movement will not soon again rise to the va3t
                    dimensions it once assumed, and that, at any rate, it will cease to be an
                    important factor in the growth of the English population.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Division of the Land.—Agriculture.</hi></p>
                <p>Till within the last few years nothing whatever was known regarding the ownership
                    of land in England, and widely differing estimates, none of them of any real
                    value, in the absence of all authentic facts, were brought forward from time to
                    time about the subject. Various attempts to get official returns failed, till at
                    last the House of Lords consented to an inquiry, which resulted in the
                    publication, in 1876, of a report in two volumes imperial quarto, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Landowners in England and Wales: Return of the Owners of Land of
                    One Acre and upwards in England and Wales, exclusive of the Metropolis, with
                    their Names, Addresses, Extent of Lands, and Estimated Cross Rental.</hi> Though
                    the information put forth in this Bluebook, referring to the year 1873, is not
                    distinguished by great accuracy, the returns regarding the extent and rental of
                    the land being based on the parish valuation lists, mostly very defective, while
                    large extents of land are not accounted for at all, still the publication proved
                    of the highest interest, as containing the only actual facts known about the
                    division and ownership of the land.</p>
                <p>The summary of the return published by the Government, referred to frequently as
                    the New Domesday Book, showed that iu the year 1873 there were in England and
                    Wales 972,836 owners of land, holding together 23,013,515 acres, of a gross
                    estimated rental of .£99,382,301. The subjoined table exhibits the number of
                    landowners, under thirteen classifications of ownership, the total extent of
                    lands held by each class, and the gross estimated rental :—</p>

                    less than 4,311,368 are not accounted for in the foregoing returns. These must
                    consist partly of waste spaces, moorlands, and other areas, including that of
                    the metropolis and crown property, intentionally set aside; and partly of lakes,

                    based. Still, with all these imperfections, and the undoubted miscalculations in
                    the rental values, generally admitted to be large under-statements, enough
                    remains to give a fair idea of the division of landed property in England and
                    Wales.</p>
                <p>One of the most notable features of the returns is the fact that the number of
                    landowners possessed of less than one acre is as high as 703,289, being 72 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 3 per cent of the whole. The great decrease seen in
                    the number of those who possess from one acre to ten, being considerably under
                    one-fifth of the first class, is remarkable; and no less so is it that there are
                    more landowners who possess from 100 to 500 acres than who possess from 50 to
                    100 acres. The total number of landowners in England and Wales is altogether,
                    according to these returns, very far above to what was formerly believed, for in
                    the census returns of 1861 the number of “landed proprietors” was given at
                    30,766, and in those of 1871 at 22,964. But while it is seen that real property
                    is so widely distributed, there appears not the less from the Bluebook of 1876
                    the all-important fact that the proprietors of over 5000 acres, who deserve,
                    more especially, the title of “great” landowners, 874 in number, hold 9,367,031
                    acres, or more than one-fourth of the country. The owners of 1000 acres and
                    upwards, numbering 5408, hold 18,695,528 acres, being more than one-half of the
                    land; and those of 500 acres and upwards, 10,207 in number, hold 22,013,206
                    acres, or two-thirds of the whole of England and Wales.</p>
                <p>Together with the returns of landowners in England there were issued similar ones
                    for Scotland aud Ireland. It is not a little interesting to compare the relative
                    facts given in these various returns, which illustrate to a striking degree the
                    diversity of the ownership of the soil and division of the land in the three
                    portions of the United Kingdom. While in England the proportion of landowners
                    below an acre is72 ’ 3 per cent., it is 85 ’ 5 per cent, in Scotland, and 52 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 in Ireland. Again, of landowners possessing more
                    than one acre, the proportion who have less than 500 acres is 96Ί per cent, in
                    En⅛land, 86 ’ 5 per cent, in Scotland, and 80 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 1
                    per cent, in Ireland. With regard to England, the twelve largest owners hold in
                    the aggregate 1,058,883 acres, while the twelve largest owners in Scotland
                    possess 4,339,722 acres, and the twelve largest owners in Ireland 1,297,888
                    acres. Thus the ownership of the twelve principal landowners of England is not
                    one-fourth that of the twelve chief landowners of Scotland.</p>

                <p>In the returns of the census of 1871, before given, the total area of England was
                    stated at 32,590,397 acres, and that of Wales at 4,734,436 acres. In the
                    Agricultural Returns for the year 1877 it was reported that the total acreage
                    under crops, bare fallow, and grass had come to be 24,312,033 acres in England,

                    onefourth of the total, not accounted for in the Agricultural Returns for
                    England, and 1,643,327 acres, or about one-third of the total, in those for
                    Wales. The subjoined tables exhibit the distribution of the acreage, and the

                <p>It appears from the last annual Agricultural Returns that the extent of arable
                    land in England and Wales is on the decrease, as is also the produce of live
                    stock, while, on the other hand, the area of pasture land is on the increase.
                    The decline in the acreage of arable land, very marked in the five years from
                    1872 to 1877, was greater in Wales than in Eugland, and embraced all the
                    principal crops. The land under wheat fell from 3,336,888 acres in 1872 to
                    2,987,129 in 1877, iu England; and from 126,367 acres in 1872 to 100,226 in
                    1877, in Wales. During the same period, the acreage under potatoes fell in
                    England from 339,056 to 303,964, and in Wales from 48,417 to 42,942; and that
                    under clover in England from 2,822,392 to 2737,387, and in Wales from 370,850 to
                    351,797. In the acreage under barley and oats there was a slight increase in
                    England, but a decrease in Males; while in the acreage under turnips and swedes
                    there was a trifling increase in England and a decrease in "Wales during the
                    period. Taken altogether, the extent of arable land in England fell from
                    13,839,000 acres in 1872 to 13,454,000 acres in 1877, being a decrease of
                    385,000 acres. In· Wales, the extent of arable land sank from 1,104,000 acres to
                    999,000 acres in the same period, the decrease amounting to 105,000 acres. The
                    decrease of arable land during the five years was very steady, and so likewise
                    was the increase in the acreage of pasture land. There were in England under
                    pasture—exclusive of heath and mountain land—9,991,000 acres in 1872, and
                    10,858,000 acres in 1877, the increase in the five years amounting to 867,000
                    acres, being more than double the extent of decrease of arable land. In Wales
                    there were under pasture 1,532,000 acres in 1872, and 1,732,000 acres in 1877,
                    making the increase amount to 200,000 acres, this also being not far from double
                    that of the decrease in arable land. The decrease in the extent of arable land,
                    and simultaneous increase of pastures, may be explained by the fact of England
                    being supplied, more and more, with corn from foreign countries, where it can be
                    grown cheaper than at home. Naturally, the produce of pasture lands cannot be
                    brought in the same way into the country.</p>
                <p>If the decrease of arable land and increase of pastures can be thus explained, it
                    is not so easy to account for the decline of live stock which also took place
                    during the same period, more especially from 1874. It might have been expected
                    that the widening of the pastural area would have led to an increase of live
                    stock, but the contrary was the case, more especially as regards horned cattle
                    and sheep. In England there were 4,305,440 head of cattle in June 1874, and
                    3,979,650 head in June 1877, so that there was a decrease of 325,790 head in
                    three years. During the same period, the number of cattle in "Wales fell from
                    665,105 to 616,209, being a decline of 48,896. The decrease in numbers was even
                    greater in sheep. There were 19,859,758 sheep in England in June 1874, and
                    18,330,377 in June 1877, being a decrease of 1,529,381. In Wales, during the
                    same period, the number of sheep fell from 3,064,696 to 2,862,013, being a
                    decrease of 202,683. Thus the total decline in the number of sheep in England
                    and "Wales was no less than 1,732,064 in the short space of three years. The
                    great diminution of live stock during the triennial period from 1874 to 1877 was
                    not confined to England and Wales, but occurred simultaneously in Scotland, as
                    well as in Ireland, being greatest in the latter country, where the decline in
                    sheep alone amounted to 10∣ per cent.</p>
                <p>In the census returns of 1871, the number of persons entered as “agriculturists”
                    in England and "Wales was 1,447,481, comprising 1,264,031 men and 183,450 women.
                    At the preceding census (1861) the number of “agriculturists” was given at
                    1,833,652, showing a diminution of 386,171 within the decennial period, due
                    probably to the augmented use of machinery for the cultivation of the soil.</p>

                    riches appear in the visits of men from the Mediterranean, who braved the
                    dangers of unknown seas to gather the tin of Cornwall. Cornish tin stiff holds
                    the first place in the annual reports on the “Mineral Statistics of the United
                    Kingdom” drawn up by the keeper of mining records; but, though by no means an
                    unprolific source of riches, it has sunk far behind a number of other minerals,
                    unknown, even in name, at the time the Phoenicians visited, in search of it, the
                    island of Britain. In the last of those animal reports the mineral produce of
                    Great Britain is summarized as follows, in regard to quantities and value, under
                    nineteen headings, or classes, representing the produce of the year 1876 :—</p>

                <p>It will be seen by a glance at the preceding tables that the mineral wealth of
                    the Uuited Kingdom lies, in substance, in two articles, namely, coal and iron
                    ore. From these springs, as immediate produce, a third, namely, pig iron. Coal
                    and iron ore together form, as regards value, over nine-tenths of the mineral
                    produce; while pig iron by itself holds nearly the same position in value among
                    the metals produced in the United Kingdom.</p>

                    Kingdom in the year 1876, England and Wales contributed 114,554,278 tons, being
                    five-sixths of the whole. The remainder, 18,790,488 tons, was produced almost
                    entirely in Scotland, —the mines of East Scotland furnishing 11,667,648 tons,
                    and those of West Scotland 6,997,904 tons. The production of coal in Ireland in
                    1876 was not more than 124,936 tons.</p>
                <p>England and Wales are officially divided into nineteen colliery districts, very
                    unequal in size, but so arranged, geographically, as to be within the constant
                    and regular inspection of the Government survey. The following table gives a
                    list of these districts, with the number of collieries in each, and the
                    quantities of coal taken from them in the year 1876.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Seeing the supreme importance of coal as the chief material agent of modern
                    civilization, and one the value of which, instead of lessening, is likely to
                    become infinitely greater in future years, with the expansion of science and
                    arts, the question has frequently been discussed whether the British coal-fields
                    may not become exhausted at some time or other. The subject more especially
                    engaged the attention of parliament and the Government in 1866, through the
                    publication of a work by Professor W. Stanley Jevons, of Manchester, entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">The Coal Question,</hi> which, while admitting the immensity
                    of England’s wealth in coal, asserted that the present ever-increasing rate of
                    supply could not continue in the same proportion for any great length of time.
                    This theory found much opposition, others maintaining that the coal deposits of
                    Great Britain were virtually inexhaustible, and that, properly managed, and with
                    constantly improved scientific appliances, their riches would last as long, if
                    not longer, than the probable life of the nation.</p>
                <p>The discussion in and out of parliament on “the exhaustion of our coal mines,”
                    important as it was, scarcely settled the main points of the question, namely,
                    first, to what depth the coal mines of Great Britain can ⅛e practically worked,
                    and, secondly, to what extent the use of coal may be limited in the future, by
                    the discovery of other motive powers. As to the first point, Mr Edward Huff, a
                    well-known authority on mining subjects, laid it down, after practical
                    inquiries, that the limit of coal-mining was not reached till the depth of 4000
                    feet; but this again <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n238/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0238-0227"/> was disputed by other investigators, who
                    expressed confi dence that the limit was 2500 feet, a depth already reached in
                    some existing mines. Greater still must be the uncertainty regarding the
                    possible or probable discovery of other sources of motive power as substitutes
                    for coal. The opponents of the widely expressed theory that such discoveries
                    were not only possible, but of the very nature of scientific progress, which
                    having, quite recently, taught mankind the high value of coal, was not likely to
                    stop here, found powerful support in Professor Tyndall, who insisted that coal
                    was the absolute monarch, present and future. “I see no prospect,”he wrote to
                    Professor Jevons, “of any substitute being found for coal as a motive power. We
                    have, it is true, our winds and streams and tides; and we have the beams of the
                    sun. But these are common to all the world. We cannot make head against a nation
                    which, in addition to these sources of power, possesses the power of coal.”
                    Professor Tyndall concludes with the somewhat startling dictum that “the destiny
                    ot this nation is not in the hands of its statesmen, but of its coal-owners,”
                    adding, emphatically, that, “while the orators of St Stephen’s are unconscious
                    of the fact, the life blood of this country is flowing away.”</p>
                <p>Professor Tyndall wrote this letter in 1866; and if, as he and others thought,
                    the “life-blood of this country ’’ was then flowing at too high a rate, it has
                    been flowing much faster ever since. In the ten years from 1856 to 1866, the
                    production of the coal mines of the United Kingdom rose from 66,645,450 tons to
                    101,630,544, and after another lapse of ten years, in 1876 it had risen to
                    133,344,766 tons. The gradual rise in production is indicated in the subjoined
                    table, which shows the quantities and the value of the coal brought from the
                    mines of the United Kingdom every third year from 1855, when the first accurate
                    returns were published, to 1876 :—</p>

                <p>It is an admitted fact that the price of coal, which has been gradually rising in
                    recent years, must continue to rise, both on account of its increased
                    consumption, and of the constantly growing expenses of raising it. Although the
                    total area of the coal-fields of Great Britain extends, according to the most
                    authentic estimates, over 5400 square miles, comparatively few new pits
                    have-been opened in recent years; and the ever-increasing demand has been
                    supplied by the deepening, as well as widening, of the best collieries. This
                    could only be achieved at an increased outlay, inasmuch as the cost of raising
                    coal to the surface and the attendant expenses of administration and supervision
                    are far greater than the cost of the actual displacement of the material from
                    its beds.</p>
                <p>From the returns of one of the oldest and best-managed collieries in England, the
                    South Hetton, in Durham, it appears that out of 529 men employed, only 140 were
                    hewers of coal. The account, interesting in various ways, stands as follows

                <p>The extraordinarily large number of persons required in a colliery, over and
                    above the actual producers of coal, to attend to the working of the
                    establishment, is explained by the mine and its machinery requiring the most
                    strict and unceasing supervision to prevent dangerous accidents. Thus a large
                    staff of workmen and artisans of all kinds, such as smiths, joiners,
                    engine-wrights, masons, and others, has to be kept, to watch over the
                    complicated apparatus by which the mine is ventilated and the precious mineral
                    raised from the bowels of the earth. It may be said that, as a rule, the working
                    of the collieries of England and Wales is most satisfactory, the
                    superintendence, both on the part of the private owners and the Government,
                    being the best that human ingenuity can devise. Nevertheless, the annual Joss of
                    life is terribly large In the ten years from 1857 to 1866, the number of deaths
                    from colliery accidents averaged 1000 per annum, and though in the next ten
                    years the death rate decreased, it never fell under 800 a year.</p>
                <p>The production of coal in the United Kingdom was more than doubled in the period
                    from 1855 to 1876, but the exports to foreign countries during the same time
                    increased nearly eight fold. From 4,976,902 tons in 1855 the exports rose to
                    9,170,477 tons iu 1865, and to 11,702,649 tons in 1870. They further rose to
                    13,198,494 tons in 1872, to 13,927,205 tons in 1874, to 14,544,916 tons in 1875,
                    and to 16,299,077 tons in 1876, Of the total exports of the year 1876, France
                    took 3,160,555 tons, Germany 2,243,722 tons, and Italy, Russia, and Sweden and
                    Norway each a little over a million tons, the remainder being distributed over
                    thirty other foreign countries and British colonies. Vast as has been the amount
                    of the coal exports in recent years, they still represent less than one-eighth
                    of the coal produce of the country. The mines of the district of South Durham
                    alone produced in 1876 considerably more coal than was exported to all foreign
                    countries.</p>

                    wealth, to coal, and deriving nearly all its value from it, still the second
                    most important produce of English mines, the iron ore, has the greatest effect
                    upon the industrial character of the country. England and Wales alone produce
                    iron ore, the amount raised in Scotland and Ireland being quite insignificant.
                    It amounted in Scotland to 5226 tons, valued at £3432, and in Ireland to 116,066
                    tons, valued at £60,748, in 1876. The whole of the rest of the produce of the
                    United Kingdom, 16,720,291 tons, valued at £6,761,525, was raised in England and

                <p>Iron ore lies widely distributed all over England and Wales, and though at
                    present mainly raised in the northern and western counties, and all the
                    districts which contain coal, the union with which alone gives it industrial
                    value, the geological strata containing it are equally to be found in the south
                    and elsewhere. The earliest use of the iron ore in England, before the important
                    discovery of the manufacture of pig iron by coal was known, was almost
                    exclusively in the southern counties, more particularly in Sussex. “I have
                    heard,” says John Norden, the topographer, in his <hi rend="italic">Survey of
                    Middlesex,</hi> published in the latter part of the 17th century, “that there
                    are, or recently were, in Sussex neere 140 hammers and furnaces for iron.”
                    William Camden, writing about the same time, adds that Sussex “is full of iron
                    mines in sundry places, where, for the making and founding thereof, there be
                    furnaces on every side, and a huge deal of wood is yearly burnt.” Other writers
                    refer to the burning of “cole,” that is, charcoal, in the iron manufacture of
                    the south of England.</p>
                <p>The old iron manufacture came to an end towards the middle of the 18th century,
                    with the destruction of the once plentiful woods and forests of England.
                    However, the production of iron in the country was still estimated in 1740 at
                    17,350 tons, made in 59 “hammersand furnaces,”being less than half the number
                    mentioned by John Norden as existing in Sussex. Within the next few years the
                    trade sank still lower, and was on the point of being extinguished, wheu at last
                    the efforts of a number of enterprising men to make use of “pit coal” for making
                    iron were crowned with success. Like most discoveries, this great one, destined
                    to give a new course to the industrial and commercial history of England, was
                    not the work of one man, but resulted from the labours of many; still an
                    important share of it fell to the Darbys, father and son, the first of whom
                    established, in 1709, with the help of skilled Dutch workmen, the celebrated
                    Colebrookdale ironworks, in Shropshire. The father did not reap the benefits of
                    his great enterprise, but the son was fully rewarded. He sat “watching the
                    filling of his furnace for six days and nights uninterruptedly, and was falling
                    into a deep sleep, when he saw the molten iron running forth.” In December 1756,
                    the Colebrookdale iron works were “at the top pinnacle of prosperity, making
                    twenty or twenty-two tons per week, and sold off as fast as made, at profit
                    enough.”</p>
                <p>At the date here given, the total production of pig iron in England was probably
                    about 225,000 tons a year, but from that time it rose with extraordinary
                    rapidity. It is estimated that 68,300 tons were produced in the United Kingdom
                    in 1788, which amount had increased to 125,079 tons in 1796, and to 258,206 tons
                    in 1806, a doubling in ten years. The production had again doubled in 1825, when
                    it was 581,000 tons; and once more in 1839, in which year it had risen to
                    1,240,000 tons. In 1848, the total amount of pig iron produced was estimated to
                    be over two millions of tons; and in 1854, the first year for which trustworthy
                    statistics were gathered by the mining record office, the production surpassed
                    three millions.</p>

                    United Kingdom in every third year from 1855 to 1876 :—</p>

                    total number of existing furnaces in England and Wales was 771, so that more
                    than 200 were standing idle. The total number of existing furnaces in England
                    was 626, and in Wales 145, showing that the depression of trade was greatest in
                    Wales, exactly one-half of the furnaces standing idle. The total number of
                    active ironworks amounted to 159 in England, and 24 in Wales, at the end of
                    1876.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lead.—</hi> In comparison with coal and iron, all the other
                    mineral products of the country are of small importance. Of these minor
                    products, the highest on the list, as to value, is lead ore, raised in the
                    United Kingdom to the value of £1,218,078 in 1876, and producing lead valued at
                    £1,270,415. The quantities of lead ore raised in the year amounted to 79,096

                    were raised in England and Wales, producing 54,363 tons of lead. More than
                    one-half of the lead ore and lead produced in England came from the counties of
                    Durham and Northumberland, while two-thirds of the produce of Wales came from
                    Montgomeryshire and Cardiganshire. There were al together 392 lead mines in the
                    United Kingdom in 1876, and of this number 387 were in England and Wales. The
                    mines were very unequal in extent and produce. Derbyshire contained 140 lead
                    mines, producing 2441 tons of ore and 2149 tons of metal; while Durham and
                    Northumberland produced 23,285 tons of ore and 16,730 tons of metal in 28
                    mines.</p>
                <p>The produce of the lead mines, after remaining stationary for many years,
                    declined considerably from 1870 to 1876. In the fifteen years from 1854 to 1868
                    the average annual produce in the United Kingdom amounted to about 68,000 tons,
                    valued at £1,400,000. The culminating point of production was reached in the
                    year 1870, with 73,420 tons, valued at £1,452,715, after which there was a
                    steady falling off, down to the amount of 1876. The decrease in the home produce
                    of lead was accompanied by an increase in the imports of the metal, which
                    amounted to 61,987 tons, valued at £1,411,988, in 1874, and rose to 79,825 tons,
                    valued at £1,801,962, in 1875, and to 80,649 tons, valued at £1,749,978, in
                    1876. It will be seen that the imports of lead are considerably larger than the
                    home production.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tin.—</hi> Next to lead in value, among the minor ores and
                    metals, stands tin. In 1876 there were raised 13,688 tons of tin ore, producing
                    8500 tons of metallic tin, valued at £675,750. Tin ore is found nowhere but in
                    Cornwall and Devonshire, the famous mines of Cornwall, which attracted
                    foreigners thousands of years ago, producing the greater part. At the end of
                    1876 there were returned as existing in England 135 tin mines, of which number
                    104 were in Cornwall and 16 in Devonshire, the remainder consisting not of
                    “mines,” in the ordinary sense, but, more strictly, of “finding places,”
                    situated on rivers and near the shore. The number and produce of tin mines have
                    suffered a great decrease in recent years. Tn 1872 there were raised 14,266 tons
                    of ore, producing 9560 tons of metal, valued at £1,459,990; in 1873, only
                    1,056,835 tons were raised, producing 9972 tons of metal, valued at £1,329.766,
                    and in 1874 but 788,310 tons of ore, producing 9,912 tons of metal, valued at
                    £1,077,712. The year 1875 showed a further falling off to 735,606 tons of ore,
                    with 9611 tons of metal, valued at £866,266, upon which followed the first
                    mentioned still lower production of the year 1876. During the same period, the
                    imports of tin, in blocks and ingots, from foreign countries gradually
                    increased. They amounted to 166,840 cwts.. valued at £ 1,154,578, in 1872, and
                    rose to 304,551 cwts., valued at £1,148,542, in 1876. It will be seen that while
                    the total quantity of tin imported within the quinquennial period underwent a
                    considerable increase, the total value not only did not augment, but actually
                    decreased. The decline in price v <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> as probably one
                    of the main causes of the decline in production of tin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Copper.—</hi> Next to tin in value, among the minor ores and
                    metals, stands copper. The total product of copper ore raised in the United
                    Kingdom in 1876 was 79,252 tons, of which 71,756 tons were the produce of
                    England and Wales, while 680 tons came from Scotland, and 6816 tons from
                    Ireland. The total amount of the metal produced from the ores was 4694 tons,
                    valued at £392,300, of which 4222 tons were made in England and Wales, 33 in
                    Scotland, and 449 in Ireland. There were at the end of 1876 copper mines to the
                    number of 101 in the United Kingdom,—England and Wales possessing 93, Scotland
                    1, and Ireland 7. Only the copper mines of England, and more particularly those
                    of Cornwall and Devonshire, are of any importance. At the end of 1876 there was
                    one copper mine in each of the counties of Cumberland, Cheshire, and Lancashire,
                    15 in Devonshire, and 65 in Cornwall, the latter producing 43,016 tons of ore
                    and 3034 tons of metal. Even more than lead and tin, the production of copper
                    has been greatly declining in recent years, In 1855 the total produce of copper
                    was as high as 21,294 tons, valued at £3,042,877; which amount had fallen to
                    15,968 tons, valued at £1,706,261, in 1860. In 1865 the quantity had fallen to
                    11,888 tons, valued at £1.131,664; and in 1870 it had further declined to 7175
                    tons, valued at £551,309. Thus the decline continued, with slight fluctuations,
                    till the production had reached the small amount of 1876. As with lead and tin,
                    the copper imports grew largely while the production declined.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Zinc.—</hi> The remaining metallic ores—zinc, silver, and
                    gold—are but of trifling value. Zinc is found in five counties of England and
                    seven of Wales, which together possess 53 mines. There are 3 more mines in the
                    Isle of Man, and 1 in Scotland. In 1876, the total of zinc ore raised was 23,613
                    tons, producing 6641 tons of zinc, valued £158,011. The production of zinc
                    trebled in quantity and value in the sixteen years from 1852 to 1876. It
                    amounted only to 2151 tons, valued at £50,548, in 1862, and in 1872 had risen to
                    5191 tons, valued at £118,076. The increase in production did not prevent a
                    simultaneous increase in im ports, which more than doubled in the decennial
                    period from 1.866 to 1876, amounting in the latter year to 29,327 tons, valued
                    at £662,190, being more than four times the amount of the home produce.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Silver and Gold.—</hi> Silver and gold, the so-called
                    “precious” metals—though iron is infinitely more valuable under every point of
                    view—form but imperceptible additions to the mineral wealth of the country. Of
                    silver, always found in combination with lead ores, 483,422 ounces, valued at
                    .£106,222, were raised in the year 1876 in the United Kingdom, and of gold, 293
                    ounces, valued at £1138. There were, according to the returns of the mining
                    record office, two “gold mines” in the United Kingdom, the one in
                    Merionethshire, and the other in the county of Wicklow, Ireland. The former,
                    situated at Clogan, produced 288 ounces, valued at £1119, in 1876. As for the
                    Irish “gold mine,'·' its yield was just 4 ounces, worth £18. The returns do not
                    state the sum expended in raising the 4 ounces of Irish gold.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">SαU and Clays.—</hi> The sum total of England’s mineral riches
                    is completed by a variety of miscellaneous substances raised from the earth,
                    such as salt, clays—including porcelain, potter’s clay, and fire
                    clay—coprolites, oil shales, barytes, and gypsum. None of these are of much
                    importance except salt and clays. The centre of the salt production is in
                    Cheshire, at North wich, Middlewich, Winsford, and other places; but there are
                    also salt mines in Staffordshire and Worcestershire. In 1876 the total quantity
                    of salt raised amounted to 2,273,256 tons, valued at £1,136,628, of which
                    854,538 tons, valued at £529,547, were exported to foreign countries, chiefly to
                    the United States and British India. Of clays of all kinds, the total produce in
                    1876 was 3,971,123 tons, valued at £744,224. The finest of the clays, known as
                    kaolin, or porcelain clay, is the produce of Cornwall and Devonshire, the former
                    county raising 105,275 tons, and the latter 25,000 tons, in 1876. Of importance
                    next to it, as potter’s material, is the “Poole clay” of Dorsetshire, of which
                    72,105 tons were produced in 1876. Raised in much larger quantities than both
                    the kaolin and the “Poole” are the fire clays, the production of which in the
                    year 1876 amounted to 1,514,902 tons. The fire-clays are found chiefly in the
                    north and west of England and in South Wales. There were 171 fire-clay pits at

                    persons distinguished as “miners,” the number comprising 371,105 males and 5678
                    females. At the preceding census of 1861 there were 330,446 persons enumerated
                    as “miners,” of whom 330,352 were males and only 94 females. Thus there was a
                    total increase of 46,337 persons so designated, comprising 40,753 males and 5584
                    females, in the ten years from 1861 to 1871. There were besides enumerated as
                    “workers in stone and clay,” 152,673 at the census of 1871, comprising 149,567
                    males and 3106 females. At the census of 1861 the total number of persons so

                <p>There were two agencies, one moral and the other material, that gained for
                    England its comparatively modern superiority in manufactures. Long after textile
                    and other industries had been flourishing in the leading states of the
                    Continent,— the Netherlands, Flanders, and France,—England remained a purely
                    agricultural and pastoral country, content to export her riches in wool, and to
                    import them again, greatly enhanced in value, as clothing. Thus it remained till
                    religious persecution drove the flower of the industrial population of the West
                    of Europe away from the homes of their birth; and, happy to find an asylum here,
                    they liberally repaid English hospitality by establishing their own arts in the
                    country, and teaching them to the inhabitants. Thus religious liberty formed the
                    noble foundation of England’s industrial greatness. Then came the material
                    agent, machinery propelled by steam. The invention of the steam engine,
                    following quickly upon that of the carding machine, the spinning jenny, and
                    other ingenious machinery employed in textile manufactures, gave an
                    extraordinary impulse to their development, and, with them, that of kindred
                    branches of industry. At the basis of all of them was England’s wealth in
                    coal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cotton Manufacture.—</hi> That England, not possessing the raw
                    material, became the seat of the cotton manufacture, was owing, in the first
                    instance, to the ingenuity of her inventors of machinery. Established as early
                    as the beginning of the 17th century at Manchester, the cotton manufacture made
                    no progress for a long time, and generation after generation clothed themselves
                    in cotton goods spun by Dutch and German weavers. It was not till the latter
                    part of the 18th century, when a series of inventions, unparalleled in the
                    annals of industry, followed each other in quick succession, that the cotton
                    manufacture took real root in the country, gradually eclipsing that of other
                    European nations. But though the superior excellence of their machinery enabled
                    Englishmen to start in the race of competition, it was the discovery of the new
                    motive power, drawn from coal, which made them win the race. In 1815 the total
                    quantity of raw cotton imported into the United Kingdom was not more thau 99
                    millions of pounds, which amount had increased to 152 millions of pounds in
                    1820, and rose further to 229 millions in 1825, so that there was considerably
                    more than a doubling of the imports in ten years. In 1830 the imports of raw
                    cotton had further risen to 264 millions of pounds, in 1835 to 364 millions, and
                    in 1840 to 592 millions of pounds.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the progress, with fluctuations, of the cotton trade,
                    in the annual imports, the exports, and the excess of imports of raw cotton
                    during each, for every fifth year from 1841 to 1876 :—</p>

                <p>There were 2655 cotton factories in the United Kingdom at the end of 1874. They
                    had 41,881,789 spindles and 463,118 powerdooms, and gave employment to 479,515
                    persons, of whom 187,620 were males and 291,895 females. The following statement
                    gives the number of cotton factories in England—there are none in Wales—
                    distinguishing those devoted to spinning and to weaving, and the total—including

                <p>It will be seen that Lancashire absorbs more than three-fourths of the
                    manufacture of cotton fabrics in England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Woollen and Worsted.</hi> —Second only to the cotton trade as a
                    national industry is the manufacture of woollen and worsted textile fabrics.
                    There were in 1874 in the United Kingdom 1800 woollen and 692 worsted factories.
                    In the woollen factories there were in use 3,323,881 spindles and 57,090
                    power-looms, and they employed 134,605 persons; while in the worsted factories
                    there were in use 2,382,450 spindles and 81,747 power looms, and they employed
                    142,097 persons. Unlike cotton, the raw material for woollen fabrics is mainly
                    produced at home; still for many years past the native supply has been
                    insufficient, which necessitated imports from foreign countries and British
                    colonies, ever increasing in amount. During 1840-1876 the imports of wool rose
                    from 49 to 390 millions of pounds.</p>

                <p>The number of persons employed in the woollen factories of England and Wales in
                    1874 comprised 54,119 males and 51,252 females. Of the males, 4391 were under
                    thirteen years of age, 10,726 from thirteen to eighteen years of age, and 93,002
                    above eighteen. Of the females, 2841 were under thirteen, and 48,411 over
                    thirteen years of age. In the worsted factories, the persons employed in 1874
                    comprised 53,995 males and 77,835 females. Of the males, 14,074 were under
                    thirteen, 10,694 were from thirteen to eighteen, and 29,227 above eighteen years
                    of age. Of the females, 15,394 were under thirteen, and 62,441 over thirteen
                    years of age. It will be seen that the number of children, of both sexes, is far

                    manufacture is in Yorkshire, while Lancashire stands second, but a long way
                    behind. In the western and some of the midland counties where the trade is

                    trade, which is now all but extinct in Norwich, the most ancient manufacturing
                    town in the kingdom, where a colony of Flemings settled in the reign of Henry

                    which the new produce was named. The once famous market-town itself has sunk to
                    an obscure village.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sillc.—</hi> Compared with the manufacture of goods made from
                    cotton and wool, that of other textile fabrics is comparatively unimportant, the
                    main articles being silk, flax, and hemp. As far as the United Kingdom is
                    concerned, the manufacture of flax stands first among these minor textile
                    fabrics; but taking England alone, the chief of them is silk. There were in 1874
                    in the United Kingdom 818 silk factories, with 1,336,411 spindles and 10,002
                    powerlooms, employing 45,559'persons. Of this total, only 4 factories, with 226
                    power looms, employing 740 persons, were in Scotland; and but 2 factories, with
                    7 power-looms, employing 400 persons, were in Ireland.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the number of silk factories in England, with the
                    number of spindles and powerdooms in use, and the number of persons employed, at
                    various periods from 1850 to 1874:—</p>

                <p>The number of persons employed in the silk factories of England in 1874 comprised
                    12,772 males and 31,647 females. Of the males, 2324 were under thirteen, 2375
                    from thirteen to eighteen, and 8073 over eighteen years of age. Of the females,
                    4521 were under thirteen. The employment of children of both sexes in silk
                    factories was on the decrease from 1850 to 1874, while during the same period it
                    was largely on the increase in cotton factories, and also, but to a smaller

                <p>It will be seen from the above table that the silk manufacture is more dispersed
                    over England than either that of cotton or woollen fabrics. The tendency to use
                    machinery appears most pronounced in Lancashire and the three eastern counties,
                    in both of which disticts the number of power-looms is nearly half as large as
                    that of hands employed; while in other counties the number of power looms is
                    very small in proportion to that of workers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Linen.—</hi> Next to silk in importance, as one of the minor
                    textile manufactures of England, stands flax. At the end of 1874, there were in
                    the whole of the United Kingdom 449 factories for spinning flax, using 1,473,800
                    spindles and 41,980 power looms, and employing 128,459 hands. In the returns for
                    1874, Scotland took the first rank as regards the number of flax factories,
                    Ireland the second, and England the third rank. There were in Scotland at that
                    date 159 factories, with 275,119 spindles and 18,529 power-looms, employing
                    45,816 persons; and in Ireland 149 factories, with 906,946 spindles and 17,827
                    powerlooms, employing 60,316 hands.</p>

                    with the number of spindles and of power-looms in use, and the number of persons

                <p>The number of persons employed in the flax-spinning factories of England in 1874
                    comprised 6856 males and 15,471 females. Of the males, 844 were boys under
                    thirteen, 1380 lads from thirteen to eighteen, and 4632 men over eighteen years
                    of age. Of the females, 1245 were children under thirteen, and 14,226 women over
                    thirteen years of age. There was a slight increase in the proportion of children
                    of both sexes employed in the flax factories of England in the period from 1850
                    to 1874. In the Scottish flax factories, during the same time, the increase of
                    children, notably females, was very great. There were only 218 girls under
                    thirteen employed in all the flax-spinning factories of Scotland in 1850, and
                    the number had risen to 1956 in 1874.</p>

                <p>The chief seat of the flax manufacture, it will be seen, is in Yorkshire. It is a
                    new branch of industry in Leicestershire and the adjoining midland counties,
                    where it did not exist previous to 1870.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hemp and Jute.—</hi> Among the minor textile manufactures, hemp
                    and jute come next to flax. The hemp manufacture is of comparatively recent
                    date. There were but five hemp factories in the United Kingdom in 1861, but they
                    had increased to 61 in 1874. Of these 45 were in England, 12 in Scotland, and 4
                    in Ireland. The English hemp factories, situated mainly in Lancashire and the
                    northern counties, had in use 6448 spindles and 22 power-looms in 1874, and gave
                    employment to 3039 persons, of whom 1574, or about one-half, were women. Of jute
                    factories, there were in the United Kingdom 110 in 1874, England having 15,
                    Scotland 84, and Ireland 11. The English jute factories, distributed over the
                    northern and midland counties, had iu use 21,754 spindles and 927 power-looms in
                    1874, and employed 4933 persons, of whom 3423, or nearly three-fourths, were
                    women. In 1861 the whole of the jute factories of England employed only 107
                    persons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hosiery, Lace, and Shoddy.—</hi> There are enumerated in
                    parliamentary papers, and various official returns, a number of other existing
                    factories, among them of hosiery, lace, “shoddy,” hair, felt, and elastic
                    fabrics. The hosiery factories of the United Kingdom employed 11,980, and the
                    lace factories 10,373 persons in 1874; but all the others gave employment, in
                    the aggregate, to less than 9000 workers. The hosiery factories were all in
                    England, with the exception of 4 in Scotland, employing 1006 persons. In the
                    English hosiery factories, 65 in number, nearly all in Leicestershire and
                    adjoining midland counties, there were 10,914 persons employed in 1874, about
                    one-half of them women. The hosiery factories of England more than doubled from
                    1861, when their number was 65, to 1874. The same was the case with the lace
                    factories, which increased from 186 in 1868 to 311 in 1874. Another notable
                    textile industry enumerated in the official returns is that of “shoddy
                    factories.” There were of these establishments, 125 in the. United Kingdom in
                    1874, all of them in England, with the exception of some very small Scottish
                    ones, returned as employing together 7 persons. The English shoddy factories,
                    dispersed in 1874 over Yorkshire and Lancashire, with but a few in other
                    counties, had in use in that year 101,134 spindles and 1437 powerlooms, and
                    employed 3424 persons, more than one-half of them women. There was an increase
                    in the shoddy factories of Lancashire from 1868 to 1874, but a decrease during
                    the same period in those of Yorkshire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Factory Supervision.—</hi> To protect the health of the people
                    employed in English manufacturing industries, and to preserve them from
                    accidents of all kinds, parliament passed in recent years a numberof laws, known
                    generally as the Factory Acts. In these Acts, the hours of labour are
                    restricted, more especially for young persons and women, who cannot be set to
                    work formore than 12 hours on any day, and not for more than 60 hours per week.
                    The due execution of the Factory Acts is superintended by inspectors of
                    factories, appointed by the Government, who have to make to the home secretary
                    half-yearly reports, which are printed and laid before parliament. In a recent
                    report it is stated that the laws passed are constantly more appreciated both by
                    employers of labour and by the workers, but that the latter are subjected to
                    much suffering through stagnation of trade. The latter is ascribed mainly to
                    foreign competition. While there is doubtless truth in this view, there can be
                    equally little doubt that other causes have affected, and continue to affect,
                    English manufacturing industry.</p>

                    felt, in recent years, in the chief manufactures, operated also upon the

                    the number of fishing boats, as will be seen from the subjoined table, which
                    gives tne number of boats of which the tonnage was known, for each division of

                <p>It will be seen that there was an increase, during the three years, in the total
                    tonnage of the English, but a decrease in that of the Scottish and Irish fishing
                    boats, as well as in that of the Channel Islands.</p>
                <p>The fishing boats of the United Kingdom are divided by the Board of Trade into
                    three classes,—the first class comprising all boats over 15 tons; the second all
                    boats under 15 tons, propelled otherwise than by oars; and the third class all
                    boats navigated only by oars. The number of the first class in England and Wales
                    at the end of 1874 was 2934, with a tonnage of 110,500, and in Scotland 2407,
                    with a tonnage of 40,629. Of fishing boats of the second class there were at the
                    same date 8313, with a tonnage of 35,670, in England, and 9815, with a tonnage
                    of 48,124, in Scotland. Of boats of the third class, there were in England 2879,
                    with a tonnage of 4098, and in Scotland 1249, with a tonnage of 2366. Thus
                    England had the superiority in vessels of the first and third, but not in those
                    of the second class. The fisheries of England are devoted mainly to the netting
                    of mackerel, pilchards, and similar fish, and those of Scotland to cod, ling,
                    and herrings.</p>
                <p>The imports of fish from foreign countries have in recent years been on the
                    increase, and the exports on the decrease. The total value of the imports of
                    fish in 1872 was .£859,042, and in 1876 it amounted to £1,459,974. The total
                    exports of fish were of the value of £1,183,801 in 1872, and of £624,726 in
                    1876. The exports are chiefly in herrings, of which 631,750 barrels were shipped
                    to foreign countries in 1872, and 426,588 barrels in 1876. (See also <hi

                <p>British commerce received an enormous development, unparalleled in the history of
                    any nation, during the half a century from 1826 to 1876. In the year 1826 the
                    aggregate value of the imports into and exports from the United Kingdom amounted
                    to no more than £88,758,678; while the total rose to £110,559,538 in 1836, and
                    to £205,625,831 in 1846. In 1856 the aggregate of imports and exports had risen
                    to £311,764,507, in 1866 to £534,195,956, and in 1876 to £631,931,305. Thus the
                    commercial transactions of the United Kingdom—those of England, by itself, <pb

                <p>The following two tables exhibit the values of the annual imports, of the total
                    annual exports of British home produce, and of the total imports and exports of

                    produce—as well as the proportions per head of population, for every third year

                <p>It will be seen from the preceding tables that the bulk of the commercial
                    transactions of the United Kingdom, both as regards imports and exports, is with
                    but a few states —mainly three British colonies and eight or nine foreign
                    countries. In the same manner, the great mass of imports, as well as of exports
                    of British produce centres, in each case, in about half a dozen principal
                    articles. More than one-half of the total imports into the United Kingdom are
                    made up of the six articles enumerated in the following table, one-half of which
                    represent food for the nation, and the other half raw material for its
                    manufactures. The table shows the value of each of these six articles imported
                    into the United Kingdom during the years 1875 and 1876</p>

                <p>The most important fact in connection with the foreign commerce of the United
                    Kingdom in recent years, is that there has been a gradual and steady increase of
                    imports, together with a decrease of exports of home produce. The movement began
                    in 1872. Up to that time, the exports of British home produce had kept on
                    increasing with the imports, although at a lesser rate, and far inferior in
                    aggregate value; but a change took place in the latter year. While the imports
                    continued their upward course, gradually rising from £354,693,624 in 1872 to
                    £375,154,703 in 1876, the exports of British produce fell from £256,257,347 in
                    1872 to £200,639,204 in 1876. The decline in exports, regular and steady
                    throughout the period, and with a tendency to become more pronounced every year,
                    affected all the principal articles of British home produce just enumerated. The
                    value of the cotton manufactures exported sank from £80,164,155 in 1872 to
                    £67,641,268 in 1876; woollen fabrics from £38,493,411 to £23,020,719; iron and
                    steel from £35,996,167 to £20,737,410; coals from £10,442,321 to £8,904,463;
                    machinery from £8,201,112 to £7,210,426; and linen manufactures from £10,956,761
                    to £7,070,149. The decline during the four years, it will be seen, was greatest
                    of all in textile manufactures, and least in coals and machinery.</p>

                    from each of the three great divisions of the United Kingdom may be judged by

                    approximately ascertained—making due allowance for great centres of
                    commerce—from the custom-house returns. The receipts of the customs were as

                <p>More than one-half of the total customs receipts of the United Kingdom, and
                    nearly two-thirds of those of England and Wales, are collected in London; while
                    the amount collected at Liverpool is not very far from the total receipts of
                    Scotland and Ireland. Besides London and Liverpool, there are but eight towns of
                    England and Wales, out of eighty-seven which have customhouse establishments,
                    where the collection amounts to £100,000 and more per annum. The following is a
                    list of these eight ports, together with London and Liverpool, giving the sums
                    collected by the customs in each of them, in the years 1875 and 1876 :—</p>

                <p>It appears from the returns of the last thirty years that the commerce of the
                    country has a constantly growing tendency towards concentration, and that while
                    the customs receipts of the smaller ports are gradually decreasing, there is
                    corresponding increase in those of the two chief ports, London and Liverpool,
                    which are gradually becoming the all-absorbing centres of England’s
                    international trade and navigation.</p>

                </table>
                <p>During the period 1864-76 the number and tonnage of sailing vessels registered as
                    belonging to the United Kingdom decreased, but the steamers increased from 2490
                    to 4335, and the table shows that their tonnage nearly quadrupled. The latter
                    fact indicates a doubling of the average tonnage of steamships, the wants of
                    commerce requiring them to be more and more large. Nearly three-fourths of the
                    total shipping of the United Kingdom belongs to England and Wales,</p>
                <p>The total tonnage of the United Kingdom, far larger than that of any other
                    country, represents by itself more than one-third of the shipping of all the
                    maritime states of the world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ship-building</hi> has long been an industry of great
                    importance in England, although of late years it has suffered considerable
                    fluctuations. The principal centres of the industry are the Thames, the Tees,
                    the Tyne, and Sunderland on the east coast, and Liverpool, Barrow, and
                    Whitehaven on the west. A very large proportion of vessels built in recent years
                    are constructed of iron, with the consequence that the ship-building trade has
                    mostly settled in those parts of the coast that are nearest to the iron and coal
                    fields.</p>
                <p>In 1874 the total amount of shipping built in England reached 277,984 tons; in
                    1875, 220,036 tons; and in 1876, 189,840 tons. In Scotland there were built
                    166,214 tons, and in Ireland 4311 tons in 1876. The numbers do not include ships
                    built on foreign account.</p>
                <p>VII. <hi rend="italic">Railways.—Canals and Roads.</hi></p>
                <p>Far greater even than the impulse given to the country’s foreign commerce by
                    steam navigation has been the vast progress of internal communication effected
                    by railways. The first ordinary roads deserving the name of highways were made
                    in 1660, and canal-building began in the middle of the following century; but
                    though roads and canals aided materially in raising the commercial and
                    industrial activity of the nation, their fostering agency was very slight
                    compared with that of railways. In the half century during which England has
                    built railways, its material progress has been vastly greater than that of the
                    whole five previous centuries,</p>
                <p>The first line of railway on which carriages were propelled by steam engines,
                    that from Stockton to Darlington, fourteen miles in length, was opened September
                    27, 1825. Although this little line, pioneer not only of England’s, but the
                    world’s railways, proved a great success, it had no immediate successors of any
                    note till five years after, when the first really important railway, connecting
                    two great centres of commerce, was finished. This was the line from Manchester
                    to Liverpool, opened September 15, 1830, when Mr Huskisson was accidentally
                    killed. As yet no railway had come near the metropolis, but great efforts were
                    made by George Stephenson and his friends to get permission for constructing a
                    line from London to Birmingham. The bill brought into parliament for this
                    purpose met with the most violent opposition, chiefly on the part of the great
                    landowners, who, so far from seing that the new mode of communication would
                    immensely enhance the value of their properties, loudly proclaimed that the
                    substitution of steam for horse-power would be “the curse and the ruin of
                    England.” It took three years to get the bill for the London-Birmingham railway,
                    which was passed at last in the session of 1833, obtaining the royal assent on
                    the 8ih of May. The first sod of the great line was cut at Chalk Farm, London,
                    on the 1st of June 1834. Enormous engineering difficulties had to be overcome,
                    originating not so much from the nature of the ground as from intense public
                    prejudice against the new mode of locomotion. Instead of following the course of
                    the old highroad, running along valleys, the line had to be pushed, by numerous
                    viaducts and tunnels, over hollows and under hills, so as to avoid touching any
                    considerable towns. It took five years to construct the railway from London to
                    Birmingham, at a cost of over four millions. Even friends of the railway
                    presaged that such outlay could not by any possibility be remunerative; but the
                    contrary became evident from the moment the line was opened, in 1838. The first
                    great “trunk” line proved a striking success, and its opening settled, without
                    further controversy, the establishment of the new system of intercommunication
                    in England.</p>
                <p>All the great railway systems of England sprang into existence within less than
                    ten years after the opening of the London-Birmingham line. Out of the latter
                    grew, in the first instance, one of the largest of companies, the London and
                    North-Western, while the most extensive system, as regards mileage, the Great
                    Western, originated in a line from Paddington, London, to Bristol, for which an
                    Act of Parliament was obtained in 1835, and which was opened in 1841. In 1836, a
                    bill passed the legislature erecting the “Great North of England” Railway
                    Company, from which was developed the now third largest of English railway
                    systems, the North Eastern. A few years subsequently various other Acts were
                    passed, sanctioning the “Midland Counties” and the “North Midland” lines, from
                    which sprang the present Midland system, fourth largest of English railway
                    companies. The construction of railways, up to this time, was confined almost
                    exclusively to England; the work was begun much later in Scotland, and still
                    later in Ireland.</p>
                <p>The total length of railways in the United Kingdom at the end of the year 1825,
                    which saw the opening of the first line, was 40 miles, constructed at a cost of
                    £120,000. Five years later, at the end of 1830. there were not more <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n248/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0248-0237"/> than 95 miles, built at a cost of £840,925, but
                    at the end of 1835 there were 293 miles, costing £5,648,531. Thus, in the first
                    five years of railway construction, from 1835 to 1830, the mileage doubled;
                    while in the second five years, from 1830 to 1835, it trebled. It quintupled in
                    the next five-yearly period, till the end of 1840, when the total length of
                    miles of railway in the kingdom had come to be 1435, built at a cost of
                    £41,391,634, as represented by the paid-up capital of the various companies. The
                    next five years saw again nearly another doubling of length of lines, for at the
                    end of 1845 there were 2441 miles of railway, created by a paid-up capital of
                    £88,481,376. Not far from a fresh trebling took place in the course of the next
                    quinquennial period, and at the end of 1850 there were 6621 miles of railways,
                    constructed at the cost of £240,270,745. Nearly all the railways opened up to
                    this date were main or “trunk” lines, connecting more or less busy centres of
                    population, the traffic between which was so large as to require double lines.
                    Unlike most European countries up to the present time, England began railway
                    building on a scale commensurate with the importance of the new mode of
                    intercommunication, the leaders of the great enterprise foreseeing clearly the
                    ultimate requirements of their work. It thus came to pass that double lines were
                    made the rule, and single lines the exception. More recently, however, an
                    increase has taken place in the construction of the latter, owing to the
                    extension of short branches from the main lines.</p>
                <p>The length of railways open for traffic in the United Kingdom, either with double
                    or single lines, and the amount of authorized capital, were as follows at the
                    end of each fifth year from 1856 to 1876 :—</p>

                <p>Among the most marvellous effects produced by railways was the incentive given by
                    them to the population to move from one place to another. Before the making of
                    ordinary roads, that is, previous to the middle of the 17th century, and the old
                    era of packhorses and bridle paths, there was scarcely any movement worth the
                    name; and the immense majority of people had to live and die in the places where
                    they were born, simply through not being able to transport themselves elsewhere,
                    even for a short distance. A change took place when highways came to be made,
                    with stagecoaches rolling along them, at a rate of from six to ten miles an
                    hour. But the accommodation afforded by these new means of travelling was
                    necessarily limited, besides being costly, in time as well as money, and the
                    mass of the people could not avail themselves of it. But what was impossible for
                    “the coach” was the easiest achievement for “the train” of coaches. In “the
                    train,” placed upon two longitudinal lines of iron rails, and propelled by
                    steam, the whole nation for the first time obtained freedom of movement. The
                    ancient packhorses carried their hundreds, and the stage-coaches their
                    thousands; but the railways carried their millions—and more millions than
                    ever·stagecoaches carried thousands.</p>
                <p>The railways carried their first million of passengers in 1833, the year in which
                    Stephenson won his great parliamentary battle in getting the bill for the
                    London-Birmingham line passed. The number of passengers carried per mile m 1832
                    was 4860, but before other ten years were gone, the number of passengers had not
                    only increased in proportion with the opening of new lines, but more than
                    doubled per mile, and, instead of being under 5000, had in 1842 come to be near
                    12,000. The following table exhibits the growth of the passenger traffic on the
                    railways of the United Kingdom, giving the length of lines open, the total
                    number of passengers carried, and the number per mile, in every fifth year from
                    1846 to 1876 :—</p>

                <p>The table shows, more clearly than could be expressed by any description in words
                    only, the striking changes effected by railways in the migratory habits of the
                    people in the course of a generation. While the number of passengers was little
                    above 14,000 per mile in 1846, it was'nearly 32,000 in 1876. The number of
                    passengers carried on the railways of the United Kingdom in the year 1876 was
                    equal to four times the population of Europe, and more than half the estimated
                    population of the globe.</p>
                <p>Considerably more than four-fifths of the passenger traffic on the railways of
                    the United Kingdom is in England and Wales. The number of railway passengers in
                    England and Wales, in Scotland, and in Ireland, and the numbers travelling by
                    each class of railway, were as follows in the year 1876 :—</p>

                    passenger traffic. In 1854 the total receipts were exactly alike from the two
                    sources, but after that year the proportion contributed by goods gradually rose,
                    reaching 51 per cent, in 1858, 52 per cent, in 1862, 53 per cent, in 1863, 54
                    per cent, in 1867, and 55 per cent, in 1873. In Scotland the receipts from goods
                    traffic in recent years amounted to 85 per cent, of the total; but in Ireland
                    the passenger traffic furnished 53 per cent, of the total receipts.</p>
                <p>The construction of railways in England was undertaken originally by a vast
                    number of small companies, each obtaining separate Acts of Parliament deemed
                    requisite for their existence. But many years did not elapse before it was
                    discovered that there could be neither harmonious nor profitable working of a
                    great many systems, and this led'to a series of amalgamations, by which the
                    majority of the lines were brought under the management of a few great
                    corporations. In the official “Railway Returns” issued by the Board of Trade,
                    there were still 92 independent companies enumerated as existing in England and
                    1 Val es at the end of 1876, but the mass of these consisted of very small
                    undertakings. Virtually, the railways of the country were controlled by seven
                    leading companies, as follows :—</p>

                <p>The seven great railway companies here enumerated— which might be reduced to six,
                    the North Eastern and Great Northern practically forming a united system—held
                    between them 8543 miles on the 3lst December 1876, representing nearly all the
                    main lines of the country. It seems probable that, with the exception, perhaps,
                    of two or three companies south of the Thames, possessing, in the communication
                    with the Continent, an independent traffic, all the others will gradually follow
                    the process of absorption, more and more strongly developed in recent years. It
                    may be that the process will ultimately reach its furthest solution by all the
                    railways being placed by purchase, the same as the telegraphs, under the sole
                    control of the Government <hi rend="italic">Tramways.—</hi> The obvious
                    advantages, quite independent of steam power, offered by placing longitudinal
                    rails on the ground for the traction of vehicles led to the introduction, in
                    recent years, of a modified form of raihvays, known as tram roads. In reality,
                    tramroads are the oldest railways. Wooden rails existed in the mining and
                    quarrying districts of England as early as the commencement of the 18th century,
                    and these being liable to rapid destruction by wear and tear, it occurred to the
                    manager of the far-famed Colebrookdale works before referred to that iron would
                    be an excellent substitute for wood. Accordingly, in 1767 the whole of the
                    wooden rails used on the extensive grounds over which the factories extended
                    were taken up, and replaced by iron rails. Early as thus was the establishment
                    of iron tramroads, over which vehicles were drawn by horses, into England, they
                    were forgotten over steam-worked railways, and nearly a century elapsed before
                    they were introduced again. The first tramway was laid down at Birkenhead in
                    1860, after American models; but a subsequent attempt to lay down a line in
                    London, from the Marble Arch to Bayswater, and another from Westminster Bridge
                    southwards, proved a failure. Fresh attempts, made in 1868, were more
                    successful; and in 1870 an Act was passed by the legislature—33 and 34 Vict. c.
                    78—to facilitate the construction of tramways throughout the country. This led
                    to the laying down of “street railways” in nearly all the large towns. According
                    to a return laid before the House of Commons in the session of 1878, the total
                    length of tramways authorized by parliament up to the 30th of June 1877 was 363
                    miles, and the total length opened for traffic 213 miles, comprising 125 miles
                    of double lines, and 88 miles of single lines. The total authorized capital of
                    all the tramway companies on the 30th June 1877 was =£5,528,989, while the
                    paid-up capital amounted to .£3,269,744, and the capital actually expended to
                    £3,343,265. A parliamentary commission on tramways, which made its report in the
                    session of 1877, recommended the introduction of steam as a motive power, and
                    the probable adoption of this improvement can scarcely fail to bring “street
                    railways,” in course of time, to be a useful appendage of the ordinary railway
                    system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Canals.—</hi> Roads and canals, too, the oldest aids to inter-
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> communication, are tending more and more, as far
                    as lengthened distances are concerned, to be simple auxiliaries of railways. The
                    total length of the canals traversing England extends over 2360 miles, and it is
                    estimated that more than half of this length already either belongs to railway
                    companies or is under their control, "while the remainder must follow the same
                    tendency of absorption, as the traffic on them, even for the heavy goods, is
                    unable to withstand the competition of railways. Various attempts to introduce
                    steam on the canals have not met with success, being opposed by the size and
                    construction of most of them, and the hindrance of numerous locks, dividing
                    unequal levels.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roads.—</hi> Railways have rather aided than prevented the
                    extension and improvement of the old highways of England, the turnpike roads,
                    which are now acknowledged to be among the best in the world. But the
                    “turnpikes” them selves have almost become things of the past. The system of
                    road-building by private enterprise, the undertakers being rewarded by tolls
                    levied from vehicles, persons, or animals using the roads, "was established in
                    England in 1663, an Act of Charles IL, 15. c. 1, authorizing the taking of such
                    tolls at “turnpikes” in Herts and Cambridgeshire. A century after, in 1767, the
                    authorization was extended over the whole kingdom, by Act 7 George III. c. 40.
                    In its fullness, the system lasted just sixty years, for the first breach in it
                    was made by an Act 7 and 8 George IV. c. 24, passed in 1827, by which the chief
                    turnpikes in the metropolis<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0250-0239"/> were abolished. Further Acts in the same
                    direction followed, leading to the gradual extinction, by due compensation of
                    the persons interested, of the old system, the maintenance of the roads being
                    vested in “turnpike trusts and highway boards,” empowered to levy local rates.
                    The revenue of these boards, outside the metropolis, amounted to .£2,302,869 in
                    1870, and had risen to over three millions sterling in 1876.</p>
                <p>VIII. <hi rend="italic">Post and Telegraphs.</hi></p>
                <p>It is one of the main arguments of the advocates of the purchase of all the
                    railways by the state, that vast undertakings, in which the whole nation is
                    deeply interested, ought not to be left to private enterprise, aiming at gain
                    chiefly; and that such concerns not only can be, but mostly are, better managed
                    by the Government. The argument rests on the post-office. On all sides it is
                    admitted that the creation and maintenance of the post-office as it now exists,
                    burthened with an immense amount of work besides the mere carrying of
                    correspondence, is a striking instance of the successful interference of
                    Government in commercial affairs; while it is difficult to imagine how the same
                    result could have been achieved by private persons. So general is this belief
                    that all the states not only of Europe, but of the civilized world, have made
                    the English post-office their model, closely imitating its whole
                    organization.</p>
                <p>In its present form, the post-office is an entirely modern creation, though the
                    first regular arrangements for despatching letters to all parts of the kingdom
                    date back to the year 1635, when the “letter office for England and Scotland”
                    was established. But the system thus inaugurated, also based upon a Government
                    monopoly, existing as such to the present time, remained long practically a
                    private enterprise, the right of conveying letters and packets being let by
                    contract to privileged individuals, whose sole aim was to make the greatest
                    profit out of the undertaking. The first radical reform of the system, which
                    laid the foundation of the present organization, was made by the Act 1 Vict. c.
                    32, confirmed July 12, 1837, which repealed all the old enactments relating to
                    the post-office in favour of an entirely new legislation. This important Act was
                    followed by another, 2 and 3 Vict. c. 52, confirmed August 17, 1839, which
                    established a uniform rate of postage of one penny on inland letters, repealing
                    at the same time the old and much abused system of “franking” letters, exercised
                    by members of parliament and others since 1660. The Act came into operation on
                    the 10th of January 1840.</p>
                <p>The vast increase in correspondence following upon the new organization is shown
                    in the subjoined table, which gives the estimated number of letters in 1839 and
                    1840, and the ascertained number in quinquennial periods from 1841 to 1870, and
                    for each of the six years from 1871 to 1876 in England and in the United
                    Kingdom, together with the average number of the letters to each person,

                    system, under which persons were enabled to hand the money in at one postoffice
                    for payment at another office. After the system had been tried from the year
                    1839 in the United Kingdom, it was extended to the colonies in 1856, and to

                <p>The money-order business transacted with the British colonies and with foreign
                    countries is about equal in importance, but the latter showed a far greater
                    expansion in the years 1870 to 1876. The total number of colonial orders in 1870
                    was 143,211, transmitting £600,981; and in 1876 the number had risen to 145,838,
                    but the amount fell to £572,752. On the other hand, the total number of foreign
                    money orders rose from 47,431, transmitting £172,983, in 1870 to 211,163,
                    transmitting £612,925, in 1876. In the case of both colonial and foreign money
                    orders, the number and amount arriving from abroad are far greater than those
                    sent away.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Savings Banks.—</hi> The post-office, besides issuing and
                    paying money orders, fulfils the duties of a national savings bank, and also of
                    an insurance institution, granting life insurance policies and annuities. The
                    post-office savings banks, established by Act of Parliament-in 1861, held a
                    total amount of £26,996,550, standing in the names of 1,702,374 depositors, at
                    the end of 1876. The proportion of depositors to population at that date was one
                    to 15 in England and Wales, one to 71 in Scotland, and one to 87 in Ireland. In
                    the whole of the United Kingdom it was one to 19. The average daily number of
                    deposits in the year 1876 was 10,347, and the average amount standing to the
                    credit of depositors, £15, 17s. Id. It is a notable fact that, although the
                    majority of depositors undoubtedly belong to the labouring classes, including
                    servants, the transactions of the post-office savings bank are much larger in
                    winter than in summer. The greatest number of deposits in the year 1876 occurred
                    on the 31st January, when it reached 25,063, considerably more than double the
                    average daily number. There were 5448 post-offices open as savings banks at the
                    end of 1876. (See page 256 below.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Life Assurance.—</hi> While the post-office savings banks
                    proved a great success, ever growing, and evidently much appreciated by the
                    public, the same cannot be said about the life insurance and annuity department.
                    It showed some vitality in the first few years after its establishment, from
                    1865 to 1872, but after this date both the insurance and annuity contracts
                    greatly declined. In 1872 the number of life policies granted was 757, insuring
                    £55,982; while in 1876 the number had fallen to 270, insuring £22,875. During
                    the same period the number of annuity contracts fell from 1057 in 1872 to 758 in
                    1876, the total receipts in the latter year, both for immediate and deferred
                    annuities, not amounting to more than £111,775. The almost insignificant amount
                    of the transactions seems to show that this department of the post-office has no
                    vitality, the field being already fully occupied by private enterprise.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Telegraphs.</hi> —Subsequent to the establishment of the money
                    order, the savings banks, and the insurance departments, a business of immense
                    importance was added to the functions of the post-office in the control and
                    management of all the telegraphs of the kingdom. It was not without much doubt
                    and misgiving that parliament consented to add to the Government monopoly of
                    conveying letters that of sending messages by electric wires; but after long
                    discussions in 1866 and 1867, the system was approved of by the legislature the
                    year after. An Act, 31 and 32 λ'ict. c. 110, authorizing the purchase of all the
                    telegraphs by the Government, for the purpose of being added to tho machinery of
                    the post-office, was passed in thesession of 1868, receiving the royal assent on
                    the 31st of July. It was followed by another statute, 32 and 33 Vict. c. 73,
                    establishing the monopoly. The chief reasons for passing the Act of 1868 were
                    given in the preamble, which declared that “it would be attended with great
                    advantage to the state, as well as to merchants and traders, and to the public
                    generally, if a cheaper, more widely extended, and more expeditious system of
                    telegraphy were established, and to that end [it is recommended that] the
                    postmaster-general be empowered to work telegraphs in connection with the
                    administration of the post-office.” It was stated in parliament during the
                    debates on the Act that, under the then existing system of private telegraph
                    companies, severely competing with each other for the most remunerative
                    business, there were 700 towns in the kingdom having a surplus service, each
                    being attended to by two, three, or more companies, with offices close together,
                    in the central parts; while, on the other hand, there existed 486 towns with no
                    telegraphic facilities, except, perhaps, that offered by the nearest railway
                    station. It was this fact which weighed, more than any other, in giving the
                    future control of the telegraphs to the post-office, to be worked as a state
                    monopoly.</p>
                <p>There were, when the Act of 1868 was passed, 13' telegraph companies in existence
                    within the United Kingdom, including several which owned submarine cables for
                    international service. There were, besides, 83 railway companies possessing
                    electric telegraphs, for the use of the public as well as their own service.
                    Altogether these 83 railway companies had constructed for themselves 5157 miles
                    of lines, comprising 16,191 miles of wire, with 1226 stations for public use;
                    while the 13 telegraph companies possessed 16,879 miles of land lines, made up
                    of 79,646 miles of wire, besides 4688 miles of submarine cable, containing 8122
                    miles of wire imbedded, with 2155 stations. Under the Act of Parliament, only 3
                    telegraph companies, the Electric, the British and Irish Magnetic, and the
                    United Kingdom Telegraphic, had specified sums allowed to them for their
                    property, and with all the rest the purchase money had to be settled by
                    agreement, if requisite through an arbitrator appointed by the Board of Trade.
                    It necessarily took some time to settle these matters, which involved payment of
                    over six millions sterling; but the task was accomplished, on the whole, with
                    remarkable rapidity; and on the 5th of February 1870, the post-office commenced
                    the working of all the telegraph lines of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>The vast increase of telegraphic communication immediately after the new state
                    organization, and its subsequent progress, is shown in the subjoined table,
                    which gives the total number of messages forwarded from the year 1870—
                    commencing February 5—to the 3lst of March 1877, the last period comprising
                    fifteen months, to bring, as previously explained, the postal accounts into
                    uniformity with the general financial accounts of the kingdom :—</p>

                    of March 1877 was 3734, in addition to which messages were received at and
                    delivered from 1636 railway stations. The staff exclusively engaged on telegraph

                <p>By the terms of the Act of 1868, establishing the system of postal telegraphs,
                    all the railway companies retain the privilege of transmitting messages relating
                    to their own service free of charge, on the wires running along their lines. To
                    the public a uniform rate of transmission is charged, irrespective of distance.
                    The charge was fixed, provisionally, at one shilling for every twenty words, and
                    threepence for every additional word, the names and addresses of senders and
                    receivers not being included in the number. The payments were originally made in
                    postage stamps; but on the 1st of April 1876, distinctive telegraph stamps for
                    the prepayment of messages were introduced. Forms of receipts for messages were
                    brought into use on the 1st of February of the same year, but it was stated in
                    the twenty-third report of the postmastergeneral, dated August 4, 1877, that up
                    to that time “very little use had been made” of this innovation by the

                    coaches, carts, and other vehicles. The total expenditure of the money-order
                    department in the year ended March 31, 1877, resulted, according to the report
                    of the postmaster-general before cited, in a loss of £10,000, which deficit was
                    expected to be greater in future years, owing to “the large increase in the
                    number of inland money orders for small amounts, on which the commission is
                    insufficient to cover the cost of the service.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Staff·—</hi> The total staff of officers and servants employed
                    by the post-office at the end of 1876 was 45,024, inclusive of 11,654 persons
                    attendingly solely to telegraph duties. Of post-office clerks there were at the
                    date 3380; of postmasters, 13,447; and of letter carriers, sorters, and
                    post-office messengers, 16,327. In London alone, the staff of the post-office
                    comprised 10,380 persons, of which number 5500 were attached to the chief
                    offices in St Martin’s-le-Grand. In 1840 the total number of postoffices. in the
                    United Kingdom was 4500; and at the end of 1876 they had increased to 13,447,
                    besides which there were 10,724 road letter-boxes. It is now an established fact
                    that not any other Government department of modern times has succeeded like the
                    post-office in the double task of augmenting the welfare of the nation and at
                    the same time increasing the public revenue.</p>
                <p>IX. <hi rend="italic">National Revenue and Expenditure.—Taxation.</hi></p>
                <p>The finances of no European state are in a more admirable condition than those of
                    the United Kingdom. Not only is the national revenue, requisite to meet the
                    expenditure, raised with the utmost facility, but for many years the balance of
                    them has been complete, an annual surplus being the rule, and a deficit the
                    exception, in most financial periods. In the half century intervening between
                    the years 1827-28 and 1876-77, both the expenditure and revenue rose to but a
                    comparatively small degree, far below all proportion with the vastly increased
                    wealth of the nation during the same period. In the financial year 1827-28 the
                    total public revenue amounted to £54,932,518, and the expenditure to
                    £53,800,291; while iu the financial year 1840-41 the total revenue was
                    £47,433,399, and the total expenditure £49,285,396. Thus, in the course of
                    thirteen years, the fiscal burthens laid upon the population, augmented by
                    nearly two millions in the meantime, instead of being increased, had been
                    greatly lessened. Subsequently, from 1841 to 1877, a gradually increasing
                    expenditure took place, together with a rising public revenue; but the upward
                    movement was slight, and much below the growth of the population iu numbers,
                    and, still more, in wealth. At the end of the next decennial period, in the
                    financial year 1850-51, the total revenue had risen to £53,057,053, and the
                    expenditure to £49,882,322; and at the end of another decennial period, in the
                    financial year 1860-61, the revenue stood at £70,283,674, and the expenditure at
                    £72,792,059. At the end of the next decennial period, in the financial year
                    1870-71, the total revenue had fallen to £69,945,220, and the expenditure to
                    £69,548,539. During the whole of the thirty years from 1840-41 to 1870-71, there
                    were but few annual periods without a surplus of revenue over expenditure.</p>

                    government, together with the proportion of receipts per head of population of

                    year thereafter to 1877. Up to 1854, the financial years ended April 5; but,
                    commencing from 1855, the financial years ended March 31. Till the year ending

                <p>The surplus for the financial year 1876-77 amounted to £439,809, being less than
                    in any of the preceding five years. In the budget estimates for 1877-78 the

                <p>About three-fourths of the total revenue of the United Kingdom are derived from
                    three sources of income—excise, customs duties, and stamps. In the sixteen
                    financial years from 1861-62 the revenue from the excise increased greatly, and
                    that from customs declined, while that from stamps increased moderately. The
                    following table shows the receipts from these main sources of revenue for every

                <p><hi rend="italic">Excise.—</hi> The vast increase in the receipts from the excise
                    during the sixteen years from 1862 to 1877 was due solely to the corresponding
                    increase in the consumption of spirituous liquors. The increase was greatest in
                    the receipts from spirits, which rose from £9,618,291 in 1861-62 to £14,873,165
                    in 1876-77. The excise receipts from malt grew from £5,866,302 in 1861-62 to
                    £8,040,378; and those from licences to make and sell spirits and malt liquors
                    from £1,500,613 in 1861-62 to £3,548,557 in 1876-77. In the latter financial
                    year the receipts from the excise had come to represent already considerably
                    more than one-third of the total revenue, and should the growth, very steady and
                    regular from year to year, continue at the rate shown in the preceding table, it
                    will not be long before one-half of the national income will be raised by the
                    voluntary taxation of the consumers of alcoholic liquors.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Customs.—</hi> The decline in the receipts from customs during
                    the period 1862 to 1877 was due entirely to a constant reduction of duties.
                    Those on tea were reduced in 1862, causing a loss to the revenue of £1,641,541;
                    and again in 1864, when the loss was £2,214,981. Theduties on sugar were also
                    greatly reduced in 1863, the loss to the customs being £1,741,272; and again in
                    1872, with a loss of £1,612,882; while the small remnant of the old duties on
                    corn was repealed in 1868, at a loss of £855,581; and the example was followed
                    in the case of the sugar duties, the last of which was abolished in 1875. Thus
                    the sugar duties, producing £6,383,289 in 1861-62, brought nothing in 1876-77,
                    while the tea duties fell from £5,516,584 to £3,723,147. Alone of all the
                    customs duties, those on foreign spirits and wine increased during the period,
                    notwithstanding the latter article also underwent a reduction of duties.
                    Together, the foreign wine and spirits duties produced £3,753,785 in the
                    financial year 1840-41, and £7,507,807 in 1876-77. Adding this sum to the excise
                    receipts, the total revenue derived from spirituous liquors in the financial
                    year 1876-77 was no less than £35,243,807, or nearly three-sevenths of the
                    national revenue.</p>
                <p>The subjoined table exhibits the changes effected in the national revenue by
                    either the repeal or reduction of taxes, and the imposition or re-imposition of
                    old and new ones, during the period from 1861-62 to 1876-77 :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Income</hi><hi rend="italic">Tax.—</hi> The basis and principle
                    of the system of levying the national revenue is indirect taxation, or, as it
                    may very properly be called, voluntary taxation, since at present no impost lies
                    upon any article of prime necessity. To this system the only exception is the
                    income tax, which, however, has many opponents, and is barely considered by the
                    legislature a permanent tax, as it has to undergo constant changes, all tending
                    to its repeal at a favourable opportunity. Originally granted by parliament,
                    against great opposition, in 1798, as “an aid for the prosecution of tbe war”
                    against France, the old income tax was repealed in 1816. But it was re-imposed,
                    under modified forms, in 1842, nominally for only three years, the amount being
                    fixed at 7d. in the pound. Subsequently parliament consented to new
                    prolongations, alternately of three years, of one year, and of seven years; and
                    in the course of the Crimean war, the impost was raised, first to 14d., and then
                    to 16d., in the pound. In 1857 the income tax was again reduced to 7d., and in
                    1858 to 8d,, in the pound. In the following year it was once more raised to 9d.,
                    and to 10d. in 1860; but was again reduced to 9d. in the pound in 1861, to 7d.
                    in 1863, to 6d. in 1864, and to 4d. in 1865. In 1867 the tax was again raised to
                    5d., and in 1868 to 6d., but in the following year once more lowered to 5d., and
                    in 1870 to 4d., in the pound. The tax was again brought up to 6d. in 1871, but
                    lowered to 4d. in 1872, to 3d. in 1873, and to 2d. in 1874. Finally, in 1876 it
                    was once more raised to 3d. in the pound, but at the same time restricted to
                    incomes of over £150 per annum, with a deduction of £120 for all incomes between
                    £150 and £400, thus affecting mainly the so-called “upper” and “upper middle”
                    classes of the population. The total receipts of the income tax amounted to
                    £10,365,000 in the financial year 1861—62, and had sunk to £5,280,000, or little
                    more than one-half, in the year 1876-77.</p>

                    Scotland, and Ireland respectively is given in the following table. The figures,

                <p>The amount of terminable annuities,, included in the total capital of the debt,
                    by computation in 3 per cent stock, varied considerably in different years,
                    through additions being made to them, as in 1864, when <hi rend="italic"
                    >£5,</hi> 000,000 of the funded debt were converted into terminable annuities,
                    and again in 1875, when £4,000,000 of Suez Canal bonds were added. The total
                    computed capital of them amounted to £49,308,558 on the 31st of March 1877. By
                    the provisions of an Act of Parliament passed in the session of 1875, the
                    national debt will be gradually reduced by the establishment of a new permanent
                    sinking fund, maintained by annual grants. The grants, by the same Act, were
                    fixed at £27,400,000 for the financial year 1875-76, at £27,700,000 for the year
                    1876-77, and at £28,000,000 for every subsequent year after 1877.</p>
                <p>There is a somewhat remarkable harmony between the chief sources of revenue and

                    covered the first branch of expenditure, interest and management of debt,
                    amounting to £27,992,834. Again, in the same financial year, the receipts from
                    customs and stamps paid, with a surplus left, for the cost of the army and navy;
                    while the produce of the taxes, including income tax, together with the
                    post-office, discharged the expenses of the general government.</p>

                <p>In addition to the sums here specified, the local authorities raised in the
                    financial year 1873-74 the amount of £1,552,555 from sales and rents of
                    property, £2,404,675 from Government contributions, £8,480,486 by loans, and
                    £3,848,504 from miscellaneous sources. The total local receipts, including
                    taxes, amounted in the year to £45,533,815,—of which £37,731,193 was contributed
                    by England and Wales, £3,202,714 by Scotland, and £4,599,908 by Ireland.</p>
                <p>From a parliamentary paper, comparing imperial and ' local taxation in the United
                    Kingdom, issued in the session ' of 1876, it appears that the burthen of local
                    taxation is much higher in England and Wales than either in Scotland or in
                    Ireland. If spread evenly over the three divisions of the United Kingdom, it
                    amounted in 1873-4 to £2, 18s. lid. per head of the total population.</p>

                <p>About one-fifth of the entire national expenditure is for the maintenance of the
                    army, and an additional one-seventh for that of the navy. In the army estimates
                    for the financial year ending the 31st March 1878, sanctioned by parliament, the
                    total amount to be expended on account of the army was fixed at £14,583,700, of
                    which £12,643,900 was for “effective services,” that is, the actual maintenance
                    of the regular army, as well as auxiliary and reserve forces, and £1,894,800 for
                    “auxiliary services,” comprising rewards, pensions, and superannuation
                    allowances.</p>
                <p>The regular army was composed, according to the army estimates of 1877-78, of

                <p>The numbers of the regular army, maintained for service in the United Kingdom,
                    have varied much in the course of the present century. In the year 1800 the
                    total was 70,745; and it rose to 106,331 in 1805, and to 112,518 in 1810. Within
                    the next three quinquennial periods, the number decreased, that is, to 80,731 in
                    1815, to 61,116 in 1820, and to 46,264 in 1825. In 1830 the number rose again to
                    48,094, but fell to 47,214 in 1835. There was another rise to 50,476 in 1840, to
                    59,870 in 1845, and to 67,077 in 1850. In 1855 the number had fallen once more
                    to 49,342, but this was the lowest point it reached. The strength of the army
                    rose again to 89,507 in 1860; it stood at 78,410 in 1865, and at 84,361 in 1870.
                    There were considerable fluctuations in the number of men maintained for home
                    service in each of the years from 1871 to 1876. The number was 82,472 at the end
                    of 1871, 94,402 in 1872, 101,145 in 1873, 98,719 in 1874, 92,386 in 1875, and
                    96,275 in 1876. Of the total force in the United Kingdom in 1876, there were
                    68,253 men in England and Wales, 3895 in Scotland, 22,414 in Ireland, and 1713
                    in the Channel Islands.</p>
                <p>The numbers of regular troops on colonial service were gradually diminished in
                    recent years. They were entirely withdrawn from Australia and New Zealand, and
                    partly from British North America, a small force only being left in Nova Scotia.
                    The chief military stations left were Malta, Gibraltar, the Cape of Good Hope,
                    Ceylon, Bermuda, and Hong Kong. The total number of the British forces in India
                    was given at 62,652 men of all ranks in the army estimates of 1877-78.</p>
                <p>The recruits for the regular army were raised as follows from each of the
                    divisions of the United Kingdom in the years 1871 to 1873 :—</p>

                <p>Desertions from the army, mainly if not entirely by recruits, were formerly
                    extremely numerous. But they tended to diminish in recent years, partly on
                    account of improved organization, under which better treatment is secured to the
                    rank and file of soldiers, and partly by the option given to recruits to enlist
                    either for “long” service of twelve years, or for “short” service of six years.
                    In the year 1862 there were 4624 recruits approved, and among them there were no
                    fewer than 2895 desertions, being more than one-half of the total; but from
                    among the 21,927 recruits of 1871 there were but 5861 desertions; while from
                    20,640 recruits enlisted in the year 1874 there were only 5572 desertions. Of
                    the recruits of 1874, there enlisted 7784 on “long” service, and 12,856 on
                    “short” service.</p>
                <p>The army estimates enumerate, as constituting the forces of the United Kingdom,
                    besides the regular troops, four other bodies, classified as reserves, or
                    auxiliary troops. These are—the militia, the yeomanry cavalry, the volunteer
                    corps, and the enrolled pensioners and army reserve force. The total number of
                    the militia in 1877-78 was returned at 139,331, comprising a permanent staff' of
                    4831, and 134,500 men in training service. For the same period the total number
                    of yeomanry cavalry was 14,830, there being a permanent staff of 282, and 14,548
                    yeomen. The total number of volunteers provided for in the army estimates of
                    1877-78 was 174,241, comprising 32,393 artillery volunteers, and 148,848 light
                    horse, engineers, and rifle volunteers. Since its establishment, under a new
                    organization, in the year 1859, down to the end of 1876, the total number of
                    volunteers who joined and passed through the force was as follows, according to
                    a report laid before parliament in the session of 1877 :—</p>

                    Kingdom, the enrolled pensioners, were returned as numbering 36,000 in the army
                    estimates of 1877—78. The enrolled pensioners are divided into two classes,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Army Expenditure.—</hi> The expenditure for the army, after
                    nearly doubling from 1840-41 to 1861-62, remained almost stationary in the
                    sixteen financial years from 1861-62 to 1876-77. It amounted to £15,570,869 in
                    1861-62, and, gradually decreasing, fell to £13,804,450 in 1865-66, after which
                    it rose again to £15,482,582. It sank once more to £13,430,400 in 1870—71, but
                    rose in the financial year 1872-73 to £14,824,500; and changed little till the
                    year 1876-77, when the disbursements for the army amounted to £15,749,717. The
                    largest branch of expenditure is that for the general staff and regimental pay,
                    for which £4,565,800 was set down in the army estimates of 1877-78; and the next
                    largest branch for provisions, transport, and other services, fixed at
                    £2,986,000 for the same year. The total cost of the auxiliary and reserve forces
                    for the year 1877-78 was not more than £1,209,100, of which £534,000 was for the
                    militia, £74,400 for the yeomanry cavalry, £468,700 for the volunteer corps, and
                    £132,000 for the enrolled pensioners and army reserve force.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Naval Expenditure.—</hi> Although considered “the bulwark of
                    the nation,” and more important for the defence of the kingdom than its land
                    forces, the navy is maintained at much less expense. However, the disbursements
                    for the navy increased very largely since the year 1840, when the old wooden
                    “three-deckers,” formerly the pride of the seas, had to disappear, to give way,
                    first, to iron ships propelled by steam, and, not long after, to armour-clad men
                    of-war, gradually assuming the shape of floating fortresses. In the financial
                    year 1840-41 the total expenditure on account of the navy, including transport
                    service, was £5,597,511; and in the next year, 1841-42, the cost rose to
                    £6,489,074. In 1845-46 the naval expenditure had risen to £6,809,872, in 1846-47
                    to £7,803,465, and in 1847-48 to £8,013,873. After 1848 the expenditure for the
                    navy remained nearly stationary for six years, till 1854, when it suddenly rose,
                    with the setting in of the era of armour-clad ships. In the financial year
                    1854-55 the naval expenditure went up, with a leap, to £14,490,105; and in the
                    next year, 1855-56, it reached the large sum of £19,654,585, an amount
                    unparalleled before or since. The next few years showed a great reduction in
                    naval expenditure, which fell to£13,459,013 in 1856-57, to £10,590,000 in
                    1857-58, and to £9,215,487 in 1858-59. There was another rise to £11,823,859 in
                    1859-60, and to £13,331,668 in 1860—61; but this was followed by a decrease to
                    £12,598,042 in 1861-62, and to £11,370,588 in 1862-63. At the latter amount the
                    expenditure for the navy remained, with unimportant fluctuations, till 1877,
                    never rising much above 12 millions, nor sinking much below 10 millions. The
                    naval expenditure amounted to £11,364,383 in the financial year ended March 31,

                <p>The number of ships in commission here given form but a small portion of the
                    naval forces of the United Kingdom, especially of its by far most ' important
                    division, the armour-clad fleet. Together with the navy estimates for the
                    financial year 1877-78, there was issued a parliamentary return, issued from the
                    Admiralty, dated April 5, 1877, containing a list “of all iron clads, and date
                    of their first completion for sea.” The return gives the names of 48 armour-clad
                    vessels, 31 of them classified as “broadside ships,” 1 as a “ram,” 14 as “turret
                    ships,” and 2 as “ironclads building.”</p>
                <p>The whole of the armour-clad ships of the broadside class completed previous to
                    1870 have no thicker armour than from 4^ to <hi rend="italic">5⅛</hi> inches;
                    while those completed from 1870 to 1873 received armour of from 6 to 8 inches
                    thickness. This was increased in the broadside iron-clad of 1877, the
                    “Alexandra,” to from 8 to 12 inches thickness; andin three not quite completed,
                    to armour of from 8 to 10 and 11 inches. In the turret ships, a greater
                    thickness of armour was resorted to at an earlier date. The “Glatton,” completed
                    in 1872, was the first ship to receive armour of from 12 to 14 inches in
                    thickness, subsequently also given to the “Devastation” and the “Thunderer;”
                    while the “Dreadnought” had 14 inches throughout. Surpassing all other ships in
                    armour-thickness is the “Inflexible,” under construction at the end of 1877, the
                    central part of which has from 16 to 24 inches, protecting 4 guns of 81 ton
                    weight, the heaviest ever made for the British navy, and exceeded only by a few
                    made in England for two Italian men-of-war.</p>
                <p>The construction of unarmoured ships, while not yet quite abandoned, is confined
                    entirely to screw streamers, built of iron or steel, designed for great speed,
                    and with very powerful engines. There were 9 ships of this class at the end of
                    1877, 3 of them frigates and 6 corvettes. The two largest frigates, the
                    “Inconstant” and the “Shah,” of 5700 tons, with engines of 7500 horse-power,
                    were reported at the date to be the swiftest ships of the British navy.</p>
                <p>The number of men provided for the naval service of the kingdom was 54,400 in the
                    navy estimates 1877-78. They were divided into 34,100 seamen and 6300 boys, 3000
                    of the latter being under training, giving a total of 40,400 directly classified
                    as “sailors.” Besides them, for the service of the fleet, were 14,000
                    marines—7000 afloat and 7000 on shore. Included in the number of 34,100 seamen
                    of the fleet, provided for in the estimates of 1877-78, were 160 flag officers,
                    30 officers superintending dockyards and naval establishments, and 2889 other
                    commissioned officers on active service, being a total of 3079 officers for the
                    British navy.</p>

                <p>There is a singular want of authentic religioue statistics in England. While in
                    nearly all other European countries the number of the population adhering to
                    various creeds is carefully ascertained at the periodical census takings, or at
                    other times, this has never been done in England, except in a cursory manner. At
                    the census of March 31, 1851, an enumeration took place of the number of places
                    of worship in England and Wales, and the attendance of persons therein on the
                    preceding day, a Sunday; but the information thus obtained, though valuable in
                    some respects, was not of the kind to allow accurate conclusions concerning the
                    strength of the various religious bodies, it being well known that the
                    attendance in churches and chapels comprises many persons outside the creed to
                    which they adhere. The returns of the census of March 1851 were as follows

                <p>The total population of England and Wales at the census of March 31, 1851, was
                    17,927,609, so that the church attendance registered comprised little more than
                    one-third of the population.</p>
                <p>In the absence of other official reports, the best existing means of ascertaining
                    the numbers of the various creeds are in the returns of the registrar-general of
                    births, deaths, and marriages. Since the year 1836, when, duriug Lord
                    Melbourne’s administration, an Act was passed granting all dissenters from the
                    state church the right to go through the ceremony of marriage in their own
                    churches and chapels— a right of which they had been deprived from 1754, for a
                    period of 82 years—strict accounts were kept of the creeds of all persons
                    marrying, and from these tolerably accurate conclusions may be drawn regarding
                    the respective numbers, if not of all the sects and denominations, at least of
                    the two great divisions of the population, churchmen and nonconformists. A
                    careful analysis of the marriage returns for the forty years from 1837 to the
                    end of 1876 makes it apparent that the number of nonconformists is steadily
                    increasing, and that, although the great majority of the population still adhere
                    to the Church of England, the probability seems that it will be otherwise in the
                    course of one or two generations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dissenters.—</hi> From an enumeration made in the year 1699,
                    and believed to be quite trustworthy, it appears that at that time the total
                    number of Protestant dissenters from the Church of England was not more than
                    214,000, being 448 per cent, of the population. There are no returns for about a
                    century and a half after this date from which an estimate can be drawn
                    respecting the number of dissenters, the first new basis for them not offering
                    itself till the passing of the Marriage Act of 1836. Tn 1845, when the Act had
                    been well carried out, the number of Protestant dissenters in England and Wales
                    was calculated at 1,351,000, being 8Ό8 per cent, of the population. This was no
                    great increase from 1699, when the percentage was 448, but the rise of dissent
                    became more marked henceforth. In 1851 the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n258/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0258-0247"/> number of Protestant dissenters was estimated at
                    1,958,000, or 10’89 per cent, of the population; and ten years after, in 1861,
                    the total number was calculated to have increased to 3,090,000, being 15 ’ 36
                    per cent, of the population. There was an estimated further increase to
                    3,686,000, or 17'38 per cent, of the population, in the number of dissenters at
                    the end of 1866; while the last calculations, going down to the end of 1876,
                    make it probable that at this date the number had risen to 4,500,000, being not
                    far from 20 per cent, of the population. According to the most reliable
                    estimates, the dissenters did not constitute the majority of the population in
                    the year 1876 in any part of England, but they possessed it in Wales. Next to
                    Wales, the greatest number of dissenters were in Monmouthshire, Cumberland,
                    Cornwall and Devon, Durham, and Yorkshire, in all which counties they
                    constituted more than a third of the population. On the other hand, the
                    dissenters were in a small minority in nearly all the southern counties of
                    England, notably in Middlesex, Kent, and Sussex. In the metropolis itself, the
                    Protestant dissenters were estimated to form about 10 per cent, of the
                    population.</p>
                <p>Under the Act of 1836, the registrar-general has to keep a list of all the
                    churches and chapels of the various dissenting religious denominationswishing to
                    be “licensed” for the celebration of marriages. The number so entered was,
                    according to the “Thirty-Eighth Annual Report of the Registrar-General” issued
                    in 1877, no less than 122. The following was the reported list of denominations

                <p>The total number of “licensed” churches and chapels belonging to Protestant and
                    other dis3enters from the established church was 20,480 on the 31st December
                    1875. The number had fallen to 19,486 on the 31st October 1877.</p>
                <p>The numerically most important body of Protestant dissenters is that of Wesleyan
                    Methodists, founded in 1739 Dy the Rev. John Wesley, clergyman of the Church of
                    England. Subsequently to his death, in 1791, the community split into various
                    subdivisions, of which 13 are enumerated in the preceding list. The largest of
                    these, known simply as Methodists, or Wesleyan Methodists, had on its roll
                    402,437 members at the end of 1876; and the next largest, the Primitive
                    Methodists, 181,081 members. Of more or less importance, among the other bodies
                    of Protestant dissenters, are the Baptists, split into nearly as many divisions
                    as the Wesleyan Methodists; the Independents, also known as Congregationalists;
                    the Unitarians; and the Moravians. No authentic returns exist regarding the
                    number of persons adhering to any of the minor Protestant creeds reported by the
                    registrar-general as existing in England and Wales.</p>
                <p>More numerous than any single body of Protestant dissenters is that of Roman
                    Catholics in England. It is stated by Hallam that in the reign of Queen
                    Elizabeth the Roman Catholics numbered one-third of the entire population; but
                    the effect of the many repressive laws enacted against them was that at the end
                    of the 17th century, when the already referred to religious census of 1699 was
                    taken, the total number was only 27,696, being barely one-half per cent, of the
                    population. It was estimated that the number of Roman Catholics in England had
                    increased to 68,000 in 1767, being about 1 per cent, of the population, and that
                    it stood at 69,400 in 1780, being less than 1 per cent. On the basis of the
                    marriage returns of the registrar-general, the estimated number of Roman
                    Catholics in England and Wales was 284,300 in 1845, or 1 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 70 per cent, of the population; but within the next six years, when there
                    was a large immigration of Irish, the numbers rapidly rose, and at the end of
                    1851 the total number of Roman Catholics was calculated at 758,800, being 4’22
                    of the population. The numbers kept rising till 1854, when there were estimated
                    to be 916,600 Roman Catholics in England and Wales, being 494 per cent, of the
                    population; but there was a fall after this year, if not in numbers yet in
                    percentage. The calculated number was 927,500, or 4 61 per cent., in 1861, and
                    982,000, or 4 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 62 per cent., in 1866. It is
                    estimated that in the middle of 1877 the number of Roman Catholics in England
                    and Wales had barely reached one million, being a less percentage than in 1866,
                    and that about one-half the number comprised natives of Ireland, with their
                    families. It would thus seem that Roman Catholicism has not been progressive in
                    England for about a quarter of a century. However, the wealth of the body
                    increased very greatly during this period, owing mainly to the secession of many
                    rich persons, of both sexes, to the church, which led to a vast increase of
                    Roman Catholic places of worship. They numbered 616 in 1853, and had risen to
                    1095 at the end of 1877, with a clergy of 1892. The government of the Roman
                    Catholic Church in England and Wales is under 12 bishops ruling dioceses, and 1
                    archbishop, head of the “province of Westminster.”</p>
                <p>The Established Church of England, to which adhere the majority of the
                    population—the estimated number of members being 13⅜ millions in the middle of
                    1877, leaving about 11 millions to all other creeds—was governed, at the end of
                    1877, by 2 archbi⅛hops and 28 bishops, the former at the head of two provinces,
                    and the latter of as many episcopal sees. There were as many as 21 bishoprics at
                    the beginning of the 8th century, which number was thought insufficient at the
                    time, for the Venerable Bede, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n259/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0259-0248"/> some years before his death, in 735, exhorted
                    King Egbert to increase the sees by converting many monasteries into cathedrals.
                    However, the advice was not followed; and at the period of the Conquest the
                    number of sees was still 21. During the centuries that elapsed till the
                    Reformation, while the population increased from 1J to 4 millions of souls, only
                    two new bishoprics were formed, namely, that of Ely in 1109, and that of
                    Carlisle in 1133. In the reign of Henry VIII. it was proposed to establish 20
                    new dioceses, but only 6 came to be formed, one of which, that of Westminster,
                    had no long existence. Three centuries again elapsed after the Reformation till
                    any more sees were founded, the first new creation being that of Ripon,
                    established in 1836. Eleven years afterwards, in 1847, the bishopric of
                    Manchester was founded; while the lapse of another twenty years saw the
                    establishment of two more bishoprics in those of St Albans and Truro.</p>

                <p>The formerly variable incomes of the archbishops were fixed by a number of
                    statutes, arising out of the establishment, in 1832, of a parliamentary
                    “Commission to inquire into the Revenues and Patronage of the Established Church
                    in England and Wales.” In 1836 the members of the commission, after having made
                    a close investigation into all the sources of church revenue, were constituted,
                    by Act 6 and 7 William IV. c. 77, a perpetual corporation, under the title of
                    “Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England and Wales,” with power to administer
                    the financial affairs of the church, to pay fixed salaries to the principal
                    church dignitaries, to re-arrange, under approval of the Queen in council, the
                    boundaries of dioceses and incumbencies, and to take other measures “conducive
                    to the efficiency of the established church, and the best mode of providing for
                    the cure of souls.”</p>
                <p>In the government of the Church of England, the archbishops and bishops are
                    assisted by 30 deans and 74 archdeacons, the former having fixed incomes, paid
                    by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but the latter dependent chiefly on
                    preferments, held independent of their dignity. The more immediate supervision
                    of the parochial clergy, estimated to number about 13,000, is in charge of 610
                    rural deans, who have no salaries as such, but are entirely dependent on that
                    derived from their preferments, or “livings.” The incomes of these vary
                    extremely, being excessively low in many cases, while in others approaching the
                    revenues of the dignitaries of the church, To raise the value of the smallest
                    “livings” has been among the chief labours of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners,
                    and they have been aided in the task by the endeavours of various societies,
                    both lay and clerical, among them that of the “Bishop of London’s Fund,”
                    established in 1864. Foremost among the older organizations stands the “Queen
                    Anne’s Bounty,” founded in 1703, to increase the incomes of the poorer clergy.
                    The commissioners under the Act of Queen Anne which established the “Bounty”
                    found no less than 5597 livings under £50 per annum in England and Wales; but
                    since that time the number greatly decreased, and although there are no official
                    returns on the subject, it may be estimated that there were not 1000 preferments
                    in the country in 1877 endowed with such small incomes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> The spirit of reform which made itself felt in
                    the church by the institution of the Church Inquiry and Ecclesiastical
                    Commissions exhibited itself to a far more vigorous degree during the same
                    period by promoting the cause of education. The work of educational reform began
                    with the upper and middle class schools, and gradually went downwards, till it
                    reached the lowest classes of the population. Parliament began occupying itself
                    with the condition and management of the public schools of England in 1818, when
                    a commission made a report upon them, exposing many evils. Though little action
                    was taken at the time, the work of inquiry continued in various forms, leading
                    to the close inspection of more than 2000 endowed schools. Many of these were
                    compelled to undergo extensive reforms in their mode of teaching, so as no
                    longer to exclude science, art, and modern languages; while the revenues of
                    nearly all of them were regulated, and made to serve larger objects than before.
                    It was the leading aim of the educational reformers in parliament both to deepen
                    and widen education, giving the largest possible number the best possible
                    instruction, and a variety of measures were passed for this purpose. From 1834
                    direct annual grants were voted, the first of &lt;£20,000, for the promotion of
                    education, and in 1839 the Committee of the Privy Council on Education was
                    instituted for the distribution of the money. An Act for the establishment of
                    industrial schools was passed in 1857; and in the same year the universities of
                    Oxford and Cambridge consented to undertake “middleclass examinations” in some
                    of the chief towns of England. These local university examinations began in the
                    summer of 1858, and proved most successful in promoting higher education. It was
                    stimulated no less by an Act passed in 1869, 31 and 32 Vict. c. 118, reforming
                    the government, teaching, and discipline of the seven great public schools of
                    England, —Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester, Shrewsbury, the Charterhouse, and
                    Westminster. This statute greatly widened their field of instruction.</p>
                <p>"While these efforts were made to improve the education of the middle and upper
                    classes, the lower classes of the population were not altogether forgotten.
                    Still the achievements in this direction, naturally vastly more difficult, were
                    for a time inconsiderable. The first impulse given towards more determined
                    exertion was by a great educational conference, under the presidency of the
                    Prince Consort, which took place in London in June 1857, and passed resolutions
                    that were soon echoed all over the land. The first result of the conference was
                    the appointment, in the session of <pb break="no"

                    into the state of popular education, the report of which was issued, rather
                    tardily, in March 1861. Close upon the report followed a minute of the Committee
                    of the Privy Council on Education, establishing a revised code of regulations
                    for elementary schools. The code, which was to come into operation on the 1st
                    April 1862, decreed regular examina tions of the pupils, payment by results,
                    evening schools for adults, and various other changes in elementary education,
                    tending to make it more general. But so far from giving satisfaction, the new
                    code raised a storm of opposition, chiefly from the clergy, and had to be
                    altered iu some of its most important provisions. In the session of 1870 a
                    statute of the highest importance was passed, which effected ’ little less than
                    a revolution in the state of national education. By this statute, 33 and 34
                    Vict. c. 75, entitled “An Act to provide for Public Elementary Education in
                    England and Wales,” it was ordered that “there shall be provided for every
                    school district a sufficient amount of accommodation in public elementary
                    schools available for all the children resident in such district, for whose
                    elementary education efficient and suitable provision is not otherwise made.” It
                    was further enacted that all children attending these “public elementary
                    schools” whose parents were unable, from poverty, to pay anything towards their
                    education, shoüld be admitted free, the expenses so incurred, with all others
                    necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act, to be defrayed out of local
                    taxation. Finally, it was ordered that the whole administration of the new
                    system of public education should be placed under “school boards,” elected by
                    the suffrages of all tax-payers, including women, and invested with large
                    powers, among them that of compelling all parents, under severe penalties, to
                    give their children between the ages of five and thirteen the advantages of
                    education. The statute of 1870, proving more beneficial even than expected at
                    the outset, laid a firm basis for universal education.</p>
                <p>The gradual progress of public elementary education during the course of a
                    quarter of a century is shown in the following table, which gives the total
                    number of schools under Government inspection, the total number of children for

                    the schools, in every fifth scholastic year, ended August 31, from 1850 to 1870,
                    and for each year thereafter to 1876.</p>

                <p>While the charge for elementary education, under the Act of 1870, chiefly falls
                    upon local rates, there are at the same time large and continually increasing
                    parliamentary grants made, out of imperial funds, for promoting the education of
                    the masses. In 1863 the annual grants for examination and attendance of pupils
                    in elementary schools, under inspection in England and Wales, amounted to only
                    ^205; but they rose to &lt;£180,303 in 1864, to £376,367 in 1865, to £388,006 in
                    1866, to £429,885 iu 1867, and to £431,594 in 1868. Thus regularly advancing,
                    the grants came to over half a million in 1869, amounting then to £504,286, and
                    over a million in 1875, when they stood at £1,093,378. In 1876 the annual grants
                    for examination and attendance increased to £1,272,495, and in 1877 to
                    £1,415,333.</p>

                    fιom parliamentary returns issued in the session of 1874 that at that time, when
                    the school-board system had just began to take root, the great mass of the
                    pupils of elementary schools under inspection were in institutions belonging to
                    and under the control of the Church of England. The following tabular statement
                    gives the number of pupils present at examination in the elementary schools of
                    England and Wales controlled respectively by the Church of England, the Roman
                    Catholics, the school boards, and the British, Wesleyan, and all other schools,
                    in the years 1871 to 1873 :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Board Schools.—</hi> It will be seen that on the 31st of August
                    1872, the total number of schools under school boards was not more than 82, with
                    11,388 pupils present at inspection; and that a year later the number of schools
                    had risen to 520, and that of pupils to 91,262. After this time, with the
                    machinery established by the Act of 1870 getting more and more into working
                    order, and its chief feature, that of compulsion, being gradually applied, the
                    progress of elementary education became very rapid. At the end of August 1876,
                    there were 1604 schools under school boards in England and Wales, affording
                    accommodation to 556,150 pupils. The total number of school boards at the end of
                    August 1876 was 1790, of which 123 were in boroughs and 1667 in rural or
                    extra-municipal parishes. There were at the same date 99 boroughs, out of 223,
                    in England and Wales as yet without school boards; still these exceptions
                    included no place with over 50,000 inhabitants. On the 1st of April 1877 there
                    were 11,221,363 of the total population drawn within the clauses of the Act
                    enforcing the attendance of children at school, so that compulsory education had
                    become the law for about one-half of the population, and it might be calculated
                    that only a few more years would be required to include the whole.</p>
                <p>The total amount received by the school boards of England and Wales iu the year
                    ended August 31, 1876, was £2,695,644, of which £1,178,946 came from local
                    rates, and £1,516,698 from loans, the latter raised for the erection of school
                    buildings, and other works of a permanent character. The total amount thus
                    borrowed amounted to £5,466,106 at the end of August 1876, the sum being raised
                    at 3⅛ per cent, annual interest by the Public Works Loan Commissioners, to be
                    repaid in the course of fifty years from local rates, the pressure upon which is
                    expected to become gradually less as the great work of compulsory education
                    advances towards its completion. The'average <pb break="no"

                    Wales was 1 87d. per pound sterling in the year 1874-75, and rose to 3 <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Adult Education. —</hi> Though as yet unaffected by the
                    introduction of the system of compulsory education, there is, nevertheless, a
                    vast progress of general instruction visible among the adult generation, as is
                    proved by the constantly growing numbers of persons able to sign their names to
                    the marriage registers. The annual numbers, carefully collected by the registrar
                    of births, deaths, and marriages, as among the most noteworthy tokens of the
                    educational condition of the people, show that while in the quinquennial period
                    1841-45 there were in England and Wales 32 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 per
                    cent, of men and 48 ’ 9 per cent, of women who signed the marriage registers
                    with “marks,” being unable to write, the proportion very steadily decreased from
                    period to period, and from year to year, till it had fallen in 1871-75 to 18 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 per cent, in the case of men, and to 25 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 per cent, in the case of women. Thus there was in
                    the thirty-five years from 1841 to 1875 a decrease of 15 ’ 5 per cent, in
                    illiterate men and of 25 ’ 6 per cent, in illiterate women.</p>
                <p>The proportion of males and females unable to write varies greatly in the several
                    counties of England and in Wales, as will be seen from the following table,
                    which gives the percentage of both sexes who signed the marriage registers with
                    “marks” in the year 1875, according to the 38th annual report of the
                    registrar-general, issued in 1877 :—</p>

                    1875, then all the men will be able to write in 38 years, and all the women in

                    of a fluctuating nature, was much less in proportion than the increase of

                <p>The small difference between the number of persons convicted and acquitted and
                    the total committed comprised those found to be and detained as insane.</p>
                <p>It will be seen from the preceding table that, while the total committals
                    decreased from 27,760 in 1841 to 16,078 in 1876, and the convictions from 20,280
                    in 1841 to 12,195 in 1876, the downward progress was not regular, but
                    intermittent, fall and rise following each other. Thus there were fewer
                    convictions in the year 1871 than in 1876. The fluctuations in crime and the
                    number of criminals must be referred to complicated causes, chief among them the
                    state of trade and commerce, which, according as they are either flourishing or
                    depressed, greatly influence the condition of welfare of the masses of the

                <p>The preceding tables show succinctly to what an extent the prisons of England and
                    Wales are filled by what may be called a criminal population, that is, one
                    living regularly by crime. It is a population not very young, nearly one-half of
                    the whole being between the ages of thirty and sixty, and not possessed of any
                    education worth the name,— 33 ’ 4 per cent., or just one-third of the whole,
                    being unable either to read or write, and 63 per cent, of the whole only able to
                    read, or to read and write imperfectly. Thus more than 96 per cent, of the
                    entire army of prisoners, male and female, belonged, so far as education went,
                    to the dregs of the population; while only a quite inappreciable fraction,
                    expressed by 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> l per cent., was that of a class
                    described as possessed of “superior instruction.”</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Pauperism.—</hi> There is, as might be expected, an intimate
                    connection between crime and pauperism. At the side of a fixed prison
                    population, steeped in crime, stands a regular workhouse population, sunk in
                    helpless, irretrievable poverty. If far more harmless than the criminal
                    population, the pauper population, on the other hand, is far more numerous,
                    varying between three quarters of a million and a million. The number of
                    paupers, like that of criminals, kept rising and falling, in alternate waves,
                    during the course of the last generation, under the probable influence of good
                    or bad harvests mainly, and the state of trade, with a general tendency to
                    increase within the first half of the period, and to decrease within the second
                    half. The total number of paupers in the United Kingdom, embracing both those
                    kept in workhouses and those receiving public charity out of doors, was
                    1,022,540 in 1846, of whom 910,561 were in England and Wales, 69,432 in
                    Scotland, and 42,547 in Ireland. At the end of thirty years, in 1876, the total
                    number of paupers in the United Kingdom had fallen to 906,983, of whom 728,350
                    were in England and Wales, 100,105 in Scotland, and 78,528 in Ireland. Thus the
                    aggregate decrease within the period was solely due to a decline of pauperism in
                    England, there being an increase of 30,673 paupers in Scotland, and of 35,981 in
                    Ireland.</p>
                <p>The following table gives the number of paupers, distinguishing “in-door,” within
                    workhouses, and “outdoor,” receiving public relief, in England and Wales, for
                    every fifth year from 1851 to 1871, and each year thereafter to 1877, on the
                    first day of January in every year :—</p>

                <p>There were 590 workhouses and “unions” for the relief of paupers in England and
                    Wales on the 1st of January 1849, and the number gradually rose till it reached
                    655 in 1864, from which time it remained stationary till 1869, when there was an
                    amalgamation of several poor-law unions. There were 650 workhouses and unions on
                    the 1st of January 1877.</p>
                <p>The paupers of 1877 comprised 92,806 returned as “able-bodied,” of which number
                    18,993 received in-door, and 73,813 out-door relief. Of the remaining paupers,
                    635,544 innumber, 138,198 received in-door, and 497,346 out-door relief.
                    Two-thirds of all the paupers were sane adults, the other third comprising
                    children under sixteen years of age, lunatics, and idiots. Among the adult
                    in-door paupers of 1877, the men formed the majority, but the women were nearly
                    three times as numerous as the men among out-door paupers. Aged persons, or
                    widows, deserted wives, and “unmarried mothers” with their children, comprised
                    the great mass of these out-door paupers.</p>

                    to £7,692,169. The branches of expenditure for criminals in the year 1873, and

                <p>The average rate imposed by local taxation for the actual relief of the poor in
                    1873 was 5s. lid. in the pound per head of population for the whole of the
                    United Kingdom, while for England and Wales alone it was 6s. 7d. per head of

                    individual for the United Kingdom, while the share for England and Wales was 3s.

                <p>The enormous cost of pauperism, and consequent heavy burthen entailed upon
                    taxpayers—deemed the harder as being very unequally distributed, the poorest
                    parishes being the highest assessed—led to many recent legislative attempts to
                    effect a remedy. Under the Poor-Laλv Amendment Act of 4 and 5 Will. IV. c. 76,
                    passed in 1834, a somewhat complicated administrative machinery was formed for
                    the purpose, receiving the title of “Poor Law Commission;” but it was superseded
                    in 1847, by the statute 10 and 11 Vict. c. 109, which instituted the
                    “Commissioners for administering the Laws for the Relief of the Poor in England
                    and Wales.” An Act passed two years after, 12 and 13 Vict. c. 103, abolished
                    alike commissions and commissioners, establishing in their stead, a “a poor-law
                    board,” invested with extensive powers, its president having a seat in the
                    Cabinet. Although by the Act itself, and the institution of a new member of the
                    Government, it was sufficiently acknowledged that the question of pauperism had
                    become one of the most momentous of the day, aud although its working, under the
                    direction of a very able chief, gave general satisfaction, it was soon found
                    that it was faulty in many respects. It was particularly so in not recognizing
                    that the system of maintaining the poor, having been and remaining entirely
                    local, could not be dissevered from local government in general, and that the
                    necessary reform must be in this direction.</p>
                <p>The admission of this fact led to the passing of another statute, 34 and 35 Vict.
                    c. 70, which obtained the royal assent, August 14, 1871, known as the Local
                    Government Board Act. The Act ordered the establishment of a Local Government
                    Board, as a ministerial department, to undertake all the functions of the
                    Poor-Law Board, abolished henceforth, and, moreover, to superintend the
                    execution of all the laws relating to the public health, and to matters
                    connected with local government. The new Local Government Board began its
                    functions in March 1871, its president holding a seat in the Cabinet.</p>
                <p>Since its institution, the Local Government Board has published annual reports,
                    addressed to parliament, the sixth of which was issued at the end of the session
                    of 1877. Judging by this report, the action of the new system for superintending
                    the relief of the poor has been very successful, there being a considerable
                    decrease of the expenditure for the actual maintenance of paupers. But this was
                    effected entirely by savings in out-door relief. The respective charges for the
                    maintenance of paupers in workhouses and for out-door relief in 1871 and in 1876
                    were stated as follows in the report :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Poor-Law Administration.—</hi> According to the sixth annual
                    report of the Local Government Board, t⅛e expenditure for the in-door and
                    out-door maintenance of paupers formed little more than half the total cost set
                    down as being “for the relief of the poor.” Among the other branches of
                    expenditure were “salaries and rations of poor-lawofficers,” £943,000; “charges
                    for pauper lunatics in asylums,” £883,000; and a number of similar
                    disbursements, the total amounting to £3,042,830. It is admitted in the report
                    that, notwithstanding the strictest supervision, the local expenses of
                    administration continue increasing, while <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0264-0253"/> the direct cost of maintenance of the poor is
                    decreasing. Thus in 1871, when the actual maintenance of in-door and out door
                    paupers cost £893,600 more than in 1876, the extra branches of expenditure were
                    £357,000 less.</p>
                <p>There cannot be any reasonable doubt that the principal remedy of pauperism must
                    be sought in the general education of the poor. That this is already taking
                    effect, under the salutary working of the Compulsory Education Act of 1870,
                    there are many symptoms, ft is stated, in a report of the inspectors of the
                    London board schools, published at the end of 1877, that the order and
                    regularity strictly enforced in their schools not only affect the character of
                    the children, but that of the parents in the most destitute social condition,
                    including paupers receiving outdoor relief. “There are indications,” says the
                    report, “that the parents are beginning to feel the wholesome influence of the
                    schools. We are assured by teachers in the very lowest neighbourhood that there
                    is now much less active opposition to their efforts to improve the children than
                    formerly, and a marked diminution in the violent language and rough conduct
                    which were at one time the invariable accompaniments to a parent’s visit to the
                    school.” The education of their children, the report goes on to say, is
                    strikingly reflected in a “growing self-respect of the parents,” while all
                    things “point unmistakably to a great change for the better, which is being
                    slowly yet surely effected in the homes of the children through the influence of
                    board schools.”</p>
                <p>XIII. <hi rend="italic">Hospitalsand Charitable Institutions.</hi></p>
                <p>No country in the world is so rich in charitable institutions of every
                    description as England. The relations between the vast pauperism and the equally
                    vast flow of charity designed to remedy it have been keenly discussed; and while
                    many insist that the latter is simply an offspring of the former, there are
                    others no less confident in maintaining that the abundance of charity has given
                    rise to the very evil it was expected to cure. Probably the truth lies midway
                    between the conflicting arguments. If indigence gave rise to charity, the excess
                    of the latter could scarcely fail in its turn to beget improvidence, and, with
                    it, poverty. There can be little doubt that, in modern times at any rate, the
                    immense multiplication of charitable institutions has served to foster idleness
                    among the lower classes in large towns, and thus has swelled the ranks of
                    hereditary pauperism. Legislation has not remained ignorant of this fact, and
                    hence a large number of laws for regulating the uses and abuses of charity.</p>
                <p>The oldest of these regulations were made in the same reign which laid the
                    foundation of the poor-law, that of Elizabeth. By the Act of 43 Elizabeth c. 4,
                    passed in 1601, usually known as the Statute of Charitable Uses, a rather wide
                    definition was given of what was considered to be within the realm of charity.
                    It might be used, declared the Act, “for relief of aged, impotent, and poor
                    people; for maintenance of sick and maimed soldiers and mariners; for schools of
                    learning, free schools, and scholars in universities; for repair of bridges,
                    ports, havens, causeways, churches, sea-banks, and highways; for education and
                    preferment of orphans; for relief, stock, or maintenance of houses of
                    correction; for marriages of poor maids; forsup-portation, aid, and help of
                    young tradesmen, handicraftsmen, and persons decayed; for relief or redemption
                    of prisoners or captives; and for aid or ease of any poor inhabitants concerning
                    payments of fifteens, setting out of soldiers, and other taxes.” It is clear
                    from the wording of this statute that, at the time it was made, organized
                    charitable institutions were already numerous in England. In order that they
                    might be well managed, aud their funds employed for none but legitimate
                    purposes, the Act ordered that commissioners should be appointed by the lord
                    chancellor, four for each diocese, to act under the bishop, and “inquire by a
                    jury concerning charities.” It does not appear that much action was ever taken
                    under the statute, cumbrous in all its prescriptions, and it had fallen into
                    disuse before the middle of the last century, when it was gradually replaced by
                    other legislative enactments.</p>
                <p>No general record of charitable institutions is known to have existed until the
                    close of the 18th century, when the subject came to occupy the serious attention
                    of parliament. It manifested itself chiefly in the passing of a statute, 26 Geo.
                    III. c. 58, generally called the Gilbert Act, which gave orders “for procuring,
                    upon oath, returns of all charitable donations for the benefit of poor persons
                    in the several parishes in England.” The returns obtained under this Act were
                    examined and reported on by a committee of the House of Commons, which sat in
                    1786 and 1788, when it appeared that out of 13,000 parishes and townships in
                    England and Wales, only 14 had omitted reporting their charities. The aggregate
                    annual income of those reported upon amounted to £528,710, but it was generally
                    held that this sum was a gross understatement. Consequently, there was more
                    legislation, though at considerable intervals, on the subject of charities.
                    Under an Act of 52 George III. c. 102, passed in 1812, stringent regulations
                    were laid down for ascertaining the nature and income of all the charitable
                    institutions in England; but the Act was never properly enforced, and remained
                    to all intents and purposes a dead letter. More effective, although limited in
                    scope, was an Act of 58 George III. c. 91, passed in 1818, which ordered an
                    inquiry into the educational charities of England. It was this statute which
                    first instituted the “Charity Commissioners for England and Wales.”</p>
                <p>The actual functions of this board, in superintending all charities, and making
                    annual reports upon them to parliament, were defined by the Charitable Trusts
                    Act of 1853, to which amendments were passed in 1855, in 1860, and in 1869. By
                    these statutes, the “Charity Commissioners for England and Wales” are invested
                    with great powers, some of them distinctly judicial in their nature, and the
                    rest of an administrative character. They may compel the trustees and
                    administrators of all endowed charitable institutions to keep full accounts of
                    their receipts and disbursements, and to forward them every year; and they may
                    likewise order special inquiries into the circumstance of individual charities,
                    and enforce the production of all required information. Possessed of such
                    powers, the commissioners have been enabled to publish a number of valuable
                    annual reports, beginning with the year 1852, on the number and character of the
                    net-work of charitable institutions spread all over England, tending to
                    alleviate misery and to promote greater welfare, or at least designed to do so.
                    Still these reports are far from giving a complete picture of the vast extent of
                    organized charity, since the action of the Charity Commissioners does not
                    embrace any but endowed charities, and not all even of this class. Specially
                    exempted from the operations of the Charitable Trusts Act of 1853, and its
                    subsequent amendments, are the charities of the universities and their colleges,
                    those of Eton and Winchester, of the various cathedral foundations, of all
                    friendly and benefit societies, and of all institutions wholly maintained by
                    voluntary contributions. Among these and other exemptions fall a number of
                    charitable institutions as important of their kind as ancient in origin—the
                    Hospitals.</p>
                <p>There can be little doubt that hospitals were, if not the very oldest, at least
                    among the most ancient, of English charitable institutions. The earliest of
                    these establishments probably grew up in the time of the crusades, or soon
                    after, necessitated by the spread of new diseases, introduced by the knights and
                    their followers returning from the East <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n265/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0265-0254"/> How terrible were the ravages made by some of
                    these diseases, such as leprosy, is shown by the fact that there were counted in
                    France, in the year 1225, upwards of 2000 hospitals, going by the distinctive
                    name of “leprosoria.” England must have suffered, as well as France, from the
                    influx of the infectious maladies from the same source, although the English
                    crusaders were much less numerous, and many of them belonged to a better class.
                    Neither in France nor in England any trace is left of the “leprosoria” of the
                    13th century, all the existing hospitals being of more modern foundation.</p>
                <p>The most ancient in the list of English hospitals is that of St Bartholomew,
                    London, which had its origin in a priory of the same name, founded by Rahere, a
                    minstrel of King Henry IL, about the year 1100. A quarter of a century later,
                    Rahere obtained from the king the grant of a piece of waste ground, adjoining
                    the monastery, where he built and endowed a hospital “for a master, brethren,
                    and sisters, and for the entertainment of poor, diseased people till they get
                    well.” At the dissolution of the monasteries, in the reign of Henry VIII., St
                    Bartholomew contained 100 beds, with one physician and three surgeons. The
                    hospital was refounded, on a new basis, in 1544, and incorporated by charter in
                    1546. St Bartholomew, on account of its age no less than of the excellency of
                    its medical staff, continues to stand in the foremost rank of English hospitals,
                    as of the endowed charities of the country in general Its average annual income,
                    in recent years, amounted to about £40,000, derived mainly from rents and funded
                    property. In 1876 St Bartholomew’s Hospital had 5672 in-patients and 19,576
                    out-patients, together with 153,905 other patients attending for temporary
                    medical and surgical attendance, thus affording relief to 179,153 persons in the
                    course of the year.</p>
                <p>The management of the oldest of English hospitals was united, in 1782, with that
                    of four other charitable institutions of the same kind in London, namely,
                    Bethlehem, St Thomas’s, Christ’s Hospital, and Bridewell. The union was effected
                    under the Act 22 George III. c. 77, and from it the joined institutions were
                    called “the five royal hospitals,” their superintendence being placed under “the
                    pious care of the lord mayor of London.” Only three out of the “five royal
                    hospitals,” St Bartholomew, Bethlehem, and St Thomas, now remain institutions iu
                    the same sense, the other two, Christ’s Hospital and Bridewell, having been
                    diverted entirely from their orginal design. Bethlehem Hospital, like St
                    Bartholomew’s originally a priory, founded in 1247, under the name of St Mary of
                    Bethlehem, by Simon Fitz Mary, sheriff of London, was given, with all its
                    revenues, by Henry VIII. in 1547, to the city of London, as a hospital for
                    lunatics. With the exception of an institution of the kind previously founded in
                    Granada, Spain, it was the first lunatic hospital in Europe, and as such
                    acquired large fame, though for a long time not well deserved, the unhappy
                    inmates being treated more like caged animals than human sufferers. Bethlehem
                    Hospital had its first site in Bishopsgate Street, from which it was transferred
                    to Moorfields, in the city of London, in 1675, and finally to its present place,
                    St George’s Fields, Lambeth, in 1814. The income of Bethlehem Hospital in the
                    year 1876 amounted to £25,184. More wealthy than Bethlehem, and with revenues
                    equal to those of St Bartholomew, is the third of the “royal hospitals,” St
                    Thomas, likewise originally a priory, and converted into a hospital in 1553. The
                    old building, in Southwark, near London Bridge, was levelled to the ground in
                    1862, to make room for the South-Eastern Railway, when a new and larger edifice
                    was erected in Stangate, Lambeth, facing the Houses of Parliament, and opened in
                    1871. Of the two converted “royal hospitals,” the first, Christ’s Hospital,
                    Newgate Street, London, founded in 1553, is solely devoted to the education of
                    upwards of a thousand boys, out oi revenues of about £58,000 per annum; while
                    the second, Bridewell Hospital, has become an industrial school, its annual
                    income of nearly £15,000 being employed in the training of 150 boys and as many
                    girls, under a scheme settled in 1860 by the “Charily Commissioners of England
                    and Wales.”</p>
                <p>There are no official statistics regarding either the total number of hospitals
                    iu England, or their revenues, the great majority of these institutions being
                    maintained by voluntary contributions, and therefore, as previously mentioned,
                    by law exempt from the supervision of the Charity Commissioners. In a few
                    provincial towns, such as Salisbury, Cambridge, Bristol, Winchester, and York,
                    there are hospitals dating back to the first part of the 18th century, and with
                    more or less considerable revenues; but otherwise the metropolis is the chief
                    home of all these charitable institutions, both ou account of its wealth, and in
                    connexion with the study of medicine necessarily demanding centralization.
                    Besides the “royal hospitals” there are others, endowed and unendowed, possessed
                    of large revenues. Foremost among them stand Guy’s Hospital, Southwark, founded
                    in 1721, which has an annual income from investments of over £40,000, and
                    relieves 5000 in-patients and 85,000 out-patients iu the course of the year; and
                    the London Hospital, established in 1740, and supported mainly by voluntary
                    contributions, which maintains 6300 inpatients and 46,000 out-patients, at a
                    cost of £44,700 per annum. Among the other principal metropolitan hospitals are
                    that of Westminster, founded in 1719, with an annual income of £13,000 per
                    annum, relieving 2000 in-patients and 20,000 out-patients; St George’s, at Hyde
                    Park Corner, opened 1733, disbursing £28,000 a year for 4000 inpatients and
                    17,000 out-patients; and the Royal Free Hospital, Gray’s Inn Road, which spends
                    £22,000 in relieving annually 2000 in-patients and 26,000 out-patients. There
                    were altogether 115 hospitals in the metropolis at the end of 1877, of which
                    number 16 ranked as “general” hospitals, for the treatment of all diseases,
                    while the rest were devoted to special maladies or infirmities. To aid in the
                    maintenance of all these institutions, involving an aggregate expenditure of
                    over a million sterling per annum, there has been made, since 1873, in the
                    middle of June an annual collection in most of the churches and chapels of
                    London, known as that of the “hospital Sunday.” The collection produced over
                    £25,000 in June 1877, and not much less in the preceding years. The receipts of
                    1877 were distributed among seventy-six general and special hospitals, including
                    four medical institutions and forty-three dispensaries, the former receiving
                    £22,747, and the latter £2223. In addition to the “hospital Sunday” there was
                    started in the metropolis, in 1875, a “hospital Saturday” collection, made later
                    in the year, the object being to let the so-called working classes contribute to
                    institutions maintained almost exclusively for their own benefit; but the
                    receipts in 1876 and 1877 were comparatively small, with large expenses of
                    collection.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Endowed Charities.—</hi> While no authentic information exists
                    regarding the number and income of the charitable institutions maintained by
                    voluntary contributions, the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales have
                    issued from time to time, in their reports to parliament, accounts of the
                    financial state of the endowed charities placed under their control. Appended to
                    one of these reports, issued in June 1877, was a series of tabular summaries,
                    giving an account of the income, both from landed property and invested funds,
                    of all the endowed charities under the superintendence of the commissioners in
                    England and Wales. Of these the following is an abstract;—</p>

                <p>It will be seen from the preceding table that the endowment of the mass of the
                    charities is mainly in land. The total area of land belonging to the endowed
                    charities at the date of the report, June 1877, amounted to 524,311 acres, which
                    brought an annual rental of £1,443,177. Rent charges and fixed annual payments
                    for land produced a further sum of £115,073, bringing the total income from real
                    estate up to £1,558,250. The annual income from personalty in 1877 amounted to
                    £640,213, produced from £17,418,250 ot invested stock and £2,197,478 of other
                    investments. Calculated at the rate of 4 per cent, interest, the total revenue
                    of the endowed charities of England and Wales represented, in 1877, a capital of
                    close upon fifty - five millions sterling.</p>
                <p>Under the provisions of the Charitable Trusts Act of</p>
                <p>1853, the personalty of the endowed charities has to be gradually transferred to
                    the “Official Trustees of Charitable Funds,” consisting of two persons appointed
                    by the lord chancellor, who are invested with large powers both of transferment
                    and re-transferment. Under very slow but steady progress, the work has been
                    going on since the year</p>
                <p>1854, and according to the twenty-fourth annual report of the Charity
                    Commissioners, issued in 1877, the total sum of stocks and investments held by
                    the “Official Trustees” at the end of 1876 amounted to £7,177,942, after
                    deducting a sum of £837,430 as re-transferments.</p>
                <p>The vastness of the work of the Charity Commissioners and “Official Trustees” is
                    shown by the fact that the seven millions sterling standing in the names of the
                    latter at the end of the year 1876 were divided in no less than 8244 separate
                    accounts.</p>
                <p>The annual income of upwards of two millions sterling divided among the endowed
                    charitable institutions of England and Wales may be thus analysed as to origin
                    :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Educational Charities.—</hi> It will be seen from the preceding
                    statement that about one-third of the total annual income of endowed charities
                    of England and Wales is for purposes of education. The sum probably represents
                    but a fraction of the actual amount devoted to education, since the majority of
                    the institutions promoting it depend either wholly or in part upon voluntary
                    contributions, and very few of them are largely endowed. Among the more
                    important charities for educational purposes are the Society for Promoting
                    Christian Knowledge, founded in 1698, the income of which in 1876 was £52,851,
                    including legacies of £16,000; the National Society, established in 1811 under
                    which are 13,000 schools, which had an income of £26,931 in 1876; and Dulwich
                    College, founded by Edward Alleyn in 1619, and reorganized by Act of Parliament
                    in 1858, which has an annual income of over £16,000. As before mentioned, the
                    Euglish universities and colleges, as well as the schools of Eton and
                    Winchester, together with all cathedral foundations, are specially exempt from
                    the control of the Charity Commissioners, and no account is therefore given in
                    the annual reports of their revenues.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Asylums and Almshouses. —</hi> While one-third of the annual
                    income of the endowed charities is for educational purposes, one-fourth is for
                    the maintenance of asylums and almshouses<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n267/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0267-0256"/>. These charitable institutions are numerous all
                    over England, and many of them of ancient date, but the incomes of the majority
                    of them are very small. In the metropolis alone there are over 100 asylums and
                    almshouses, and the total number of them in England and Wales is considerably
                    more than 1000. Among the most notable of these institutions are the Charter
                    House of London, established in 1611, which has an annual income of .£25,000;
                    the almshouses of the Mercer’s Company, dating back to 1393, endowed to the same
                    amount; and Morden College, Blackheath, near Greenwich, founded 1695, with
                    revenues of over £10,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Distribution of Charities.—</hi> There is a curious
                    agglomeration of endowed charitable institutions in many parts and districts of
                    England. Thus the small town of Baldock, in Hertfordshire, has 17 charities; the
                    village of Banstead, Surrey, 21; and the city of Norwich, 28 different
                    charities, mostly of ancient date. Probably a sort of competition for becoming
                    founders of charitable institutions, with the names of the originators going
                    down to posterity, existed in these and many more small places for some period,
                    which led to their becoming rich in bequests, not always to the advan tage of
                    future generations, while other towns, some thickly inhabited, remained without
                    these foundations. It is stated by the Charity Commissioners for England and
                    Wales in their fourth annual report, published in 1877, that great reforms in
                    the still existing irregular distribution of charities, arising from endowments,
                    are urgently required. “The case of a parish,” says the report, “has been
                    brought to our notice, which is in possession of parochial charities to the
                    value of upwards of £800 a year, the population of which is at present 46, of
                    which number it is believed that only four or five sleep within the parish, and
                    not one of whom could properly come under the designation of poor.” It is
                    estimated that the total amount raised annually for charitable purposes in
                    England amounts to, if it does not exceed, ten millions sterling—a sum
                    strikingly indicative, in its abundance, as of national kindness, so of national
                    wealth.</p>
                <p>XIV. <hi rend="italic">Savings and Wealth of the Population.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Giving Alms no Charity</hi> was the title given by Defoe to a
                    pamphlet, published in 1704, in which he recommended the establishment of
                    savings banks as a remedy for pauperism, the cancer of which, he declared, was
                    only increased by charitable institutions. The imaginative author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi> thought it quite possible that parliament
                    might order the nation to be thrifty, passing Acts “which shall make drunkards
                    take care of wife and children, spendthrifts lay up for a wet day; make lazy
                    fellows diligent, and thoughtless, sottish men careful and provident.” A long
                    time elapsed before Defoe’s wish for savings banks was acted upon. In 1771
                    Francis Masères, a thoughtful philanthropist, carried a bill through the House
                    of Commons enabling rate-payers of parishes to establish savings banks; but the
                    bill was thrown out by the Lords, as revolutionary in its nature. Subsequently
                    there were several private efforts to effect the same end, which met, however,
                    with only trifling success. A savings bank for the poor, under the ill-chosen
                    name of “Benevolent Institution,” was established by the Rev. Joseph Smith at
                    Wendover, Buckinghamshire, in 1799, on the model of a Swiss “caisse de
                    domestiques,” and a similar one by Mrs Priscilla Wakefield at Tottenham, near
                    London, in 1804, the title of the latter being that of “Charitable Trust” But
                    these institutions met with no support from the people; and it was not before
                    the year 1817, when parliament took the subject in hand, and legislated upon it,
                    that savings banks took root in the country. The statute which effected it was
                    Act 57 George III. c. 105 and 130, which placed all the savings banks of England
                    and Wales under the control of the Government. In 1828 the Act was extended to
                    Ireland, and in 1835 to Scotland; but in neither of these divisions of the
                    United Kingdom had it to any degree the same effect as in England. For various
                    reasons, chief among them ordinary banking facilities, savings banks never
                    flourished greatly in Scotland, while the poverty of the country prevented them
                    flourishing in Ireland.</p>
                <p>The extension of savings banks in England, rather slow at first, became very
                    marked during the decennial period from 1830 to 1840, and at the end of the
                    latter year 552 of them had been established in the country, the total deposits
                    amounting to £21,036,190. Thenceforth the deposits rose steadily one million
                    every year until 1846, when there came a period of decrease till 1849, followed
                    by a further increase which lasted uninterruptedly till 1861. At the end of the
                    latter year, the total deposits in the savings banks of England and Wales had
                    risen to £36,855,508. The deposits in Scotland at the same date amounted to
                    £2,537,963, and in Ireland to £2,153,004.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the amount of deposits received and paid back by
                    trustees of the old savings banks, in England and in Wales, during every third
                    year from 1864 to 1876, together with the sum of the total capital at the end of
                    each year, the whole exclusive of the deposits in post-office savings banks

                <p>The facdιtιes of the people to place their savings securely and profitably were
                    greatly increased by the establishment of post-office savings banks, by which
                    the number of offices taking deposits was spread, as it had never before been,
                    all over the country. By Act 24 Vict. c. 14, passed in 1861, the
                    postmaster-general was empowered to direct all postmasters to receive deposits
                    of money, of not less than one shilling, for remittance to the central office at
                    St Martin’s-le-Grand, London, to be repaid on demand, with 2 J per cent,
                    interest per annum. The first of the new post-office savings banks were opened
                    throughout Great Britain on the 16th September 1861, and their progress since
                    that time is shown in the subjoined table, which gives the number of offices
                    open, the number of deposits, and the amount of deposits, in years and periods

                <p>The total number of both old and post-office savings banks open at the end of the
                    year 1876 was 5912, and the total number of depositors 3,195,761. At the 20th
                    November 1876 there were 1,493,401 accounts open with the old savings banks in
                    the United Kingdom, and the amount owing to depositors was £43,283,700, being an
                    average of nearly £29 for each depositor. The amount deposited in post-office
                    savings banks at the end of 1876, in the name of 1,702,374 depositors, was
                    £26,996,550, an average of £15, 17s. (see page 240).</p>
                <p>It appears from the detailed annual returns of the old savings banks, which,
                    notwithstanding the wide-spread competition of the post-office, still hold over
                    34 millions of savings of the lower classes, that these savings are made in very
                    unequal proportions throughout England and Wales. They are largest, as may be
                    expected, in Middlesex, where the deposits amounted at the end of 1876 to
                    £5,347,217; but Lancashire came very near it, with deposits of £5,302,982. The
                    county of York stood next, the deposits at the date amounting to £3,960,754;
                    while three more counties showed deposits of over a million, namely, Devonshire,
                    £1,950,303; Cheshire, £1,235,084; and Northumberland, £1,166,086. As a rule, the
                    manufacturing counties of England show a far larger amount of savings, per head
                    of population, than the purely agricultural counties, which may be sufficiently
                    explained by the lowness of wages in the latter. In two counties of England,
                    Huntingdonshire and Rutland, there were no savings banks of the old
                    establishment in 1876; and the same was the case in two counties of Wales,
                    Anglesey and Merionethshire. In Wales in general the savings are far below those
                    in England. There were in the old savings banks of Carnarvonshire only 702
                    depositors at the end of 1876, being one in 152 of the population. The
                    proportion at the same date for the whole of England and Wales was one depositor
                    in every 21 of the population, and for Wales alone one in every 37.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Assessments to Income Tax.—</hi> While the statistics of the
                    savings banks serve as valuable indications of the growth of habits of thrift
                    among the lower classes, they furnish little or no information of the progress
                    of national wealth. It is naturally impossible to measure this progress with any
                    approach to accuracy, but fair estimates towards it may be drawn from the income
                    tax returns. Originally instituted in 1799, to defray the expenses of the war
                    against France, the income tax was levied from that date till 1816, when it
                    ceased, the motion for its renewal having been defeated in the House of Commons
                    by a large majority. The tax was re-imposed in 1842, by Act 5 and 6 Vict. c. 35,
                    and renewed at intervals, but with constant changes in the amount taxed per
                    pound of income. In the first financial year of its being levied, ended April 5,
                    1843, the total annual value of property and profits assessed in England and
                    Wales was returned at £227,710,444; but the amount sank to £221,101,717 in 1844,
                    and £220,464,968 in 1845, while it reached again £227,863,132 in 1846. There was
                    a rapid increase, scarcely checked for a few years, at intervals from this date
                    for the next twenty years. In the financial year ending 1848, the total annual
                    value of property and profits assessed to the income tax in England and Wales
                    had risen to £229,868,226, in 1851 to £230,419,304, in 1854 to £256,333,899, in
                    1857 to £261,069,680, and in 1860 to £282,312,309. The increase from this time
                    up to the financial period ended April 5, 1875—the last year for which returns
                    have been published in January 1878—is shown in the subjoined table, which gives
                    the total annual value of property and profits assessed to income tax in England
                    and Wales, as well as in the U nited Kingdom, during each of the fifteen years
                    from 1861 to 1875</p>

                <p>Under the Act of 1842 which instituted the income tax, all incomes were ordered
                    to be taxed under five classes, or schedules, marked by the first five letters
                    of the alphabet. Schedule A was to comprise all incomes from ownership of lands,
                    tenements, and tithes; schedule B, all incomes from occupation of lands and
                    tenements; schedule C, all incomes from public dividends and annuities; schedule
                    D, all incomes from trades and professions; and finally, schedule E, all incomes
                    from Government offices and pensions. The annual value of each of these classes
                    increased in the fifteen years from 1861 to 1875, but in very unequal
                    proportions. The least increase was in the incomes under schedule B, arising
                    from the occupation of lands and tenements, not amounting to more than 25 per
                    cent, during the period, while there was but a slightly larger increase in the
                    incomes under schedule C and E, the former comprising dividends and annuities,
                    and the latter public salaries and pensions. On the other hand, the incomes
                    under schedule A., from ownership of lands, more than doubled in England and
                    Wales in the course of the fifteen years from 1861 to 1875; and the incomes
                    under schedule D, from trades and professions, were not far from trebling during
                    the same period.</p>
                <p>The following table exhibits the gradual rise in annual value of these two
                    classes of incomes in England and Wales during the fifteen years 1861 to 1875

                    aggregate of £266,942,347 for the United Kingdom, and leaving not far from
                    six-sevenths to the share of England and Wales.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Growth of National Income.—</hi> The income tax returns given
                    in the preceding tables furnish important materials for ascertaining, if only
                    approximately, the national income of England. They show, first of all, that it
                    is not only growing, but growing at an enormous rate. This is conclusively
                    proved by the returns of the aggregate annual value of the incomes assessed
                    under schedule D, comprising the gains derived from trades and professions,
                    including in the same the profits from such undertakings as mines, railways,
                    canals, and gas and water works. It is said, with truth, that these incomes
                    under schedule D are “the true gauge of the prosperity of the nation and if this
                    be admitted, the people of England are growing vastly in prosperity. In the
                    fifteen years from 1861 to 1875, the increase in the annual value of the incomes
                    of England and Wales taxed under schedule D was no less than £147,865,566, being
                    at the rate of £9,857,704 per aunum. In Scotland, during the same period, the
                    increase of incomes under schedule D was at the rate of £1,269,298 per annum,
                    and in Ireland at the rate of £353,135; while in the whole of the United Kingdom
                    it was at the rate of £11,480,138 per annum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Accumulated Wealth.—</hi> There have been many attempts made to
                    estimate the amount of capital, or of accumulated wealth, of the country in
                    recent times, and the rate at which it is increasing. One of the most recent, as
                    well as most valuable of these estimates, was contained in an elaborate paper by
                    Mr Robert Giffen, head of the statistical department of the Board of Trade, read
                    before the Statistical Society of London on the 15th of January 1878. Taking the
                    income tax returns, down to the year ended March 31, 1875, the latest for which
                    particulars were published, for the basis of his calculations, Mr Giffen arrived
                    at the conclusion that “the total capital of the people of the United Kingdom
                    may be reckoned at a minimum of 8500 millions sterling,” this being “the
                    capitalized value of the income derived from capital,” <hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi> r, in other words, the accumulated wealth of the nation.</p>
                <p>“It is a bewildering figure,” says Mr Giffen, “about eleven times the amount of
                    our national debt, which may thus be reckoned with all soberness as a lleabite.
                    Nearly 7500 millions out of this amount besides must be reckoned as
                    income-yielding, only the remaining 1000 millions being set down as the value of
                    movable property or the direct property of imperial or local authorities, which
                    does not yield any individual revenue. The suggestion may perhaps be made that
                    to some extent these are only figures in an account—that the capital outlay on
                    the soil, plant, machinery, factories, and houses of England, or on the
                    circulating capital of English industry, would not come to so much. But in reply
                    I would say that, while there is no evidence one way or the other as to what the
                    outlay has been, while we shall never know what it has cost from generation to
                    generation, to give us all this inheritance, there is some justification for
                    thinking that the values are stable and not transitory. They represent an estate
                    on which thirty-four millions of people have facilities for production and
                    distribution, which must be equal all in all to the facilities existing anywhere
                    else, because they are constantly tried in the furnace of free trade, and are
                    not sustained by any adventitious means. If certain properties have acquired
                    what is called a monopoly value, it is because actual workers are able to pay
                    the corresponding rent out of their first earnings, and have ample wages and
                    profit besides. In such matters the property of a great country, like a factory
                    or business, must be valued as that of a going concern, and the monopoly value
                    which certain things acquire only enters into the question of the distribution
                    of the estate and its income.”</p>
                <p>As regards the growth of capital in the course of the first three quarters of the
                    present century, Mr Giffen’s calculations showed that it had been going on at an
                    ever-increasing rate, the greatest increase taking place in the decennial period
                    from 1865 to 1875. The following table was published by him as an approximate
                    account of the capital and property existing in the United Kingdom,
                    distinguished as assessed and not assessed to income tax, in each of the years
                    1865 and 1875, given in millions of pounds, with the amount and percentage of
                    increase in the ten years :—</p>

                <p>In the concluding part of his paper, Mr Giffen entered upon the difficult task of
                    estimating the distribution of the increase of wealth both in the three
                    divisions of the United Kingdom and among classes, premising that “it would be
                    difficult to find sufficient details, owing to the large amounts of income which
                    are earned in one part of the country and pay income tax in another.</p>
                <p>“The great increase,” he goes on to say, “both in amount and per head of
                    population is undoubtedly in England, although the income tax returns show
                    clearly enough that both Ireland and Scotland now progress very rapidly. In
                    another aspect, viz., as to whether capital is being more diffused, or is
                    accumulating in fewer hands, I am afraid the data are not sufficiently good for
                    any sure conclusions. There are certain means for comparing the number of
                    assessments under Schedule D, at different amounts of income, which would appear
                    to show that the number of large incomes is increasing more quickly than the
                    increase of population or the increase of wealth. But the fact of the rich class
                    becoming a little more numerous, would not prove that, as a whole, the number of
                    people possessed of moderate capital, and the average amount they possessed, are
                    increasing or diminishing, while the increasing number of company assessments
                    under Schedule D makes the nùmber of assessments altogether useless for
                    comparison, as we have no information whatever respecting the number of
                    individual shareholders in the different companies, the average amount of each
                    individual interest, and the interests of the holders in Schedules A, B, and
                    C.”</p>
                <p>As regards the important question whether the accumulation of capital in recent
                    years, subsequently to 1875, marked by great depression of almost all branches
                    of trade and industry, Mr Gillen’s conclusions were that the process of growth
                    continued uninterruptedly. He expressed his conviction “that in no year is the
                    accumulation absolutely at an end, and that in many directions it is even more
                    active in dull years than it is at other times. We know, for instance, that the
                    capital outlay on railways is incessant; that during the last two or three years
                    of depression, and even now, the nation .is saving in railways very nearly as
                    much as the annual income of the capital invested in them. In agriculture again,
                    there is a constant annual reclamation of land in progress, besides an incessant
                    outlay on the older cultivated area.</p>
                <p>The truth is that, owing to the division of labour, there must be a vast
                    disorganization of industry, not a mere temporary falling off from a former
                    inflation, before accumulation can be wholly checked. A certain portion of the
                    community is told off’, as it were, to create the accumulations, and if the
                    accumulations were not made, we should see in the building trades, in railway
                    construction, in shipbuilding, and numerous other directions, a wide-spread
                    stoppage of works, and masses of unemployed labourers, far exceeding anything
                    witnessed even in those terrible times of depression which were frequent before
                    the free trade period, when industry was partially disorganized, and pauperism
                    assumed most threatening dimensions. In the absence of the effects which would
                    follow, we must assume that the cause is not present, that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n270/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0270-0259"/> there is no stoppage of accumulation; but that
                    accumulation, on the contrary, goes on at present in most directions at an
                    average annual rate, or at a rate greater than the average.</p>
                <p>Another eminent political economist and statistician, the late Mr Dudley Baxter,
                    who read a paper ou the “National Wealth of the United Kingdom” before the
                    Statistical Society of London on the 21st of January 1868, just ten years before
                    Mr Giffen, took a far less hopeful view than the latter about the constancy of
                    increase of the national wealth. He expressed Ins belief that, while “the income
                    of England is the largest of any nation, and shows wonderful good fortune and
                    prosperity, we must not forget that it rests on an unstable foundation. The turn
                    of trade, or obstinacy and shortsightedness in our working-classes, or a great
                    naval war, may drive us from the markets of the world, and bring down our
                    auxiliary as well as our productive industries.” Mr Dudley Baxter wound up his
                    conclusions with an eloquent warning. “England’s position,” he exclaimed, “is
                    not that of a great landed proprietor, with an assured revenue, and only subject
                    to occasional loss of crops, or hostile depredations. It is that of a great
                    merchant who, by immense skill and capital, has gained the front rank, and
                    developed an enormous commerce, but has to support an ever increasing host of
                    dependants. He has to encounter the risks of trade, and to face jealous rivals,
                    and can only depend on continued good judgment and fortune, with the help of
                    God, to maintain himself and his successors in the foremost place among the
                    nations of the world.”</p>
                <p>XV. <hi rend="italic">Government and Laws.</hi></p>
                <p>As England stands alone in the greatness of her wealth, the extent of her
                    commerce, and the vastness of her manufactures, so also does she hold a unique
                    place among nations as regards her government. Under the nominal form of an
                    hereditary monarchy, with restricted powers, the nation is actually governed by
                    two Houses of Parliament, whose laws, when assented to by the sovereign, form
                    the statutes of the realm. It has been already remarked in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Constitution and Constitutional Law</hi> that, in respect of
                    her government, “England differs conspicuously from most other countries. Her
                    constitution is to a large extent unwritten, using the word in much the same
                    sense as when we speak of unwritten law. Its rules can be found in no written
                    document, but depend, as so much of English law does, on precedent modified by a
                    constant process of interpretation/’ One of the most thoughtful of modem
                    political writers, the late Mr Walter Bagehot, sketched, in perhaps fewer wordβ
                    than any other, the nature of this unwritten and constantly modified
                    constitution in its most recent aspect. “The efficient secret of the English
                    constitution,” he says, “may be described as the close union, the nearly
                    complete fusion, of the executive and legislative powers. According to the
                    traditional theory, as it exists in all the books, the goodness of our
                    constitution consists in the entire separation of the legislative and executive
                    authorities; but in truth its merit consists in their singular approximation.
                    The connecting link is <hi rend="italic">the Cabinet.</hi> By that new word we
                    mean a committee of the legislative body selected to be the executive body. The
                    legislature has many committees, but this is its greatest. It uses for this, its
                    main committee, the men in whom it has most confidence. It does not, it is true,
                    choose them directly; but it is nearly omnipotent in choosing them indirectly.”
                    It is a striking illustration of the fact of the constitution of England being
                    “unwritten” that the Cabinet, though universally and undisputedly admitted to
                    represent the Government of the country, remains utterly unknown as such both to
                    the written law and the legislature. The names of the persons who compose the
                    Cabinet for the time being are never officially announced, nor arc there even
                    any official records of its meetings, or of the resolutions which may have been
                    come to at them by the members. Strangest of all, the Cabinet, virtually
                    nominated by the legislative body, and depending for its existence on a majority
                    of supporters in it, has never yet been formally recognized by any Act of
                    Parliament.</p>
                <p>Although the assumption of the executive by a committee of tlιe legislature is of
                    comparatively modern date, forming, as Lord Macaulay says, “the great English
                    revolution of the 17th century,” the supreme authority of parliament is of
                    ancient date, forming a part of the common law of the realm. “The power and
                    jurisdiction of parliament,” Sir Edward Coke laid down the rule, “is so
                    transcendent and absolute that it cannot be confined, either for causes, or
                    persons, within any bounds.” With equal emphasis, Sir ÂV illiam Blackstone added
                    that to parliament “that absolute despotic power, which must in all governments
                    reside somewhere, is entrusted by the constitution of these kingdoms.” In
                    constitutional fiction, parliament consists of three “estates of the realm,”
                    namely, first, the Lords Spiritual, secondly, the Lords Temporal, and thirdly,
                    the Commons; but the more modern form of division is that into two Houses,
                    described as the Upper and Lower, or that of the Lords and the Commons. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Parliament.)</hi> Strictly speaking, a member of the Upper
                    House is a parliamentary representative equally with one of the Lower House, but
                    in ordinary language, representing, as often it does, great facts, the title of
                    “member of parliament” is only given to members of the House of Commons.</p>
                <p>The Upper House, or House of Lords, consists of a varying number of members as
                    regards the representation of England, but fixed with respect to Scotland and
                    Ireland. In the official “Roll of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,” issued at
                    the commencement of the parliamentary session of 1878, the number of members of
                    the Upper House was returned at exactly 500, the list comprising 5 members of
                    the royal family, 2 archbishops, 21 dukes, 19 marquesses, 113 earls, 24
                    viscounts, 24 bishops, 248 barons, 1G Scottish representative peers, and 28
                    representative peers of Ireland. All the peers of England, as well as those
                    whose patent of peerage is for the United Kingdom, have seats and votes in the
                    House of Lords, but the peers of Scotland and Ireland are represented only by
                    delegates, those for Scotland being elected for every new parliament and those
                    for Ireland for life.</p>
                <p>The Government, through the sovereign, has an unrestricted power for creating new
                    peerages, which at times has been largely used for political purposes. During
                    the reigu of Queen Victoria, up to the end of 1877, there were created 151 new
                    peerages under various administrations. The 151 peers so created form at present
                    more than one-third of the House of Lords, deducting from its roll the spiritual
                    and representative members. Nearly three-fourths of the existing peerages have
                    been created since the accession of the House of Hanover.</p>
                <p>The actual functions of the House of Lords, as a branch of the legislature, are
                    riot very clearly defined; but it is generally assumed that it has a revising
                    faculty over all bills passed by the Commons, except those relating to the
                    public revenue and expenditure. As a rule, a very small number of peers take
                    part in the work of a session, and the extremely limited attendance is signified
                    by the rule that three membersare sufficient to form a quorum in the Upper
                    House, while there must be 40 in the Lower House. One of the reasons of
                    non-attendance of the members of the House of Lords in former times was their
                    special privilege of voting by proxy, which has now, however, fallen into
                    disuse. Most of the sittings of the Upper House are not only very short, but
                    irregular, the custom being to adjourn “during pleasure,” which means that the
                    lord chancellor, or the deputy speaker, may, in the exercise of his discretion,
                    two other peers being present, take his seat on the woolsack, and order business
                    to proceed at any hour during the day. Besides its legislative functions, the
                    House is invested with high judicial powers, forming the supreme court of appeal
                    in the realm.</p>

                    constantly on the increase, and tending to absorb all others, having proved the
                    most auspicious for Government.</p>
                <p>“Whatever may have been the circumstances,” says Dr Hearn, of Melbourne, in his
                    elaborate work on the government of England, “which led to the gradual formation
                    of parliamentary government, the cause of its continuance is clear. In practical
                    politics, as in every other art, the great test of excellence is success. But in
                    at least British communities, the success of parliamentary government does not
                    admit of doubt. As Edward I. found the supplies voted by the representatives of
                    his burgesses more profitable than the tollages at which he assessed their
                    constituents, so experience has shown to later sovereigns the great advantage to
                    their government of our modern system. Where in former times the only remedy for
                    misgovernment, real or supposed, was a change of dynasty, the evil is now
                    corrected at no greater cost than that of a ministerial crisis. Where in former
                    times serious evils were endured because the remedy was worse than the disease,
                    even trivial inconveniences now excite universal complaints, and meet with
                    speedy remedy.”</p>
                <p>Although politically omnipotent, the House of Commons cannot prolong its own
                    existence beyond seven years. The average duration of parliaments in the present
                    century has been three years and eight months, a term almost exactly coinciding
                    with the average duration of Cabinets within the period. The following table
                    gives the dates at which the parliaments of the United Kingdom—dating from the

                <p>The shortest-lived House of Commons was the third of the United Kingdom, which
                    existed only for four months and fifteen days, while the longest w as the
                    seventh, which sat six years one month and nine days, thus reaching nearly the
                    extreme limit of age set to parliament by the constitution of the realm.</p>
                <p>The constitution of the House of Commons, in its present state, as framed by the
                    Reform Bills of 1832 and 1867-68, is that of a body elected by nearly universal
                    suffrage, but in very unequal electoral divisions. Under the English Reform Act
                    of 1867, extended, with slight changes, to Scotland and Ireland in 1868, the
                    franchise was given to all householders in boroughs, and occupiers of lands or
                    houses rated at no less than &lt;£12 in counties, thus admitting to the right of
                    electing members of parliament the majority of the adult male population, with
                    the sole exception of the class of agricultural labourers. The elections, under
                    an Act passed in 1872, take place by secret vote and ballot. It appears from aιi
                    annual return made by order of the House of Commons that, at the end of June
                    1877, the total number of its constituents in England and Wales amounted to
                    2,377,761, while in Scotland at the same date the number was 302,313, and in
                    Ireland 231,265. The number of members returned, respectively, for the counties,
                    boroughs, and universities of each of the three divisions of the United Kingdom,
                    with the number of electors on the register, was as follows at the end of June
                    1877 :—</p>

                <p>It is stated in a recent parliamentary return that, if the allotment of members
                    of parliament to each of the three divisions of the United Kingdom were
                    regulated solely by population, on the basis of the last census, England and
                    Wales should have 493, Scotland 60, and Ireland 97 representatives; while if the
                    allotment were made according to contributions to the public revenue, England
                    and Wales should have 514, Scotland 79, and Ireland 57 members.</p>
                <p>It has become the most important function of the House of Commons in modern times
                    to appoint the Government for the time being, and, more immediately, those
                    leading members of the Government, headed by the prime minister, known as the
                    Cabinet. Far reaching as is the legislative authority of the elected
                    representatives of the nation, it naturally must stand in the background of this
                    higher power of choosing the rulers of the country, since the latter, leesides
                    guiding the executive, likewise are the more immediate framers of all the laws
                    that are passed. “The legislature,” says Mr Bagehot, in his already quoted work,
                    “chosen, in name, to make laws, in fact finds its principal business in making
                    and in keeping an executive.” It has come to be tacitly understood that the
                    leading statesman of the political party possessing a majority in the House of
                    Commons must fill the place of prime minister, officially styled first lord of
                    the treasury, while the other chief men of the party have a claim to become
                    members of the Cabinet.</p>
                <p>“The leading minister selected,” says Mr Bagehot, “has to choose his associates,
                    but he only chooses among a charmed circle. The position of most men in
                    parliament forbids their being invited to the Cabinet; the position of a few men
                    ensures their being invited. Between the compulsory list whom he must take, and
                    the impossible list whom he cannot take,, a prime minister’s independent choice
                    in the formation of a cabinet is not very large; it extends rather to the
                    division of cabinet offices than to the choice of cabinet ministers. Parliament
                    and the nation have pretty well settled who shall have the first places; but
                    they have not discriminated with the same accuracy which men shall have which
                    place. The highest patronage of a prime minister is, of course, a*considerable
                    power, though it is exercised under close and imperative restrictions, and it is
                    far less than it seems to be when stated in theory, or looked at from a
                    distance. The Cabinet, in a word, is a board of control chosen by the
                    legislature, out of persons whom it trusts and knows, to rule the nation.”</p>
                <p>There is no fixed number of members for the Cabinet, any more than of regular
                    meetings of the members admitted to it. In recent years the number of members
                    varied from eleven to sixteen, the former, the lowest ever attained, <pb

                    Disraeli, just previous to his elevation to the peerage under the title of earl
                    of Beaconsfield. All Cabinets yet formed included the following nine members of
                    the administration :—the prime minister, the lord chancellor, the lord president
                    of the council, the chancellor of the exchequer, and the secretaries of state
                    presiding over the departments of foreign affairs, war, India, the colonies, and
                    home affairs. To these nine members there are usually added various others, most
                    frequently the first lord of the Admiralty, the postmastergeneral, the chief
                    secretary for Ireland, and the president of the Board of Trade. (See also the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Cabinet.)</hi><hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> The
                    Cabinet does not constitute more than about onefourth part of the executive, or
                    what is generally called the Government. With every change of administration,
                    necessitated by the expressed will of the House of Commons, from forty to fifty
                    political heads of department have to quit their places, to make room formen
                    belonging to the party which can claim a parliamentary majority. Besides the
                    departments already mentioned, whose heads are generally, or sometimes, included
                    in the Cabinet, there are others of great importance, such as the Committee of
                    Council on Education, the Local Government Board, the Office of Works and Public
                    Buildings, and the various departments for the collection of the national
                    revenue, considered to form part of the Government, or, more correctly, the
                    administration. The chief officers of all these branches of the administration
                    change with the Cabinet, with the exception of the heads of the departments of
                    the customs, excise, stamps, and taxes, who hold permanent appointments. Subject
                    to political changes likewise are the great law officers of the crown, the lord
                    chancellor, attorneygeneral, sol ici tor-general, and judge-advocate-general of
                    England, the lord-advocate and solicitor-general of Scotland, and the lord
                    chancellor, attorney-general, and solicitorgeneral for Ireland. These, as all
                    the other members of the political administration, hold office “durante bene
                    placito,” instead of, as the administrators of the law, or judges, “quamdiu bene
                    se gesserint.”</p>
                <p>In closest contact with the constitution and government of England, and similar
                    to them in nearly every respect, are its laws and their administration. Unlike
                    most other countries, England has no code of laws; nor would codification be
                    easily possible, seeing that the principles which govern the national
                    jurisprudence are, like those which lie at the basis of the constitution, as
                    much “unwritten,” as “written.” Broadly, the whole body of laws may be divided
                    into two classes, namely, first, those springing from immemorial usage,
                    sanctified by judicial decisions, and, secondly, those springing from
                    parliamentary enactments. The former, in their nature, take far deeper root in
                    the national life than in the latter. This is expressed by the fact that there
                    were law exponents, or judges, long before there were law-makers, or
                    legislators. The most ancient of English courts, that of King’s or Queen’s
                    Bench—in its correct legal title, “the Court of the King before the King
                    himself,” <hi rend="italic">coram</hi><hi rend="italic">ipso rege—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">-was</hi> far older than parliament itself, for it can be traced
                    back clearly, both in character and the essence of its jurisdiction, to the
                    reign of King Alfred. Not much less ancient thau “the Court of the King before
                    the King” was the Court of Chancery, which acted for ages as the fountain of
                    justice, the <hi rend="italic">offi,cina justitice,</hi> forming the origin of
                    the courts of common law. The independence of the Courts of King’s Bench and of
                    Chancery was destroyed by the Judicature Act of 1871, exactly 1000 years after
                    the accession of Alfred.</p>
                <p>’ 1he Judicature Act of 1871, amended and enlarged in 1873, and in operation from
                    the 1st of November 1875, made very important alterations in the administration
                    of justice in England. By its provisions, aiming centrally at a fusion of the
                    judicature for the better distribution of judicial force, there was formed a
                    single court, called the “High Court,” divided into five departments, called
                    respectively the Queen’s Bench, the Chancery, the Common Pleas, the Exchequer,
                    and the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty divisions. It is in these divisions that
                    is vested the administration of the law, while the “High Court,” or, more fully,
                    the “High Court of Justice,” as such, can scarcely be said to have any
                    existence. It is, as one of the judges described it soon after the passing of
                    the Judicature Act, an <hi rend="italic">eηs</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >rationis,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> that is, it exists only in theory, or in
                    contemplation of law.</p>
                <p>At the head of the judicial administration of the kingdom, as at present
                    constituted, stands the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, a political
                    officer changing with the Cabinet, presiding over the supreme Court of
                    Judicature, and forming part also of the judicial committee of the Privy
                    Council, sitting as a court of appeal. There are annually about 100 cases heard
                    and determined before the judicial committee of the Privy Council, and seldom
                    less than 300 cases “remaining for hearing” or in arrears, the number tending to
                    increase. All the judges of the divisions of the High Court form part of the
                    judicial committee of the Privy Council, which has besides four special paid
                    judges. President of the first of the five divisions of the High Court of
                    Justice, the Queen’s Bench, is the lord chief justice of England, under whom are
                    four “puisne justices,” while the second division, the Chancery, is presided
                    over by the Master of the Rolls, who has at his side three vice-chancellors
                    administering law in the vice-chancellor’s courts. Within the Chancery division
                    are the great seal patent office, and office of the commissioners of patents for
                    inventions, the designs registry, and the trade marks registry. In the third <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ι</hi> of the divisions of the High Court, the Common Pleas,
                    the president has the title of lord chief justice, and in the fourth, the
                    Exchequer, that of lord chief baron, the former having under him four “puisne
                    justices,” and the latter four “puisne barons.” Finally, in the fifth division,
                    that of Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty cases, there is one president and one
                    judge, with an admiralty advocate, queen’s proctor, and an admiralty proctor.
                    (See also <hi rend="smallcaps">Court,</hi> vol. vi., p. 516.)</p>
                <p>Besides the great courts of law, which, like the foregoing, have jurisdiction all
                    over the kingdom, there are a number of courts exercising local jurisdiction
                    within counties, boroughs, and other defined districts. Foremost among the
                    courts of local jurisdiction are those of assize. The great inconvenience of
                    resort by suitors from distant parts to the seat of the central courts of law
                    led, from a very early period, to the appointment of justices “in eyre,” or
                    itinerant judges, authorized to hear civil and criminal causes within a
                    prescribed circuit.</p>
                <p>These circuits of assize, altered at various times, are at present seven in
                    number, denominated respectively the South-Eastern or Home, the Midland, the
                    Northern, the Oxford, the Western, the North Wales and Chester, and the South
                    Wales circuits. The South-Eastern or Home circuit embraces the counties of
                    Herts, Essex, Hunts, Cambridge, Suffolk, Norfolk, Kent, Sussex, and Surrey, the
                    assizes being held at Hertford, Chelmsford, Huntingdon, Cambridge, Ipswich, Bury
                    St Edmunds, Norwich, Maidstone, Lewes, and Kingston; the Midland, the counties
                    of Bedford, Bucks, Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Notts, Northampton, Rutland, and
                    Warwick, with assizes at Bedford, Aylesbury, Derby, Leicester, Lincoln,
                    Nottingham, Northampton, Oakham, and Warwick; the Northern, the counties of

                    Reading, Oxford, Worcester, Stafford, Shrewsbury, Hereford, Monmouth, and
                    Gloucester; and the Western circuit, the counties of Hants, Wilts, Dorset,
                    Devon, Cornwall, and Somerset, with assizes at Winchester, Devizes, Dorchester,
                    Exeter, Bodmin, and Taunton. The North Wales and Chester circuit extends over
                    Montgomery, Merioneth, Carnarvon, Anglesey, Denbigh, Flint, and Cheshire,
                    assizes being held at Welshpool, Dolgelly, Carnarvon, Beaumaris, Ruthin, Mold,
                    and Chester; the South Wales Circuit embraces Pembroke, Cardigan, Carmarthen,
                    Glamorgan, Brecon, and Radnor, with assizes at Haverfordwest, Cardigan,
                    Carmarthen, Swansei, Brecon, and Presteign. In every circuit there are at least
                    two assizes held every year, mostly in spring and summer; but in the more
                    populous circuits there are also ιvinter assizes. The appointments of the judges
                    for the various assizes are made out in the Chancery division of the High Court
                    of Justice, the custom being to let the selection take place by mutual agreement
                    among the members of the judicial bench.</p>
                <p>Among the other local courts of jurisdiction deserving notice are the Central
                    Criminal Court of London, the Middlesex Sessions, and the Surrey Sessions. The
                    Central Criminal Court, sitting at the Old Bailey, tries, as indicated by its
                    name, only criminal cases, the sessions, presided over by a judge, taking place
                    once every month throughout the year Different in organization from the* Central
                    Criminal Court are the two metropolitan law courts, going by the names of the
                    Middlesex Sessions and the Surrey Sessions. These courts, instituted, not only
                    for the trial of prisoners, but for various administrative purposes, such as the
                    licensing of public-houses, and the inspection of weights and measures, are
                    composed of county justices, or, as they are commonly called, magistrates,
                    presided over by a chairman and assistant judge. Similar in constitution to the
                    Middlesex and Surrey Sessions are the general and quarter sessions of other
                    counties. They are held in the first week after March 31, June 24, October 11,
                    and December 28, it being left to the decision of the county justices composing
                    them to fix the exact date when they are to commence, with liberty to make such
                    changes as shall not interfere with the holding of the assizes. The county
                    justices, assembled in general and quarter sessions, have jurisdiction in civil
                    and criminal actions, except, as regards the latter, cases of treason, perjury,
                    and other heavy crimes.</p>
                <p>By the Municipal Corporation Act of 5 and 6 William IV. cap. 76, cities and
                    boroughs in England and Wales may have a system of magisterial judicature
                    similar to that of counties. The ordinary duties of county justices, out of
                    sessions, are performed for most cities and boroughs by their mayors or other
                    magistrates. By the same Act, courts of quarter sessions may also be granted to
                    cities and boroughs. The sole judges of such courts are recorders, empowered to
                    take cognizance of offences in the same man-mer as courts of quarter sessions in
                    counties, but with a jurisdiction to levy county rates and to grant licences, or
                    to exercise any of the other powers vested in town councils. The recorder, who
                    must be a barrister of not less than five years’ standing, has to hold his court
                    quarterly, or, if necessary, more frequently; and should there be an unusually
                    large number of cases to be tried, he may, with the sanction of the town
                    council, form a second court, under the presidency of an “assistant barrister,”
                    approved of by the Secretary of State for the Home Department</p>
                <p>It was long the opinion of writers on jurisprudence, foreign and English, as well
                    as of the public in general, that one of the most manifest advantages of English
                    law was in its general adoption of trial by jury. In recent times, however, a
                    growing tendency has been manifested to trust, at least in civil cases, more to
                    the administration of the law by judges than by juries. This tendency is
                    strikingly shown in the most important juridical statutes passed lately, the
                    Judicature Acts already referred to. There can be no doubt that on this subject
                    the legislature expresses but public opinion, and that what is ordered by
                    parliament in respect to changes in the administration of the English law is
                    done by the will of the nation. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. ma.)</hi><hi

                <p>PART II.—HISTORY.</p>
                <p><hi> ENGLAND</hi>, the land of the Angles or English, is, according to its
                    etymology, the distinctive name of that part of Britain in which, by reason of
                    the Teutonic conquests in the fifth and sixth centuries, the Teutonic race and
                    speech became dominant. The name is in itself equally applicable to the older
                    home of the Angles in Germany; but, though cognate forms, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Angeln,</hi> are to be found there, the exact forms <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anglia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">England</hi> do not seem to have beeniu use.
                    As applied to later settlements of Englishmen, settlements made by men starting
                    from Britain, it is used with direct and conscious reference to the elder
                    England. New England implies Old England. The name is thus etymologically
                    applicable to English settlements anywhere; historically it belongs to the great
                    English settlement in Britain. And, in its use for many ages past, it has not
                    taken in the whole of that part of Britain which is historically English. Part
                    of northern England was at an early time detached from the English kingdom to
                    form part of Scotland. And again, from the part of England so detached, the
                    English tongue, and much of English blood, has further spread over part of the
                    proper Scotland. In modern usage then England means somewhat less than the land
                    which is marked out by its strict etymology. It does not mean the whole of the
                    Teutonic part of Britain, but only that part of it which has formed the kingdom
                    of England since the present line between England and Scotland was drawn. But in
                    any case it should be remembered that the name is a purely political nuiie.
                    Britain is a certain part of the earth’s surface, with unchangeable physical
                    boundaries. England, Scotland, Wales, are political names of parts of Britain,
                    which have had different meanings at different times, according as the part of
                    Britain to which they have been applied lias been larger or smaller. It is also
                    to be remembered that these political names are comparatively modern. England,
                    for instance, is not heard of by that name till late in the tenth century. In
                    fact it hardly could have been a formal title, used in the country itself, till
                    the many English settlements in Britain had become one kingdom. It is not, as we
                    shall see, the oldest name for the Teutonic part of Britain. But as the various
                    English kingdoms were fused into one, England became and remained the name of
                    that one. England then is that part of Britain which came and remained under the
                    direct rule of the king of the English. It thus excludes Scotland, meaning by
                    Scotland, as by England, a greater and a smaller space at different times. It
                    also in strictness excludes Wales. Legal phraseology is not quite consistent on
                    this head; but the more accurate description of South Britain is “England and
                    Wales,” rather than “England” only. Wales, first under its own princes, then
                    under the English kings, was long a dependency of England rather than a part of
                    England; and its complete political incorporation with England has not
                    altogether destroyed its separate character.</p>
                <p>England then is the name which certain historical events caused to be applied to
                    a part of the isle of Britain. The history of England therefore strictly begins
                    with the beginning of those events which caused part of Britain to become
                    England. The history of England has no concern with the earlier history of
                    Britain, except so far as is needed to make the working of those causes
                    intelligible. Nor need it dwell on the earlier history of the English before
                    they came into Britain further than is needed for the same end. The history of
                    England begins when the English first settled in Britain. But, in order to
                    understand this settlement, some account must be given of the earlier condition
                    both of the settlers themselves and of the land in which they settled.</p>
                <p>Britain in the fifth century, the time of the settlement which gave to so large a
                    part of the island the name of England, was in a state unlike any other part of
                    the world. The greater part of the island, all that is now called England and
                    Wales, with a considerable part of what is now called Scotland, had formed a
                    Roman province, but had been cut off from the empire by the act of the imperial
                    power itself. As the Roman legions had been a hundred and thirty years earlier
                    withdrawn from Dacia by Aurelian, so they were in the early years of the fifth
                    century withdrawn from Britain by Honorius. The Teutonic invaders therefore
                    found in Britain, what they did not find in Gaul or Spain, an independent
                    people, who doubtless kept many memories and fruits of their long subjection to
                    Rome, but who had ceased to be actual Roman subjects. The people whom the
                    English found in the possession of this, restored and somewhat precarious
                    independence were the Celtic people of the Britons. It is not here needful to
                    determine certain curious points of controversy, how far the purely Celtic
                    character of the inhabitants of Britain had been modified by intermixture,
                    either with races earlier than their own settlement or with Teutonic or other
                    settlers during the time of Roman dominion. All the probabilities of the case
                    would certainly go against the belief that the Celts found the isle of Britain
                    wholly uninhabited. That they were the first Aryan settlers there can be no
                    reasonable doubt; but, even in the absence of any kind of evidence, we should
                    expect that the first Aryan settlers would, in Britain as elsewhere, find
                    earlier non-Aryan settlers in possession of the land. One set of inquirers have
                    made it highly probable that the cromlechs and other primaeval remains, which
                    used to be vaguely called Druidical, are really the works of a race of
                    inhabitants earlier than the Celts. Another set of inquirers have, from the
                    physiological point of view, brought plausible arguments to show, not only that
                    such an earlier non-Aryan population existed, but that it actually forms a
                    perceptible element in the present population of South Britain. It has been
                    argued that a large part of the population of the border shires of England and
                    Wales is in truth neither English nor British, but comes of a non-Aryan stock
                    akin to the Basques of Gaul and Spain. So, on the other hand, it has been argued
                    that a part of the eastern coast of Britain had received Teutonic inhabitants
                    earlier than the conquest of Britain by the Romans. It has been argued too, and
                    in this case argued with undoubted certainty, that, under the Roman occupation,
                    soldiers and other subjects and allies of the empire of various races, the
                    Teutonic race among others, settled in the Roman province of Britain, and helped
                    to form a part of its inhabitants. But, if all these doctrines are admitted in
                    their fullest extent, they in no way affect the political history of England.
                    They simply prove that the British people whom the English found in possession
                    of the isle of Britain had, like all other nations in all other times and
                    places, had the purity of their blood more or less affected by foreign
                    intermixture. They in nowise affect the fact that the English invaders found in
                    this island a people who, for all practical and historical purposes, must be
                    looked upon as Celtic, a people in whom the dominant blood, and the dominant
                    national being, was undoubtedly Celtic. In the eye of general history they must
                    be looked on, as they were in the eyes of their English conquerors themselves,
                    as Britons. They were Britons, modified no doubt in every respect by their long
                    subjection to Rome, but stili essentially a British, that is, a Celtic people.
                    And it is further clear <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0275-0264"/> that they were a people who had been less
                    modified by Roman influences than the inhabitants of the other provinces of the
                    empire. This is shown by the fact that the ancient British language survived the
                    Roman Conquest, and still remains the language of a not inconsiderable part of
                    the isle of Britain. The mere fact of the existence of the Welsh language shows
                    that Roman influences could not have been so strong in Britain as they were in
                    Gaul and Spain. The military conquest and the political occupation were no doubt
                    as complete in Britain as in any other province of the Roman empire; but the
                    moral and social influence of Rome must have been less than it was elsewhere. In
                    Gauland Spain the inhabitants adopted the name, the feelings, and the speech of
                    Rome, and handed on their Roman speech to their Teutonic conquerors. The
                    difference between the phaenomena of Britain and the phaenomena of the
                    continental provinces is plain at a glance. The speech of Gaul and Spain at this
                    day is Latin; the exceptions are only where the earlier languages survive in
                    obscure corners. In the lands which formed the Roman province of Britain a Latin
                    speech is now nowhere spoken, nor is there any sign that a Latin speech has ever
                    been spoken as the popular language at any time since the withdrawal of the
                    Roman legions. The dominant tongue is that of the Teutonic conquerors; but part
                    of the island, a part somewhat more than a mere corner, keeps its ancient
                    British speech. The Roman tongue, dominant and more than dominant in Gaul and
                    Spain, has in Britain no place at all.</p>
                <p>Britain then, even if the Roman legions had not been deliberately withdrawn from
                    it, was, at the beginning of the fifth century, in quite another case from the
                    other provinces of the empire. Mere conquest had been as thorough as in any
                    other frontier province; for it must not be forgotten that Britain was
                    pre-eminently a frontier province. As the whole of Britain was never subdued,
                    the part which was subdued always remained, like the lands on the Rhine and the
                    Danube, exposed to the attacks of the still independent inhabitants of the
                    island. But the usual results of Roman conquest, social and national
                    assimilation, had been much less thorough than elsewhere even in the frontier
                    provinces. One main cause of this difference doubtless was the geographical
                    position of the country. A large island, an island large enough to have a
                    separate being of its own, is far harder to incorporate or assimilate than a
                    land which is geographically continuous with the ruling country. The history of
                    the greater Mediterranean islands proves this, and it is still more true of
                    great oceanic islands like our own. The British islands seem designed to form
                    one political whole; yet it has been found impossible to unite Ireland with
                    Great Britain in the same way in which the different parts of Great Britain have
                    been united with one another. Britain, the most distant and geographically the
                    most distinct of the provinces of Rome, was felt to be, and was constantly
                    spoken of as, another world. In all ages and among all changes of inhabitants,
                    the insular character of Britain has been one of the ruling facts of its
                    history. Its people, of whatever race or speech, whatever their political
                    condition at home or their political relation to other countries, have been
                    before all things pre-eminently islanders. This must be borne in mind through
                    the whole of British history. We are not dealing with Celts, Romans, Teutons,
                    simply as such, but with Celts, Romans, Teutons, modified by the fact that they
                    dwelled in a great island, which was cut off in many ways from the rest of the
                    world, and which acted in many things as a separate world of itself.</p>
                <p>The result of this insular position of Britain was shown in many things during
                    the time of the Roman dominion. It was remarked that no province of the empire
                    was so fertile in tyrants. That is to say, no part of the empire ' produced so
                    many of those military chiefs who, by the favour of their armies, sometimes it
                    would seem with the good will of the inhabitants of the provinces, set
                    themselves up as opposition emperors, in revolt against the acknowledged prince
                    who reigned in the Old or the New Rome, at Milan or at Ravenna. The position of
                    these tyrants must not be misunderstood, as if they at all consciously aimed at
                    the foundation of national kingdoms. Their object was not to lop off a province
                    from the empire, and to form it into an independent state. Their object was the
                    empire itself, the whole if they could get it; if not, as large a share of it as
                    their forces would allow them to hold. An emperor who ruled in Britain was
                    anxious, if he could, to rule also in Gaul, to rule also in Italy. But the
                    geographical necessities of the case stepped in, and often confined the emperors
                    who arose in Britain to a purely insular dominion. That dominion was more easily
                    won, and more easily kept as a practically distinct power, than the dominion of
                    any of the continental provinces. It was again doubtless due to the geographical
                    position of Britain that it was the one province of the West from which the
                    legionswere deliberately withdrawn. They were withdrawn from one world to
                    another. The Roman world, it seemed, might exist without the dominion of the
                    British world. The deliberate surrender of Gard or Spain or Africa would have
                    been quite another matter. Those lands had become in every sense members of the
                    Roman world, and the voluntary lopping off of any one of those members would
                    have been an act of suicide which no one would have dreamed of. With the great
                    island it was otherwise. While the other provinces were cut off from the empire
                    by open or disguised foreign invasion, Britain was voluntarily given up. It was
                    doubtless given up through fear of foreign invasion, through a feeling of
                    inability to withstand foreign invasion; but not as the direct result of foreign
                    invasion itself. We may believe that successive Teutonic inroads had so weakened
                    the Roman power in Britain that it was felt hopeless to attempt to keep the
                    province any longer. But the actual Teutonic conquerors of the island found the
                    Roman legions already gone. Britain was won by the English, not from Roman
                    legions or from Roman provincials, but from men who had been Roman provincials,
                    but who, on the withdrawal of the Roman legions, had changed into an independent
                    British people. It is however to be borne in mind that the independence in
                    possession of which the Britons were found by their English conquerors was an
                    independence which had been thrust upon them. No province of the empire
                    separated itself from the empire of its own free will. Britain would have had,
                    on every geographical and national ground, more temptation so to do than any
                    other province of the West. But Britain did not, any more than any other
                    province of the West, seek for independence of Rome. The forsaken people, left
                    to themselves, cried to their masters to come back to be their helpers; but the
                    groans of the Britons fell in vain on the ears of Aëtius. He could deliver Gaul
                    from the Hun; he felt no call to deliver Britain from the Pict or the Saxon. The
                    inhabitants of the Roman province of Britain were left to defend themselves how
                    they could, against the incursions alike of their neighbours in those parts of
                    their island whieh Rome had never subdued, and of the more dangerous Teutonic
                    invaders from beyond the sea. Thus forsaken by Rome, they seem to have tried to
                    keep up some shadow of a Roman dominion among themselves. Their chiefs bore
                    Roman titles; a tradition of imperial succession was kept up among the reputed
                    descendants of the tyrant Maximus. So the first British prince whom history or
                    legend brings into personal contact with the Teutonic invaders appears in the
                    earliest versions of the tale, not as a British king, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n276/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0276-0265"/> but as a Roman duke. Such is the title which
                    Vortigern bears in that one meagre yet authentic narrative of English conquest
                    which we have from the hand of British Gildas. But, however they might cling to
                    Roman shadows, the people whom the English found in this island were undoubtedly
                    in every practical sense a British nation, a revived British nation. And the
                    fact that the invaders had to deal with a nation, and not with mere provincials,
                    had, beyond all doubt, a most important effect on the progress and the nature of
                    their conquest.</p>
                <p>The land then in which the English conquerors settled, and the people whom they
                    found in possession of that land, were thus in a wholly different condition from
                    the lands in which the other Teutonic conquerors settled, and from the people
                    whom they found in those lands. Here was one cause which gave the English
                    conquest of Britain a wholly different character from the Teutonic conquest of
                    any other of the western provinces of the empire. The difference may in truth be
                    summed up in a word; it was not a conquest of one of the provinces of the
                    empire, but a conquest of a land which had once been a province of the empire.
                    And if the condition of the land and people that were to be conquered was thus
                    unlike that of any land and people elsewhere, the condition of those who were to
                    be its conquerors was at least as widely different from the condition of those
                    who were the conquerors of any of the continental provinces. A large part of the
                    difference lies in the difference between a continental and an insular land.
                    When an island is conquered by new settlers, it can only be by settlers from
                    beyond sea, and a settlement from beyond sea is likely to be in many things
                    different from a settlement which is made by land. This is part of the
                    difference, but it is far from all. Had the invaders of Britain been exactly the
                    same kind of people as the invaders of Gaul or Spain, had the people of Britain
                    been in exactly the same position as the people of Gaul or Spain, the mere fact
                    that it was made by sea would doubtless have given the conquest of Britain a
                    special character of its own. But the main difference lies deeper. As the people
                    of Britain were in a widely different position from the people of Gaul and
                    Spain, so the Teutonic conquerors of Britain were in a position at least as
                    different from the Teutonic conquerors of Gaul or Spain.</p>
                <p>The enemies by whom the inhabitants of the forsaken province were first attacked
                    were indeed neither men of another race nor invaders from beyond sea. The
                    immediate danger was from the Celtic inhabitants of those parts of the island
                    which the Romans had never subdued. The boundary of the Roman province had often
                    fluctuated, and the defence of the frontier had needed all the efforts of the
                    legions and the further protection of artificial bulwarks. A line of forts, a
                    massive dyke, a wall of stone strengthened by. towers, had been raised at
                    different times at two different points. The line of Hadrian marked the southern
                    limit from Solway to the mouth of the Tyne. The line of Antoninus took in a
                    larger territory as far as the firths of Clyde and Forth. Severus fell back to
                    the line of Hadrian. Under Valentinian the victories of the elder Theodosius
                    carried the recovered Roman land of Valentia beyond the line of Antoninus. In
                    the last moments of Roman dominion the boundary again fell back; the defences of
                    Hadrian and Severus were again strengthened, and took the form of that mighty
                    wall on the ruins of which we still gaze with wonder. But amid all these changes
                    there remained to the north of the Roman province an independent territory, of
                    greater or less extent, which the Roman confessed by his very defences that he
                    was unable to subdue. That its inhabitants, like the inhabitants of the
                    conquered part of the island, belonged to the Celtic race there can be no
                    reasonable doubt; but as to the exact degree of their kindred with the people of
                    southern Britain many questions have been raised. On the whole it seems most
                    likely that they belonged to the same branch of the Celtic race as the southern
                    Britons, and that they differed from them chiefly as the unsubdued part of any
                    race naturally differs ’ from the part which is brought into subjection. In the
                    later days of the Roman power in Britain, these northern tribes, under the name
                    of Picts, appear as dangerous invaders of the Roman province, invaders whose
                    inroads were sometimes pushed even into its southern regions. Along with them we
                    hear of the Scots, a name which as yet means only the people of Ireland. But
                    about this time the Scottish name was carried into Britain by a settlement of
                    Irish Scots on the north-western coast of the island, in the land known as
                    Argyle. The Picts of Britain, the Scots of Ireland, appear as the first enemies
                    whose attacks had to be endured by the forsaken inhabitants of the former Roman
                    province. But it was not the Picts or the Scots by whom the conquest of southern
                    Britain was to be made. A conquest at their hands could have had no other effect
                    than bringing the island back more or less thoroughly into that of the state in
                    which it had been before the Roman Conquest. Another fate was in store for the
                    greatest of European islands. The conquest of southern Britain was to be made,
                    but it was not to be made by any of the inhabitants of Britain. That great
                    event, one of the greatest in the history of Europe and of the world, was to be
                    the work of Teutonic settlers from beyond the sea.</p>
                <p>The Teutonic settlement in Britain must, in the general history of Europe, be
                    looked on as part of the great movement which drove so many of the Teutonic
                    nations westward and southward. It was part, in short, of the general wandering
                    of the nations. But it had in many respects a character of its own, which
                    distinguishes it in a marked way from the other western and southern settlements
                    of the Teutonic conquerors. We have already seen that the condition of Britain
                    and its inhabitants in the fifth century was widely different from the condition
                    of Gaul or Spain. The land had never been so thoroughly Romanized, and the Roman
                    legions had been withdrawn by a voluntary act of the Roman government. Here we
                    have one point of difference; we have also seen that there is another point of
                    difference in the mere fact that the invaders came by sea. But the difference in
                    the position and character of the invaders themselves was more important still.
                    The great mass of the Teutonic settlers who entered the empire by land had
                    already acquired some tinge of Roman cultivation. They already knew something of
                    the arts, the laws, and the religion of Rome; they served in the Roman armies;
                    they received grants of land within the Roman dominions as the reward of their
                    services. Their princes were proud to bear Roman titles of honour, military or
                    civil. The conquest was in many cases veiled under some form of decent
                    submission to the Roman power. The Teutonic chief, in truth a foreign invader,
                    did not scorn to give his occupation a show of legality by accepting some kind
                    of commission from the emperor. In short, in most of their continental
                    conquests, the Teutons were to the Romans, if conquerors, yet also disciples. In
                    most cases they had embraced Christianity before their final settlement on Roman
                    ground. Where this was not the case, their conversion speedily followed on their
                    settlement.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Vandals
                    and the East-Goths came to an end at a comparatively early stage of their
                    settlement, before they had assimilated with tho Romans. The more permanent
                    settlers, the West-Goths in Spain and the Lombards in Italy, gradually became
                    Catholic.</p></note> Where they came as Christians, but as Arian Christians,

                    speech of Rome, and were gradually lost among the mass of the Roman inhabitants.
                    These processes were quicker or slower according to circumstances. They were
                    quicker where the Goths in Spain or the Burgundians in Gaul were altogether
                    isolated and cut off from their old homes. They were slower where, as in the
                    case of the Franks, the settlements of the conquerors on Roman ground were
                    continuous with their former possessions in the unconquered Teutonic land. But
                    sooner or later, more or less completely, the same causes led to the same
                    results. Wherever the Teutons settled within the empire, they neither
                    exterminated nor assimilated the Roman inhabitants. They were in the end
                    assimilated by them, though, of course, in the process of such assimilation, the
                    Roman inhabitants themselves underwent a certain degree of modification, greater
                    or less, according to circumstances. Thus both France and Italy are Roman lands,
                    with a certain infused Teutonic element. But for the same reasons which made
                    assimilation in Gaul slower than in Italy, the infused Teutonic element is much
                    greater in France than it is in Italy.</p>
                <p>The case of the Teutonic tribes which settled in Britain was altogether
                    different. They came from lands which had been altogether untouched by the Roman
                    power, and where the arts, the language, and the religion of Rome were
                    altogether unknown. They had never been Roman subjects, Roman soldiers, or even
                    Roman allies. They had received no grants from Roman princes, nor had their
                    chiefs been honoured with Roman titles. They were, in short, altogether free
                    from Roman influences. They had no share in that reverence for Rome and all that
                    belonged to her that had so deep an effect on all who came within the range of
                    her magic power. They came not, like the conquerors of the continental
                    provinces, as disciples of a civilization which they revered, but simply as
                    destroyers of a civilization of which they knew nothing. The conquerors of the
                    continental provinces, themselves already half Romanized, settled in lands which
                    were still thoroughly Roman. The conquerors of Britain, themselves untouched by
                    the slightest Roman influence, settled in a land where Roman influences had
                    already begun to die out. From this wide difference in the circumstances both of
                    conquerors and the conquered, as compared with the circumstances of conqueror
                    and conquered in other countries, it followed that the English conquest of
                    Britain had a character altogether different from the Teutonic conquest of any
                    other Roman province. A people wholly ignorant of Roman culture, coming by sea,
                    and therefore utterly cut off from their own homes, were of themselves disposed
                    to act as destroyers in a way in which the Teutonic invaders elsewhere were not.
                    They were also, as it were, compelled to act as destroyers by the circumstances
                    of the land into which they entered. They met with an amount of resistance, of
                    steady national resistance, such as Goths, Franks, and Burgundians nowhere met
                    with. They had to win the land bit by bit by hard fighting; their advauce was
                    often checked by victories on the part of the Britons, or delayed by periods of
                    mere exhaustion and inaction. Their conquest thus took a character of
                    extermination, of complete displacement of one people by another, which was not
                    taken by the Teutonic conquests elsewhere. The English could not, like their
                    fellows on the continent, sit quietly down as the ruling order among a people
                    who for the most part easily submitted, and who therefore kept their lives,
                    their laws, their religion, and a share of their property. The determined
                    resistance of the Britons made it a struggle for life and deatlι on both sides.
                    On the one hand, it made death or personal slavery the only alternatives for the
                    conquered within the conquered territory. On the other hand, the gradual nature
                    of the conquest gave the conquered in one district every opportunity of escaping
                    into the districts which were still unconquered. There can be no reasonable
                    doubt that the English conquest, in those parts of Britain which were conquered
                    while the English still remained heathens, came as near to a conquest of
                    extermination, to a general killing or driving out of the earlier inhabitants,
                    as was possible in the nature of the case. A complete physical extermination,
                    the killing or driving out of every individual of a whole people, is a thing
                    which cannot take place, except in the case of some utterly helpless tribe
                    attacked by a people immeasurably superior to them in physical resources. Even
                    in such cases it commonly happens that the savage is not, strictly speaking,
                    exterminated by the civilized man; he rather dies out before him. Still less
                    could complete physical extinction take place with a people in the condition of
                    the Britons at the English landing. In the course of the English conquest we may
                    be sure that the alternative of death or flight was the ordinary rule; but we
                    may be equally sure that the rule had its exceptions. The women could be largely
                    spared; even men would sometimes be allowed to escape death at the price of
                    slavery. It might even happen that here and there someof the conquered might
                    make terms with the conquerors, and might be admitted to their fellowship. In
                    all these ways it follows that, physically and genealogically, there is a
                    British element in the English nation, even in the most strictly Teutonic parts
                    of England. No nation is of perfectly pure blood, and the English nation is no
                    exception to the rule. The point is that the British infusion was not large
                    enough to have any perceptible effect on the national being of England. The
                    smaller Celtic infusion was assimilated into the greater Teutonic mass. In the
                    sense of the physiologist or the genealogist, the English nation is not purely
                    Teutonic; but then in their sense no nation is purely anything. The point is
                    that the English people are as strictly Teutonic as the High-Germans are
                    Teutonic, or as the Britons themselve3 were Celtic. This or that Englishman may
                    conceivably have had British forefathers, as this or that High-German may
                    conceivably have had Slavonic forefathers, as this or that Briton may
                    conceivably have had Basque forefathers; but to speak of the Britons as the
                    forefathers of the English nation as a nation is as misleading as it would be to
                    speak of the Slaves as the forefathers of the German nation, or of the Basques
                    as the forefathers of the British nation. One nation displaced another; the
                    English displaced the Britons. One system of law, language, and religion gave
                    way to another system of law, language, and religion. The English swept away all
                    that was Roman or British from the soil of the land which they made English, as
                    thoroughly as the Saracens swept away all that was Roman from the soil of
                    Africa. Yet we may be quite certain that in both cases some slaves and renegades
                    here and there conformed to the new state of things. The only point is that they
                    were not in such numbers as to be of the slightest historical importance, not in
                    such numbers as to work any practical modification of the general mass in which
                    they lost themselves.</p>
                <p>A new people thus settled in the land, a people who displaced, as far as their
                    complete conquest reached, its earlier inhabitants. From each successive
                    district that was subdued all traces of the old state of things passed away,
                    except a few of the gigantic works of, Roman engineering skill. The old language
                    passed away; English displaced Welsh as the language of every district which the
                    English occupied. And the language of the conquerors, in thus displacing the
                    language of the conquered, was hardly at all modified by it; a few Welsh and a
                    very few Latin words were all that crept into English at this stage. The old
                    local nomenclature passed away, except in the case of a few great cities and a
                    few great natural objects. London on the Thames and Gloucester <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n278/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0278-0267"/> on the Severn keep their British names; but the
                    names of the vast mass of the towns and villages of England are purely English.
                    The only exceptions are in the districts which were won from the Briton at a
                    later stage of conquest, and in those districts which, through the working of
                    later events, came largely to exchange their English nomenclature for a Danish
                    one. But the English and the Danish nomenclature mark two successive waves of
                    Teutonic conquest; they make one whole as opposed to anything Roman or British.
                    The change of nomenclature shows how complete the change of occupants was; the
                    land was settled and divided afresh, and each place received a new name in the
                    language of tbe new settlers. The settlers brought with them their own
                    territorial and tribal divisions, their own laws or customs, their own religion.
                    No feature of primitive English law or custom can be shown with the slightest
                    probability to be derived from a Roman or British source. And nowhere, at this
                    stage, within the conquered districts did conquerors and conquered live on side
                    by side, each making use of its own law, as so largely happened in the Teutonic
                    conquests on the continent. That English territorial divisions often represent
                    the earlier divisions of the conquered people is far more likely. The territory
                    won by a particular battle would naturally auswer to the territory of the tribe
                    which was overthrown in that battle. And where earlier divisions were made
                    convenient by anything in the physical conformation of the country, the same
                    reason which had already fixed the boundary would lead the new settlers to fix
                    it again at the same points as before. But everything else passed away. Kent
                    alone, of the great divisions of south-eastern Britain, kept its name through
                    all conquests. But it passed on its name to a new race of Keutishmen, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cantwaru,</hi> alien in blood, speech, law, and faith to the
                    British <hi rend="italic">Cantii</hi> whom they displaced. That the new comers
                    were alien in faith is perhaps after all the greatest and most important point
                    of difference between the English conquest and the other Teutonic conquests. Of
                    all the Teutonic conquerors of lands which were or had been Roman, the English
                    alone entered the land as heathens and abode in it as heathens. The religious
                    history of Roman Britain is a most mysterious subject; but there can be no doubt
                    that there was an organized Christian church in tbe island at the time of the
                    English invasion. And, as far as we can see, it would seem that, at least within
                    the former Roman province, the profession of Christianity was universal; there
                    is no sign that aught of old British or Roman idolatry still lived on. On this
                    Christian land and this Christian people came the destroyingscourge of a heathen
                    conquest. Our one record of the time, the lament of Gildas, brings out this
                    feature in the strongest light. As afterwards, when the Christian English came
                    under the scourge of the heathen Dane, so now, when the Christian Briton came
                    under the scourge of the heathen English, the churches and clergy were the
                    foremost objects of the destroying fury-of the invaders. During the first
                    hundred and fifty years of English settlement in Britain, English conquest meant
                    heathen conquest; English rule meant heathen rule. Christianity, its ministers,
                    its professors, its temples, were thoroughly swept away before the inroad of
                    Teutonic heathendom.</p>
                <p>In all these ways then tbe English conquest of Britain stands apart by itself, as
                    something differing in all its main features from the common race of the
                    Teutonic conquests elsewhere. There are only two parts of Western Europe which
                    present phaenomena which are at all like those of our own island. These are
                    those parts of Germany which lie on the left bank of the Rhine and on the right
                    bank of the Danube. There, as in Britain, a land that w·as Roman ceased to be
                    Roman. The speech, the laws, and the manners of Germany displaced those of Rome.
                    Thus far tbe case of these lands resembles the case of Britain, and it unlike
                    the case of Italy, Spain, and the rest of Gaul. But their case differed in this,
                    that the Rhenish and Danubian lands lay adjoining to the unconquered Teutonic
                    lands; they were the lands which were specially exposed to Teutonic inroads. The
                    earliest inroads of the invaders would naturally be of a more devastating kind
                    than those which followed. It would largely be in the course of their earliest
                    inroads that they picked up that amount of Roman culture which made the second
                    stage of their inroads less devastating. And after all, the amount of havoc
                    could not have been equal to the amount of havoc which was done in Britain, as
                    most of the Roman cities lived through the storm and kept their Roman names. And
                    in the lands west of the Rhine, in those German lands which formed part of the
                    Roman province of Gaul, the Teutonic invaders were but winning back an old
                    Teutonic land. It is possible that some traces of Teutonic speech and feeling
                    may have still lingered on to make the progress of the invaders more easy. And
                    in these lands, above all, the Roman inhabitants had the fullest means of
                    withdrawing into the unsubdued part of the province. As long as the Teuton was a
                    mere destroyer, they would naturally seek shelter in the lands which were still
                    untouched. As soon as he became only a conqueror, and not a mere destroyer, they
                    would find it more to their interest to submit. In Britain it was not till a
                    much later stage, not till the greater part of his conquests were made, that the
                    Teutonic conqueror began to carry on his conquests in such a fashion as to make
                    it the interest of the conquered to submit rather than to flee.</p>
                <p>Such then was the general nature of the Teutonic conquest of the greater part of
                    Britain, the conquest which changed so great a part of Britain into England. It
                    was a destroying conquest which swept away the former inhabitants and their
                    whole political system. It was specially a heathen conquest, which utterly
                    rooted up Christianity from a land where it must have already taken deep root.
                    It was a gradual conquest, spread over several centuries, a conquest in which
                    the conquerors had to win each step by hard fighting against the earlier
                    inhabitants. Lastly, it was a conquest which never was completed, which never
                    spread over the whole island. Leaving for the present purely political questions
                    about homage and supremacy, it is plain that, there is a large part of Britain
                    which remained untouched by the English occupation, and where the ancient
                    inhabitants, their language, laws, and manners still lived on. And it may be
                    added that, in some districts to which English occupation did extend, in those
                    conquests namely which were the latest in date, the character of the conquest
                    greatly changed from what it had been in its earlier stages.</p>
                <p>It seemed well fully to set forth the nature of the conquest before giving any
                    detailed account of the former condition of the conquerors, or any direct
                    narrative of their conquest. Having cleared the ground from misconceptions, it
                    will be easier to tell the tale simply and clearly. The Teutonic conquerors of
                    Britain then were the Low-Dutch<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Scandinavia, the lands from the mouths of the Elbe and tbe Weser. Their dialects
                    form a branch of the Teutonic speech distinct from the High-Dutch dialects
                    spoken to the south of them. Their own speech must not be looked on as in any
                    sense a corruption of tbe High-Dutch, but as a perfectly independent and coequal
                    branch of the great Teutonic family, as old <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0279-0268"/> as the High-Dutch, perhaps older. These dialects,
                    which in their system of letter-changes agree with the ancient Gothic and the
                    Scandinavian rather than with the High-Dutch, form the natural speech of the
                    whole coast region stretching from Picardy to Denmark, and they have been
                    carried by conquest far to the east, along the Slavonic, Prussian, and Finnish
                    coasts of the Baltic. But their area has been encroached on in different parts
                    by French, by Danish, and by High-Dutch, so that that form of the Low-Dutch
                    which is spoken in the kingdom of the Netherlands, and which we now know
                    specially as <hi rend="italic">Dutch,</hi> is the only continental dialect of
                    the whole group which is commonly acknowledged as a national and literary
                    language. Among the tribes of this region, three stand out conspicuously in the
                    history of that conquest, the Angles, the Saxons, and the Jutes.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Angles and the Saxons are
                    plain enough; there is a certain degree of mystery about the Jutes, their name,
                    and their origin. But it is enough for our purpose that they were a third
                    Teutonic people, distinguishable from the Angles and Saxons.</p></note> Each had
                    its special and marked share in the work. The Jutes, in all likelihood, formed
                    the first permanent Teutonic settlement in Britain. The Saxons and the Angles
                    settled later; but each of them occupied a far larger part of the island than
                    the Jutes. And each of these last gave a name to the Teutonic settlements as a
                    whole. As soon as the Teutonic settlers were so <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> ∙
                    far united as to bear a common name, the received name on their own lips was <hi
                    rend="italic">English;</hi> on the lips of their Celtic neighbours and enemies
                    the received name was <hi rend="italic">Saxon.</hi></p>
                <p>The reason for this difference in nomenclature is plain. The Angles occupied a
                    greater share of the land than the Saxons; they therefore gave the national name
                    to the united people.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Engle, Angeleyn, Angli,</hi> are the usual names of the
                    united nation. <hi rend="italic">Angli-Sαxones, Angul·Seaxe,</hi> are sometimes
                    found, especially in the royal style of the tenth century. Those forms are
                    equivalent to <hi rend="italic">A ngli el Saxones,</hi> the nation formed by the
                    union of the Angles and Saxons. It is therefore the more correct description of
                    the two; but its employment in England is always formal; it clearly never passed
                    into general use. In foreign writers it is somewhat more common.</p></note> But
                    the Saxons were the first among the invaders with whom the Celtic or Roman
                    inhabitants of Britain had to deal; they therefore gave the Saxon name to the
                    invaders in general. This last fact at once brings us to the actual history of
                    the English conquest. If we cannot say that the English conquest itself began,
                    we may at least say that the first steps towards it were taken, as soon as any
                    Low-Dutch invaders from beyond sea first attempted a settlement by arms in
                    Roman, or once Roman, Britain. This process, it must be marked, stands wholly
                    apart from questions either as to the possible Teutonic origin of any of the
                    tribes whom the Romans found in Britain, or as to possible Teutonic settlements
                    in the province made with the sanction of the Roman authorities. This last
                    process undoubtedly happened in the case of soldiers of Teutonic race serving in
                    the Roman armies. But Teutonic settlements, either before the Roman occupation
                    or under the Roman occupation, are something wholly distinct from the Teutonic
                    conquest either of a Roman province or of a land forsaken by Rome. Such
                    settlements might make the Teutonic conquest more easy when it did come, but
                    that is all that they could do. Settlers of either of those classes became Roman
                    subjects, Roman provincials. The events which led to the Conquest began when men
                    of Teutonic race first settled or tried to settle in the island, not as Roman
                    soldiers or Roman - subjects, but as foreign invaders of the Roman land. This
                    work, which was not the English conquest, but which was the first step towards
                    it, the conquest which was merely attempted and not carried out, seems to have
                    begun in the second half of the fourth century. Claudian bears witness to the
                    naval victories of the elder Theodosius, the father of the renowned emperor of
                    that name, who (367 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> beat back a Saxon invasion
                    by sea. That is to say, an attempt at Teutonic settlement was then made: but
                    there was still strength in the Roman power to hinder it. Had it been otherwise,
                    the history of English conquest in Britain would have begun in the fourth
                    centuιy instead of in the fifth. Incursions undoubtedly went on; the
                    south-eastern coast of Britain, the part specially exposed to Saxon invasion,
                    got the name of the <hi rend="italic">Saxon Shore,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The <hi rend="italic">Limes Saxοnicus</hi> or

                    truly explained by Dr Guest. It means, not a shore occupied by Saxons, but a
                    boundary against Saxons. It answers to the Danish, Slavonic, and Spanish marches
                    of the later empire, except that in the one case the enemy was to be dreaded by
                    land, and in the other case by sea.</p></note> and a Roman officer with the
                    title of Count had that shore under his special keeping. But things took quite a
                    new turn after the withdrawal of the Roman legions from Britain. The land now
                    lay open to settlement in a way in which it had not done before. It is now
                    therefore that actual conquests, as distinguished from mere incursions and
                    attempted settlements, begin.</p>
                <p>Our materials for the history of this great event, an event which is nothing
                    short of the beginning of our national history, at first sight seem scanty. Our
                    only absolutely contemporary notice is to be found in two meagre entries in the
                    chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine, which however assert the main fact that
                    Britain was brought under the power of the Saxons about the middle of the fifth
                    century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Prosper has two
                    entries. The former says that “Hac tempestate (the time of Constantine the
                    Tyrant, 407—411) prae valitudine Romanorum, vires funditus attenuate
                    Britanniae.” The other says that, some time before the death of Aëtius in 454,
                    “Britanniae, usque ad hoc tempus variis cladibus eventibusque lacerate, in
                    ditionem Saxonum rediguntur.”</p></note> The native writer who is most nearly
                    contemporary, the Briton Gildas, belongs to the next century, and was a witness
                    of some stages, though not of the earliest, of the work of conquest. He is the
                    earliest writer who gives us anything that can be called a narrative, a
                    narrative meagre enough, but which helps us to some particular events and
                    personal names. About the same time Procopius, without any direct notice of the
                    conquest, speaks of Britain as a land inhabited by Angles and Frisians as well
                    as Britons. The series of English writers begins with Baeda, and goes on with
                    the English Chronicles, to which we may fairly add the fragments of ancient
                    English songs which lurk in the Latin of Henry of Huntingdon. Of these Baeda
                    himself did not write till more than two hundred years after the beginning of
                    the Conquest, and the materials for his short narrative of the Conquest itself
                    seems to come at least as much from British as from English sources. Our only
                    details are those which are preserved in the Chronicles and in Henry of
                    Huntingdon. The Chronicles in their present form do not date from an earlier
                    time than the reign of Aelfred in the ninth century; but any one who studies
                    them carefully will see that this part of the record contains far older
                    materials. The narrative is remarkably free from anything which has a legendary
                    sound. That its chronology may be largely arbitrary is possible; but that it is
                    so is of itself an arbitrary conjecture. The English at the time of their
                    landing were not wholly illiterate. They had their runic alphabet, and it is
                    perfectly possible that the entries in the Chronicles may come from an
                    absolutely contemporary record. Such a record, even if it marked the sequence of
                    years according to some reckoning of its own, must of course have been adapted
                    to the Christian reckoning by the compilers of the Chronicles, and in such a
                    process some errors of detail may well have crept in. But there seems no reason
                    to suspect invention, falsification, or even accidental error, on any great
                    scale. The narrative will bear testing; the entries fit in with all that can be
                    made out from an examination of the country. They fit in with the notices of the
                    Welsh writers, and with all such <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n280/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0280-0269"/> incidental sources of knowledge as we have. In
                    this way a narrative in considerable detail has been recovered by the care and
                    skill of Dr Guest. As for the notices in Henry of Huntingdon, which evidently
                    contain fragments of lost poems, we must remember that a contemporary poem may
                    be just as good an authority as a prose writing. Several poems are inserted in
                    the Chronicles themselves in undoubtedly historical times, in the tenth and
                    eleventh centuries. Other poems of those ages, sometimes, like the song of
                    Maldon, preserved in the original, sometimes, like the song of Stamfordbridge
                    and the song of Waltheof at York, preserved only in Latin fragments, are among
                    our best materials for military events. They go far more into detail than the
                    prose writers do. There seems then no good ground for doubting the general
                    trustworthiness of the narrative which is preserved to us in the Chronicles, and
                    which we are occasionally able to enlarge from other sources. It is, of course,
                    only the earlier stages of the Conquest that can be made the subject of any
                    controversy at all. From the beginning of the conversion of the English to
                    Christianity, we begin to have contemporary materials of one kind or another,
                    till, in the time of Aelfred, the Chronicle itself becomes contemporary. It is
                    only for about a hundred and fifty years that we are left almost wholly to judge
                    of our materials by their internal evidence. And surely a narrative like that of
                    the Chronicles, no tissue of wild and impossible legends, but a steady
                    businesslike series of entries, may very well have been handed down for that
                    length of time by means of runes, helped here and there by a contemporary
                    song.</p>
                <p>Our narrative then, put together from these various sources, represents the
                    Britons, after the departure of the Roman legions, as left without defence
                    against the attacks of their northern neighbours the Picts and Scots. They apply
                    for help to Aëtius; but the Roman general, busy in the struggle with Attila, has
                    no leisure to do anything for them. Their prince, who bears a name of « hich the
                    most familiar form is Vortigern, invites the help of the Saxons, an unwise step
                    enough, but one which has plenty of parallels in history. The British prince, in
                    the most authentic record, is not a king but a duke. The Teutonic leaders whom
                    he invites are also <hi rend="italic">ealdormen</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >heretogαn,</hi> not kings. They are the two brothers Hengest and Hυrsa. Their
                    landing is fixed by the Chronicle to the year 449; and, without insisting on
                    this exact date, it is plain that the Conquest must have begun about the middle
                    of the fifth century. A warfare of nearly forty years, in which many battles are
                    entered, established the first Teutonic kingdom in Britain, that of Kent, the
                    one land which never lost its British name. Of the two brother leaders, Horsa is
                    killed in a battle with Vortigern in 455, after which Hengest and his son Aesc
                    assume the kingly title. In all this there is nothing like romance; it is a
                    matter-of-fact kind of history, which might be preserved by a runic chronicle,
                    which might almost be preserved by tradition. Once only we have a touch which
                    seems to come from a song, as when in a battle in the year 473 the Welsh are
                    said to have “fled from the English like fire.” The geography of the story has
                    been minutely examined, and it shows that the tale is a sound and credible
                    military narrative. Later writers, English and British, have tricked out the
                    story with endless mythical details, and have carried the arms of Hengest far
                    beyond the narrow limits of Kent, to which the Chronicle confines them. Modern
                    critics have found materials for cavil in the names of the two brothers, and in
                    the number of the thirty-nine years of the reign of Hengest. Both points might
                    easily be given up. The main fact is the gradual conquest of a small corner of
                    Britain after much hard fighting with its British possessors. But there really
                    seems no reason why Hengest and Horsa might not be names of real men as much as
                    Wulf, Beorn, and Leo. And the years of Hengest’s reign are, after all, one short
                    of the mystical forty.</p>

                    editor, but in the entry (473) which has the earliest ring of all about it. But
                    when Baeda, and after him the Chronicler, gives a short ethnological account of
                    the invaders, they describe the Teutonic conquerors of Kent neither as Saxons
                    nor as Angles, but as Jutes. As the Jutes then, in the very record of their
                    conquest, are spoken of, on the one hand as Saxons, on the other hand as
                    English, it seems to follow that, from the very beginning, the Celtic
                    inhabitants of Britain called all Teutonic invaders Saxons, while the invaders
                    themselves from the very beginning used Angle or English as their common name.
                    The general use of the Saxon name by the Celts is only what we should have
                    looked for; the wide use of the English name among the Teutons themselves is a
                    fact to be noticed. It is at least certain that, while the English name is often
                    applied to Saxons and Jutes, it would be hard to find any case where an Angle
                    calls himself, or is called in his own tongue, a Saxon. We need not infer that
                    the English name had become the common name of all the three tribes before they
                    left Germany; it certainly .became so within no long time after they settled in
                    Britain.</p>
                <p>We also see that, from the beginning, the Teutonic conquerors spoke of their
                    British enemies as <hi rend="italic">Welsh</hi> or strangers. The name is
                    familiar in that sense both in Britain and on the mainland, but it seems never
                    to be applied to any strangers but those who were either of Roman or of Celtic
                    speech. And it would seem to be applied only to those Celts who had come under
                    the Roman dominion. Our forefathers spoke of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bretιveαlαs</hi> in Britain, of the <hi rend="italic">Galwealas</hi> in Gaul,
                    of the <hi rend="italic">llumu'cαlαs</hi> in Italy; but the name seems never to
                    be applied to the Scots either in Ireland or in Britain. Like the word <hi
                    rend="italic">Slave,</hi> it sank, in the language of the conquerors, to express
                    bondage. The masculine <hi rend="italic">wealh</hi> sometimes, the feminine <hi
                    rend="italic">vvylne</hi> much more commonly, mean a slave in the secondary
                    meaning of that word. This difference of usage is again remarkable. It falls in
                    with the belief, natural in itself, that in the process of conquest the few
                    Britons who were spared were mainly women. Again, Baeda and the Chronicler, as
                    we have seen, speak of the Teutonic conquerors of Britain as sprung from three
                    tribes only, the Saxons, Angles, and Jutes. It was plainly only those three
                    tribes, that is, chiefs of those tribes, who founded kingdoms in Britain. But in
                    all great migrations various kindred tribes are sure to take a part, and it
                    would be rash to rule that no Low-Dutch people but those three took a part in
                    the enterprise. Procopius, for instance, speaks, not of Angles and Saxons, but
                    of Angles and Frisians. We may well believe that Frisians, and other tribes too,
                    helped in the work. Possibly no one settlement consisted wholly of men of any
                    one tribe. It is enough that all the royal races of the several kingdoms
                    belonged to the three stocks, Saxon, Anglian, and Jutish. It was then by Saxon,
                    Anglian, and Jutish settlers, or at all events by settlers under Saxon, Λngliau,
                    and Jutish leaders, that the greater part of Britain was changed into England.
                    But the work was a slow one, and the way in which it was carried out seems not
                    to have been exactly the same in all parts. In the end seven or eight chief
                    kingdoms were founded. The old dream of a regular <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heptarchy</hi> has long been exploded; but it is certain that, among a crowd υi
                    smaller states, seven or eight stand out as conspicuous among the rest, and as
                    having something like a continuous <pb break="no"

                    the smallest part of the country. Their dominions took in only Kent with perhaps
                    for a while Surrey, and Wight with a small part of the neighbouring mainland of
                    Hampshire. They were hemmed in on all sides by the Saxon settlements, all of
                    which bore the Saxon name. <hi rend="italic">Suthsexe, Westsexe, Eastsexe,</hi>
                    have been softened in modern speech into Sussex, Wessex, and Essex; but the
                    names are strictly not territorial, but tribal. <hi rend="italic">Westsexe</hi>
                    and the rest are all of them names, not of a land, but of a people. The whole of
                    the Saxon settlements were made on the southern and southeastern coasts; and it
                    was the West-Saxons only who at any time carried their conquests to any distance
                    inland. The South-Saxon settlement came next after the Jutish settlement in
                    Kent. The date given to it is 477. The most remarkable event in the process of
                    conquest was the storming of Anderida, now Pevensey, in 491. The forsaken walls
                    of the Roman city still bear -witness to the day when Aelle and Cissa slew all
                    that were within, and when not a Bret was left behind. But the South-Saxons
                    found a natural frontier to the north in the great wood of Anderida. Their
                    kingdom always remained little more than a long strip of coast, cut off to a
                    great extent from the other kingdoms of Britain, and playing but a small part in
                    their general history. It still keeps its name and boundary as the modern county
                    of Sussex. The kingdom of the Gewissas or West-Saxons, founded to the west of
                    the South-Saxons, was destined to hold quite another place in English and
                    British history. Two Saxon <hi rend="italic">ealdormen,</hi> Cerdic and Cynric,
                    founded in 495 a settlement on the coast of what is now Hampshire. That
                    settlement grew into the kingdom of England. Twenty-four years after their first
                    landing, the two Saxon ealdormen deemed their position strong enough, and their
                    conquests wide enough, for them to assume the kingly title. Thus began the royal
                    line of the West-Saxons, which became the royal line of England. The third Saxon
                    settlement, that of the East-Saxons, has no such definite date given to its
                    foundation; but it certainly began not later than the first half of the sixth
                    century. Like Sussex, it never extended itself far inland; but it derived some
                    importance from its containing two of the great cities of Roman Britain. One was
                    Camulodunum or Colchester; the other was London. But London, with its district
                    of the Middle-Saxons, grew, by virtue of its admirable position, to a greatness
                    which gave it a separate being. The city of ships, on its broad river, remained
                    as a great prize to be striven for by every conqueror, rather than as a lasting
                    and integral possession of any one of the English kingdoms.</p>
                <p>The settlements of the Angles, who in course of time occupied a much larger part
                    of the land to which they gave their name than was occupied by the Saxons, have
                    quite another history from the kingdoms of which we have just spoken. In Kent,
                    in Sussex, in Wessex, the chief who leads the settlement is himself the founder
                    of the kingdom. In the case of Kent and Sussex, the kingdom never permanently
                    outgrew the bounds of the earliest conquests. The boundaries of Wessex advanced
                    and fell back and advanced again; but they advanced by the process of bringing
                    fresh conquests, newly won from the Briton, under the rule of the already
                    existing kingly house of Wessex. The Anglian kingdoms grew in another way. We
                    know, in some cases at least, the names of their first king3; but those first
                    kings do not appear as the first leaders of settlers from beyond sea. It would
                    rather seem as if a crowd of small settlements, of the date and circumstances of
                    whose foundation we can say nothing, each doubtless ruled by its own ealdorman
                    or petty king, were gradually grouped together into several considerable
                    kingdoms. It is perfectly possible, though there is no evidence for the belief,
                    that some of these original settlements may have actually been of earlier date
                    than the landing of Cerdic, of Aelle, or of Hengest. What is certain is that
                    these Anglian states do not appear as organized kingdoms till a later time than
                    Kent, Sussex, and Wessex. The chief Anglian powers were four. The East-Angles
                    occupied the land to the north of the East-Saxons, a land which the vast fen
                    region to the west of it made in those times, if not insular, at least
                    peninsular. North of the Humber arose two kingdoms, Bernicia and Deira, whose
                    union at a later time formed the mighty realm of Northumberland, stretching from
                    the Humber to the Forth. Ida, who in 547 gathered together a number of scattered
                    Anglian settlements into the kingdom of Bernicia, is the one Anglian prince
                    during the first stage of conquest who stands out with a personal being like
                    that of the Saxon and Jutish founders. From his fortress on the basaltic rock of
                    Bamburgh, overhanging the German Ocean, he ruled the eastern seaboard from Tees
                    to Forth. Of the founder of the kingdom of Deira to the south of Bernicia we
                    have no such clear mention, nor do we know when or by what means that kingdom
                    won the possession which gave it its chief importance. This was the former
                    capital of Roman Britain, <hi rend="italic">Eboracum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Eofoτwic,</hi> or York. Of the process of conquest in central England we know
                    even less. We know absolutely nothing of the circumstances under which the land
                    was won from the Briton. A crowd of Anglian tribes, which kept more or less of
                    separate existence till a very late time, were gradually brought under the
                    dominion of a single Anglian power. Th <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> s power, as
                    growing up on the British frontier, took the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Merce,</hi> the men of the mark or border, and the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercia</hi> gradually spread over all central England. The date of the
                    beginning of the Mercian kingdom is fixed as late as 584. But this of course
                    does not mean a fresh settlement from beyond sea, but simply the gathering
                    together of several small settlements so as to form one considerable power. The
                    boundaries of the true Mercian kingdom may be traced by the boundaries of the
                    old diocese of Lichfield; but it could not have reached to anything like this
                    extent so early as 584.</p>
                <p>Here then we have, among a crowd of smaller states, a few kingdoms, seven or
                    eight in number, which stand out prominently, and fill a place in the history of
                    Britain. Among these again, a smaller number stand out at different times as
                    aspiring, with more or less of success, to the general supremacy of the country.
                    In all cases where a number of kindred but independent states lie near together,
                    a supremacy of one kind or another is sure to come, either by force or by
                    consent, to some one among the number, in which the rest are, more or less
                    quickly, more or less thoroughly, merged. Thus, in modern Europe, France grew
                    into Gaul, and Castile grew into Spain; thus in our own day Piedmont has grown
                    into Italy, and Prussia has gone far towards growing into Germany. So in the end
                    Wessex grew into England; but it was not till after many struggles, many ups and
                    downs, many changes of frontier, that the house of Cerdic became the royal house
                    over the whole land. Three, or at most four, of the greater Teutonic kingdoms in
                    Britain became serious competitors for the general supremacy over all the
                    settlements of the race. Kent, small in geographical extent, had the start in
                    order of time, and was in many ways favoured lγ position. But any effective
                    supremacy on the part of Kent belongs only to an early stage of English
                    occupation; the powers among which the supremacy was really disputed were the
                    great Saxon kingdom of Wessex, the great Anglian kingdom of Northumberland,
                    formed by the union of Bernicia and Deira, and the Anglian kingdom of Mercia,
                    which formed itself in the space between them. It would seem that, sometimes at
                    least, a supremacy of some kind on the part of one kingdom over the whole or
                    part of the rest was <pb break="no"

                    recognized by common consent was known as a <hi rend="italic">Bretwalda</hi> or

                    only etymologically. In the two or three places where the name is used, it is
                    use&lt;l, rightly or wrongly, to mean “ruler of Britain.”</p></note> Our
                    knowledge on this subject hardly goes beyond establishing the fact that such a
                    supremacy was sometimes acknowledged, without telling us anything in detail as
                    to its nature, or as to the way in which it was obtained. It was not continuous;
                    there were times when there was no Bretwalda. It fluctuated from kingdom to
                    kingdom, according to the accidents of war, policy, or personal ability. The
                    fact that such a supremacy existed from early times is chiefly important on
                    account of what it afterwards grew into. The tradition of a supremacy vested in
                    some one power clearly helped the West-Saxon kings in gathering all the Teutonic
                    kingdoms of Britain into the one realm of England. It further combined with
                    other influences in suggesting the doctrine of an imperial supremacy over the
                    whole isle of Britain.</p>
                <p>The establishment of these kingdoms at the expense of the Britons forms the
                    period of heathen conquest, which we may reckon at about a hundred and sixty
                    years. In the course of that time, the English, at first established only on the
                    eastern and part of the southern coast, made their way step by step to the
                    western sea. At the end of this period the whole of Britain was very far from
                    being conquered; indeed English conquest was very far from having reached its
                    fullest extent; but the English had become the dominant race in South Britain.
                    The Britons still kept a large part of the land; but they held it only in
                    detached pieceβ. The English were the advancing people. The Britons could not at
                    the utmost hope to do more than defend what they still kept. The work of
                    conquest during this period was mainly the work of Wessex at one end and of the
                    Northumbrian kingdoms at the other. Sussex, Kent, East-Anglia, each gave the
                    English race a Bretwalda; but these powers, as well as Essex, were
                    geographically cut off from any share in the conquest after the first stage of
                    settlement. Wessex, on the other hand, whose later growth took another
                    direction, pressed boldly into the heart of Britain. West-Saxon progress was
                    indeed checked for a while by British resistance under the famous Arthur. The
                    legendary renown which has gathered round Arthur’s name ought not to wipe out
                    the fact that he met Saxon Cerdio face to face, and by the rings of Badbury
                    dealt him a blow which for a while made the English invader halt.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Guest has shown that “Mons
                    Badonicus” is not Bath, or anywhere else but Badbury in Dorset.</p></note> But
                    from the middle of the sixth century West-Saxon advance is swift. In 552 the
                    second stage begins with the taking of Old Sarum. Sixteen years later comes,
                    doubtless not the first, but the first recorded, fight of Englishman against
                    Englishman. The fight of Wibbandιin (Wimbledon) made Surrey West-Saxon, and cut
                    off Kent from all hope of further advance. In 571 the West-Saxon border, under
                    the Bretwalda Ceawlin, stretched far beyond the Thames, as far north as the
                    present Buckingham. Still no English conqueror had reached the sea between
                    Britain and Ireland. From Dunbarton to the south coast of Devonshire, the
                    British occupation of the western side of the island was still unbroken. Aquae
                    Solis, Corinium, Glevum, Uriconium, and, greater than all, Deva on her
                    promontory, were still British strongholds. They had not yet changed into Bath,
                    Cirencester, Gloucester, Wroxeter, and Chester. The next object of the advancing
                    English was to break this line, to reach the sea, and, if not wholly to subdue
                    the British inhabitants of the west coast, at least to break their continuous
                    power into fragments which might be more easily overcome. In 577 Ceawlin took
                    Bath, Gloucester, and Cirencester, and carried the West-Saxon border to the
                    estuary of the Severn, the future Bristol Channel. The British dominion was thus
                    split asunder. Wales and Strathclyde, to use the geographical names of a time a
                    little later, still formed a continuous whole. But they were now cut off from
                    all connexion with the Britons in the great south-western peninsula, the
                    peninsula of West-Wales, from the northern Axe to the Land’s End. To break
                    through the line at another point, to seize Deva and to carry the West-Saxon
                    arms to rhe north-western sea, was the next object. In this Ceawlin failed; but
                    his expedition of 583 established a long strip of English territory along the
                    Severn valley. Wessex thus seemed to be growing into the great power of central,
                    as well as of southern, Britain. But the second great blow which was to cleave
                    the British dominion into three, as it had been already cloven into two, was not
                    to be dealt by Saxon hands. A great power had now grown up in the north. At
                    various periods before and after the English conquest, things looked as if the
                    supreme power was to be fixed in the northern lands, in the city by the Ouse and
                    not in the city by the Thames. Eboracum had been in Roman days the capital of
                    Britain. The once imperial city was now the head of a great realm, formed by the
                    union of Bernicia and Deira under their conquering king Aethelfrith. In 603 a
                    victory over the Scottish king √Egdan at Daegsanstan secured his power to the
                    north. Some years later he broke through the line of unconquered British
                    territory; he smote the Britons under the walls of Deva, and left those walls,
                    like the walls of Anderida, desolate without an inhabitant. The English conquest
                    of Britain, if not yet completed, was now assured. The British power, which five
                    and twenty years before had stretched uninterruptedly along the whole west
                    coast, was now broken into three parts. Through western and central Britain the
                    boundaries were still very fluctuating. While Aethelfrith smote Deva, lands near
                    to his own capital, the land of Elmet and Loidis, the modern Leeds, was still
                    unconquered British ground. The dominion of Wessex north of the Thames aud Avon
                    had rather the character of an outlying territory stretching into a hostile
                    land, than of the compact dominion which the West-Saxon kings held over
                    Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Berkshire. Moreover the two great powers of the north
                    and the south were now brought into rivalry and collision. Aethelfrith had done
                    what Ceawlin had failed to do; and between Northumberland and Wessex a third
                    great power had arisen, which in a few years was to show itself the equal of
                    either. The West-Saxon had reached the western sea at one point; the
                    Northumbrian had reached it at another point. But the greater part of the
                    western conquests of both were to go to swell the Mercian power which had just
                    come into being. And besides all this, a revolution had begun which was to work
                    the greatest of all changes. The victory of Aethelfrith was the last great blow
                    dealt by the heathen English to the Christian Britons. When it was dealt,
                    Northumberland, Wessex, Mercia, Sussex, and East-Anglia were still heathen. But
                    Kent and Essex had already embraced the gospel. York and Winchester still knew
                    no worship but that of Woden; but the altars of Christ had already risen once
                    more in Canterbury and London.</p>
                <p>The time of heathen conquest thus ends with the first years of the seventh
                    century. The introduction of Christianity among the English was so great a
                    change, it gave so different a character to all the events that followed, that
                    this would seem to be the most fitting point in our story to stop and attempt a
                    picture of the general state oι things in Teutonic Britain during the first
                    century and a hall after Teutonic conquest began. The introduction of a new
                    religion did <pb break="no"

                    Briton or between Englishman and Englishman. It did not stop aggressive conquest
                    at the cost of either kinsmen or strangers. But it so far humanized its new
                    converts that warfare ceased to be exterminating. Conquest now meant political
                    subjugation and, for a while, social degradation. It no longer meant the more
                    frightful alternatives of death, flight, or personal slavery. The lands won by
                    the English up to this date must be looked on as having become purely Teutonic.
                    The Britons were swept away as nearly as a people can be swept away. The lands
                    conquered after this time must be looked on as lands in which the dominant
                    Teuton has largely assimilated his Celtic subjects. The process has gone on from
                    that day to this, and it goes on still. Kent, the south-eastern peninsula, has
                    been purely English for fourteen hundred years. Cornwall, the southwestern
                    peninsula, has become fully English, even in speech, only within the memory of a
                    generation which has hardly passed away. Thus, in the hundred and fifty-eight
                    years which passed between the landing of Hengest and the victory of
                    Aethelfrith, a large part of Britain had received another language, another
                    religion, another system of law. Old things had passed away; all things had
                    become new. In the whole eastern part of the island, from the Forth to the
                    English Channel, and through a great, though still somewhat undefined, central
                    region, reaching at two points to the western seas, the Roman and the Briton had
                    gone, and the Teuton had taken their place. The three Low-Dutch tribee brought
                    with them their form of the common Teutonic language. Into that language a few
                    Roman and a few British words crept from the beginning. British slaves, British
                    women, brought in a few humble words of domestic life. A few of the great works
                    of Roman civilization, such as the conquerors had never seen in their own land,
                    struck them with awe and wonder. For these they had no names in their own
                    tongue; they therefore kept their Latin names in the English tongue. The words
                    <hi rend="italic">street, port,</hi><hi rend="italic">ehester,</hi> thus came
                    into our language. Many of the great natural objects, most of the rivers, a few
                    of the hills, kept their earlier names; so did a few great cities. With these
                    few exceptions, the vocabulary of the tongue which our fathers brought with them
                    remained untouched. It was enriched by a few new words to express new ideas, and
                    that was all. Nothing happened till far later times to make any change in its
                    character, its grammatical construction, its general stock of words. We brought
                    with us our language, and with our language we brought with u3 the earliest
                    monuments of its literature. We brought with us our English Iliad in the
                    primaeval Song of Beowulf; wo brought with us our Homeric catalogue in the Song
                    of the Traveller. Whether they were written or unwritten, whether they lived
                    only in the memory or were graven with the primaeval runes, those songs were the
                    work of Englishmen in days before a rood of British soil had become England. Nor
                    need we doubt that the deeds of Hengest and Cerdic had already been graven on
                    the primaeval beech,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Beech</hi> and <hi rend="italic">book</hi> are the same word, just
                    like the two senses of the Latin <hi rend="italic">liber. Write</hi> is cognate
                    with the High-Dutch mssen, just like <hi rend="italic">scribere</hi> with <hi

                    English, and worshipped no god but Woden and his fellows. Before the Roman made
                    his second appearance in this island, the national literature of Englishmen, the
                    local literature of England, had begun.</p>
                <p>We thus brought with us into Britain that form of the common Aryan speech which
                    had grown up among the tribes of northern Germany. Wherever, during the first
                    hundred and fifty years of the English settlement, the English arms reached,
                    there the tongue of Rome and the tongue of Britain passed away. Their place was
                    taken by the speech which, with the changes that fourteen hundred years have
                    wrought in it, still abides the speech of England. It has changed, as all other
                    languages have changed. It has, like all other languages, so changed that its
                    older forms cannot now be understood without special study; but it has never
                    lost its unbroken personal being. The English tongue has never been displaced by
                    any other tongue, as the tongue of the Briton was displaced by the tongue of the
                    English. It has lived on, spoken in different local forms in different parts of
                    the land, changing from age to age, losing old inflexions, taking in new words;
                    but it has changed simply as the nation itself has changed, without ceasing to
                    be one and the same English nation; it has changed, as each man in the nation
                    himself changes in his passage from childhood to old age, without ceasing to be
                    the same personal being in old agejwhich he was in childhood. And, with our form
                    of the common Aryan language, we brought with us our form of another common
                    Aryan possession, which still abides, also unchanged in its personal identity,
                    never displaced to make way for any other system, but which has gone through
                    even greater and more constant changes than our spoken language. We brought with
                    us our own political and social system; that is, the form which the political
                    and social system common to the whole Aryan family had taken among the tribes of
                    northern Germany. A germ of political and social life was brought into Britain
                    in the keels of Hengest, which, changing from generation to generation but never
                    itself exchanged for any other system, borrowing from foreign sources but
                    assimilating what it borrowed with its own essence, changing its outward shape
                    but abiding untouched in its true substance, has lived and grown through
                    fourteen hundred years into the law, the constitution, the social being, of
                    England.</p>
                <p>The earliest law or custom of England was the law or custom of the old homes of
                    the English settlers, with such modifications as the settlement in a land beyond
                    the sea could not fail to bring with it. These modifications, as <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> moment’s thought will show, must have been considerable. A
                    conquest by land need not involve any sudden change; it does not necessarily
                    place the conqueror in any wholly new set of circumstances. It may well be a
                    mere territorial advance, a mere addition of field to field, in which the last
                    won territory does not call for any different treatment from the older territory
                    immediately behind it. But a conquest by sea implies a breach of continuity; the
                    old land is necessarily forsaken, and a fresh start has to be made in a new one.
                    The political society of the old home may be reproduced in the new; but it is
                    reproduced rather than continued, and it can hardly be reproduced without some
                    measure of change. And a settlement made bit by bit, each step being won by hard
                    fighting, such as was the English settlement in Britain, will be affected by all
                    such influences as are likely to be strengthened by constant fighting for the
                    possession of a new country. And in such a case, when the nation is an army in
                    active service, when the chiefs of the nation are the leaders of that army, the
                    influences which are most likely to be strengthened are those which tend iu the
                    direction of national unity. Or, what is almost the same thing, they are the
                    influences which tend to strengthen the authority of the chiefs by whom the
                    national unity is represented.</p>
                <p>The political and social state of the Low-Dutch tribes at the time of their
                    settlement in Britain was still essentially the primitive Teutonic democracy,
                    the state of things described by Tacitus, and which still exists, modified of
                    course in the lapse of ages, but untouched by any violent change, in some of the
                    smaller and more primitive cantons of Switzerland. The family is at the root of
                    everything. The <hi rend="italic">hide</hi> of land, the portion supposed to be
                    enough for the maintenance of a single family, is the lowest territorial
                    unit.</p>

                <p>The enlarged family, in Greek and Latin phrase the <hi rend="italic">gens,</hi>
                    tracing by natural descent or by artificial adoption to a common forefather,
                    real or imaginary, divine or human, is the lowest political unit. As in ancient
                    Greece and Italy, it constantly bears the name of such supposed forefather. The
                    Aescingas, the Scyldingas, a crowd of other such names, marked in Teutonic, just
                    as in Greek, by the patronymic ending, are sometimes recorded in history or
                    legend, sometimes simply left to be inferred from the local nomenclature of
                    England and other Teutonic lands. The territory, originally the common
                    territory, of such an enlarged or artificial family, formed the lowest
                    territorial division, the <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >township.</hi> The cultivated land of each <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> was
                    fenced in by a boundary line of unfilled land, forming the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mark</hi> in the strictest sense. The township then and its inhabitants formed
                    the iowest political unit, an unit having its own assembly and its own political
                    organization. Such a political unit still forms the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gemeinde,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">commune,</hi> of other lands. This unit
                    has been exposed in England to influences which have altered its character more
                    thoroughly than it has been altered anywhere else. An ecclesiastical influence
                    has changed the original <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> into the half civil, half
                    ecclesiastical <hi rend="italic">parish.</hi> An influence of another kind
                    changed the primitive community, holding its common land by its own right, into
                    a body of tenants holding their land of a lord. The township which had passed
                    through such a change became a <hi rend="italic">manor.</hi></p>
                <p>It must always be remembered that, in the primitive polity, each larger group is
                    formed by bringing together several of the smaller. Several <hi rend="italic"
                    >gentes</hi> brought together formed in the Roman system the <hi rend="italic"
                    >curia,</hi> answering to the Attic <hi rend="italic">φpατpiαaηA</hi> the
                    Spartan <hi rend="italic">ωβή.</hi> The Teutonic counterpart of this group is
                    the <hi rend="italic">hundred.</hi> The name must in its beginning have meant a
                    real hundred of some kind; but such names soon lose their proper force, and are
                    used in a purely conventional sense. The hundreds of England are familiar as
                    geographical divisions; but their traditional organization, administrative,
                    judicial, and military, is fast passing out of memory. When the English first
                    landed in Britain, and for ages after, that organization was fresh and vigorous.
                    But it is quite possible that, even before the voyage of Hengest, the mere name
                    of hundred had become purely conventional, and had ceased to imply an actual
                    hundred of any kind.</p>
                <p>As a group of <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi> formed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >curia,</hi> so a group of <hi rend="italic">curiae</hi> form a <hi
                    rend="italic">tribe.</hi> In the Teutonic nomenclature, the territory of the
                    tribe is the <hi rend="italic">ga, gau, peod,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >scir,</hi> in modern English <hi rend="italic">shire,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">pagus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">scira</hi> of Latin writers. <hi
                    rend="italic">Gd organ,</hi> a name familiar in Germany, but whose existence can
                    only just be proved in England, is doubtless the elder name. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shire,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">shear,</hi> does not mean a group of lesser
                    units, but in strictness a division, something <hi rend="italic">shorn</hi> off
                    from a greater whole. Both names are historically true. Of the existing shires
                    of England some are really primitive <hi rend="italic">gds,</hi> settlements of
                    tribes, while others are in strictness <hi rend="italic">shires,</hi> artificial
                    divisions formed at a later time in imitation of the primitive <hi rend="italic"
                    >gd.</hi> Tho West Saxon shires are primitive <hi rend="italic">gas,</hi> and
                    two at least, those of the Sumorsaetas and the Dorsaetas, still keep the ancient
                    tribal names. But the old tribal divisions of Mercia were wiped out in the
                    Danish conquest of the ninth century. In the process of English reconquest the
                    land was mapped out afresh into <hi rend="italic">shires,</hi> strictly so
                    called, shires grouped conveniently round a central town, and bearing the name
                    of that town instead of the name of the ancient tribe. The shire, it is needless
                    to say, is still a living thing throughout England, and from England it has
                    spread itself, commonly under the French name <hi rend="italic">county,</hi>
                    through all lands ruled, settled, or influenced by England</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">gd</hi> was the lowest group which could exist as a really
                    distinct political power. The mark and the hundred, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gens</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">curia,</hi> do not, at least in the
                    finished system, whether Teutonic or Greek and Italian, aspire to the character
                    of an independent state. The <hi rend="italic">gd,</hi> like the tribe, might do
                    so. The <hi rend="italic">gd</hi> might be wholly independent; it might be
                    dependent on some stronger neighbour; it might be incorporated into a kingdom,
                    and sink into one of its geographical divisions. But in any case it kept its
                    full and separate organization, its assembly with judicial, administrative, and
                    legislative power, its chief bearing the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ealdorman</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Alderman</hi> in peace, of <hi
                    rend="italic">Her etoga, Herzog—</hi> the στpατ7jγ0s of the Athenian tribe—in
                    time of war. The alderman stood, like the territory of which he was the chief,
                    in various relations. He might be an independent or a vassal prince; he might,
                    by the incorporation of his7α with a kingdom, have sunk into a mere magistrate,
                    appointed by the king and assembly of the whole kingdom. But the organization of
                    the <hi rend="italic">ga</hi> 01 <hi rend="italic">shire</hi> remained in either
                    case. So the Ramnes and Titienses were independent tribes, occupying their
                    several hills. They joined together, to become the tribes whose union formed the
                    earliest Rome.</p>
                <p>A system of <hi rend="italic">gas</hi> or shires is thus the oldest fully
                    developed form of the Teutonic polity. The process of grouping independent <hi
                    rend="italic">gds</hi> into a yet greater division was gradual, and went on much
                    faster in some parts than others. The union of <hi rend="italic">gas</hi> formed
                    a <hi rend="italic">rice</hi> or kingdom; the chief of the group thus formed was
                    a <hi rend="italic">cynιng or king.</hi> What, it may be asked, was the
                    difference between king and ealdorman? The question is a hard one , but one
                    point of difference seems plain. The ealdorman was a ruler in peace and a
                    captain in war. The king was more. Among the English at least, the kingly houses
                    all claimed descent from the blood of the gods. Every king was a son of Woden. A
                    vague religious reverence thus gathered round the king, in which the ealdorman
                    had no share. He was also the head of the highest political aggregate which the
                    ideas of those days had reached. He was. as his name implies, the head of the
                    <hi rend="italic">kin,</hi> the nation. The rule of the ealdorman was tribal,
                    and merely earthly; the rule of the king was national, and in some sort
                    divine.</p>
                <p>Kingship then, the leadership of a nation, was, in the ideas of those days, an
                    office and not a property. As an office, it demanded qualifications. It demanded
                    in truth the highest qualifications, the qualifications needed in one who was to
                    be the leader of his people in peace and in war. Such an office could not be
                    trusted to the chances of any law of strict hereditary descent. Or rather, the
                    notion of any law of strict hereditary descent was a thing which had not yet
                    presented itself to men’s minds. Kingship then was elective: the leader of the
                    people became such only by the choice of the people; but the right of choice was
                    not wholly unlimited; the king, so custom and tradition taught, must come of the
                    stock of Woden. But within that stock one member of it was as sacred, as kingly,
                    as another. The son of a deceased king would doubtless be his most obvious
                    successor, if there was nothing specially to suggest another choice; but he had
                    no further claim beyond any other man of his house. Traditional rule dictated
                    that the choice should be made from the royal house; reason dictated that it
                    should fall on the worthiest of the royal house. The union of these two feelings
                    led to that mixture of election and hereditary succession which we find among
                    the ancient English, as among most other nations at the same stage. The king is
                    chosen; but he is chosen, under all ordinary circumstances, from the one kingly
                    line. He is not chosen as the heir or the representative or the next of kin of
                    the former king. He is chosen as that one of the kingly house whom the people
                    think fit to choose. He is chosen from the house; therefore kindred in the
                    female line goes for nothing. The son of a king’s daughter does not belong to
                    the kingly bouse; he is therefore not eligible for <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n287/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0287-0274"/> the kingly office. But the most distant kinsman
                    Ln the male line is as much one of the kingly stock as the king himself, and the
                    choice of the nation may fall upon him. There is no point in our early
                    constitution which is more important to insist on than this. Nothing has led to
                    more and greater misconceptions than carrying back the legal theories of later
                    days into earlier times, than fancying that every prince was an usurper whose
                    succession to the crown did not take place according to rules which he and those
                    who chose him had never heard of, and would not have understood.</p>
                <p>The institution of kingship came in gradually among the Teutonic nations, and its
                    growth was much slower in some parts than in others. In the time of Tacitus,
                    kingship was clearly far from universal. By the time of the Wandering of the
                    Nations, when scattered tribes had begun to gather together in greater masses,
                    it was clearly the rule. Among the Saxons its growth was specially slow. Among
                    the Old-Sιxons who stayed behind in Germany it never came in at all. So both the
                    Saxon and the Jutish leaders came to Britain, not as kings, but as ealdυrmen or
                    <hi rend="italic">Heretogan.</hi> They were of the stock of Woden, and were
                    therefore qualified for kingship; but they did not take the kingly title till
                    they lιad made a firm settlement in the country. The institution of kingship
                    seems to have grown up in different ways in different parts of England. From all
                    that we can see of the Anglian kingdoms, they were formed by the union of
                    several states into one greater kingdom. In such-a case the ealdormen or kings
                    of the incorporated states might go on under the superiority of the common king;
                    but the king sank into the <hi rend="italic">under-king,</hi> kingly in descent,
                    kingly in office among his own people, but owning the external authority of the
                    common king. In Wessex the course of things was otherwise. There too we find
                    several kings at once; but all are, not only of the stock of Woden, but of the
                    house of Cerdic. There was moreover always one head king over the whole
                    West-Saxon nation. Something of the same kind seems to have been the rule in
                    Kent. We see, though dimly, signs of a separate, and doubtless subordinate,
                    kingdom of the West-Kentishmen.</p>
                <p>Among the English conquerors of Britain we see from the beginning the same
                    elements of political life which we see among the other Teutonic nations, and
                    which were doubtless parts of the original Aryan inheritance. The inhabitants of
                    the land fall into two great classes, the free and the unfree, classes each of
                    which is again capable of subdivision. Every freeman is a citizen and a soldier;
                    he is, or may be, a landowner; he has his place in the army, his voice in the
                    assembly. But all freemen are not equal in rank and honour. There is a broad
                    distinction, a distinction so old that its beginning cannot be traced, between
                    the man who is simply free and the man who is not only free but noble. This
                    distinction is expressed in different Teutonic dialects by the rhyming names <hi
                    rend="italic">eorl</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ceorl, jarl</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">kart,</hi> in modern English form, ear/ and <hi rend="italic"
                    >churl.</hi> These two last words have in modern use changed their meaning. In
                    their oldest sense they answer to the modern phrase <hi rend="italic"
                    >gentle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">simple.</hi> It is impossible to say in what
                    the privileges of the <hi rend="italic">eorl</hi> consisted, nor is there
                    anything to show that they were oppressive. But the distinction was broadly
                    drawn, and the birth of the <hi rend="italic">eort</hi> clearly entitled him to
                    special respect and honour, if to nothing more. And such special respect and
                    honour would, in the common course of things, give the <hi rend="italic"
                    >eorlas</hi> a preference for all offices and distinctions, whether honorary or
                    substantial, which either king or people had to bestow. The unfree class again
                    were clearly not on a level in all times and places. The actual slave, the <hi
                    rend="italic">thrall,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">]&gt;eow,</hi> is found
                    everywhere. The class is formed and recruited in two ways. The captive taken in
                    war accepts slavery as a lighter doom than death; the freeman who is guilty of
                    certain crimes is degraded to the state of slavery by sentence of law. In either
                    case the servile condition of the parent is inherited by his children, and the
                    slave class goes on increasing. The existence of other classes between the
                    absolute slave, the mere chattel of his master, and the full freeman, with his
                    place in the army and his voice in the assembly, is possible and frequent, but
                    not universal. It was a natural position either for the enfranchised slave, for
                    the foreign settler, or for the conquered enemy who was admitted to more
                    favourable terms than usual. Out of such cases there might easily arise a class,
                    personally free, but not possessed of the full political rights of freedom.
                    There might indeed be many stages of imperfect freedom or mitigated bondage
                    between the personal slave and the free churL To some of these intermediate
                    ranks the slave might rise or the freeman might sink. But such a class, though
                    often found, is not a necessary element in Teutonic society. But the <hi
                    rend="italic">eorl,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">churl,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">thrall,</hi> are found everywhere. They are taken for granted; and
                    legend represented the three classes as called into being by separate acts of
                    the creative power of the gods. All these, as essential elements of Teutonic
                    society, are found among our forefathers from the beginning.</p>
                <p>But in all Teutonic societies another principle was at work, which began very
                    early to change the nature of primitive Teutonic society. That society was a
                    community, a community which, like all other communities, admitted distinctions
                    of rank, wealth, and office, but where each man, earl or churl, held his place
                    strictly as a member of the community, bound by its laws, and owing to it his
                    duties in war and in peace. The Teutonic community differs from the Greek or
                    Italian city in so far as it is not fenced in with walls, but has its inhabited
                    places spread over the whole of its territory. But its leading political
                    conception is essentially the same. The king or ealdorman is clothed with the
                    authority of a leader. The earls have their privileges, in whatever those
                    privileges may consist. In the assembly the king and the earls may cousult and
                    propose, while the simple freemen merely say yea or nay. But each discharges his
                    duty in his higher or lower place strictiy as a member of the community. His
                    duty, his allegiance, is due to the whole society, not to any particular member
                    of it. This primitive system was from a very early time broken in upon by the
                    practice of personal commendation to a lord. Such commendation was in its
                    beginning strictly military. In the primitive community the army is simply the
                    nation under arms. Each man discharges his duties in war, like his duties in
                    peace, in obedience to the law of the society of which he is part. But at a very
                    early time—for the picture stands out distinctly in Tacitus—successful and
                    popular leaders began to gather round them a band of special followers, devoted
                    by a personal tie to themselves. Where the chief led they followed. The tie was
                    mutual. For the chief to forsake his followers, for the followers to forsake
                    their chief, was alike shameful. A personal tie thus arose between man and man,
                    alongside of the political tie which bound each member of the community to the
                    community itself. The king, ealdorman, or other chief, became something more
                    than the magistrate and captain of the community. He became the personal lord of
                    some particular men among its members. They became his <hi rend="italic"
                    >men,</hi> bound to do him personal service. He became their <hi rend="italic"
                    >hlaforcl, lord,—</hi> in the primitive meaning of the word, <hi rend="italic"
                    >loaf-giver,—</hi> who was to reward the service which they rendered to him. The
                    new principle spread, and gradually made its way into every relation of Teutonic
                    society. The personal following of the king, his <hi rend="italic">gesiftas</hi>
                    cr companions, his <hi rend="italic">↑&gt;egnas</hi> or servants, grew into à
                    nubility of office. Thus arose the nobility of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >thegns,</hi> which gradually supplanted the older nobility of birth, the
                    nobility of the <hi rend="italic">earls.</hi> The growth of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n288/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0288-0275"/> royal power, and the growth of the importance of
                    the thegnhood, naturally went hand in hand. A power like that of kingship, when
                    once established, is sure to grow. It is specially sure to grow in a period of
                    conquest. The king and his personal followers are likely to be foremost in
                    warfare; and each increase of territory increases the power and dignity of the
                    king, and therewith raises the condition of his followers. We see the
                    institution of thegnhood in full force at an early stage of the Teutonic
                    settlement in Britain. We may feel sure that the Teutonic settlement in Britain
                    greatly served to strengthen it. And we cannot doubt that the change from the
                    nobility of office to the nobility of birth greatly affected the position of the
                    churl or simple freeman. By breaking down a barrier which was purely a barrier
                    of birth, it made it easier for individual churls to rise to a higher rank. But
                    by gradually confining office and power and influence to the king’s personal
                    following, it tended to degrade the position of the churls as a class.</p>
                <p>This relation of a man to his lord might be on any scale. It might be contracted
                    between men of any rank, between a weaker and a more powerful king, between a
                    poorer and a richer churl, or between men of any of the intermediate ranks. In
                    its higher degrees the relation was political; in its lower degrees it was
                    purely social. It spread alike upwards and downwards, till it became the rule
                    and not the exception. It came to be looked on as the business of every man to
                    seek a lord, and at last the lordless man had legal disadvantages. Still the
                    relation between a man and his lord, the voluntary commendation of a man to his
                    lord, was in itself a relation purely personal, and had nothing to do with the
                    holding of land. But the two things might easily be brought into connexion with
                    one another. And as the practice of commendation grew, analogous changes
                    gradually affected the tenure of land. In both cases the personal relation grew
                    at the expense of the public relation. The community lost, and the individual
                    gained.</p>
                <p>The land of a Teutonic community is primarily the property of the community
                    itself. It is <hi rend="italic">folkland, ager</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >publicus,</hi> the land of the people. But here, as everywhere else, private
                    property in land gradually arose; that is, the community granted out parts of
                    the common possession to its individual members. The pictures of Caesar and
                    Tacitus show that, in the time between them, the institution of private property
                    in land had already made some advances. When it has once begun, it is sure to
                    advance. It would specially advance with every conquest; each man would claim to
                    have his personal share of the soil which he had helped to win. Thus, alongside
                    of the <hi rend="italic">folkland,</hi> the land of the community, grew up the
                    private estate, the <hi rend="italic">e∂el, odal,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >allod.</hi> This is land which is a man’s very own, the gift of the community,
                    held according to the laws of the community. It is not the gift of this or that
                    man, owing any service to this or that man. As the king’s power grew, as he came
                    to be looked on more and more as the representative of the community, the land
                    of the com munity came step by step to be looked on as his land. In the six
                    hundred years between the English conquest of Britain and the Norman conquest of
                    England, <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic">∖∖</hi><hi rend="italic">Q
                    folkland,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">ager publicus,</hi> passed into <hi
                    rend="italic">terra</hi><hi rend="italic">regis,</hi> the land of the king. As
                    the community could at all times grant away its own land, the doctrine gradually
                    grew that the king, the head of the community, could grant it away also. In the
                    first stage he granted it only with the assent of the community; in a later
                    stage he came to dispense with that assent. Land thus <hi rend="italic"
                    >booked,</hi> granted by a written document, to whomever the king would, but of
                    course mainly to his personal followers, became <hi rend="italic">bookdand.</hi>
                    The lord was the giver of bread to his man, and the land of the community was
                    the noblest form of bread that he could give him. And, as things went on, he
                    might sometimes grant him more than the land itself. The primitive community,
                    great or small, from the township to the nation, had the rights of a community;
                    it had judicial and administrative powers. From those powers it might be deemed
                    a privilege for the royal grantee to be exempted. He might be clothed with
                    exceptional judicial powers within his own lands; the next stage would be for
                    those powers to spread themselves over the lands of his neighbours. The
                    privileged landowner within a community might grow to be the lord of tue
                    community. The township might grow into the lordship; its free assembly might
                    grow into the court of the lord; the land itself, so much of it as escaped the
                    lord’s clutches, might be declared to be held under the lord. In the fictions of
                    lawyers things are commonly turned about. The exception is declared to be the
                    rule, and the rule to be the exception. If the community contrives to save any
                    fragments of its ancient rights from the grasp of the Jord, those fragments are
                    at last judicially declared to be held only by the lord’s grant. If no grant can
                    be found in real history, legal ingenuity will be ready to assume one.</p>
                <p>All land was by immemorial custom burthened with three duties. To the repair of
                    bridges and the repair of fortresses all land was bound to contribute. And the
                    duty of every member of the community to serve in arms when called on for the
                    defence of the community was so far a charge upon the land that a certain amount
                    of land had to supply a certain number of men. But this is not military service
                    in the later sense; the land is not held of a lord by a military tenure; the
                    personal duty of serving in the <hi rend="italic">fyrd,</hi> the militia of the
                    community, is not a duty paid by the man to his lord, but by the member of the
                    community to the community itself. The primitive militia of the community and
                    the personal following of the lords form two distinct elements, which often
                    appear as distinct in the records of early warfare. The strictly military
                    tenure, the holding of land from a lord on condition of doing him military
                    service, does not concern us as yet.</p>
                <p>The English settlers in Britain thus brought with them all the elements of
                    Teutonic society as they stood in their day. The distinction of <hi
                    rend="italic">earl, churl,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">iheow</hi> went on in
                    Teutonic Britain as they had gone on in Germany from time immemorial. Marks,
                    hundreds, yds, arose on the conquered soil of Britain, as they had already
                    arisen on the ancestral soil of Germany. But the circumstances of the conquest
                    could not fail to hasten the process by which the smaller communities were
                    gradually gathered into the larger. That the <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi>
                    settled by marks is plain from nomenclature; and, much as in Greece the same
                    Doric tribes helped over and over again to found distinct Doric settlements, so
                    settlements of the same <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> formed in distant parts of
                    England bore the same name. The <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Wellingas,</hi> for instance, appears at Wellington in Somerset,
                    at Wellington in Shropshire, and at Wellingborough in Northamptonshire. But the
                    mark never could have had the same importance in England which it had in
                    Germany. Such a settlement could never maintain itself alone in a country which
                    was being conquered bit by bit. Every settlement must from the beginning have
                    relied on the help of its neighbours, alike for further conquests and for the
                    defence of what it had already won. Everything must have tended to closer union
                    among the communities which grouped together to form the hundred, the <hi
                    rend="italic">gâ,</hi> and the kingdom. The <hi rend="italic">gâ</hi> must, from
                    the first, have been the lowest group capable of real separate being. And in M ’
                    essex at least, each <hi rend="italic">gâ,</hi> as it was formed, was placed
                    under the rule of au under-king of the royal house. In central England the <hi
                    rend="italic">gàs,</hi> each doubtless under its separate king or ealdorman,
                    often remained really distinct, till they were swallowed up by the growing power
                    of Mercia.</p>
                <p>All these groups, greater and smaller, mark or township<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n289/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0289-0276"/>, hundred, <hi rend="italic">gà</hi> or shire, and
                    kingdom, kept the constitution of the primitive community, modified by such
                    changes as change of circumstances could not fail to bring with them. So far as
                    we can get any glimpsee of any of them, we see in all alike the same elements.
                    There is in all the presiding chief, the leading men proposing and debating, the
                    whole body of freemen saying <hi rend="italic">yea</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >nag</hi> to their proposals. The chief change was one of the highest practical
                    moment, but which was not the result of any sudden revolution, or even of any
                    enacted law. Democracy may change into oligarchy by the mere working of the laws
                    cf time and space. The simple freeman may have the same right to appear in the
                    assembly of the kingdom which he has to appear in the assembly of his own
                    township. But he is far from being so likely to be found there. Mere distance
                    settles the question. Only the more wealthy and the more zealous will go long
                    journeys to take a part in public affairs. Thus the assembly, popular and
                    unlimited in its theoretical constitution, silently narrows till it becomes an
                    assembly of the chief men, with such only of the common freemen as live near the
                    place of assembly or are drawn to it in greater numbers than usual on some
                    occasion of special excitement. The assembly of the kingdom, the <hi
                    rend="italic">~Witenagemot</hi> or Meeting of the Wise, gradually took this
                    character. There was no need to shut the mass of the people out; they shut
                    themselves out. In the <hi rend="italic">Scîrgernôt,</hi> the assembly of the
                    shire, we see the working of the same law. Attendance has to be enforced by law;
                    at least a <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> number for each district is fixed.
                    This practically comes to confining the assembly to those who are specially
                    summoned; for a special summons to certain members is always found to lead in
                    the end to the exclusion of those who are not summoned. In this way, without any
                    formal change, by the mere working of natural causes, the popular character of
                    the primitive assemblies died out. It died out of course more thoroughly in the
                    higher assemblies than in the lower. The great assembly of the kingdom, in
                    theory the gathering of all the freemen of the kingdom, shrank up into an
                    assembly of the king’s thegns, subject to the appearance of more numerous bodies
                    of men on specially stirring occasions, and to the presence of the citizens of
                    the town where the assembly was held, when it was held in a town. This will
                    always happen whenever the assembly of a large country is primary and not
                    representative. The more purely democratic its constitution, the more sure is it
                    to shrink up into oligarchy. But it is well to remember that, as long as our
                    national assemblies kept any traces of their primitive shape, those great
                    meetings which chose and deposed kings, which made and repealed laws, which made
                    war and peace, were, in theory at least, meetings not of this or that class, but
                    of the nation.</p>
                <p>In the last paragraph we have been carried on somewhat beyond the date which we
                    had reached in our narrative, somewhat beyond the period of heathen England. In
                    so doing we have incidentally made mention of towns. The origin of the English
                    towns certainly comes within the period with which we are immediately dealing.
                    Than that origin no part of our subject is more obscure. But one negative point
                    we may assert with full confidence; there is no trace of any possession, of any
                    law or custom or office, which the cities and boroughs of England have inherited
                    from the older municipalities of Rome. Whatever likeness may be seen between the
                    two is due, beyond all doubt, not to direct derivation, but to the eternal law
                    according to which like causes produce like results. In the primitive Teutonic
                    system, in the system reaching from the mark up to the kingdom, there was no
                    place for walled towns. The early Teuton looked on the walled town as a prison.
                    When in after times strictly English towns arose, their position was wholly
                    different from that of the Roman towns. The Roman town was the centre and
                    mistress of everything within its own range. The city was a commonwealth; the
                    surrounding country was little more than a subject district. Without a city
                    there could, in Greek and Roman ideas, be no organized political or social life.
                    In the Teutonic system, on the other hand, towns were wholly unknown, and they
                    have never in any Teutonic country come to fill the place which they have always
                    filled in southern Euιope. The difference between English social life and that
                    of the southern part of the European continent, the shrinking of the English
                    upper classes from town life in any shape but that of the capital of the
                    kingdom, dates from the very beginning of our history. In southern Europe the
                    city is an essential of life; in England it is a kind of accident. When English
                    towns did arise, they were simply districts where houses stood thicker together
                    than elsewhere. The town was a mark, a hundred, perhaps a shire, in which more
                    men lived within a smaller space than they lived in other marks, hundreds, or
                    shires. But the question here arises, When did the English conquerors of Britain
                    begin to occupy walled towns at all? It is certain that in many cases the Roman
                    town was simply forsaken by its English conquerors. At Pevensey and Silchester
                    the inhabitantswereslaughtered, and the walls left standing empty for ever. It
                    is equally certain that in other cases, as at Bath and Chester, the Roman walls,
                    after standing empty for a while,—in the case of Chester for the ascertained
                    period of three hundred years,—were again inhabited by settlements of
                    Englishmen. The question is whether this last was the case with all the Roman
                    sites which were won during the time of heathen conquest and which became
                    English towns in later times, or whether any of them were continuously
                    inhabited, and simply passed from British to English occupiers. It is quite
                    certain that in some cases the period of desolation, if there was any, must have
                    been short. H London, Canterbury, York, Lincoln, Colchester, ever stood void and
                    forsaken, they must have been settled afresh very soon. Some at least of them
                    were again inhabited cities at the end of the sixth century. London and York,
                    above all, would doubtless hold out long after all the surrounding country had
                    been subdued. They may have held out till the conquerors had laid aside somewhat
                    of their first rudeness, and had learned to see that a city and its walls were a
                    valuable possession. In some then of the greatest cities we may believe that
                    their conquest was comparatively late, and that, when they were conquered, they
                    immediately became dwelling-places of the conquerors. It may then well be that
                    there never was a moment when the walls of Eboracum, the walls of Augusta— the
                    old city once called London and afterwards to be called London again—ceased to
                    gird in the dwelling-places of man. The point is that the connexion between
                    Eboracum and <hi rend="italic">Eoforwic,</hi> between Augusta and <hi
                    rend="italic">Lundenbyrig,</hi> is a connexion purely geographical. The Briton
                    went out, and the Englishman came in. The rulers and the people of the Teutonic
                    commonwealth had no political succession from the rulers and people of the RomaE
                    commonwealth which had once occupied the same soil.</p>
                <p>Of English law during this time we have no contemporary monuments. But law in its
                    first form is the same as custom; the earliest written codes are simply the
                    customs of the time set down in writing. We have no written English lawβ till
                    after the introduction of Christianity: the oldest written code bears the name
                    of the first Christian king. But the dooms of Aethelberht, and the dooms of much
                    later kings, are, in all those points which are not clearly modified by
                    Christianity, good evidence for the laws or customs of heathen times. Our oldest
                    laws set before us a society in which the position of the king is well marked,
                    and where he summons his people to him, doubtless to the general assembly of his
                    realm. The classes of <hi rend="italic">eorl, ceοrl,</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n290/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0290-0277"/> and <hi rend="italic">]&gt;eow</hi> are plainly
                    marked. Of the <hi rend="italic">thegn,</hi> in the earliest code of all, there
                    is no mention. We have mention also of the classes intermediate between the
                    freeman and the slave, the <hi rend="italic">loet</hi> namely and the <hi
                    rend="italic">esne.</hi> But we see no signs of a 30ciety containing men of
                    distinct nationalities; there is nothing answering to the mention of the Romans
                    in the codes of the continental Teutons, or to the mention of the Welsh in other
                    English codes which were drawn up at a later time and under other circumstances.
                    The first English laws are drawn up for a purely Teutonic people, keeping their
                    old Teutonic customs. Two of the most characteristic features of ancient English
                    law are there in their fulness. Every man has his value; but his value differs
                    according to his rank. Every freeman’s oath is worth something; but the oath of
                    the earl is worth more than the oath of the churl. Death or injury done to any
                    man has its penalty; but the penalty is higher or lower according to the rank of
                    the person injured. In short, in al! the early codes, in England and elsewhere,
                    the state has already stepped in to regulate and modify the natural desire for
                    vengeance on the part of the injured person or his kinsfolk. The natural avenger
                    of the slain man seeks for the blood of the slayer; the state steps in and
                    persuades him, in Teutonic England no less than in Homeric Greece, to accept of
                    a money payment instead of the gratification of his vengeance. The right of a
                    man in a state of nature to do himself justice with the strong arm, the <hi
                    rend="italic">foehde</hi><hi rend="italic">or feud</hi> —the source of the
                    private' war and the duel of later times —is not wholly set aside; but it is
                    regulated and modified, and confined to certain extreme cases. The state in all
                    such cases steps in as a mediator between the wrong-doer and the man who seeks
                    to avenge himself upon the wrong-doer. It takes the right of punishment out of
                    his hands into its own. The later legal doctrine that a wrong done to any member
                    of the community is a wrong done to the community itself, and to the king as its
                    head, has not yet been reached. A crime done against the king is more heavily
                    punished than a crime done against another man; but that is simply because the
                    king fills the highest place in the long gradation of ranks. The first notion of
                    a crime against the state as such seems to come out in that venerable enactment
                    which looks like the origin of one branch of our modern privilege of
                    parliament—“If the king his people to him call, and to them then man evil do,
                    twofold but and to the king fifty shillings.”</p>
                <p>The language, the laws, and the constitution which the English settlers in
                    Britain brought with them from their older homes were in the course of ages to
                    undergo many changes; the newer forms were to part away widely from the older;
                    but all was to be gradual growth, gradual change; there was to be no sudden
                    revolution,no supplanting of one tongue by another tongue, of one law by another
                    law. But the English had brought with them from their older homes another
                    possession which was to pass utterly away, a system which was to be thoroughly
                    supplanted by a rival system of foreign birth. With their language and tbeir
                    laws they had brought with them their religion; and while their language and
                    their laws were to abide, their religion was to pass away. The old religion of
                    the English was, like their language and their laws, that form of the common
                    Aryan heritage which had growu up among the people of northern Germany. The old
                    Teutonic faith is best known to us in the poetry and legends of that branch of
                    the race which clave to it longer than the rest, in the Eddas and Sagas of the
                    Northmen of Scandinavia. Our system was doubtless essentially the same as
                    theirs, though, as it was laid aside by both High and Low Germans earlier than
                    it was in Scandinavia, it may never have reached among them the same full poetic
                    development which it reached in more northern lands. The names of the chief
                    gods, Woden, Thunder,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>punaer, punor, in modern form <hi rend="italic">Thunder,</hi> is the true
                    English name. The more familiar form <hi rend="italic">Thor</hi> is, like most
                    Scandinavian forms, a contraction. <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi> is for <hi
                    rend="italic">)uηdresdag.</hi></p></note> Frigga, and the rest, are the same
                    with only dialectic differences. The name of one of our old gods is of special
                    interest; the great Aryan power of the sky, Zeus himself, appears among us,
                    though with lessened honours, under the English form of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tιw.</hi> He, with his fellows, gives his name to a day of the week; and his
                    name, like that of his fellows, may be traced in the local nomenclature of our
                    land. Of that laud the Teutonic gods took full possession along with their
                    worshippers. The creed of the Roman and the Briton passed away with those who
                    professed it. The still unconquered Welsh never thought of undertaking the work
                    of missionaries among the conquerors and destroyers of their brethren. And they
                    would have had small chance of being hearkened to by those conquerors and
                    destroyers, if they had undertaken such a task. It was otherwise when a new
                    light came from lands beyond the sea, between whose people and ours there
                    reigned no such mutual scorn and hatred. And above all things, it was otherwise
                    when the call to a new faith came directly from the capital of the western
                    world. The English folk were first called on to cast aside the faith of Woden
                    and to embrace the faith of Christ by men who came on that errand from Rome
                    herself, at the bidding of the acknowledged father of Western Christendom.</p>
                <p>The conversion of the English to Christianity was not only one of the great
                    turning-points in the history of England; it was one of the great turning-points
                    in the history of Christianity itself. It was, as far at least as the West is
                    concerned, a conversion of a kind that was altogether new. Christianity is
                    historically the religion of the Roman empire; wherever the influence of Rome,
                    East or West, has spread, there Christianity has been dominant; beyond that
                    range it has taken little root. The Teutonic conquerors of the continental
                    provinces accepted the religion of. the empire as they accepted its laws and
                    language. At the end of the sixth century, all the subjects, all the western
                    conquerors of Rome, were Christian. Heathendom took in only the lands, like
                    Scandinavia and Germany beyond the Rhine, which had never formed part of the
                    empire, together with the one Western land which had wholly fallen away from the
                    empire. The conversion of England was the first strictly foreign mission of the
                    Western Church. It was the first spiritual conquest of a people wholly strange,
                    a people who stood in no kind of relation to Rome and her civilization. It was
                    the first act of a long seιies of spiritual conquests which gradually brought
                    all Europe within the pale of the Church. And it was more than the first act of
                    the Series; it enlisted in the missionary work the people who were to send forth
                    the most successful apostles to other lands. The conversion of England directly
                    led to the conversion of heathen Germany and Scandinavia. Gregory, who was so
                    anxious for the soul of Trajan, was himself a spiritual Trajan, enlarging his
                    spiritual empire by conquests more lasting than the earthly conquests of Trajan
                    himself. The conversion of the English to Christianity carried with it the
                    readmission of Britain into the general world of Europe. Throughout the fifth
                    and sixth centuries the notices of the affairs of Britain in continental writers
                    are rare and meagre beyond expression. They show that Britain had fallen back
                    into the isolation of the days before Caesar; it had again become an unknown
                    world, a world about which any kind of fable might be safely uttered. Such rare
                    intercourse as that world had with the Roman world was through the Teutonic
                    masters of Gaul, the Franks. And it may be taken as a sign that, in the latter
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n291/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0291-0278"/> years of the sixth century, Kent at least must
                    have been striving to bring itself within the European circle, when we find its
                    king Aethelberht married to a Christian wife, the daughter of a Frankish king.
                    It is to be noticed however that neither the queen herself nor the Frankish
                    bishop whom she brought with her seem to have directly done anything for the
                    conversion of the king or his people. That work could be done by nothing short
                    of the majesty of Rome.</p>
                <p>One point which cannot be too strongly insisted on at this stage is that the
                    Church of England which was founded by Augustine has nothing whatever to do with
                    the early British Church. In after times certain British dioceses submitted to
                    English ecclesiastical rale, and that is all. The Christianity of England did
                    not come wholly from any single source; and one of the sources from which it
                    came was fouud within the British islands. But tha't source was not a British
                    source. The Roman planted; the Scot watered; but the Briton did nothing. He not
                    only did nothing; he refused to do anything; he would have nothing to say to
                    Augustine’s invitation to join in preaching the gospel to the heathen English.
                    Theologians may dispute over the inferences which may be drawn from the fact;
                    but the historical fact cannot be altered to please any man. The Church of
                    England is the daughter of the Church of Rome. She is so perhaps more directly
                    than any other Church in Europe. England was the special conquest of the Roman
                    Church, the first land which looked up with reverence to the Roman pontiff,
                    while it owed not even a nominal allegiance to the Roman Caesar.</p>
                <p>The conversion of the English was gradual, and, on the whole, peaceful.
                    Christianity was nowhere forced on an unwilling people by fire and sword, as was
                    doue in some later conversions. We find wars between Christian and heathen
                    kingdoms in which religion is clearly one great animating cause on both sides;
                    but we do not hear of persecutions or wars of religion within the bosom of any
                    kingdom, As a rule, the king is converted first. The great men follow, perhaps
                    in duty bound as bis thegns. The mass of the people follow their leaders. But
                    all is done without compulsion; if conversion was not always the result of
                    argument, it was at least the result of example. This may perhaps show that the
                    old religion sat somewhat lightly on its votaries, and in some cases the new
                    religion seems to have sat somewhat lightly on its converse. The Christian king
                    sometimes had heathen sons, and their accession was followed by a re’apse. But,
                    in the space of about a hundred years, all the English kingdoms had become
                    Christian. The men of Wight in their island·, and the men of Sussex isolated
                    between the sea and the great wood, were the last to cleave to the idols of
                    their fathers. The seventh century was the great time of struggle between the
                    two religions. It was also the time when Mercia first stood forth as an equal
                    rival with Northumberland, Wessex, and Kent. Kent soon sinks into a secondary
                    rank, and leaves the first place to be disputed between the three other great
                    powers. At the beginning of the period when the first Roman missionaries came,
                    in 597, the Bretwaldadom, which had been held by Aelle of Sussex and Ceawlin of
                    Wessex, was held by Aethelberht of Kent. . He is expressly said to have been
                    supreme over all the kingdoms south of the Humber. That this supremacy was not a
                    mere name is shewn by the fact that his safe-con duct held good when Augustine
                    crossed the still heathen land of Wessex to confer with the British bishops on
                    the banks of the Severn. Under Aethelberht, the Kentish Church was planted by
                    Augustine, and from Kent the new teaching spread over Essex and East-Anglia.
                    From Kent ’ too came the first conversion of Northumberland, and with it of
                    Lindesey, by the preaching of Paulinus under the powerful BretwaldaEadwine of
                    Deira. That king had,before his conversion, conquered the Welsh kingdom of
                    Loidis and Elmet, and had made Northumberland the first power in Britain. His
                    first rivalry was with Wessex, which he brought to acknowledge his supremacy.
                    After his conversion he had to endure the more dangerous enmity of two powers
                    which united against him on different grounds. The Teutonic conqueror was
                    hateful to the Britou Caedwalla, whose kingdom of Strathclyde, cut off from his
                    southern countrymen by the victory of Aethelfrith, was still a powerful state.
                    The Christian convert was hateful to the heathen Penda, under whom Mercia first
                    became great. Before the two Eadwine fell at Heathfield in 633, and with him
                    fell for a moment the Christianity and the power of Northumberland. The new
                    power of Mercia grew equally to the south at the expense of Wessex. But this
                    first burst of Mercian power was not to be lasting. Before long Northumberland
                    was again united, powerful, and Christian, under the Bernician Bretwaldas, and
                    her power and religion were first restored for a while by Oswald the saint. He
                    overthrew his British and Christian enemy at Heavenfield in 635. This is a date
                    of importance. Tn some sort it marks the completion of the English conquest.
                    Much British land was still to be won by hard fighting; but Caedwalla was the
                    last British prince who could wage aggressive and dangerous warfare against an
                    English rival. Against his heathen and English enemy Oswald was less successful.
                    He too, .like Eadwine, fell before Penda at Maserfield in 642. A time of
                    confusion and division followed, but under Oswiu, the next Bretwalda,
                    Northumberland rose again. In 654 Penda fell before him at Wιnwedfield, and the
                    armed strife between Christianity and heathendom was at an end. The second
                    conversion of Northumberland, and the conversion of Mercia which followed the
                    fall of Penda, were chiefly the work of the Scots. That name, it must be
                    remembered, though it does not shut out the Scottish colony in Britain,
                    primarily means the. original Scots of Ireland. Columba and his successors in
                    their holy island linked the two together, and both were zealous in the
                    missionary work, both in Britain and on the continent. But, though a large part
                    of England thus owed its Christianity to the Scots, yet the special Scottish
                    usages did not abide in the churches of Northumberland and Mercia. After much
                    debating, the Bretwalda Oswiu adopted, on behalf of his people, the usages of
                    Rome and Kent. Meanwhile Wessex had been converted by an independent mission
                    from the Frauks of Gaul under its apostle Birinus. The heathendom of Sussex gave
                    way in 681 to the preaching of the Northumbrian Wilfrith, and a few years later
                    the men of Wight, the last abiding-place of the old gods, were partly converted
                    by Wilfrith, partly slaughtered by the West-Saxon Ceadwalla. All England was now
                    Christian; and the English Church was finally organized between 668 and 690 by
                    Theodore of Tarsus. The Roman, the Scot, and the man of the East, thus all
                    worked together to bring the English conquerors of Britain within the pale of
                    the Christian Church, and thereby within the general world of Europe</p>
                <p>There is something wonderful in the way in which Christianity fitted itself in,
                    so to speak, to the old Teutonic institutions of England. The change in men’s
                    uhoughts, the change in their ways of looking at most things, must have been
                    great; but there is no sudden break. The old political'and social state goes on
                    , the old laws and institutions are not abolished; they are hardly modified; all
                    that happens is that many new laws are inserted among the old. But. the laws
                    bear the old character. The old scale of ranks is enlarged to take in some new
                    members, in the form of the various degrees of the Christian priesthood. Some
                    new crimes are forbidden: some new observances are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n292/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0292-0279"/> enjoined; but the spirit of the law, the nature
                    of the penalties, the manner of their execution, remains the same. The various
                    ranks of the clergy have their value, in Teutonic fashion, along with the
                    various ranks of the laity. Churchee arose, and the fabrics, with their
                    ministers and their property, were placed under the protection of the law.
                    Provisions against idolatrous practices are found; but the old faith passed away
                    so easily that but little legislation of this kind was needed. The land received
                    a new geographical division in the form of ecclesiastical provinces and
                    dioceses; but these commonly followed the existing civil geography. The extent
                    of the bishop’s diocese coincided with that of some kingdom or principality,
                    and, as the ecclesiastical divisions underwent, till quite late times, much less
                    change than the civil ones, the boundaries of the dioceses are our best guides
                    to the boundaries of the old kingdoms and ealdormanships. Nowhere was the Church
                    more thoroughly national than in England. The old assembly of the shire received
                    the bishop as a new chief, along with the ancient ealdorman, and the two sat
                    together jointly to hear matters which the more minute jurisprudence of a later
                    time divided into causes ecclesiastical and causes temporal. Bishops, abbots,
                    and other churchmen, became prominent in the counsels of kings and in the
                    assemblies of the nation. A century or two later, we even find them leading the
                    national armies to battle. Through the whole native history of England, we find
                    no traces of any of the controversies between Church and State which show
                    themselves in later times. In truth, Church and State did not exist as two
                    distinct bodies; they hardly existed as two distinct ideas. As the army was the
                    nation in its military aspect, so the Church was the nation in its religious
                    aspect. The leaders of the body might be different according to the matter in
                    hand; but the body itself was one.</p>
                <p>This strongly national character of the ancient English Church naturally followed
                    on the time and manner of the conversion of the English nation. The English were
                    not like the Teutonic conquerors on the continent, in whose eyes the Church was
                    a Roman institution, alongside of other Roman institutions. In Gaul and Spain,
                    for some generations after the Teutonic conquest, ecclesiastical power and
                    office remained in the hands of the conquered. In some later conversions the
                    Church was a foreign institution through an opposite cause. It was an
                    institution forced on the people by their conquerors. In England neither of
                    these causes of separation had any being. The English of their own free will
                    accepted the creed of foreign teachers; but the Church was not to them a foreign
                    institution. The first two or three bishops of each see were necessarily
                    strangers; but as soon as Englishmen were found fitted for such offices, they
                    held them to the exclusion of strangers. It is hard to find a foreign prelate in
                    England between Theodore of Tarsus and Robert of Jumiéges. Again, when England
                    was converted, the privileges of the clergy as an order, the powers of the
                    bishop of Rome as their head, were things which were still in their infancy. The
                    claims made by the clergy and the popes in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth
                    centuries would have been unintelligible either to Aethelberht or to Augustine.
                    There was nothing in England to part off the clergy, as a body having feelings
                    and interests distinct from the rest of the nation. There was nothing to tempt
                    the Roman bishops, subjects as they still were of the Roman emperors, to put
                    forth the claims of an Hildebraud or an Innocent. There was nothing to make them
                    claim from the newly founded English Church anything beyond the reverence due to
                    a parent from a child who has already reached full age.</p>
                <p>In short, if we look through our early law, and seek for changes in the law
                    itself—as distinguished from legislation on new subjects—which can be said to be
                    directly owing to the change of religion, we shall find few indeed. It is indeed
                    very likely that the power of bequeathing property by will was introduced by the
                    Roman clergy. There is a remarkable reference to the practice which implies as
                    much;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Norman writer

                    of English law, but its soundness can bardly be doubted.</p></note><hi

                    which the clergy took largely into their own hands, and which became in the end
                    a subject for the specially ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Yet the power of
                    willing may have grown up in England, just as it did at Rome. In the beginning a
                    will is an exceptional act. The testator prays the community to allow his goods
                    to be disposed of in a particular way. The confirmation gradually becomes matter
                    of form; at last it is altogether dispensed with, and the power of bequest, once
                    a privilege granted in a particular case, becomes the common right of every man.
                    Still there, is a strong likelihood the other way, and it may well be that the
                    power of bequest has really been transferred from the Roman law to that of
                    England. Only, if so it be, it must be remembered that it is no heritage from
                    the inhabitants of the Roman province of Britain. It is something which was
                    brought in afresh, as part of the ecclesiastical system of Gregory and
                    Augustine.</p>
                <p>Another novelty in our law, which was directly owing to the conversion, was the
                    institution of ecclesiastical property. This is plain on the face of it. Nothing
                    could be given for the support of the new religion till the new religion had
                    been accepted. But the institution of ecclesiastical property involved something
                    more than this. If it did not from the beginning imply the legal doctrine of
                    corporate property, it at least soon grew into it. This doctrine is something
                    wholly distinct from the primitive communal property. It presupposes the
                    intermediate stage of private ownership. The land is first cut off from the
                    common possession to form the particular possession of this or that person.
                    Then, by a legal fiction, several persons are clothed with the attributes of a
                    single person, and the artificial being called a corporation appears. Such
                    corporations were quite familiar to Roman law; but it is inconceivable that any
                    such subtlety should have been thought of in primitive Teutonic times. The king
                    or ealdorman, who gave lands to this or that church,—commonly under the formula
                    of giving to God, or to such and such a saint,— if he did not at once create, at
                    least paved the way for, all the fictions and subtleties of law with regard to
                    corporations of all kinds, lay and spiritual, aggregate and sole.</p>
                <p>It was also doubtless owing to direct Christian influence that the early
                    jurisprudence of England came to differ in one singular point from that of other
                    Teutonic nations. The wager of battle, an original Teutonic institution, one
                    which was brought again into England in later times, seems to have been
                    altogether disused between the conversion and the Norman conquest. It has an
                    English name, the <hi rend="italic">&lt;yrnest,</hi> but it is quite unknown to
                    English law or English usage. Its place is taken by the direct appeal to the
                    judgment of God in the form of the ordeal. The divine power, it was held, would
                    directly interfere to save the innocent and to punish the guilty. We need not
                    suppose that the ordeal itself was an invention of Christian teachers. The same
                    idea may be found in many customs in other parts of the world. But it must be
                    owing to direct Christian teaching that the judgment by hot iron or hot water
                    altogether drove out the more warlike appeal to the judg <pb break="no"

                    in after times in the guise of a foreign innovation.</p>
                <p>But, small as were the direct legal or political changes which it wrought, the
                    conversion of the English, even setting aside its purely theological and
                    spiritual side, was the greatest event in the history of our nation. The effects
                    which it wrought were great and manifold. The Roman missionaries brought with
                    them a new learning, a new culture. The little influence which Rome had on our
                    language and laws, before the great continental infusion of later times, was due
                    far more to the days of the conversion than to the days of the first conquest.
                    Our forefathers translated a great number of ecclesiastical terms, some of which
                    we have come again to use in a Latin shape. Still, as new things must have new
                    names, the Roman missionaries brought into our language a good many Latin words
                    to express ecclesiastical ideas, and seemingly a few other words, expressing
                    other objects of Roman culture. Here was a second Roman infusion into our
                    Teutonic speech. It was an infusion far greater than the handful of Latin words
                    which we picked up in the course of the first conquest; but it was still an
                    infusion which in no way affected the purity of our native vocabulary. Some
                    foreign things kept their foreign names; but no native thing changed its native
                    name for a foreign one. The effect on language was in short much the same as the
                    effect on law. There was no break, no change; only certain new elements were
                    adopted and assimilated by the old.</p>
                <p>But if the conversion wrought but little change in the English tongue, it
                    breathed a new literary life into the English people. The missionaries brought
                    with them the whole learning of their time, and, above all, the use of the Latin
                    language. Latin, it must be remembered, was still, not merely the literary
                    tongue, but the common every-day speech of Western Europe. The dialects which
                    grew into the Romance languages had doubtless already begun to form themselves;
                    but no one looked on them as anything but vulgar dialects· of Latin; no one
                    thought of committing them to writing, or of using them for any serious purpose.
                    A people who knew no Latin were cut off from all intercourse with the civilized
                    world of the West; a people among whom Latin was cultivated at once formed part
                    of that world. From the coming of Augustine, “book Latin” again took its place
                    among the languages of Britain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Chronicles at the very beginning say, “Her synd on pam
                    iglande fif gepec∣du—Aenglisc, Brytwylsc, Scottysc, Pihttisc, and Boclaeden.”
                    This translates Baeda’s list “Anglorum videlicet, Brit-tonum, Scottorum,
                    Pictorum, et Latinorum, quae meditatione scripturarum caeteris omnibus est facta
                    communis.”</p></note> But happily it always remained “book Latin.” It never
                    displaced the native Teutonic speech on the lips of men; it never even shut out
                    the native speech from the rank of a cultivated language possessing a written
                    literature. Or rather, the general intellectual impulse which followed on the
                    conversion, while it first gave us a Latin literature, also first made our
                    English written literature. We learned to use a more convenient alphabet than
                    the runes,'a more convenient writing material than the beech. English was, what
                    the Romance languages were not as yet, so far apart from Latin that the two
                    languages, the two literatures, could live side by side. One point only is to be
                    regretted. It is at once the strength and the weakness of the Latin Church, and
                    one of her points of contrast with the Churches of the East, that, wherever her
                    system is accepted in its fulness, she imposes the tongue of Rome as the one
                    tongue of religious worship. Like crowds of other laws and usages, good and bad,
                    this usage came about of itself, without any set purpose; it was only when it
                    was objected to in after times that arguments were sought for to defend it. It
                    was in England that the practice began of having divine service in a tongue not
                    understanded of the people. That is to say, England was the first country of
                    wholly foreign speech which the Roman Church had to deal with. It had not come
                    into any man’s head to translate the mass or the lectionary into the dialects of
                    Gaul or Spain. Indeed we may be sure that the time for such a step was not yet
                    come; the ecclesiastical Latin was doubtless at least as intelligible then as
                    the English of the sixteenth century is now. Thus men who were accustomed only
                    to Latin in public worship went on using it, even in a country where the same
                    reasons which pleaded for the use of Latin at Rome pleaded no less strongly for
                    the use of English. But this was the only error; the native tongue was in no way
                    discouraged as the tongue either of devotional writ or of translations or
                    paraphrases of Scripture. A noble Christian literature soon grew up in the
                    English tongue. The only thing to be lamented is that its growth must have put
                    the older heathen literature under a cloud. The songs which record the English
                    conquest live only in Latin fragments, and Beowulf himself has been taught to
                    utter Christian phrases, if only with stammering lips.</p>
                <p>The two ends of England contributed to the growth of the new English literature.
                    Our Christian English poetry is of Deira; our English prose is of Wessex; our
                    Latin literature, our earliest history in literary shape, is of Bernicia.
                    Caedmon of Streoneshalh led the way, the first of our English sacred poets, he
                    who, a thousand years before Milton, dealt with Milton’s theme in Milton's
                    spirit—he who sang the warfare of Hebrew patriarchs with the true ring of a
                    Teutonic battle-song. Next came Baeda of Jarrow, the first who recorded English
                    history in Latin prose, and who, amid a crowd of Latin writings, did not forget
                    the rendering of the gospel into the tongue of his own people. For Caedmon there
                    might have been a place in the older state of things; for Baeda there could have
                    been none. Caedmon, born while parts of England were still heathen, might have
                    been a heathen born; he might, in the selfsame spirit, with little more than the
                    change of names, have sung of Woden and Loki instead of Christ and Satan; he
                    might have told the tale of Ida warring with the Briton instead of the tale of
                    Abraham warring with the kings of Caanan. But Baeda is the direct offspring of
                    the great religious change. The monk, the student, who never struck a blow in
                    battle or raised his voice in the assembly of shire or kingdom, was a new
                    character among Englishmen. Yet Baeda is English too; he is no stranger to us;
                    he is the man of our own race, as the man of our race might now become under a
                    state of things so far removed from the thoughts of the olden time. Of English
                    prose, though in a sense it begins with Baeda, the true and full growth is
                    later. Its founder is the king who was at once the judge, the captain, and the
                    teacher of his people, West-Saxon Aelfred himself.</p>
                <p>We may also safely say that it was with the conversion to Christianity that the
                    first rudiments of art were brought back into Britain. As heathen Rome taught
                    her culture to the Briton, so Christian Rome taught her culture to the
                    Englishman. How far the monuments of Roman skill were designedly swept away it
                    might be hard to say. Most likely there was no design in the matter. Much would
                    perish in the ordinary course of barbarian havoc, <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi>
                    and there was no English Theodoric to guard what escaped. It is a speaking fact
                    that a Roman column standing in its place is a thing unknown in Britain. We may
                    be sure that the art of stone building was unknown to the heathen English in
                    their old homes; nor was there anything in the circumstances of their settlement
                    in their new homes to lead their thoughts in that direction. Architecture, and
                    with it the other arts, painting, music, and the rest, came in again in the wake
                    of the Church. Churches were built in the style <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n294/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0294-0281"/> which was then usual in Italy, churches of brick
                    or stone with round arches. Sometimes a Roman ruin was still able to be
                    repaired; more commonly it supplied materials for a new building. When the tall
                    bell-towers came into fashion in Italy, they were imitated in England also. Thus
                    arose, in England as elsewhere, that early rouud-arched style, based directly on
                    Italian models, which formed the usual style of all western Europe till the
                    eleventh century. The art of those days was mainly ecclesiastical. Houses were
                    commonly, most likely always, of wood till the coming of the Normans. The Roman
                    military works seem hardly to have been imitated till the great aera of
                    fortification in the tenth century.</p>
                <p>With the new religion the land received a wholly new class of mankind, utterly
                    unknown to the heathen Teutons, the class of men and women devoted to the
                    religious life. Monasticism forms a marked feature in some pagan systems; but it
                    had no place in the old Teutonic religion. We had not so much as anything that
                    answered to the virgins of Vesta. But Teutonic monasticism took a character of
                    its own. Monasteries became private inheritances; the distinction was not always
                    very accurately drawn between the ordained monk and the secular priest, between
                    the unordained monk and the layman. Celibacy was doubtless essential to the very
                    laxest form of the monastic life; but we shall look in vain in the early
                    monasteries of England for any very strict observance of the rule of Saint
                    Benedict. There was room however in them alike for the ascetic scholarship of
                    Baeda and for the ruder zeal which led a crowd of men and women of all ranks,
                    among them kings’ daughters and even reigning kings, to forsake the world to
                    embrace the religious life. A large proportion of the native saints of the
                    English calendar were supplied by those kingly houses whose pride had once been
                    to be sprung of the blood of the gods of heathendom.</p>
                <p>This last idea had of course wholly to change its shape under the influence of
                    the new faith. The pedigree was not forgotten; Woden was still the forefather of
                    all the kingly houses. But Woden was now found out to have been a mere mortal
                    hero, the descendant of Noah in such and such a generation. We may suspect that
                    one effect of Christianity was to lessen the reverence for the kingly stock as
                    such, to strengthen the elective element, and to make it easier to choose kings
                    who were not of kingly descent. The analogy alike of the Roman emperors and of
                    ecclesiastical officers of all kinds would work the same way. But kingship, as
                    an office, was in Christian hands clothed with a higher majesty, and became an
                    object of deeper reverence. If one form of sanctity was taken away from the son
                    of Woden, he gradually obtained another in his new character of the Lord’s
                    Anointed. At least from the eighth century, perhaps from an earlier time,
                    English kings began, as the emperors had long been, to be admitted to their
                    office with ecclesiastical ceremonies, among which the rite of unction held the
                    chief place. The king thus became in some measure a sharer iu the sanctity of
                    the priesthood. He was clothed in sacred vestments, and enjoyed sacred
                    privileges beyond the laymen of ordinary degree. But this only brought out more
                    strongly his position as holding an office according to law. The priest, the
                    abbot, the bishop, was chosen and admitted to his office according to a known
                    law. According to the same law, he might, in case of demerit, be deposed from
                    his office. So it was with the kingly office. The greater the mysterious
                    sanctity that was shed over the kingly office, the more was his person shorn of
                    all mysterious sanctity. He held a sacred office; but that sacred office might,
                    like any other office, be taken away from an unworthy holder. On the other hand,
                    the growing practice of personal commendation stepped in to restore the balance,
                    and to strengthen the king’s personal authority.</p>
                <p>He became the personal lord of all the chief men in his kingdom. They were bound
                    to him by a voluntary tie of personal faith and honour. But these two growing
                    notions, which made the king, on the one hand a personal lord, on the other hand
                    an ecclesiastical officer, worked together somewhat to wipe out the older idea
                    of the king as the head of the people, the chief, the judge and captain of the
                    community, commanding obedience directly as the head of the state, without any
                    need either of religious consecration or of personal allegiance.</p>
                <p>But if the new religion thus modified the older ideas of kingship, and tended on
                    the whole to strengthen the kingly power, it affected the national being of the
                    English people in a yet more direct way. In fact, it created that national
                    being. Hitherto there had been no tie to bind together the various Teutonic
                    kingdoms in Britain, except the precarious and fluctuating tie of the
                    Bretwaldadom. Had the Bretwaldadom been permanent, it might have gradually fused
                    all the Teutonic settlements into one nation. In the form which it actually
                    took, it was a mere momentary superiority of one kingdom over others, which was
                    naturally irksome, and was thrown off as soon as might be. The Church sowed the
                    seeds of a truer national unity by accustoming Englishmen from different
                    kingdoms to act together, and to acknowledge a common head. England had national
                    synods long before she had national parliaments. Her kingdoms acknowledged a
                    common primate long before they acknowledged a common king. The original scheme
                    of Gregory would have divided Britain into two ecclesiastical provinces of much
                    the same extent. York was to have taken in all Scotland; but the claim of York
                    to ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Scotland was always precarious, commonly
                    nominal, and it was in the end formally abolished. The regular succession of
                    archbishops of Y <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> ork began later than that of
                    Canterbury, and the northern primate, sometimes with one or two suffragans,
                    sometimes with none at all, never practically held the same metropolitan
                    position as the archbishop of Canterbury. This last became, long before any king
                    could so call himself, the “head of Anglekin,”<note anchored="true"

                    English nation, irrespective of political divisions. And such an influence was
                    purely national. It gave no political importance to the secondary, soon to
                    become the dependent, kingdom of Kent. It worked however when Kent had been
                    merged in Wessex, to help the advance of Wessex, and to settle the general
                    headship of England in the south. And, in the same way, the position of the see
                    of York, which in practice was not so much an archbishopric as a great and
                    powerful independent bishopric, doubtless did much to strengthen the general
                    tendency of Northumberland to keep up a being distinct from that of southern
                    England.</p>
                <p>Thus, before the end of the seventh century, Teutonic and heathen England had
                    embraced a new creed, and with that creed it had received those changes in
                    thought, law, and custom which could not fail to follow on such a conversion.
                    One change above all affects the general history. Warfare still goes on, warfare
                    alike with the Britons and with Englishmen of other kingdoms; but warfare no
                    longer implies extermination. Where the heathen conqueror carried mere slaughter
                    and havoc, the Christian conqueror was satisfied with political subjection. The
                    overthrow of Deva by Aethelfrith may well have been the last case of mere
                    destruction. The greatness and fall of Penda form part of the history of the
                    conversion; his reign was the armed <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0295-0282"/> resistance of heathendom to the new faith. His
                    alliance with Caedwalla gave the Briton his last chance of greatness at the cost
                    of the Teutonic intruder. When Caedwalla and Penda had both fallen before the
                    sword of the Northumbrian Bretwaldas, two questions were solved. The Teuton aud
                    not the Celt was to be dominant in southern Britain; but the rule of the Teuton
                    was to be a Christian and not a heathen rule. But a third question, which of the
                    Teutonic powers in Britain should become the head of Britain, was still
                    undecided. This question took more than a hundred years to settle, and it was at
                    last settled in a way which was hardly to be looked for. During the greater part
                    of the seventh and eighth centuries the struggle seemed to lie wholly between
                    Northumberland and Mercia. Wessex seems to have given up all herschemesof
                    aggrandizement in central Britain. She gradually loses her dominion north of the
                    Thames; it is sometimes more than she can do to maintain her own independence
                    against Mercian supremacy. But all the while she is gradually extending her
                    dominion at the expense of the Britons to the west. She is also, in the latter
                    part of the period, establishing a supremacy over the smaller English kingdoms
                    to the east. The Wessex of 800 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> was a state of a
                    wholly different shape on the map from the Wessex of 600 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> The West-Saxon kings, from the seventh century onwards, ruled over a
                    realm of quite a different character from any of the earlier English kingdoms.
                    Their western conquests, from the northern Axe to the Tamar, made them, now that
                    the days of mere slaughter and havoc were passed, masters of a realm which
                    contained British as well as English subjects. In the laws of Ine (675-693) we
                    find the picture of a land in which the Britons are under the full protection of
                    the law, but in which they form a distinct class, marked as inferior to the
                    dominant English. The Welshman’s oath and the Welshman’s life both have their
                    value; but they are rated at a less value than the oath and the life of an
                    Englishman of the same rank. When we turn to the laws of Aelfred (878-901), no
                    trace of any such distinction is left. He legislates for a purely English realm.
                    That is to say, the Welsh within the West-Saxon kingdom had, in the course of
                    those two hundred years, become naturalized Englishmen. The impassable barrier
                    of creed which divided the Christian Briton from the heathen Teuton had now
                    passed away. There was nothing to hinder the conquered, when once admitted to
                    legal protection, from gradually adopting the tongue and manners of their
                    conquerors.</p>
                <p>The same work must have been going on along the Mercian frontier also; but here
                    we have not the means of studying it in the same detail. During these hundred
                    and fifty years the Mercian kings spread their dominion a long way westward of
                    the boundary stream of the Severn. But we hear far more of them as warring,
                    often as conquerors, against the English powers to the north and south of
                    them.</p>
                <p>But at the beginning of this period Northumberland still remains the greatest
                    power of Britain. For a while after the death of Penda her supremacy was
                    undoubted. Mercia then again became independent, and under Wulfhere (657- 675)
                    and his successor Aethelred (675-703), who died a monk, pressed far towards the
                    dominion of southern as well as of central England. Meanwhile, Ecgfrith of
                    Northumberland (670-685) was pressing on to the further north, as the West-Saxon
                    kings were to the extreme west. Northumberland, it must be remembered, reached
                    to the Forth; but to the west it was hemmed in by the British land which
                    stretched to the Clyde. This last Ecgfrith incorporated with his dominions.
                    Carlisle and its district, a land which was in after days to become English
                    again, now became English for a moment, as well as the land to the west which
                    was not to become English again. But Ecgfrith fell in a war with the Picts
                    beyond the Forth, and the dominion of Northumberland died with him. The northern
                    land still remained for a while the chief scat of learning and culture, the land
                    of Caedmon and Baeda. But its political power fell with Ecgfrith. The stoutest
                    Northumbrian kings of the eighth century could at most keep their own borders
                    against the Mercian, or again win victories against the North Briton. Of the
                    Bretwaldadom of the seventh century they had no hope. Towards the end of the
                    eighth century Northumberland fell into a state of confusion and division, which
                    made it an easy prey for any enemy.</p>
                <p>During the greater part of the eighth century everything looked as if the chief
                    place in the island was destined for Mercia. Aethelbald (716-757), Offa
                    (757-796), and Cenwulf (797-819), through three long reigns, taking in more than
                    a century, kept up the might and glory of their kingdom. Meanwhile, in Wessex a
                    series of valiant kings pressed westward against the Briton, and bore up against
                    the Mercian. But to bear up was as much as they could do. The fight of Burford
                    in 752, under the West-Saxon king Cuthred, secured the independence of Wessex;
                    but it secured only lier independence; her northern frontier was finally cut
                    short by Offa. This last is the greatest name in Mercian history. Though none of
                    these Mercian kings are enrolled on the list of Bretwaldas, yet the position of
                    Offa was as great as that of any English king before the final union of the
                    kingdoms. In one way it was higher than that of any of them. Offa held, not only
                    a British, but an European position. Britain was now again threatened with
                    annexation by a continental power. Charles the Great, not yet crowned Caesar and
                    Augustus, but already virtual lord of Rome, exercised an influence in British
                    affairs such as no prince of the mainland had ever exercised since Honorius
                    withdrew his legions. That Englishmen, the famous Alcuin (Ealhwine) at their
                    head, held high places at his court and in his favour was simply part of the
                    wise encouragement which he held out to learning and merit everywhere. But the
                    great Frankish king exercised direct influence, if not supremacy, in several
                    parts of our island. The Scots are, at least by his own annalist, counted among
                    his homagers. Northumberland took back a king at his bidding. A banished
                    West-Saxon prince learned in his school the art of founding empires. But with
                    the great king of the Mercians Charles corresponded as an equal. War was once
                    threatened, but only threatened, between the great potentates of the island and
                    of the mainland. In the next reign Cenwulf found it needful to put it clearly on
                    record that neither the bishop of Rome nor the emperor of Rome had any
                    jurisdiction in his realm of Mercia. These dealings with the continental empire
                    should be marked, both on their own account and because of the light which they
                    throw on some later passages in British history.</p>
                <p>Charles, lord of the western world of Rome, was not fated to become lord of the
                    island world of Britain. But a nearer approach to that character than had yet
                    fallen to . any English prince was in store for the friend and pupil of the
                    great emperor. West-Saxon Ecgberht went back from the Frankish court to do in
                    Britain as nearly as he could what Charles had done in Germany and Gaul. He went
                    back to become the eighth Bretwalda, and more than a Bretwalda. The day of
                    Northumberland and jjιe day of Mercia had passed; the day of Wessex had come.
                    The single reign of Ecgberht (802-837) placed her for ever at the head of the
                    powers of Britain. Immediate king only south of the Thames, Ecgberht stretched
                    his overlordship to the Forth, and, what no Bretwalda had done before him, he
                    handed on his dominion to his successors. But the dominion of Ecgberht must not
                    be mistaken for a kingdom of all England. He was king of the West-Saxons; once
                    only does be call himself King of the English. But the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n296/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0296-0283"/> kingdoms of Kent, Sussex, and Essex were now, as
                    the West-Saxon shires had once been, ruled by under-kings cf the West-Saxon
                    house. In Mercia, Northumberland, and East-Anglia native kings still reigned,
                    but they held their crowns as the men of the West-Saxon overlord. And in neither
                    was the West-Saxon supremacy a mere precarious dominion, like that of the
                    earlier Bretwaldas. Both relations were steps towards more perfect
                    incorporation; they were stages in the process by which Wessex grew into
                    England.</p>
                <p>The name of <hi rend="italic">England</hi> is not yet found in any contemporary
                    writer. It came into use in the course of the next century. In truth, the oldest
                    name for the Teutonic part of Britain is not <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> but
                    <hi rend="italic">Saxony.</hi> This is only what was to be looked for. The lands
                    won by the Teutons would first receive a common name from the Celts of the
                    island, and that name, according to their usage, would naturally be <hi
                    rend="italic">Saxony.</hi> The Teutonic settlers themselves would not give their
                    country a common name till they had reached some degree of political unity; but
                    when they gave it a name, that name was naturally <hi rend="italic"
                    >England.</hi> England, in short, as a political unity, began to be formed in
                    the ninth century; it received its name in the tenth. Now that the various
                    English kingdoms are brought so closely together, we begin to feel the need of a
                    geographical name which may take them all in. Some name is needed, some name was
                    doubtless soon felt to be needed, to distinguish the English kingdoms now united
                    under West-Saxon supremacy from the other parts of the island. The position of
                    Ecgberht could not be so well described as by calling him king of the
                    West-Saxons and lord of ail England. Lord of all Britain he was not, though he
                    came nearer to being so than any prince before him. West-Wales, if not actually
                    incorporated, was brought into thorough dependence, and the princes of
                    North-Wales—that is, Wales in the modern 3ense—were brought to acknowledge the
                    West-Saxon supremacy. The Welsh of Strathclyde, the Picts, and the Scots,
                    remained independent and untouched.</p>
                <p>Thus, though a kingdom of England was mt yet formed, the greatest of all steps
                    had been taken towards forming it. But the work of Ecgberht had stood but for a
                    little while when it seemed to be swept away for ever. Yet while it seemed to be
                    swept away, it was in truth both quickened and strengthened by an event which
                    forms one of the great landmarks in our story, an event which has no parallel
                    since the first settlement of the English in Britain. The English conquest was
                    in some sort wrought over again. Christian Britain was again attacked by heathen
                    invaders, and a large part of it was again brought under heathen rule. The
                    West-Saxon supremacy seemed to vanish away; the West-Saxon kingdom itself was
                    for a moment overcome. But the blows which overcame kingdom and supremacy did in
                    truth only enable Ecgbcrht’s successors again to do Ecgberht’s work more
                    thoroughly.</p>
                <p>The dominion of Ecgberht passed to his son Aethelwulf (837—858), and from him to
                    four of his sons in succession, .Ethelbald, Aethelberht, Aethelred (858 -871),
                    and the more famous Aelfred (871—900). This succession involves a constitutional
                    point; for we hear of a will of Aethelwulf, confirmed by the Witan, by which the
                    order in which his sons were to succeed to the crown was arranged beforehand.
                    There is in this no formal surrender of the right of the nation to choose its
                    king; for the confirmation by the Witan was equivalent to a conditional election
                    in advance. But that the crown could be made the subject of bequest in any shape
                    shows the growth of a whole crowd of ideas which had no place in the elder
                    Teutonic system. We are, to say the least, on the way towards the doctriue that
                    the leadership of men is not an office but a property. This is the first case of
                    any attempt to settle the succession beforehand, and, as in most other cases
                    afterwards, the attempt failed. The sons of Aethelwulf succeeded; but they did
                    not succeed in the order marked out by their father’s will. Another point which
                    marks the increasing intercourse between England and the mainland is the fact
                    that Aethelwulf made the pilgrimage to Rome. More than one king had given up his
                    crown, and had ended his days at Rome; but this is the first case of a reigning
                    king thus absenting himself from his kingdom. On his return also he married a
                    foreign wife, Judith the daughter of Charles the Bald. This is the first
                    recorded case of the kind since the marriage of Aethelberht of Kent; and we
                    shall find only one more in the whole line before the Norman Conquest. As long
                    as England remained purely England, the mothers of English kings were
                    Englishwomen.</p>
                <p>Another point with regard to the succession should be noticed. On the death of
                    Aethelred, Aelfred succeeded, though Aethelred had children living. This is of
                    course simply an instance of the general law of choosing from the royal house,
                    but of choosing only one who was personally qualified to reign. Minors were
                    therefore passed by, as a matter of course, in favour of a full grown uncle or
                    other kinsman. The children thus shut out might or might not be chosen at some
                    future vacancy. The right of Aelfred to his crown was not disputed in his own
                    day, nor has he commonly been branded by later historians with the name of
                    usurper. But it is well to bear in mind that his succession was of exactly the
                    same kind as that of some later kings to whom the name of usurper has been
                    freely applied. In all such cases the mistake comes from forgetting that the
                    strict laws of succession to which we have been used for the last two or three
                    centuries were altogether unknown in the earlier stages of our constitution.</p>
                <p>But the main history of England during these reigns, and indeed for a long time
                    after, gathers round the successive Danish invasions. Christian England was now
                    attacked by the heathen Danes, as Christian Britain had been attacked by the
                    heathen English. But the results in the two cases were widely different. The
                    Danes were not a people altogether foreign to the English; they were of kindred
                    race, and spoke a kindred tongue. Had their inroads begun when the settlements
                    of the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes were still new, they nυght have passed for a
                    fourth branch of the same stock, come to share the spoil with their kinsfolk. As
                    it was, their nearness in blood and speech made them disposed to accept a new
                    religion at the hands of the English, and in the end to merge their own national
                    being in that of the English, in a way in which the English themselves had been
                    in no way disposed to do towards the wholly foreign races among whom they
                    settled. The Danish invasions of England were part of a general movement which
                    about this time began to carry the adventurous people of Scandinavia into all
                    parts of Europe. Of the three great kingdoms into which they settled down about
                    this time, Sweden had little to do with Western Europe; the advance of that
                    power was to the east. But the people of Norway and Denmark ravaged everywhere,
                    and settled in many places, along the coasts of Germany, Gaul, and the British
                    islands. The Northmen founded powerful states, which have an occasional
                    connexion with English history, in Ireland, Orkney, and the Western Islands; but
                    the Scandinavian settlements in England itself were almost wholly Danish in the
                    stricter sense.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>That
                    there were in northern England Northmen, as distinguished from Danes, appears
                    from the record of the commendation of 924 in the Winchester Chronicle. The name
                    <hi rend="italic">Northmen,</hi> at an earlier time, meant the Scandinavian
                    nations generallj'; it is now specially used, to mean the men of Norway. The
                    Danes settled on the eastern coast of Northumberland and East-Anglia; the
                    Northmen would seem tc have made their way into western Yorkshire by way of
                    Cumberland.</p></note> Their <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0297-0284"/> invasions fall naturally into three periods.
                    There is first a time of mere plunder; secondly, a time of local settlement,
                    when Danish dynasties are set up in certain parts of England; lastly, when
                    England, Denmark, and other European powers had grown into something more of
                    definite shape and order, we find an attempt, and for awhile a successful
                    attempt, to place a king of all Denmark on the throne of a kingdom of all
                    England. Of these periods it is the first two only with which we are concerned
                    at this stage, and these two have their exact parallels in the two stages of
                    English invasion in Britain. The first recorded inroad of the Danes in any part
                    of England is placed in Northumberland in 789; but it was not till the latter
                    years of the reign of Ecgberht that their incursions became formidable, at leaβt
                    in southern England. They plundered both in Kent and in Wessex, and they leagued
                    themselves with the West-Welsh to meet a common defeat at the hands of the
                    Bretwalda.</p>
                <p>The actual settlements did not begin till the reign of Aethelred. In 870 the
                    Danes, after ravaging various parts of Northumberland and Mercia, and setting up
                    a puppet king in Bernicia, occupied East-Anglia, whose king, the famous local
                    saint Eadmund, died a martyr. Then came their first great invasion of Wessex,
                    and the battles of the last days of Aethelred and the first days of Aelfred.
                    Then (874-888) Northumberland and Mercia came altogether into the power of the
                    Danes. For a moment they overran Wessex itself, and the realm of Aelfred was
                    confined to the isle of Athelney. But the spirit of the great king never failed,
                    and that of his people rose again. The Danes were driven from Wessex, and the
                    peace of Wedmore settled the relations between the West-Saxon king and the Danes
                    of East·Anglia. A line drawn from north west to south east divided Mercia into
                    two parts. The south western fell to the West-Saxon, the north-eastern to the
                    Dane. The Danish king Guthrum embraced Christianity, and became a precarious and
                    dangerous vassal of the West-Saxon overlord. His actual kingdom lay in
                    East-Anglia; the chief power in Danish Mercia lay in the confederacy of the five
                    boroughs, Lincoln, Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, and Stamford. In all these the
                    Danish settlers seem to have formed a patrician order, holding the English
                    inhabitants in bondage. Deira, with York for its capital, formed a Danish
                    kingdom. In Bernicia English princes still reigned under Danish overlordship. In
                    a large part both of Northumberland and Mercia the land was divided among Danish
                    owners, and not a few places received new Danish names. It might have seemed
                    that the Danish conquest of more than half England was only less thorough than
                    the English conquest of Britain itself.</p>
                <p>But in truth the Danish occupation of northern and eastern England did but make
                    ready the way for the more thorough incorporation of those lands with the
                    West-Saxon kingdom. Ecgberht had established his supremacy over the English
                    powers in those lands. But it was the supremacy of an external master. The
                    Danish settlements gave the West-Saxon kings a wholly new character. Unless we
                    reckon the tributary kingship of Bernicia, all the ancient English kingdoms,
                    with their royal houses, were swept away wherever the Danes established their
                    power. The West-Saxon kings remained the only champions of Christian faith and
                    English nationality. They were now Kings of the English, and they alone. Mark
                    also that, by the treaty between Aelfred and Guthrum, while the West-Saxon king
                    lost as an overlord, he gained as an immediate sovereign The actual West-Saxon
                    dominion, as distinguished from mere West-Saxon supremacy, again reached far
                    beyond the Thames. English Mercia was ruled under Aelfred by an ealdorman of the
                    old royal stock, the husband of his daughter the renowned Aethelflaed. The Lord
                    and Lady of the Mercians held a place intermediate between that of an under-king
                    and an ordinary ealdorman. At the other end of Wessex, Kent and Sussex were
                    completely incorporated, and ceased to be even distinct apanages. The West-Saxon
                    supremacy was more fully established in Wales, and at last, in 893, even the
                    Danes of the north acknowledged it. Aelfred had thus, in name at least, won back
                    the overlordship of Ecgberht, combined with an enlarged immediate kingdom. As
                    that immediate kingdom took in by far the greater part of Saxon England, and
                    little or nothing that was not Saxon, he sometimes bears, neither the narrower
                    style of King of the West-Saxons nor the wider style of King of the English, but
                    the title, almost peculiar and specially appropriate to himself, of King of the
                    Saxons. His overlordship over the heathen Danes was doubtless far less firmly
                    established than Ecgberht’s overlordship had been over their Christian
                    predecessors. But now, in the eyes of the Christian inhabitants of
                    Northumberland and Mercia, the West-Saxon king was no longer a stranger and a
                    conqueror. He had become the champion of their race and faith against their
                    heathen masters. In that character Aelfred himself hardly appeared. The last
                    years of his reign were chiefly taken up in defending Wessex and English Mercia
                    against new’ Danish invasions from without. But this Christian and English
                    championship is the distinct characteristic of the kings who follow him, of his
                    son Eadward the Unconquered (901-925), of his grandsonsAethelstan (925-940),
                    Eadmund (940-946), and Eadred (946-955). Under them Wessex grew into England,
                    and the overlordship grew into the empire of Britain. Eadward waged the war in
                    partnership with his sister the Lady of the Mercians, who ruled alone after the
                    death of her husband, and whose territory was on her death fully incorporated
                    with Wessex. The son and the daughter of Aelfred gradually advanced their
                    frontier, winning battles, fortifying towns, till Eadward, King of the English,
                    held all England south of the Humber as his immediate realm His overlordship was
                    more fully admitted by the Welsh and the Northumbrians, and it was acknowledged
                    for the first time by the Scots and the Strathclyde Welsh, who in 924 chose the
                    English king as father and lord. Under Aethelstan Northumberland was
                    incorporated, and the immediate realm of the one king of the English reached to
                    the Forth. Still both he and his two successors had to fight against endless
                    revolts and rival kings in Northumberland The Danish land was won and lost and
                    won back oveι and over again, till at last under Eadred Northumberland was
                    finally incorporated, and ruled, sometimes by a single earl, sometimes by two,
                    of the king’s appointment. The kingdom of England was now formed</p>
                <p>The first half of the tenth century thus gave the West- ’ Saxon kings aposition
                    in Britain such as no English kings of any kingdom had held before them.
                    Dominant in ' their own island, claiming and, whenever they could, exercising a
                    supremacy over the other princes of the island, their position in the island
                    world of Britain was analogous to the position of the Western emperors in
                    continental Europe. It was in fact an imperial position. As such it was marked
                    by the assumption of the imperial titles, <hi rend="italic">monarchal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">imperator,</hi><hi rend="italic">basιleus. Augustus,</hi> and even
                    <hi rend="italic">Coesar.</hi> These titles were meant at once to assert the
                    imperial supremacy of the English kings within their own world, and to deny any
                    supremacy over Britain on the part of either of the lords of the continental
                    world. When we remember that some both of the Teutonic and Celtic princes of
                    Britain had been the men of Charles the Great, the denial of all supremacy in
                    the Caesars of the mainland was not needless. Indeed that denial was formally
                    made over <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n298/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0298-0285"/> and over again at various time3 down to the reign
                    of Henry VIII.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we see during these reigns the beginning of the process which
                    fixed the modern frontier of England to the north. The Picts and the Scots of
                    Britain now formed what, as regarded their southern neighbours, was a single
                    great kingdom north of Forth and Clyde. In the great fight of Brunanburh in 936
                    the Scots joined the Danes against Aethelstan, and shared in their defeat. After
                    that time the relations of the Scottish kings to the English overlord seem for a
                    long while to have been friendly. During this period the Scottish power began to
                    make its way south of the two great firths. In 945 Eadmund conquered Cumberland.
                    It might not be easy to say exactly what territory is meant by that name; but it
                    was clearly the whole or a part of the ancient Strathclyde. It most likely took
                    in Carlisle and its district, which had not been under direct English rule since
                    the days of Ecgfrith. This territory Eadmund bestowed on Malcolm king of Scots,
                    distinctly as a territorial fief. This is perhaps the earliest case of a grant
                    of that kind in our history. It is something different from the commendation of
                    either Scots or Britons to Eadward in 924. The northern kingdom of the Britons
                    now became the ordinary apanage of the heirs of the Scottish crown. The Scottish
                    royal house, if not the actual Scottish kingdom, thus obtained a great
                    establishment south of the firth of Clyde, and soon afterwards the Scottish
                    kings themselves made their way south of the Forth. In the reign of Eadred,
                    Edinburgh, the border fortress of Northumberland to the north, became a Scottish
                    possession. It is not clear on what terms this acquisition was made, or whether
                    it was made in war or in peace. It is at least as likely, under the
                    circumstances of the time, that it was a peaceful grant. But in any case it was
                    the beginning of the process which brought the lands between Forth and Tweed
                    into the possession of the Scottish kings, and which thereby turned them into
                    English kings of a northern England, which was for a while more English than the
                    southern England itself.</p>
                <p>This period of war and conquest was also a period of legislation and intellectual
                    advancement. In Aelfred we have the noblest name in all English history, the
                    name of him who united more and more varied, virtues than any other recorded
                    ruler. The captain of his people, he was also their lawgiver and their teacher.
                    His laws, the first that can be called a code, laws drawn up by himself and then
                    submitted by him to the approval of his Witan, mark, as we have seen, when they
                    are compared with those of Ine, a time when the distinction of Englishman and
                    Briton had passed away from the West-Saxon kingdom. They are remarkable also for
                    the great mass of scriptural and other religious matter which is brought in
                    whole into their text. The laws of Eadward, of Aethelstan, and of Eadmund
                    follow, and among them we have the text of the treaty between Aelfred and
                    Guthrum, the earliest diplomatic instrument in our language. In all these laws
                    we may trace the growth of the various new ideas which have been already spoken
                    of as having gradually made their way into the older Teutonic system. The king
                    grows greater and greater. Already a sacred, and fast becoming an imperial
                    personage, he is something widely different from the old kings who ruled only
                    over Wight or half of Kent. The increase of his dignity, the increase of the
                    extent of his dominion, raise him at every step above the mass of his people.
                    And as the kingdom grows, the right of the ordinary freeman to a place in the
                    general assembly of the nation becomes more and more shadowy. That assembly
                    shrinks more and more into an assembly of bishops, ealdormen, and king’s thegns,
                    made ever and anon more splendid by the appearance of vassal princes and kings.
                    As the king grows in greatness, his immediate followers grow also. The old
                    nobility of the earls is finally supplanted by the new nobility of the thegns.
                    The result of this change is the general depression of the churls as a class,
                    while it becomes easier for this or that churl to raise himself to thegn’s rank.
                    On the other hand, the lowest class of all begins to have its lot lightened. The
                    spirit of Christianity, if it does not yet venture to preach the emancipation of
                    the slave, brings in provisions which lessen the rigour of the ancient law. And
                    we now find the first of a series of well meant, though for the most part vain,
                    attempts at least to hinder the slave from being sold out of his native land.
                    Commerce and discovery are fostered. Thegn’s rank is held out as a reward to the
                    successful trader by sea. Intercourse with foreign countries becomes closer and
                    closer. No foreign wife shares the throne of the <hi rend="italic">basileus</hi>
                    of Britain; but the sisters of glorious Aethelstan are given in marriage to the
                    greatest princes of Western Europe. It was a great age for England, an age of
                    great men and great events. The line of our hero kings, of Eadward the
                    Unconquered, of Aethelstan the Glorious, and of Eadmund the Doer-of-great-deeds,
                    is only less famous than it should be, because even their names must yield to
                    the unequalled glory of their grandfather and father. Towards the end of the
                    period we see, for the first time in English history, the person of a great
                    minister, the wise counsellor of wise kings. Our first recorded statesman who
                    was not a king is, as might be looked for in that age, a churchman, the great
                    Dunstan, the guide of England through many stirring years of war and peace. The
                    Church had made the English a nation; a great churchman was now foremost in
                    making England a kingdom. A kingdom she now became, not yet indivisible, but
                    still one. But one and strong and glorious as England stood in the central years
                    of the tenth century, her unity and strength and glory were bought in no small
                    degree by the loss of the ancient freedom of her people.</p>
                <p>In literature this was a time which saw nothing short of the beginning of English
                    prose. For a long time, as we have seen, the special home of learning and
                    culture in England was in the north. Wessex had her scholars too, King Ine’s
                    kinsman Ealdhelm at their head; but the land of Baeda took the lead. In the
                    confusions of the latter years of the eighth century the light of Northumbrian
                    learning seems to have died out; yet even at the time of Aelfred’s accession the
                    great king places the greatest lack of learning south of the Thames. In the
                    interval of peace between the wars at the beginning and the wars at the end of
                    his reign, Aelfred largely devoted himself to wipe out this stain. He was
                    himself the first English prose writer on a great scale; but his writings, in
                    accordance with the modest and practical bent of his mind, were no displays of
                    original genius, but translations, or rather paraphrases, of such Latin works,
                    both on divine and on secular subjects, as he thought were fitted for the
                    improvement of his people. But above auything that Aelfred wrote himself stands
                    the really greatest literary work of his reign, the beginning of the English
                    Chronicle as it now stands. The fragmentary <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    chronicles of earlier times were put together; the history of Baeda and the
                    records of other lands were pressed into the service: the work became
                    contemporary in the minute and brilliant narrative of Aelfred’s own reign. From
                    his day it goes on, sometimes full, sometimes meagre, sometimes a dry record of
                    names and dates, sometimes rising to the highest flight of the prose picture or
                    of the heroic lay, but in one shape or another never failing us, till the pen
                    dropped from the hand of the monk of Peterborough who recorded the coming of
                    Henry of Anjou. We, and we alone among the nations of Western Europe, can read
                    our own <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n299/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0299-0286"/> story from the beginning in our own tongue in
                    which we were born. But it must be borne in mind that, as we go on, we 8hall
                    find that the English Chronicle 13 not one chronicle but many. The record which
                    began at the beginning of Aelfred was in the eleventh century continued in
                    various monasteries, and the later parts of the several copies must be looked
                    on, not as copies of a single work with some place3 where they differ, but as
                    separate works which have some matter in common. The tale is told in different
                    ways, with much difference of local feeling and even of political creed. The
                    different chronicles stop at different periods. That of Peterborough, as we have
                    hinted, stops suddenly in 1154.</p>
                <p>England under Aelfred was a land where foreign merit was welcome, as under
                    Charles the Great English merit had been welcome in other lands. The Briton
                    Asser, the Old-Saxon John, the Frankish Grimbald, received at the West-Saxon
                    court the same reception which Ealhwine had met with at the hands of the mighty
                    Frank. Learning now prospered; the monasteries were schools; but the native
                    tongue flourished also. Of the wars of Eadward and Aethelflaed the Chronicle
                    gives us a full military narrative; in the following reigns the prose entries
                    are meagre, but we get in their stead the glorious lay of Brunauburh and the
                    shorter song of the deliverance of the Five Boroughs. Towards the end of our
                    present period, Dunstan, the great statesman, began to appear as an
                    ecclesiastical reformer. Hie name is connected with the movement of the last
                    half of the tenth century for enforcing a stricter discipline on the monasteries
                    and for substituting mouks for secular priests iu many cathedral and other
                    churches. The English clergy, even those who formed collegiate bodies, were fond
                    of the separate, and not uncommonly married, life of the secular priest. This
                    supposed laxity now gave way in several episcopal churches to the strict
                    Benedictine rule. Hence came the usage, almost but not quite peculiar to
                    England, by which the bishop had, as his diocesan council and the ministers of
                    his own special church, a body of men who had professedly renounced all the
                    affairs of this world. That Dunstan shared in this movement there is no doubt.
                    But it would be hard to show from real history that he was foremost in the
                    movement; aud it is far more certain that no merely ecclesiastical reform was
                    the foremost object in Dunstan’s policy. The unity and the greatness of England
                    were the first objects of the statesman whom Glastonbury gave to England.</p>
                <p>Under Eadred the unity of England was formed. On his death the newly-built fabric
                    seemed to break in pieces. The days of the grandsons of Aelfred, like the days
                    of his brothers, were days when brothers succeeded one another after short
                    reigns, and died for the most part childless. When Eadred died, there was no
                    other son of Eadward the Unconquered to succeed him; nor does there seem to have
                    been in the more distant branches of the royal family any one likely to command
                    the unanimous voice of the nation. For a man who, though of kingly descent, was
                    not the son of a king to come forward as a candidate for the crown would hardly
                    have been endured, except in the case of one who held a commanding personal
                    position, such as was held by no man in the realm save the mighty churchman.
                    England had therefore more than once during this age to risk the woes which are
                    denounced against the land whose king is a child. And the realm so newly united
                    risked the dangers not only of minority but of division. The young sons of
                    Eadmund, passed by according to ordinary rule on the death of their father,
                    succeeded, for want of better candidates, on the death of their uncle Eadred.
                    The elder, Eadwig, received Wessex as his immediate kingdom; tho younger,
                    Eadgar, reigned over Northumberland and Mercia as under-king. The division was
                    followed by a period, short, confused, and obscure, but of the highest
                    importance both on its constitutional and on its ecclesiastical side. The facts
                    which stand out without doubt are that Eadwig was the enemy of Dunstan and that
                    Eadgar was his friend; that in 957 the kingdom of England was altogether divided
                    by the Mercians and Northumbrians declaring their under-king Eadgar full king in
                    his own right; that in 959 the kingdom was again united by the death of Eadwig
                    and the succession of Eadgar to the whole realm. But the causes which
                    immediately led to these events are told with every kindof contradiction; the
                    characters of the actors are painted in the most opposite colours. It is clear
                    however that with the accession of Eadgar the party of the monks triumphed. It
                    is clear also that under Eadgar’s rule the land enjoyed sixteen years of
                    unparalleled peace and of unparalleled prosperity. During his reigu no word of
                    foreign invasion was breathed, and the two or three disturbances within the
                    island were of slight consequence. The well-known picture of the <hi
                    rend="italic">lasilens</hi> of Britain rowed by eight vassal kings on the Dee,
                    even if some of its details may be legendary, at least sets before us the
                    popular conception of the dominion of Eadgar the Peaceful. On the other hand,
                    when we turn to the personal character of the two brothers, it is dangerous to
                    accept, without the closest examination, either the crimes which the monks lay
                    to the charge of Eadwig or the crimes which the gleemen lay to the charge of
                    Eadgar. At no time in our early history did England hold a higher position in
                    the world in general. And when Old-Saxon Otto wore the crown of Rome, and
                    West-Saxon Eadgar, in some sort his nephew, reigned over the island empire of
                    Britain, the Saxon name had reached the highest point of its glory.</p>
                <p>The reign of Eadgar, there can be no doubt, did much for the unity of England. By
                    birth a king of the south, he owed his crown to the men of the north. He
                    strictly preserved the distinct lawsand customs to which the great divisions of
                    the kingdom, now beginning to be distinguished as West-Saxon, Mercian, and
                    Danish, were severally attached. Commerce and intercourse with foreign countries
                    is encouraged. The ecclesiastical reform led to increased splendour in
                    ecclesiastical buildings, and the land was covered with minsters built on a
                    scale before unknown. The kingdom thus.built up and strengthened had presently
                    to undergo the shock of a disputed election for the crown. Again the immediate
                    royal family contained none but minors, tho two sons of Eadgar, Eadward and
                    Aethelred. As far as we can see, Aethelred was supported by the party of the
                    monks and Eadward by their enemies. Dunstan therefore distinctly sacrificed his
                    party to his country when he brought about the election of Eadward, the elder of
                    the boys, whose minority would therefore be the shorter. Hie short reign
                    (975-979) was ended by his murder, done, there can be little doubt, at the
                    biddiug of his step-mother Aelfthryth, the Elfrida of romance. Her young son
                    Aethelred then entered on the saddest and most shameful reign in our annals. His
                    time of thirty-seven years (979-1016) forms the most marked contrast to the
                    short and vigorous reigns of the heroes who opened the century. For the first
                    nine years of this unhappy time, Dunstan still lived; he was taken away before
                    the fulness of evil came. . The main feature of this time is the renewal of the
                    Danish invasions, which, after some years of mere plundering incursions, take
                    their third form, that of a distinct political conquest, the establishment of a
                    Danish king on the throne of all England. The constitutional lesson of this time
                    is that, limited as the powers of an English king were by law, incapable as he
                    was of doing any important act without the consent of his Witan, the difference
                    between a good aud a bad king was something which words cannot set forth. It was
                    for the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n300/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0300-0287"/> Witan to pass decrees; but it was for the king to
                    put them in force; and under Aethelrod nothing good ever was put in force. The
                    unready king—that is the king without <hi rend="italic">rede</hi> or
                    counsel—seems to have been incapable of any settled or vigorous plan of action.
                    He showed energy now and then in needless and fruitless enterprises; but under
                    him the kingdom never showed an united front towards the common enemy. His only
                    policy, the only policy of his cowardly or traitorous advisers, was the
                    self-destroying policy of buying off the invaders with money. The invaders are
                    met at London, at Maldon, at Exeter, with the highest valour and conduct on the
                    part of the leaders and people of particular cities and districts; but it is
                    always isolated cities and districts which resist. Such local efforts were
                    naturally fruitless; the local force is either defeated by superior numbers, or,
                    if victorious, it has, through want of concert with other parts of the kingdom,
                    no means of following up its victory. Through a warfare like this, carried on
                    year after year, the nation at last lost heart as well as its king. Local
                    jealousies, hushed under the vigorous rule of earlier kings, now rose again. It
                    is emphatically said that one shire would not help other. Under such a reign the
                    efforts of the best men in the land were thwarted, and the places of highest
                    power fell to the worst men. The successive advisers of Aethelred appear as a
                    succession of traitors, who sold him and his kingdom to the enemy. The last of
                    them, Eadric, whom Aethelred made earl of the Mercians and married to one of his
                    many daughters, plays the chief part in the revolution which in the end placed
                    the Dane on the English throne.</p>
                <p>The staple then of the history of this time is foreign warfare, and that mostly
                    warfare which takes the shape of invasion of England. But this time is marked
                    also by foreign intercourse of another kind, intercourse which may at the time
                    have seemed of no great importance, but which helped, together with the Danish
                    invasions, to lead the way to events greater even than the Danish conquest
                    itself, English political intercourse with other lands had hitherto been mainly
                    with the Franks in Germany and Gaul, and with their successors in Germany, the
                    Saxon emperors. In the course of the tenth century, the new powers of France and
                    Normandy had sprung up in what had been the western or Gaulish part of the
                    Frankish dominion. The king of the French at Paris was cut off from the sea by
                    his vassal the duke of the Normans at Rouen. While Normandy was a practically
                    independent state, there could be hardly any dealings, in war or in
                    peace,between England and France. But it was through its connexion with Normandy
                    that England became entangled in the affairs of France, and the connexion
                    between England and Normandy begins under Aethelred. England and France might
                    doubtless in the end have become rival powers in some other way; but the way in
                    which they actually did become rival powers was through a chain of events of
                    which we have now reached the beginning. Two quarrels between Aethelred and the
                    Norman duke Richard were ended by a peace and a marriage (1002) between
                    Aethelred and Richard’s daughter Emma. Here was the beginning of the causes
                    which led to the Norman Conquest. Emma brought with her Norman followers, some
                    of whom were trusted with commands in England. The kindred between the ruling
                    families of the two lauds which came of the marriage of Emma led to increased
                    intercourse between Normandy and England, to Norman interference with English
                    affairs, to the settlement of Normans in England, to the claims of Duke William
                    and to the Norman Conquest. When Normandy and England were under a common
                    sovereign, France became in some sort a neighbour and an enemy of England. The
                    rivalry between Normandy and France led to a rivalry between England and France,
                    and that rivalry went on after France had swallowed up Normandy. Thus not only
                    the Norman Conquest, and the internal changes which followed it, but the French
                    wars of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and the long abiding enmity
                    between Englishmen and Frenchmen, have their direct source in the events of the
                    reign of Aethelred.</p>
                <p>This last series of Danish invasions began, in the form of mere plundering
                    incursions, in 980. In 991 a formidable invasion, Norwegian rather than Danish,
                    and in which the famous Norwegian king Olaf Tryggvesson seems to have had a
                    share, was marked by two opposite events, each alike characteristic of the time.
                    Brihtnoth, the ealdorman of the East-Saxons, died with his thegns around him in
                    the fight of Maldon, and his fall is recorded in one of the noblest of Teutonic
                    battle-songs. Aethelred’s earl, as he calls himself in the song, met the
                    invaders with steel; but Aethelred himself had no arms but gold. The year of
                    Brihtnoth’s death was the very one in which the invaders were for the first time
                    bought off with money. In 994 came a great joint invasion under the two kings of
                    the north, Olaf of Norway and Swegen of Denmark. They were beaten off by the
                    Londoners. Aethelred again bought peace; Olaf, converted to Christianity, kept
                    the peace and vanishes from the story; but the war went on, if not with Swegen
                    himself, at least with his Danes. After eight years of invasions, payments,
                    brave local resistance, and inaction and treason at head quarters, came the
                    general massacre of the Danes in England on the day of Saint Brice in 1002. This
                    of course does not mean the slaughter of all the men of Danish descent in
                    England, but simply the slaughter of those men of the invading host who had
                    stayed in England, under cover of a treaty. Then came in 1003 a more terrible
                    invasion by Swegen in person, when Exeter was betrayed to him by a Norman
                    follower of the queen’s. A valiant resistance in East-Anglia checked the
                    invasion at the time, and Swegen himself did not appear again for some years. In
                    the next stage, in 1006, the Danes first ravaged the inland part of Wessex. In
                    1010 comes the invasion of Thurkill; and the battle of Ringmere near Ipswich
                    marks the last armed resistance. In 1013 Swegen came again. All strength and all
                    hope was now gone; Aethelred was deposed, and took refuge in Normandy, and the
                    Danish king was acknowledged as king—though native writers choose rather to call
                    him tyrant—over all England.</p>
                <p>This Danish conquest of England, taking the form of a forced election of the
                    conqueror, is something widely different alike from mere plundering incursions
                    and from mere local settlements. It shows that we have got into the age of great
                    powers. The king of an established king dom adds another crown to the one which
                    he has already, and strives to give his conquest an outward show of legality.
                    Swegen’s conquest is in this way almost aliterai foreshadowing of the more
                    famous conquest of William. But Swegen’s conquest was only for a moment; he died
                    the next year; his Danish host chose his younger son Cnutashis successor; the
                    English Witan voted the restoration of Aethelred. In Denmark, it must carefully
                    be marked, Swegen was succeeded by his elder son Harold. Cnut was chosen king
                    over England only. A Danish dynasty was to reign in England; it was not yet
                    ruled that Denmark and England were to have a single king. The war was now
                    renewed between Cnut and Eadmund, surnamed Irouside, one of the younger sons of
                    Aethelred. Englishmen had again a hero at their head, and, under his guidance,
                    the whole state of affairs was changed. In the midst of this second war, in
                    1016, Aethelred died. A double election took place; Cnut and Eadmund were chosen
                    to succeed by two distinct bodies of the English Witan. Eadmund, it would seem,
                    was chosen, at such a <pb break="no"

                    elder brother Aethelstan.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This is merely a probability, not an ascertained fact; but several
                    circumstances point to such a supposition, there is nothing to contradict it,
                    and it would explain several difficulties. See <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    Norman Conquest,</hi> i. 691, ed. 3.</p></note> A series of battles followed, in
                    which Eadmund had decidedly the upper hand, till the last fight at Assandûn,
                    that is, Ashington in Essex, was lost by the treason of Eadric. The kingdom was
                    divided; Eadmund took the south with a formal supremacy; Cnut took the north.
                    The division was hardly made when Eadmund died mysteriously, by the practice of
                    Eadric, as men deemed. And now another and final election gave Cnut the crown of
                    the whole realm.</p>
                <p>The personal character of Cnut, his gradual change from a barbarian conqueror
                    into a king who stood beside Aelfred in the memory of his people, makes him one
                    of the most interesting studies in our whole history. But we have here to deal
                    mainly with the political results of his accession. England was now brought more
                    closely than ever into relations with other parts of the world. But those
                    relations took a shape which was altogether new and unexpected. Cnut was a
                    conqueror, and his establishment in England was a conquest, so far as that a
                    foreign king made his way to the English crown at the sword’s point. And, when
                    he had worn the crown, he did not scruple to secure it by the death or
                    banishment of such Englishmen as he thought dangerous to him, either on account
                    of their connexion with the former royal house or on any other ground. But, when
                    he had once made himself safe on the throne, there was nothing more of the
                    conqueror about him. England was neither oppressed nor degraded under his rule.
                    His government, his laws, were framed after the pattern of those of the ancient
                    kings. He sent home his Danish army, keeping only a body of chosen guards, the
                    famous housecarls. These were the first standing army known in England, a body
                    of picked men, Danes, Englishmen, or brave men from any quarter. Cnut gradually
                    displaced the Danes whom he had at first placed in high offices, and gave them
                    English successors. He raised an Englishman, the renowned Godwine, to a place
                    second only to kingship, with the new title of Earl of the West-Saxons. In her
                    foreign relations, England, under her Danish king, was in no sense a dependency
                    of Denmark. England was the centre, Winchester was the imperial city, of a
                    northern empire, which rivalled those of the East and the West. Cnut, it must be
                    remembered, was chosen to the crown of England first of all, while still very
                    young. To that crown he added the crown of Denmark, on the death or deposition
                    of his brother Harold. He won Norway, which had revolted against his father,
                    from its king Olaf; and he seems to have established his power over part of
                    Sweden and other parts of the Baltic lands. But all these were acquisitions made
                    by one who was already “King of all England;”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Up to this time the title is always “King of
                    the English,” never “King of England.” Cnut uses the special style of “King of
                    all Englaud,” “Rex totius Angliae.” This is not strictly a territorial style;
                    still less is it the style of a conqueror. The object is to distinguish his
                    kingship over all England from his earlier divided kingship when the land was
                    parted between him and Eadmund.</p></note> they were largely won by English
                    valour, and the complaint in Denmark and elsewhere was that Cnut made his
                    northern kingdoms subordinate to England, and preferred Englishmen rather than
                    natives to high offices in them. At home, after the first years of his reign,
                    his rule was one of perfect peace. In 1018 a Scottish victory at Carham secured
                    all Lothian to the Scottish king. This was the carrying out of the work which
                    had been begun by the Scottish annexation of Edinburgh. Whether there had been
                    an earlier grant, or an earlier conquest, of Lothian is uncertain. Of its
                    Scottish occupation from this time there is no doubt. But in 1031 Malcolm of
                    Scotland, and two under-kings, the famous M’acbeth and one described as Jehmarc,
                    did full homage to the King of all England. The northern king thus held his
                    dominions in three distinct forms. Tn Scotland proper he was simply under the
                    terms of the old commendation. Cumberland, whatever extent of territory comes
                    under that name, was strictly a territorial fief. Lothian was an earldom held
                    within the kingdom of England.</p>
                <p>The position of Cnut, both as a man and as a king, derives a special interest
                    from his being a convert to Christianity. His father Swegen was an apostate. He
                    had been baptized in his childhood or youth; but he cast aside his new faith,
                    and carried war into England as a heathen conqueror. His son Cnut was baptized
                    in the course of his English wars, and he appears in English history as a
                    Christian king, a devout king, a special favourite of the Church and her
                    ministers. His laws are strong ou all ecclesiastical points, and they
                    contain—what was needful in his day, but which had not been needful, in Wessex
                    at least, for some ages—a crowd of provisions for the suppression of heathen
                    worship. In Denmark he appears as completing the conversion of that kingdom
                    which had already begun. His newly born religious zeal led him, like Aethelwulf,
                    to make the pilgrimage to Rome. His reception there by the pope, the emperor,
                    and the Burgundian king, helped to raise the position of England and her
                    sovereign in foreign eyes; but it had no other political result.</p>
                <p>One change, the fruit of which was chiefly seen a little later, was made by Cnut
                    in the administration of the kingdom. As far as we can see, the rule bad
                    hitherto been for each shire to have its own ealdorman. One ealdorman sometimes
                    held several shires, and the arrange ment, at any rate under Aethelred, was
                    confused and fluctuating; under Cnut it was organized in a new shape. Four great
                    chiefs were set over the four great divisions of the kingdom, Wessex,
                    East-Anglia, Mercia, and Northumberland. The Danish title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jarl</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Earl,</hi> hitherto used only in Northumberland,
                    was now substituted for ealdorman. We find also smaller earls of one or more
                    shires; but it is plain that these were subordinate to these great governors.
                    Wessex, above all, received now for the first time, in the person of God wine, a
                    governor distinct from her king.</p>
                <p>The relations between England and Normandy now get closer and more important.
                    Aethelred had found shelter in the Norman court with his brother-in-law Duke
                    Richard. The young Aethelings, Aelfred and Eadward, the sons of Aethelred and
                    Emma, were brought up at the court of their uncle. But, strange to say, their
                    mother Emma entered into a second marriage with Cnut himself, who must have been
                    many years younger than she was. With Richard of Normandy Cnut kept unbroken
                    peace; but Richard’s more adventurous son Robert asserted the rights of his
                    cousins and threatened—perhaps attempted—an invasion of England on their behalf.
                    Robert presently died on his famous pilgrimage. In the same year (1035), Cnut
                    himself died, still in the prime of life, after a reign of only eighteen years
                    from his final election.</p>
                <p>Such a dominion as the northern empire of Cnut was in its own nature ephemeral.
                    Such a power‘can hardly endure beyond the life of its founder. The dominions of
                    Charles the Great, geographically continuous and bound together both by Roman
                    and by Frankish traditions, could not be kept under one ruler. Much less could
                    the scattered empire of great islands and peninsulas which Cnut had brought
                    under his power. Not only did his empire break in pieces, but his kingdom of
                    England was again, for the last time, divided. Of his empire he himself had
                    decreed <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n302/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0302-0289"/> the partition. He had in some sort begun it in
                    his lifetime. His sons had been sent to reign as under-kings in Denmark and
                    Norway. As his successor in England he named Harthacnut, his son by Emma, who at
                    his death was under-king in Denmark. But the succession to the English crown was
                    disputed. Godwine and the West-Saxons asserted the claims of Harthacnut,
                    according to his father’s will. Mercia and Northumberland declared fur Cnut’s
                    doubtful or illegitimate son Harold. A civil war might have been looked for; but
                    a decree of the Witan divided the kingdom between the two. candidates.
                    Harthacnut, now king of the West-Saxons, tarried in Denmark, and left his
                    English kingdom to the care of Emma and Godwine. Now, and not under Cnut, the
                    ΛVest-Saxon realm seemed to be dealt with as a province of Denmark. The offended
                    subjects of Harthacnut voted the deposition of their non resident king, and the
                    crown of the whole realm passed to Harold. Since that day England has been an
                    united kingdom. Its crown has often been disputed and struggled for in arms; but
                    every claimant has been a claimant of the whole kingdom. The division of England
                    between two kings has never been seriously proposed since the deposition of
                    Harthacnut. The very thought of such a thing had altogether passed out of men’s
                    minds before the end of the century with which we are now dealing.</p>
                <p>The divided reign of Harold and Harthacnut was marked by an event which is told
                    in as many and as contradictory shapes as any event in our early history. But it
                    is certain that Aelfred, the elder of the two Aethelings who were living in
                    banishment in Normandy, came over to England to make an attempt on the crown.
                    The case is an exact parallel to the coming of the two Stewart pretenders seven
                    hundred years later. As Aelfred landed on the south coast, his immediate design
                    must have been on the kingdom of Harthacnut; but he came, in some way or other,
                    into the power of Harold. His Norman companions were put to cruel deaths; the
                    Aetheling himself was blinded, and died soon after. Such dealings are quite
                    contrary to either the English or the Norman practice of the age. It shows that
                    the son of Cnut, unlike his father, retained the full spirit of a Scandinavian
                    pirate. That Earl Godwine had a share in the crime was rumoured in his own day;
                    but, as the tale is commonly told, it is absolutely impossible. If his guilt was
                    asserted by some, it was carefully denied by others; he was tried on the charge,
                    and was solemnly acquitted; and, in the state of our evidence on the subject, be
                    is entitled to the benefit of that acquittal. The reign of Harold was short. On
                    his death in 1040, Harthacnut was chosen to the whole kingdom. A son of Emma,
                    therefore a half brother of the surviving Aetheling Eadward, he sent for that
                    prince to his court. But Harthacnut proved as worthless and brutal as Harold,
                    and his reign, like Harold’s, was short. On his death in 1042, the English
                    nation were thoroughly tired of Danish rule. The memory of Cnut could not
                    outweigh the infamy of his two sons. There was still a Danish party, whose
                    candidate was Swegen, the nephew of Cnut through his sister Estrith, a prince
                    who afterwards ruled Denmark with consummate prudence. But the English people
                    had made up their minds to go back to the old kingly stock of the West-Saxons.
                    In two distinct elections the nation chose the Aetheling Eadward, an unwilling
                    candidate, recommended by his birth. But at such a moment English and kingly
                    birth outweighed every other consideration. ’ It should be also remarked that
                    Eadward, like so many other kings, was chosen over the head of a nephew, who,
                    according to modern ideas, was the direct heir. This was another Eadward, the
                    son of his elder brother Eadmund Ironside. But he was far away in Hungary and
                    none thought of him.</p>
                <p>The election of Eadward was in some sort the beginning of the Norman Conquest.
                    The English nation had chosen Eadward, who seemed an Englishman, ratheι than
                    Swegen, who seemed a foreigner. But Eadward was in truth far more of a foreigner
                    than Swegen. Born in England, but taken to Normandy in his childhood, he was in
                    speech and feeling far more Norman than English. His monastic virtues wou him
                    the reputation of a saint and the title of Confessor, but no man could have been
                    less fitted to wear the crown of England in such an age. His reign falls into
                    two parts. Elected mainly by the influence of Godwine, Eadward married his
                    benefactor’s daughter, and raised his sons to earldoms. But the greatness of the
                    West-Saxon earls was looked on with more or less jealousy by central and
                    northern England, or at least by the earls who ruled over them. According to the
                    division of Cnut, Northumberland was ruled by the Danish Siward, Mercia by
                    Leofric, seemingly a descendant of the ancient kings of Mercia. Leofric himself
                    was, as a party leader, eminently moderate aud conciliatory; but the rivalry
                    between his house and the house of Godwine formed a marked feature in the
                    reign.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the king himself filled every place that he could with Norman
                    favourites, who plotted against Englishmen of every district aud party. Above
                    all, the king was under the influence of the Norman Robert, a monk of Jumiéges,
                    whom he raised successively to the bishopric of London and the archbishopric of
                    Canterbury. The influence of strangers was now at its height; so was their
                    iusolence. Against the king’s foreign favourites no justice could be had.
                    Godwine and his sons took up arms in the cause of the nation (1051). He was
                    induced to abide by the decision of a national assembly, by which he and his
                    sons were banished. The power of the strangers now seemed secure. William, duke
                    of the Normans, a kinsman of Eadward through his mother, visited Eadward; and it
                    was most likely now that Eadward made to him that promise of the succession to
                    the crown on which William afterwards founded his claim to succeed him. It
                    seemed as if the Normau conquest of England had been already brought about
                    without slash or blow. The king was Norman in feeling; he was surrounded by
                    Norman courtiers; Normans and other men of French speech held high offices and
                    great estates. The peaceful succession of the Norman duke to the English crown
                    seemed far from unlikely. But all this was only on the surface. It is needless
                    to show that a king of the English had no right to bequeath his crown. The
                    utmost that he could do was to recommend a candidate to the Witan, and their
                    choice was, under all ordinary circumstances, confined to the royal house.
                    William.himself might doubtless see through all this; but his kindred to
                    Eadward, <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> the bequest of Eadward in his favour,
                    worthless as either was in point of English law, were advantages which he well
                    knew how to turn to his own purposes.</p>
                <p>A peaceful conquest of this kind, had such a thing been possible, would have been
                    an unmixed evil. When the actual Norman Conquest came, its final results were on
                    the whole for good. But that was because the violent overthrow of our national
                    freedom didin effect breathe a new life into the nation. It called forth the
                    spirit of Englishmen, and step by step we won back more than we had lost. But
                    had the Normanizing schemes of the Confessor been carried out, the ancient
                    freedom would have been undermined rather than overthrown; there would have been
                    less to call forth the full strength of antagonistic feelings, and England
                    might, without knowing it, have sunk to the level of continental states. It is
                    therefore not only in the patriotic view of the moment, but in the
                    longest-sighted view of general history, that we set down the return of Godwine
                    and his sons in the year after their banishment<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n303/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0303-0290"/> as one of the great events of our history. They
                    came in arms; but the nation received them with all gladness, and the army which
                    the king had brought together refused to fight against the deliverers. The
                    restoration of Godwine and his sons, and the banishment of the archbishop and of
                    a crowd of other Normans, was decreed in a national assembly which was one of
                    the most memorable in English history. The old Teutonic constitution revived. At
                    such a moment the Witenagem&lt;5t ceased to be a mere gathering of the chief men
                    of the realm. The nation itself came together. Such a name may fairly be given
                    to an assembly made up of the citizens of London and of the two armies which had
                    refused to fight against one another. This is the most conspicuous among several
                    instances which show that, narrow as the constitution of the national assembly
                    had become in ordinary practice, the rights of the common freemen were only
                    dormant, and could still be made good whenever circumstances were favourable for
                    making them good. It should be noticed also that this aπned assembly of the
                    nation took upon itself to depose an archbishop, and seemingly to nominate his
                    successor. So to do was, there can be no doubt, fully within the powers of an
                    English national assembly. But the breach of all ecclesiastical rule, as
                    ecclesiastical rule was understood on the continent, was turned by Norman
                    cunning into another count against England and her deliverers.</p>
                <p>Godwine died the year after his return, and his place in the kingdom was taken by
                    his son Harold. His policy was one of conciliation. The king was allowed to keep
                    his personal favourites about him; but the Norman influence in public affairs
                    was stopped. On the other hand, Harold cultivated the friendship of Germany, and
                    many Lotharingian churchmen were promoted in England. The Welsh were now again
                    formidable, having been united under a vigorous prince named Gruffydd ap
                    Llywelyn. After some victories over other English commanders, the Britons were
                    at last brought to more complete dependence by Harold himself, in a war in which
                    Gruffydd was killed by his own people. Earlier than this, the Northumbrian earl
                    Siward had overcome Macbeth, and had restored the Scottish crown to Malcolm, the
                    heir of the former kings.</p>
                <p>England thus, under the administration of Harold, held a high place at home and
                    abroad. Still there were several sources of weakness, all of which the Norman
                    knew how to make use of. When the Norman archbishop Robert was deposed and
                    banished, his English successor Stigand was looked on at Rome as an usurper of
                    the see. In the early years of Eadward, Roman iufluence had greatly grown in
                    England, and the canonical scruple about Stigand’s appointment was shared by
                    many at home. And when at last Harold procured the acknowledgment of Stigand
                    from Pope Benedict X., matters were only made worse; for Benedict himself was
                    presently declared to be an usurper. It was of more importance still that Harold
                    himself was alleged to have entered into some personal engagements with Duke
                    William. The tale, which comes to us only from the Norman writers, is told with
                    so much contradiction that it is impossible to get at the exact truth. The
                    Normans gave out that Harold was sent by Eadward to announce· his bequest of the
                    crown to William, that be did homage to William, engaged to marry his daughter,
                    and promised to promote his succession at Eadward’s death and to give him
                    immediate possession of the castle of Dover. This tale is altogether impossible;
                    but it is very likely that Harold was shipwrecked on the shore of Ponthieu and
                    imprisoned by its count Guy; that he was released by the interference of Duke
                    William; that, in return for this favour, he helped him in his war with the
                    Bretons; that he promised—though an older man than Duke William—to marry his
                    daughter; and that he did an act of formal homage to his intended father-in-law
                    and temporary military commander. Here is most likely the germ of the story, a
                    story about which the contemporary English writers are significantly silent,
                    while the Normans improve it into such forms as suited their own purposes. It is
                    plain that the canonical question about Stigand, and the story of Harold’s oath,
                    gave every opportunity, when the time came, to represent the English as a
                    sacrilegious and schismatic people, and their ruler as a man faithless to his
                    oath.</p>
                <p>While these sources of danger were growing up abroad, a third source was growing
                    up in England itself. The rivalry between the West-Saxon and the Mercian,
                    between the house of Godwine and the house of Leofric, went on. The character of
                    Leofric himself is without stain; but his son Aelfgar did not scruple to ally
                    himself with the Welsh against England. Outlawed and restored, he held his
                    father’s earldom of Mercia till his death, when it passed to his son Eadwine.
                    But, in the latter days of Eadward, all the rest of England was under the
                    government of the sons of Godwine. Of these Tostig had succeeded Siward in
                    Northumberland. He was a personal favourite of the king, and his appointment may
                    well have been King Eadward’s own act. In the last year of Eadward’s reign the
                    Northumbrians deposed Tostig, and chose as their earl Morkere, the brother of
                    Eadwine. Rather than plunge the country into a civil war, Harold confirmed the
                    choice of the Northumbrians. Tostig went into foreign lauds to complain of his
                    brother, and to plot against his country. Harold thus drew on himself the enmity
                    of his brother, without winning the gratitude of the sons of Aelfgar.</p>
                <p>Such were the threefold dangers which threatened England when Eadward died,
                    January 5, 1066, while the Witan were assembled at Westminster for the Christmas
                    feast. Eadward was childless, and the question of the succession must have been
                    in men’s minds during the wholo of his reign. That he promised the crown to
                    William at the time of the duke’s visit is, as we have seen, very likely. But
                    such thoughts passed away under the administration of Harold. Eadward sent for
                    his nephew Eadward from Hungary, clearly designing him as his successor. Tho
                    younger Eadward came to England and died. He left two daughters, and a son
                    Eadgar, young and of little promise, who was at Eadward’s death the only male
                    left in the royal family. In such a strait, it was needful to look for a king
                    beyond the royal family. Eadward on his death had recommended Harold to the
                    choice of the electors, a recommendation which was willingly accepted. Harold
                    was chosen and crowned, taking care to avoid auy question as to the validity of
                    the crowning rite, by having it performed, not by Stigand, but by Ealdred
                    archbishop of York. The Northumbrians for a moment refused to acknowledge the
                    election of the new king; but he won them over by his presence and the eloquence
                    of his friend Wulfstan bishop of Worcester. It was most likely at the same time
                    that he tried to win the northern earls to his side by a marriage with their
                    sister Ealdgyth. This was a direct breach of his promise to William; and, as
                    Ealdgyth was the widow of Gruffydd of Wales, this last fact was made a further
                    chargo against him by the Normans.</p>
                <p>Of the lawfulness of Harold’s succession, according to the English law of the
                    time, there can be no doub⅜. He was nominated by the late king, regularly
                    chosen, regularly consecrated. The Witan had always exercised a free choice
                    within the royal bouse, and the same principle would justify a choice beyond the
                    royal house, when the royal house contained no qualified candidate. Minorities
                    had been endured after the death of Eadred and after the death of Eadgar. But
                    then the only man in the land who held at all the same position as Harold now
                    did was the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n306/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0306-0291"/> churchman Dunstan. Γη fact the claims of Eadgar
                    do not seem to have been put forward at the time. They begin to be heard ∩f at a
                    later time, when the notion of strict hereditary right was growing. When Harold
                    is blamed at the time, it is not for disregarding the hereditary right of
                    Eadgar, but for breaking his own personal engagement to William. Whatever was
                    the nature of that engagement, its breach was at most a ground of complaint
                    against Harold personally; it could give William no claim as against the people
                    of England. According to English law, William had no shadow of claim. The crown
                    was not hereditary but elective; and he was not elected to it. Nor had he even
                    any hereditary claim; for he was not of the kingly stock of Cerdic. The alleged
                    bequest of Eadward was cancelled by the later bequest in favour of Harold. The
                    whole question was a personal question between William and Harold. A single act
                    of homage done by Harold to William when in William’s military service could not
                    bind Harold to refuse the crown which the nation offered him. The engagement to
                    marry William’s daughter was undoubtedly broken. To this charge we have Harold’s
                    own answer: A King of the English could not marry a foreign wife without the
                    consent of his Witan.</p>
                <p>William then had no claim to the crown on any showing, either of natural right or
                    of English law. But, by artfully working together a number of points which had
                    no real bearing on the matter, he was able to make out a plausible case in lands
                    where English law was unknown. His kindred to Eadward, the alleged bequest of
                    Eadward, the alleged perjury of Harold, the alleged wrong done to Archbishop
                    Robert and the other Normans, were able to be worked into a picture which
                    gradually won supporters to William, first in his own duchy, and then beyond its
                    bounds. His own subjects, who at first listened but coldly, were before long
                    stirred to zeal in his cause. Foreign princes encouraged him; to the Roman see
                    above all it was the best of opportunities for winning increased power in
                    England. Pope Alexander IL, under the influence of his archdeacon Hildebrand,
                    afterwards the renowned Pope Gregory VII., approved of William’s claims. He was
                    thus able to cloke his schemes under the guise of a crusade, and to attack
                    England alike with temporal and spiritual weapons.</p>
                <p>Thus doubly armed, the Norman duke set forth on his enterprise against England.
                    Ha had not a single partisan in the country; but Tostig, the banished
                    Englishman, was indirectly doing his work. For Tostig William was too slow; he
                    betook himself to Harold Hardrada, the famous king of Norway, and either stirred
                    him up to an attempt on England or joined him in an attempt which he had already
                    planned. Harold of England was thus attacked at once by two enemies, either of
                    whom alone it might be hard to overcome. The Norwegian came first; he landed in
                    Yorkshire, defeated Eadwine and Morkere at Fulford, and on September 24 received
                    the submission of York. Harold of England on the morrow overthrew the Norwegian
                    invader at Stamfυrdbridge. Three days later the Normans landed at Pevensey; the
                    English king marched southward; the northern earls kept back their forces,
                    seemingly in the hope of a division of the kingdom. On October 14, Harold, at
                    the head of the men of Wessex, East-Anglia, and part of Mercia, met William and
                    his host on the hill of Senlac. After a hard-fought struggle, the Normans by a
                    stratagem made their way on to the hill; the king was wounded by an arrow and
                    cut down by four Norman knights, and his personal following was slaughtered
                    around him. The first step in the conquest of England was thus taken; but the
                    work was far from being done. After the fall of Harold, William had never again
                    to fight a pitched battle; the land was without a leader, and therefore without
                    union. Local resistance was often valiant; but it was only local resistance, and
                    the land was conquered bit by bit.</p>
                <p>On the death of Harold, the Witan in London chose Eadgar to the vacant throne.
                    But the Mercian earls failed him, as they had failed Harold; and their treason
                    hindered any general national resistance. Before the end of the year, the newly
                    chosen king and a large body of the chief men of the realm found it expedient to
                    submit to the invader. He had then subdued the shires south of London, whose
                    forces had been utterly cut off at Senlac; he had crossed the Thames and
                    threatened the city from the north. He was now chosen king and crowned at
                    Westminster on Christmas day. He was thus king by the submission of the chief
                    men, by the rite of coronation, and by the absence of any other claimant. But he
                    was very far from having full possession of the whole kingdom. His actual
                    authority did not go beyond the south-eastern part of the country. His dominions
                    certainly reached from Hampshire to Norfolk. They probably took in Wiltshire,
                    Oxfordshire, and Northamptonshire, with an outlying post in Herefordshire; but
                    the north, the south-west, and the greater part of central England were still
                    unsubdued.</p>
                <p>The conquest of these still independent districts was the result of a series of
                    local campaigns spread over about two years, from the beginning of 1068 to the
                    beginning of 1070. In 1067 William visited Normandy, and the oppression of his
                    lieutenants, his half-brother Odo, bishop of Bayeux and earl of Kent, and
                    William Fitz-Osbern, earl of Hereford, stirred up revolts in Kent and in
                    Herefordshire. The Kentish revolt took the strange form of an alliance with a
                    foreign prince, Eustace count of Boulogne, who had been himself in William’s
                    service in his invasion. In Herefordshire the movement was more strictly
                    national, though its chief, Eadric, surnamed the Wild, who bad never submitted
                    to William, did not disdain an alliance with his Welsh neighbours. Eadric in
                    fact held out till a much later time; but the Kentishmen with their foreign
                    allies were subdued before William’s return. At the end of the year the king
                    came back, ιnd with the beginning of the next year he betook himself to the
                    conquest of what was still unconquered. His first march was towards the west,
                    where Exeter and the whole of western England were still independent. They were
                    first subdued in the spring of 1068. After a revolt in the next year, after tw o
                    attempts in successive years on the part of Harold’s sons, westeτn England was
                    finally subdued in the course of 1069. Northern England, as far as the northern
                    boundary of Yorkshire, was first conquered in the autumn of 1068. An attempt on
                    Durham in January 1069 was defeated. York and the North generally revolted more
                    than once. In September 1069 Swegen of Denmark sent a great fleet to the help of
                    the English, who were under the leadership of Eadgar, Waltheof the son of
                    Siward, earl of Northampton and Huntingdon, and the other northern leaders. But,
                    in the course of the winter of 1069-1070, the whole of northern and central
                    England was finally conquered, Chester being the last point to hold cut. After
                    this time there were local revolts, but no very general resistance of any large
                    part of the country. Early in 1070 William reviewed and dismissed his army at
                    Salisbury. At the Easter feast of the same year, being now full king over all
                    England, he was again solemnly crowned by legates from Rome.</p>
                <p>A distinction must be carefully drawn between the resistance to William’s arms in
                    those districts which had never submitted to his authority and the revolts which
                    happened after his power was fully established. The two are however divided by a
                    very short interval of time. In the course of the summer of 1070 the fen-land
                    was in <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n307/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0307-0292"/> revolt under Hereward. That inaccessible district
                    can never have fully submitted; still the warfare there was a new and distinct
                    outbreak, and not a continuation of the earlier warfare at Exeter, York, and
                    Chester. The abbey of Ely was the centre of resistance, and, in a country which
                    so often formed the last shelter of defeated parties, it was defended for about
                    a year. Earl Eadwine was slain on his way to join the insurgents; Morkere was in
                    the island at the time of its surrender, and was condemned to a life-long
                    imprisonment. Hereward alone, with a few valiant followers, escaped by sea. He
                    appears to have been afterwards reconciled to William, and even to have served
                    him in his foreign wars. The manner of his death is uncertain.</p>
                <p>The war at Ely was the last patriotic warfare on the part of the English against
                    William. He was now undisputed master of England; the nation had learned that
                    the time for national resistance was past, and that local revolts could avail
                    nothing. On the Welsh border he established the great earldoms of Chester,
                    Shrewsbury, and Hereford, whose holders largely extended the power of the
                    English kingdom at the expense of the Britons. Northumberland was entrusted to
                    the care of a succession of earls, first English, then Norman. But on this side
                    the frontiers of the kingdom were not at this time enlarged.</p>
                <p>But from the very beginning of William’s conquest the northern frontier was a
                    source of the deepest anxiety. The banished English, and specially the royal
                    family, found shelter at the court of Malcolm of Scotland, who married Margaret,
                    the sister of Eadgar. Under cover of asserting their rights, Malcolm cruelly
                    ravaged northern England. But in 1072 λVilliam himself entered Scotland and
                    received the homage of Malcolm at Abernethy. He had thus succeeded to the
                    empire, as well as to the immediate kingdom, of his West-Saxon predecessors. In
                    the next year he employed English troops on the continent in winning back the
                    revolted county of Maine. In 1074 he could afford to admit Eadgar, the rival
                    king of a moment, to his favour.</p>
                <p>A revolt which took place in 1075 only showed how firmly William’s power was
                    established, and how little disposition there was on the part of the English to
                    rise against him. Two of his own earls rose against him. One, Ralph earl of
                    Norfolk, was an Englishman by birth; but as he came over with William and served
                    with him at Senlac, he must have been banished under Eadward or Harold. His
                    fellow rebel, Roger earl of Hereford, was the son of William’s special friend
                    William Fitz-Osbern. These two revolted: but they had to trust mainly to the
                    help of Breton mercenaries or adventurers: Normans and English were leagued
                    against them. The revolt was crushed; Ralph escaped' <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi>, Roger, like Morkere, spent the rest of his days in prison. But their
                    fall brought down with them the last Englishman who held a secular post of the
                    first rank under William. This was Waltheof, formerly the leader of the English
                    at York, but who had submitted again and had been received to the king’s highest
                    favour. Besides his former earldoms of Northampton and Huntingdon, he had
                    received the earldom of Northumberland. That name now means so much of Bernicia
                    as had not passed to the Scottish kings; that is, the present county so-called.
                    Waltheof seems to have listened to the plans of his brother earls; but he took
                    no part in their revolt, and he even revealed the conspiracy to William. Yet he
                    was the only one of the three whose life was taken. After a long imprisonment,
                    he was on May 31, 1076, beheaded at Winchester. At no other time in William’s
                    long reign did he send a political enemy to the scaffold; and Waltheof could
                    hardly be called a political enemy. The Norman courtiers and his own Norman
                    wife, the king’s niece Judith, seem to have called for his blood. By the English
                    he was looked on as a saint and martyr.</p>
                <p>The last eleven years of William’s reign are far richer in continental than in
                    English events. He was engaged in wars with his French and Breton neighbours,
                    and with his rebellious eldest son Robert. In England a Danish invasion in 1075,
                    in concert with the revolt of the earls, led to a sack of York, and to nothing
                    further. In 1080 Walcher, bishop of Durham and earl of Northumberland, was
                    killed in a popular tumult. A revolt it could hardly be called; but it was
                    cruelly punished by the king’s brother Bishop Odo. After this we do not hear of
                    so much as a tumult. In 1086 an invasion from Denmark was again threatened by
                    the Danish king Cnut. His enterprise was stopped by his death by the hands of
                    his own subjects, which won him, somewhat strangely, the honours of martyrdom
                    and the title of a saint. The next year, 1087, William himself died of an
                    accidental hurt received while burning the town of Mantes in warfare with his
                    neighbour and lord, Philip king of the French.</p>
                <p>The Conqueror was now gone, but the tale of the Conquest is not quite over. One
                    act more of the drama is still to be told before we stop to consider the nature,
                    the cause, and the results, of this wonderful revolution. By the dying will of
                    William, Normandy passed to his eldest son Robert; England he wished to be the
                    portion of his second son William. William, surnamed the Red, was acknowledged
                    and crowned without opposition. In the next year (1088) almost the whole of the
                    Norman nobles rebelled on behalf of Robert. The king appealed to his English
                    subjects. By their valour, seconded by the loyalty of the bishops, the Norman
                    revolt was put down, and the crown of the Red King was made safe. This was the
                    last time that Normans and English, as such, met in arms on English soil. The
                    work of the Conquest had been so thoroughly done that it could bear in a certain
                    sense to be undone. The conquest made by the Norman had been so thorough that it
                    was not disturbed even by English victories over Normans. Within twenty-two
                    years after William’s landing, his son, the second Norman king, owed his crown
                    to the support of the native English against his own countrymen. Signs of
                    distinction and jealousy between the two races may be discerned for some time
                    longer; but the last open warfare between them was when the English defended the
                    throne of William Rufus against his Norman rebels.</p>
                <p>Such is a short sketch of the leading events of the period which we may call the
                    period of the Norman Conquest. Looking at it simply as an event, it is most
                    important to bear in mind its gradual nature. Nothing can be further from the
                    truth than the notion that England passed at once into the hands of the Normans
                    after a single battle. Still there is a sense in which it is not untrue to say
                    that England was conquered in a single battle. After the fall of Harold, at all
                    events after the northern earls withdrew their forces from the service of
                    Eadgar, the conquest of England was only a question of time. Just as in the days
                    of Aethelred, there was no acknowledged leader; and throughout that age, under a
                    worthy leader, the English people could do everything; without such an one, they
                    could do nothing. There was no man who could gather the whole force of the
                    nation around him. There was no man who could stand up as William’s rival either
                    in military or in political skill. Hence, after the one great battle, there was
                    no common effort. The West resisted valiantly; the North resisted valiantly; but
                    the resistance of each was isolated without any intelligent concert. Help came
                    from Denmark but it was no avail when there was no generalship, no common plan,
                    and when the Danish leaders were actually bribed by William. In all these ways
                    the strength of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n308/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0308-0293"/> country was frittered away. Aelfred and Eadmund
                    Ironside, whether defeated or victorious, fought battle after battle. They were
                    real leaders. After Harold fell in the first battle, there was no real leader
                    left, and the first pitched battle was the last. Next to the fall of Harold and
                    his brothers in the first battle, William’s greatest advantage was the
                    submission of London and of the chief men assembled in London. This enabled him
                    to be crowned king at an early stage of the war, when not more than a third of
                    the country was in his actual possession. From that time his government had a
                    show of legality. The resistance of the west and north was, in fact, as truly
                    resistance to an invading enemy as the fight on Senlac itself. But, when William
                    was once crowned, when there was no other king in the land, resistance to him
                    took the outward form of rebellion. The gradual nature of the conquest, together
                    with William’s position as crowned king at the head of an established
                    government, even enabled him to turn the force of the conquered districts
                    against those which were still unconquered, and to subdue England in some
                    measure by the arms of Englishmen Thus, within five years from his landing,
                    anything like real resistance had come to an end. William was full king
                    throughout the land. The revolt of the earls met with no national support, and
                    the tumult in which Bishop Walcher was killed was a mere tumult, caused by local
                    and personal wrongs, such as might have happened in any age. The one general
                    national impulse of a later date than the fall of Chester was, as we have just
                    seen, that which led the English people to support that son of the Conqueror who
                    appealed to them against that son of the Conqueror who was supported by the
                    Norman nobles.</p>
                <p>But the Norman conquest of England was something much more than the mere
                    establishment of a Norman king or a Norman dynasty upon the throne of England.
                    William, we must always remember, did not give himself out as a conqueror. The
                    name <hi rend="italic">Conqueror,</hi><hi rend="italic">Conquoestor,</hi> though
                    applied with perfect truth in the common sense, must strictly be taken in the
                    legal meaning of <hi rend="italic">purchaser</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >acquirer.</hi> William claimed the crown as the lawful successor of Eadward. No
                    doubt he would have been well pleased if his title had been peaceably
                    acknowledged. As his claim was not acknowledged or taken notice of in any way,
                    he had, from his own point of view, no course left except to make good his
                    rights by force; and, in a land where he had no native partisans, the making
                    good of his rights by force meant the conquest of the land by a foreign army.
                    The peculiar character of the Norman Conquest comeβ from this, that a legal
                    claim to the crown was made good through conquest by a foreign army William’s
                    accession was something quite different from the mere peaceful succession of a
                    foreign king. It was also something quite different from a mere foreign invasion
                    without any legal pretext at all.</p>
                <p>We must here, in considering the effects of the Norman Conquest, distinguish
                    between those immediate effects which are rather the form which the Conquest
                    itself took and those lasting effects which the peculiar nature of the Conquest
                    caused it to have upon the whole future history of England. The peculiar nature
                    of William’s claim, and the personal character of William himself, had the
                    deepest influence both on the character of the Conquest itself as an event, and
                    on the character of its permanent results.</p>
                <p>We may say generally of William that he was a man who united the highest military
                    skill of his age with a political skill which would have made him great in any
                    age. He knew how to knit together a number of points, none of which really
                    proved anything, but all of which in one way or another told in his favour, so
                    as to give a plausible look to a claim which had no legal or moral ground
                    whatever. He deceived others; most likely he deceived himself. He was in no sort
                    a vulgar oppressor, in no sort a contemptuous despiser of law and right. He
                    never lost sight of a formal justice and of a more than formal piety. He was
                    cruel, in the sense of not scrupling at any severity which would serve his
                    purpose; he was not cruel, in the sense of taking any pleasure in oppression for
                    its own sake He was guided strictly by the letter of the law, according to his
                    reading of the law. In his own idea, he was not only guided by justice, but he
                    tempered justice with mercy. It is certain that he often forgave those who
                    revolted against him; it is also certain that he carefully abstained from blood
                    except in open battle. When he punished, it was always, with the single
                    exception of Waltheof, by some penalty short of death. That the worse part of
                    his character grew at the expense of the better is not wonderful in such a
                    career. Early in his reign he laid waste Northumberland out of a cruel policy;
                    later in his reign he laid waste a large tract of Hampshire to form a forest for
                    his own pleasure. In his earlier days Exeter withstood him, Le Mans revolted
                    against him. Both those cities he entered as a peaceful conqueror. In his last
                    days he gave Mantes to the flames, and enjoyed the sight, when he had no wrong
                    to avenge on the part of the people of Mantes, but when he was simply stirred up
                    to wrath by a silly jest of their king.</p>
                <p>The effect of the peculiar position and character of William was that his
                    settlement was in truth a territorial conquest veiled under legal forms. In
                    William’s reading of the law, if he was not himself actually king from the
                    moment of Eadward’s death, yet at least he was the one lawful successor to the
                    kingdom. It was therefore treason to fight against him, or to put any hindrance
                    in the way of his taking possession of the crown. The lands and goods of
                    traitors were confiscated to the crown; therefore the lands and goods of all who
                    had opposed William, Jiving or dead, were confiscated to him. The crown
                    lands—and in William’s reading of the law, the <hi rend="italic">folkland</hi>
                    was crown land— of course passed to the new king. The whole <hi rend="italic"
                    >folkland</hi> then, together with the lands of all who had fallen on Senlac,
                    including the vast estates of Harold and his brothers, all passed to William,
                    and was at his disposal. But, as no Englishman had supported his claims, as many
                    Englishmen had opposed him in arms, the whole nation was involved either in
                    actual or in constructive treason. The whole soil of England then, except the
                    property of ecclesiastical corporations, was forfeited to the new king. But
                    William was not inclined to press his claims to the uttermost; at his first
                    entry he allowed the mass of the English landowners to redeem the whole or a
                    part of their possessions. Gradually, after each conquest of a district, after
                    each suppression of a revolt, more land came into the king’s power That land was
                    dealt with according to his pleasure. It was restored, wholly or in part, to its
                    former owners; it was granted away, wholly or in part, to new owners, as William
                    thought good in each particular case. But in every case, whether a man kept his
                    own land or received land which had belonged to some one else, all land was held
                    as a grant from the king. The only proof of lawful ownership was either the
                    king’s written grant, or else evidence that the owner had been put in possession
                    by the king’s order. Of this process of confiscation and regrant, carried out
                    bit by bit during the whole reign of William, Domesday is the record. We see
                    that, in the course of William’s twenty-one years, by far the greater part of
                    the land of England had changed hands. We see further, as we might take for
                    granted in such a case, that by far the greater part of the land which was
                    granted to new owners was granted to William’s foreign followers. By the end of
                    William’s reign all the greatest estates in England had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n309/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0309-0294"/> passed into the hands of Normans and other
                    strangers. But we see also that it is an utter mistake to believe that
                    Englishmen were indiscriminately turned out of hearth and home. A few Englishmen
                    who had, in whatever way, won William’s special favour kept great estates. A
                    crowd of Englishmen kept small estates or fragments of great ones. In a vast
                    number of cases the English owner kept his lands as tenant under a Norman
                    grantee. Altogether the actual occupants of the soil must have been much less
                    disturbed than might have seemed possible in so great a transfer of lands from
                    one set of owners to another.</p>
                <p>The special feature of this great transfer of land from f men of one nation to
                    men of another is that it was done gradually and under legal form. It was not a
                    mere scramble for what every man could get; nor was it like those cases in the
                    early Teutonic invasions when the lands of the conquered, or a part of them,
                    were systematically divided among the conquering army. Every step in William’s
                    great confiscation was done regularly and according to his notion of law. There
                    was no formal or general distinction between Normans and Englishmen. Every man,
                    Norman or English, was dealt with according to his personal merits. Every man,
                    Norman or English, held his land only by a grant from King William. No general
                    change was made in the tenure of land. The new owner got his land on the same
                    terms on which the old owner had held it. The new owner was clothed with the
                    same rights, and was burthened with the same liabilities, as the old one.
                    William took lands here, and granted them there, according to the circumstances
                    of each case. Most commonly he took from Englishmen and gave to Normans. But he
                    took from Englishmen and gave to Normans, not by virtue of any legal distinction
                    between Englishmen and Normans, but because it was, as a rule, Englishmen who
                    incurred forfeiture by resisting him, N0rman3 who deserved reward by serving
                    him.</p>
                <p>As William dealt with lands, so he dealt with offices. The two processes were to
                    some extent the same; for most ecclesiastical and many temporal offices carried
                    with them land or rights over land. Gradually, and under cover of law, the
                    highest offices in Church and State were taken from Englishmen and bestowed on
                    Normans. At the end of William’s reign there was no English earl, but one
                    English bishop, and only a few English abbots. But this change was not made all
                    at once. In the appointment of earls William brought in a new policy which
                    reversed that of Cuut. The great earldoms were broken up. There were no more
                    earls of the West-Saxons or of the Mercians, and the earldom of Northumberland
                    now meant only the modern county. Indeed William did not appoint earls at all,
                    except in districts which were open to attack by land or sea—districts, in
                    short, where the earls would have to play the part of <hi rend="italic"
                    >marquesses.</hi> Kent, Norfolk, Northumberland, Chester, Shrewsbury, Hereford,
                    were William’s only earldoms. Each.of these had a special duty of guardianship
                    against the Briton, the Scot, the Dane, and any possible enemies from Gaul or
                    Germany. At his coming he established Norman earls in such parts of the earldoms
                    of Harold and his brothers as be thought needed defence. Elsewhere he kept the
                    English earls, and even appointed new ones, as the circumstances of the time
                    dictated. At last, ten years after William’s coming, the last English earl was
                    removed by the beheading of Waltheof. Other officers, sheriffs, stallers, and
                    the like, were in the same way gradually changed. But smaller posts largely
                    remained in the hands of Englishmen. It has been noticed, as marking some traits
                    in William’s personal habits, that Eadward’s English huntsmen kept their places,
                    but that all the new king’s cooks were strangers.</p>
                <p>The same system was carried on with ecclesiastical offices also, though in this
                    case a greater degree of caution was needed. The king might by himself, or at
                    all events with the consent of his Witan, remove a sheriff, an earl, or any
                    temporal officer: to remove a bishop or abbot needed, in William’s view, full
                    ecclesiastical sanction. Throughout William’s reign, when a bishop died, a
                    foreign successor was found for him, and those English bishops against whom any
                    canonical charge could be devised were removed without waiting for their deaths.
                    The same general rule was applied to the abbots, though here the exclusion of
                    Englishmen was not quite so strict. Though the greater number of the newly
                    appointed abbots were strangers, a few Englishmen were appointed to abbeys even
                    down to the end of William’s reign. In a series of synods held in 1070 by the
                    papal legates, the new organization of the English Church began. The two
                    metropolitan sees were filled ty foreigners. York was vacant in ordinary course
                    by the death of Ealdred; it was bestowed on the Norman Thomas of Bayeux.
                    Canterbury was vacated by the deposition of Stigand, and was bestowed on a far
                    more famous man, Lanfranc of Pavia, William’s right hand man in the settlement
                    of Church and State. Other sees were filled in the same year, and gradually, as
                    bishops died or were deposed, Normans took their places. At William’s death,
                    Wulfstan of Worcester was the only bishop of English birth.</p>
                <p>Of these changes in the possession of landed property Domesday Book is the great
                    record. This unique and invaluable document was drawn up in pursuance of a
                    decree passed in the Christmas assembly of 1085-1086, and the necessary survey
                    was made in the course of the first seven months of 1086. The immediate object
                    of the survey was a fiscal one, to insure that the tax on the land known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Daneyeld</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The more correct name is <hi rend="italic">IIer eg chi,</hi> that is, a tax
                    for the support of a paid military force. <hi rend="italic">Dαηegeld</hi> is, in
                    strictness, money paid to the Danes as black mail by Aethelred and others. But,
                    as both payments were unpopular, the two names got confounded, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Daηegehl</hi> became the received name of the chief direct tax
                    paid in those, times.</p></note> might be more regularly paid and more fairly
                    assessed. But William further took care to have a complete picture of his
                    kingdom drawn up. We are told in all cases by whom the land was held at the time
                    of the survey, and by whom it had been held in the time of King Eadward. We are
                    told what was the value of the land at those two dates. This is the essence of
                    the inquiry; but we also get a mass of statistics and a mass of personal and
                    local detail of every kind. As a mere list of landowners under Eadward and under
                    William, it enables us to trace the exact degree to which land had passed from
                    Englishmen to Normans. And the incidental notices of tenures, customs, personal
                    anecdotes, the local institutions of districts and towns, are at least as
                    valuable as the essential parts of the survey. With their help we can see
                    England as it was in 1086 more clearly than we can see it at any earlier time,
                    more clearly than we can see it at any later time for a long while after. And
                    not the least instructive thing about the survey is the light λ∖hich it throws
                    on the general character of William’s government, the system of legal fictions,
                    the strict regard to a formal justice. William is assumed throughout as the
                    lawful and immediate successor of Eadward. The reign of Harold is ignored. The
                    grant of William is assumed as the one lawful source of property; but there is
                    throughout a clear desire to do justice according to that doctrine, to secure
                    every man in his right, as William understood right, without any regard to race
                    or rank. Powerful Normans, William’s own brothers among them, are entered as
                    withholding lands wrongfully, sometimes from other Normans, sometimes from
                    Englishmen. Domesday, in short, may be set alongside of the English Chronicle as
                    one of the two great and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n310/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0310-0295"/> unique sources of English history. They are
                    possessions which have no parallel elsewhere.</p>
                <p>In the constitution of England William made no formal change, and the particular
                    laws of his enacting were few. The direct changes of his reign had some analogy
                    to the direct changes which followed on the introduction of Clιristianity. No
                    old institutions were abolished; but some new institutions were set up by the
                    side of the old ones. The old national assemblies went on, without any change in
                    their formal constitution. The real change in their character was not a formal,
                    but a practical one. The assembly which, at the beginning of William’s reign,
                    was an assembly of Englishmen with here and there a Norman had, before the end
                    of his reign, changed into an assembly of Normans with here and there an
                    Englishman. The assemblies, as before, were in ordinary times mere gatherings of
                    the great men of the realm; but, as before, on special occasions, a vast
                    multitude was brought together. Thus, when Domesday was finished in 1086,
                    William gathered all the landowners of his kingdom, great and small, whether his
                    tenants-in-chief or the tenants of an intermediate lord, and made them all
                    become his men. No one act in English history is more important than this. By it
                    William secured his realm against the growth of feudal doctrines and their
                    abuses. It established the principle that, whatever duty a man might owe to any
                    inferior lord, his duty to his sovereign lord the king came first. When this
                    rule was once established, the mightiest earl in England could never be to
                    William what William himself was to his own lord the King of the French. This
                    one act of the wisdom of the Conqueror secured the unity of England for
                    ever.</p>
                <p>Of the few actual changes in the law which William made, the most part were mere
                    ordinances enacted to meet the immediate needs of the time. Thus, for instance,
                    in the appeal to the judgment of God, the English ordeal and the Norman wager of
                    battle were alike legalized and regulated. Provisions were made for the safety
                    of William’s foreign followers, especially by the singular law of <hi
                    rend="italic">Murder</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Enylishry,</hi> according to
                    which, if an unknown man was found dead, he was held to be a Norman, unless he
                    could be proved to be English. In legislating against the slave-trade, William
                    only followed in the steps of former kings; but in wholly for bidding the
                    punishment of death, he acted on a personal theory of his own. But it must be
                    remembered that, in William’s jurisprudence, the substitutes for death were
                    mutilations which in modern ideas would be deemed worse than death. Most of
                    these provisions were in their own nature temporary. The chief permanent change
                    in our law which was due to an actual ordinance of William was a part of his
                    ecclesiastical reformation, the separation of the temporal and spiritual
                    jurisdictions. Hitherto the bishop and the earl had sat together in the <hi
                    rend="italic">SHryemot,</hi> and had heard both ecclesiastical and temporal
                    causes. This was now forbiddèn, and separate ecclesiastical courts began. The
                    strict forest law of William’s reign must also have been an innovation; but it
                    does not exist in the shape of a code; we know it only by the complaints of the
                    con temporary chronicles, and by the practice of later times. In all legal
                    matters the ancient assemblies and the ancient forms went on; nor was. there any
                    direct change in the language of the law. English remained, as before, an
                    alternative language with Latin. But from this time the use of Latin gradually
                    encroaches on the use of English. French is not used till a much later time.</p>
                <p>But the immediate and formal changes which followed on William’s coming were of
                    small account when compared with the indirect, and far more important, changes
                    which came as it were of themselves as the natural result of his coming. A
                    revolution was gradually wrought in everything that touched the relations of the
                    kingdom within and without. But it was a revolution of a strange kind. It was a
                    revolution which seemed, if not to root up our ancient institutions, at least
                    practically so to transform them that they might be deemed to have in truth
                    passed away. It was a revolution which seemed to have broken down the spirit of
                    Englishmen for ever under the yoke of strangers. But what that revolution really
                    did was to call forth the spirit of Englishmen in a stronger and more abiding
                    shape, and to enable us to win back under new forms the substance of the
                    institutions which seemed for a moment to have passed away. This will then be
                    the best place to go through the chief lasting results of the Conquest, and to
                    show how deeply, and in what ways, that event has influenced our institutions
                    and the general course of our history down to our own day.</p>
                <p>First of all, the Norman Conquest altogether changed the European position of
                    England. As soon as England was ruled by a continental prince who kept his
                    dominions on the continent, Britain ceased to be that separate world which it
                    had hitherto been And, though after events brought us back in no small degree to
                    our older insular character, yet Britain has never again become so completely
                    another world as it was in the older day. We have already seen that it was
                    through her connexion with Normandy that England was first led into that rivalry
                    with France which has had so great an influence on our later history. England
                    took up the quarrel of Normandy, and she carried it on on her own account after
                    Normandy had gone over to the other side. And, besides this special side of our
                    history which is formed by the relations between England and France, the Norman
                    Conquest brought Eugland in every way into closer connexion with continental
                    nations generally. In ecclesiastical matters this took the form of a far closer
                    connexion with the see of Rome than had been known before. The insular position
                    of Britain had hitherto made the English Church far more independent of the see
                    of Rome than the westeru churches generally. If the king of the English was
                    looked on as the emperor of another world, the primate of all England was also
                    looked on, and was sometimes directly spokeu of, as the pope of another world.
                    And it may be that the very fact that the English Church was more directly the
                    child of the Roman Church than any other of the western churches may really have
                    helped to strengthen the independence of the island church. It was pre-eminently
                    a child. It was not a subject or a servant, nor could it pass for a part of the
                    Roman Church itself. It was a child, but a child of full age, who owed reverence
                    indeed, but who no longer owed servile obedience. One great effect of the
                    Conquest was to weaken this insular independence, and to bring the insular
                    Church more nearly into the same position as the churche3 of the mainland. In
                    this, as in many other things, the Conquest did but confirm and hasten
                    tendencies which were already at work. The reforms of Dunstan’s day marked one
                    step Romewards. Another, we may say, was marked by the pilgrimage of Cnut. The
                    zeal of a new convert naturally filled the Danish king with a special reverence
                    for the chief seat of the religion which he had embraced. The reign of Eadward,
                    a special devotee of the Roman Church, wrought still more strongly in the same
                    direction. In his day the interference of the Roman see in the affairs of
                    England becomes more marked and constant than ever. But the great step of all
                    was taken by William himself. When he sought for a papal confirmation of his
                    claim to the crown of England, he went very far towards clothing the pope with a
                    power to dispose of that crown. In William’s own hands the rights of his crown
                    were safe. When Hildebrand himself called on him to do homage for his <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n311/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0311-0296"/> crown, he refused to do what no king of the
                    English had done before him. So, while the great struggle of investitures was
                    raging in Germany and Italy, William went on in England and in Normandy
                    investing bishops and abbots with the staff, as the kings and dukes before him
                    had done. Nor did Hildebrand ever blame William for doing what he branded as
                    such deadly sin in his own sovereign the emperor. Under William the old
                    ecclesiastical supremacy of the crown remained untouched; but it is none the
                    less true that two acts of his had a direct tendency to undermine it. The
                    separation of the ecclesiastical and temporal jurisdictions led the way to those
                    claims on the part of churchmen to be exempted from all temporal jurisdiction
                    which were unheeded in his day, but which became matter of such important
                    controversy under his successors. And, though he himself firmly refused all
                    homage for his crown, yet, when he made the pope a judge between himself and
                    Harold, he led the way for the day when his descendant took his crown back again
                    as a fief of the Roman see.</p>
                <p>In other points also we see the way in which the Norman Conquest opened a path
                    for increased intercourse between England and the continent. It was doubtless
                    mainly owing to the Norman settlers that England took the share which she did in
                    the crusades. The crusades were primarily a Gaulish movement. Germany was less
                    stirred than Gaul, and Scandinavia was less stirred than Germany. England, in
                    her old insular state, could hardly have played a greater part than Scandinavia.
                    Again, with the accession of a foreign line of kings, foreign marriages become
                    more common. The settlement of foreigners in England which began with the
                    conquest and confiscations of William was followed by the coming of settlers of
                    a more peaceful kind, of foreign merchants and of foreign scholars. And, if
                    strangers came to make their fortunes in England, the general breaking down of
                    barriers between nation and nation equally opened the way for the advancement of
                    Englishmen in other lands. These were gradual and indirect results of the great
                    Norman revolution. But the Conquest itself, its confiscations and its
                    outlawries, led directly to an emigration of Englishmen of quite another kind.
                    Englishmen, chafing under the yoke of the stranger, found their way to the
                    extremest bounds of Europe. They took service under the Eastern emperor, and
                    remained the surest bulwarks of his throne against the assaults of Turk and
                    Frank alike.</p>
                <p>With regard to the effects of the Conquest on English institutions, the Norman
                    king stepped into the position of his English predecessors. As king he claimed
                    their rights, and no more. But the circumstances of the Conquest worked in every
                    way to increase his power, and to provide him with new means of influence and
                    new sources of revenue. The notion that William introduced a “feudal system”
                    into England is a delusion which shows utter ignorance both of the position of
                    William and of the general history of Europe. If by a “feudal system” is meant
                    the state of things in Germany and Gaul, a state of things in which every great
                    vassal became a rival to the king, William took direct care that no such “feudal
                    system” should ever be introduced into his kingdom. But if by a “feudal system”
                    is meant merely -the holding of land by military tenure, subject to the burthens
                    of reliefs, wardship, marriage, and the like, though William certainly did not
                    introduce such a “system” ready made, yet the circumstances of his reign did
                    much to promote the growth of that kind of tenure, and of the whole class of
                    ideas connected with it. Such tendencies were already growing in England, and
                    his coming strengthened them. Under him the doctrine that all land is a grant
                    from the crown became a fact. And, though he did not directly innovate on the
                    Old-English tenures, yet we can see that the doctrine of military tenure began
                    in his reign, and that it was put into a systematic shape, and carried out to
                    its logical consequences, in the reign of his son. The Norman kings ruled in a
                    twofold character; they were all that their English predecessors had been, and
                    something more. The Norman king was the chief of the state; he was also the
                    personal lord of every man in his kingdom. In the one character, he could call
                    out the military force of the state; in the other, he could call on his tenants
                    for the military service due from their lands. As chief of the state, he levied
                    the ancient taxes due to the state; as lord he levied the new-fangled profits
                    which, according to thenew-fangled ideas, were due to the lord from his tenants.
                    In'short, William brought in that side of feudal doctrine which helped to
                    strengthen the crown, and kept out that side which helped to weaken it. The
                    doctrine that a man was bound to follow his immediate lord had destroyed the
                    royal power in other lands. William, by making himself the immediate lord of all
                    his subjects, turned that doctrine into the strongest support of his crown.</p>
                <p>This union of two sources of power in the Norman kings made their rule
                    practically despotic. But their very despotism preserved English freedom. They
                    had no temptation to uproot institutions which they found means to turn into
                    instruments of their power. They had no temptation to abolish the national
                    assemblies, in which they found little check on their will, and in which they
                    both displayed their power and practically exercised it. The coming of William
                    practically changed the character of those assemblies; it gradually gave them a
                    new constitution and a new name. But there was no sweeping away, no sudden
                    revolution; all was done gradually and by force of circumstances at particular
                    times. Thus the forms of a free constitution went on; there is no break between
                    the earliest national assemblies and the latest. At some points of our history,
                    the freedom of England seems sometimes to slumber; but it never died. The
                    seeming slumber under Norman despotism led to the awakening of the thirteenth
                    century. The seeming slumber under Tudor despotism led to the awakening of the
                    seventeenth.</p>
                <p>The king was thus in possession of two sources of power, of two sources of
                    revenue. One source came by inheritance from his English predecessors; another
                    came from the circumstances of William’s' conquest. He was both king and lord of
                    all men w ithin his realm. To the English he was in the first place king; to the
                    Normans he was in the first place lord. Each race had need of him, and the
                    Norman kings knew how to play off each race against the other. In the first days
                    of the Conquest, the king, if he was not the friend of his English subjects, was
                    at least not their worst enemy. His power was some protection against local
                    oppressors. Both William Rufus and Henry I. w ere raised to the throne by the
                    English in the teeth of Norman opposition. Gradually, as the two races drew
                    together, as in a word the Normans became Englishmen, neither race needed the
                    support of the king against the other, while both alike felt the heavy yoke of
                    his dominion. Instead of the English people siding with the king against the
                    Norman barons, the Norman barons, changed into Englishmen, now became the
                    leaders of the English people against the king.</p>
                <p>The greatest effect of the Norman Conquest is really to be looked for, not in any
                    sudden changes, least of all in any great and immediate legislative changes, but
                    in a.complete, though gradual, change of the administrative system, and in such
                    changes of the law as followed upon those changes in the administration. And
                    even the administrative, changes seldom took the form of the utter abolition of
                    anything old. They too rather took the form, sometimes of setting up something
                    new by the side of the old, sometimes only of increasing the importance of one
                    old institution at the expense of another. Thus the national assemblies
                    themselves changed their character, and a variety <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n312/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0312-0297"/> of institutions were developed out of the
                    national assemblies, by no cause so much as by the growth of the practice of
                    summons. Wherever it becomes usual specially to summon particular members of an
                    assembly, the first step is taken towards the exclusion of all who are not so
                    specially summoned. In the great assembly at Salisbury, where all the landowners
                    of England became the “men” of the king, we see the first germs of Lords and
                    Commons. The Witan are distinguished from the “land-sitting men.” By the Witan,
                    so called long after the Conquest, we are doubtless to understand those great
                    men of the realm who were usually summoned to every assembly. The vast multitude
                    who came to do their homage to the king were summoned only for that particular
                    occasion. The personal right of summons is the essence of the peerage. It is the
                    distinctive mark round which all the other honours and privileges of the peer
                    have grown. The earls and the bishops of England, by never losing their right to
                    the personal summons, have kept that right to personal attendance in the
                    national assembly which was once common to all freemen, but which other freemen
                    have lost. The House of Lords represents by unbroken succession the Witan of the
                    assembly of Salisbury; that is, it represents by unbroken succession the old
                    assemblies of the Teutonic democracy. Never did any institution so utterly
                    change its character. But the change has been the gradual result of
                    circumstances, without any violent break. The “land-sitting men,” on the other
                    hand, not summoned personally or regularly, but summoned in a mass when their
                    attendance was specially needed, gradually lost the right of personal
                    attendance, till in the end they gained instead the more practical right of
                    appearing by their representatives. Thus grew the Commons. The steps by which
                    our national assemblies took their final shape do not begin till a later time.
                    But it is important to notice that the first glimpse of something like Lords and
                    Commons—a distinction which doubtless already existed in practice, but which is
                    nowhere before put into a formal shape—dates from the last years of the
                    Conqueror.</p>
                <p>The practice of summons thus gave birth to our final parliamentary constitution.
                    It gave birth also to a vast number of administrative and judicial institutions,
                    of which we see traces before the Conquest, but whjch put on their definite
                    shape under the Norman kings. The practice of summons produced the House of
                    Lords. It produced also the <hi rend="italic">curia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >regis,</hi> the King’s Court, out of which so many institutions grew. The
                    King’s Court is properly the national assembly itself; but the name gradually
                    came to be con fined to a kind of judicial and administrative committee of the
                    assembly. Even before the Norman Conquest, we get a faint glimpse of a body of
                    the king’s immediate counsellors, bearing the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theningmannagemoc</hi> Out of this body, to which was gradually attached the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">curia</hi><hi rend="italic">regis,</hi> grew, on the
                    one side the Privy Council, and out of that the modern Cabinet, and on the other
                    side the courts of law. The Cabinet, our most modern political institution, an
                    institution so modern as to be unknown to the written law, is the last growth of
                    the principle of summons. The Cabinet, the body to which in common use we have
                    latterly come to give the name of <hi rend="italic">Government,</hi> is simply a
                    body of those privy councillors who are specially summoned. Those who are not
                    summoned stay away. All the king’s courts, administrative and judicial, grew in
                    the same way. They were committees of the national assembly, which gradually
                    grew into separate being and separate powers, as the legislative, executive, and
                    judicial branches of government parted off more distinctly from one another.</p>
                <p>Along with the practice of summons grew the importance of those who were most
                    specially and habitually summoned, the great officers of the king’s court and
                    household. Soon after the Conquest these officers began to rise into an
                    importance which they had never held before. They may be divided into officers
                    of state and officers of the household. The notion that offices in the royal
                    household were honourable is part of the general doctrine of the <hi
                    rend="italic">comitatus</hi> and its personal service, the doctrine out of which
                    grew the nobility of the thegns. Some of these offices were simply old offices
                    with new names. The <hi rend="italic">staller</hi> became the <hi rend="italic"
                    >constable,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">bower-thegn</hi> became the <hi
                    rend="italic">chamberlain,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">steward</hi> kept his
                    English name. Some of these posts became hereditary and almost honorary. In some
                    cases, as in that of the chamberlain and the steward, a secondary office of the
                    same name grew up. Of greater importance and interest are those officers into
                    whose hands came the chief powers of government under the king. Nothing is so
                    important under the Norman reigns as the exchequer. But the exchequer is simply
                    an old institution with a new name, and the treasurer is simply an old officer
                    with a new name. The king’s <hi rend="italic">hoard</hi> or treasury must always
                    have had a keeper; but the <hi rend="italic">hoarder,</hi> under the Latin name
                    of <hi rend="italic">treasurer,</hi> grew into increased importance in times
                    when the main object of government seemed to be to fill the king’s hoard. The
                    hoard or treasury got the playful name of exchequer,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The older names are <hi rend="italic"
                    >fiscus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">thesaurus. Scaccariurn</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">exchequer</hi> was the established name by the time of Henry II.
                    It comes from the parti-coloured cloth with which the table was covered, which
                    suggested the notion of a chess-board.</p></note> and it grew into two
                    departments of state, administrative and judicial. The treasurer himself grew
                    into an officer of such power and dignity that, for a long time past, his office
                    has been put into commission among several holders. And of these the chief has
                    drawn in late years to himself more than the power, though without the dignity,
                    of the old single-headed treasurer. The chancellor again is found by that title
                    under Eadward the Confessor, and his office must have existed under some title
                    as early as there was any settled government at all. But it is under the Norman
                    kings that he gradually grew to great importance and dignity, an importance and
                    dignity which have been more lasting in his case than in the case of any other
                    of the great officials of those days. But the greatest dignitary of the Norman
                    reigns, the justiciar, really seems to have been wholly new. The name is first
                    given to the regents who represented William in his absence from England; and
                    the office may well have grown up through the need which was felt for some such
                    representative when the king visited his dominions beyond sea. The justiciar
                    appears as the first in rank among the great officers of state; but while the
                    chancellorship, remaining a single office, grew, the office of the justiciar was
                    gradually divided among many holders. Among them all those, great and small, who
                    administer justice in the king’s name may claim to have a share.</p>
                <p>The modern judicial system of England begins, in something like its present
                    shape, in the reign of Henry II. But its growth is one of the direct results of
                    the Norman Conquest. The older judicial system is essentially local and popular.
                    The men of the township, of the hundred, of the shire, come together under their
                    local chiefs. The highest judicial body of all, as well as the highest
                    legislative body of all, the assembly of the nation, comes together under the
                    chief of the nation, the king. At least as early as the reign of Aethelred we
                    find examples of royal commissioners, like the <hi rend="italic">missi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">οi</hi> the Frankish emperors and kings, who are sent on the
                    king’s errand to the local courts. After the Conquest this system grows, till in
                    the end the local chiefs, the earl and the bishop, are wholly displaced by the
                    king’s judges. Thus; grew up the lawyers’ doctrine that the king is the fountain
                    of justice. But the popular element survived in the various. forms of the jury.
                    It is idle to debate about the invention or introduction of trial by jury. The
                    truth is that it never <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n313/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0313-0298"/> was invented or introduced, that, even more than
                    other institutions, it emphatically grew. Its germ may be seen in all those
                    cases, compurgation or any other, where a matter is decided by the oaths of men
                    taken from the community at large. The Conquest caused a step in advance by the
                    more constant employment of recognitions taken on oath. Under Henry II. the
                    practice was still further strengthened; but it was not till long after his day
                    that the modern idea of the jury was established, as no longer witnesses but
                    judges of facts. When their judicial character was fully established, that is,
                    when in the reign of Charles II. they ceased to be called to account for their
                    verdicts, the old popular character of the courts in a great measure came back
                    to them.</p>
                <p>In this way justice became more centralized in England than anywhere else. All
                    the weightier causes came to be tried either in the king’s own courts or by
                    judges immediately commissioned by him. The local chiefs gave way to the king’s
                    representatives. One local officer indeed grew into increased activity. This w13
                    the officer who in each shire had always been specially the king’s officer, the
                    <hi rend="italic">shire-reeve</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sheriff,</hi> who looked
                    after the interests of the king, while the ealdorman or earl represented the
                    separate being of the shire. Under William, earls ceased to be appointed, save
                    where they had distinct military duties. Under his successors earldoms gradually
                    sank into merely honorary dignities. But the sheriff was in the Norman reigns
                    the busiest of all officers; for he had to collect and bring in all that was due
                    to the royal exchequer from the endless sources of income by which it was
                    fed.</p>
                <p>The main political result of the Norman Conquest thus was to strengthen every
                    tendency that was already in being—and such tendencies have been powerfully at
                    work ever since the beginning of the growth of the thegnhood—by which the king,
                    his authority, his officers, took the place of the nation and its authority. But
                    the older system was undermined rather than overthrown, and the course of our
                    history has, to a great extent, given us back the old institutions under other
                    shapes. Thus, for instance, there was a strong tendency at work to turn the <hi
                    rend="italic">folkland,</hi> the land of the nation, into the land of the king.
                    To this process the Conquest gave the finishing touch. The stroke by which the
                    whole <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ay soil of England was held to be forfeited
                    to the Conqueror turned all <hi rend="italic">folkland</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic">terra</hi><hi rend="italic">regis.</hi> From Domesday onward the
                    <hi rend="italic">folkland</hi> vanishes; but now that the crown lands are
                    placed under the control of parliament, as part of the national revenue, the <hi
                    rend="italic">terra</hi><hi rend="italic">regis</hi> has practically become <hi
                    rend="italic">folkland</hi> again. And while the king, the highest lord, was
                    thus encroaching on the nation, that is, on the community which took in all
                    others, smaller lords were doing the like to the lesser communities which made
                    up the nation. Under the older system all grants of <hi rend="italic">sac</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">soc,</hi> that is, all grants to a particular person of
                    any special jurisdiction exempt from the ordinary local courts, were in their
                    own nature exceptional. As the new ideas grew, the <hi rend="italic">manor,</hi>
                    as it was called by the Normans, finally supplanted the <hi rend="italic"
                    >township.</hi> Lawyers gradually found out that the exceptional novelty was the
                    original state of things. Just as they ruled the king to be the fountain of
                    justice, because he had gradually taken the administration of justice into his
                    own hands, so they ruled that, wherever any rights of the community had escaped
                    the grasp of the lord, their existence must necessarily be owing to an
                    unrecorded grant of the lord. The ancient court of the people, the <hi
                    rend="italic">court baron,</hi> was held to be the court of the lord. Here again
                    the evil has cured itself. The lord and his court have become harmless; but they
                    remain as curious examples of the way in which lawyers have read the history of
                    England backwards.</p>
                <p>Both as regarded the greater lord and the lesser, the tendency of the ideas which
                    the Norman Conquest strongly confirmed was to put the notion of property before
                    the notion of office Kingship, the highest office in the commonwealth, came to
                    be looked on mainly as a possession. The king of the people has now put on the
                    character of the lord of the land; his title gradually changes into a form which
                    better expresses this new position. The <hi rend="italic">King of the
                    English</hi> gradually changes into the <hi rend="italic">King of England.</hi>
                    William himself is still almost always <hi rend="italic">Hex Anglorum.</hi> But
                    the new territorial title now begins to creep into use, and from the beginning
                    of the thirteenth century it altogether displaces tho older style. But the new
                    ideas did much more than merely change the royal style. As soon as office had
                    .changed into property, as soon as the chief of the people had changed into the
                    lord of the land, the old rule that the king should be chosen out of the one
                    kingly house began to stiffen into the doctrine of strict hereditary right. The
                    general results of the Conquest were all in favour of that doctrine; but the
                    circumstances of the reigns which immediately followed the Conquest all told the
                    other way, and helped to keep up the elective character of the crown for some
                    time longer. The ancient doctrine died out very slowly, but it did die out in
                    the end. And then lawyers found out that the crown had been hereditary from the
                    beginning, and ruled that the king never died, and that the throne never could
                    be vacant. On the other hand, as office was turned into property, so property in
                    land was turned into office, and carried with it much of the likeness of a
                    miniature sovereignty. The doctrine of primogeniture also now naturally
                    supplanted the old principle of division of lands. No doctrine could be more
                    opposite to the old doctrine of nobility than the doctrine ιvhich gave
                    everything to a single son in the family. In this way primogeniture has its good
                    side. It gave us a peerage; but, in giving us a peerage, it saved us from a <hi
                    rend="italic">noblesse.</hi></p>
                <p>The immediate ecclesiastical effects of the Nora.an Conquest, those which in
                    truth formed part of the process of conquest, have been already spoken of. But
                    the introduction of foreign prelates, and the closer relations with Rome, worked
                    in many ways. The foreign bishop naturally stood at a greater distance from the
                    native clergy than his English predecessor had done. Moreover, the new theories
                    as to the tenure δf laud turned the bishop into a baron, holding as a
                    tenant-in-chief of the crown. The bishop became in his own diocese more of a
                    lord and less of a father, while he was often kept away from his diocese by
                    holding lιigh temporal office. It gives a false view of the case to say that the
                    prelates grasped at high temporal office: the case rather is that, in a time
                    when education was chiefly confined to the clergy, public business was mainly in
                    the hands of the king’s clerks, and that they received bishoprics as the reward
                    of their temporal services. Under such bishops the Church was secularized and
                    feudalized. Ecclesiastical livings were looked on less as offices with an
                    endowment for the maintenance of the holder than as <hi rend="italic"
                    >benefices</hi> charged with certain duties which might be discharged by deputy.
                    The relation of the parish priest to his bishop put on the likeness of the
                    relation between a man and his lord. At the same time, the rage for founding
                    monasteries, which was at its height in Normandy at the time of the Conquest,
                    came into England with the Normans, and ir√ the next century drew a fresh
                    impulse from the foundation of the, Cistercian order. The love of exemptions of
                    all kinds led <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> to a constant striving on the part of
                    ecclesiastical bodies to be exempted from the ordinary ecclesiastical
                    jurisdiction. This is shown, not only by separate monasteries, but even by the
                    cathedral chapters, especially where the place of the chapter was filled by a
                    monastic body. And one immediate result of the Conquest was the transfer of the
                    seats of several bishoprics from smaller towns to greater. This was <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n314/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0314-0299"/> in accordance with tbe continental notion of a
                    bishop, by which he was looked on as primarily bishop of a city, while in
                    English ideas he was rather the bishop, first of a tribe, and then of a
                    district. But this very change, one made by the Norman bishops themselves, may
                    well have helped to bring about that separation between the bishop and his
                    church which dates from this time. The bishop who had become a feudal lord, even
                    when he was not altogether away from his diocese on the king’s service, commonly
                    fixed his dwelling-place in his rural castle rather than in his palace in the
                    city.</p>
                <p>The social results of the Conquest were such as naturally followed on the general
                    transfer of the greatest estates and highest offices of the country. The
                    Conquest itself, the military occupation of William, was followed by a peaceful
                    immigration of Normans and other strangers into England, especially into the
                    merchant towns. London, above all, received a crowd of citizens of Norman birth.
                    That these men, and the Norman settlers generally, turned into Englishmen in a
                    wonderfully short time is one of the great features of our history. The causes
                    are easy to see: with most men, if there be no special reason to the contrary,
                    place of birth goes for more than descent by blood, and the stranger is
                    gradually assimilated by the people among whom he dwells. And in the case of
                    Normans and Englislι, we can hardly doubt that original kindred went for
                    something The Norman was simply a Dane who had adopted the French tongue and
                    some French fashions; he was easily won back into the Teutonic fold. But the
                    circumstances of William’s conquest, his pretended legal claim to the crown and
                    the whole system of legal fictions which grew round that claim, helped largely
                    to bring all classes of his subjects together. The Norman settled in England was
                    driven to become in some sort an Englishman. He held his estates of the King of
                    the English, according to English law. The fusion of the two races was so speedy
                    that a writer little more than a hundred years after the Conquest, the author of
                    the famous <hi rend="italic">Dialogus</hi><hi rend="italic">de Scaccariο,</hi>
                    could say that, among the free population, it was impossible to tell who was of
                    Norman and who was of English birth. That is to say, the great nobles must still
                    have been all but purely Norman; the lowest classes must have been all but
                    purely English. In the intermediate classes, among the townsmen and the smaller
                    landowners, the two races were so intermixed, and they had so modified one
                    another, that the distinction between them had been forgotten. We might say that
                    the effect of the Norman Conquest was to thrust every class, save one, of the
                    older English society a step downwards. The churl, the simple freeman, had been
                    gradually sinking for a long time before the Conquest. In the course of the
                    century after the Conquest, he finally sank into the villain. On the other hand,
                    if the churl gradually sank to the state of villainage, the slave gradually rose
                    to it. The Norman Conquest, while thrusting down every other class, undoubtedly
                    helped to raise the most wretched and helpless class of all.</p>
                <p>But while the Normans who settled in England changed into Englishmen with
                    remarkable speed, they of course, by the very fact of their fusion, did much to
                    modify the character of Englishmen. A way was now opened for all that class of
                    ideas which, for want of better names, may be called feudal and chivalrous.
                    Chivalry is rather French than Norman; and its development conies rather under
                    the Angevin than under the Norman kings. Still, so far as Normandy was
                    influenced by France, so far as the Norman Conquest opened a way for French
                    influence, and, we may add, French kings, in England, so far this whole class of
                    ideas and feelings may be set down as results of the Norman Conquest. But in
                    England chivalry never was really dominant. Teutonic notions of right and common
                    sense were never wholly driven out. For the man unassisted by birth to rise was
                    harder in some ages than in others. There was no age in England when it was
                    wholly impossible.</p>
                <p>The greatest of the outward changes which were caused by the Norman Conquest was
                    its effect on the language and literature of England. In the matter of language,
                    as in other matters, the Conquest itself wrought no formal change. Whatever
                    change happened was the gradual result of the state of things which the Conquest
                    brought about. French was never substituted for English by any formal act.
                    Documents were written in English loüg after the Conquest; and, though the use
                    of English gradually dies out in the twelfth century, it dies out, not in favour
                    of French, but in favour of Latin. French documents are not found till the
                    thirteenth century; they are not common till the latter part of that century. As
                    it was with institutions, so it was with language. The old language was neither
                    proscribed nor forgotten, but a new language came in by the side of it. William
                    himself tried to learn English; his son Henry, if no other in his family,
                    understood English, and seems even to have written it. Henry II. understood it,
                    but seemingly did not speak it. By the end of the twelfth century, English seems
                    to have been the most usual tongue among people of all classes. It was the
                    language of common speech and of purely popular writings; French.was the more
                    polite and fashionable language, the language of elegant literature; Latin was
                    the language of learning. Every educated man in the latter part of the twelfth
                    century must have been familiar with all three.</p>
                <p>A foreigu language was thus brought into England alongside of the native
                    language, and it displaced the native language for certain purposes. Such a
                    state of things could not fail to have a great effect on the English language
                    itself. That effect largely took the usual form of strengthening tendencies
                    which were already at work. The two changes which took place were the loss of
                    the old inflexions and the infusion of foreign words into the vocabulary Neither
                    of these processes began with the Conquest; the Conquest simply strengthened and
                    quickened them. The other Low-Dutch and Scandinavian tongues, which were brought
                    under no such influences as English was by the Conquest, have lost their
                    inflexions quite as thoroughly as English has. Even the High-Dutch, which keeps
                    a comparatively large stock of inflexions, has lost a large part of the forms
                    which were once common to High and Low. We may be sure then that we should have
                    lost our inflexions, or most of them, even if the Normans had not come. Indeed,
                    in one form of English, the dialect of the North, the inflexions had largely
                    given way already, chiefly, it would seem, through the influence of the Danes.
                    But when English lost its place as a polite and literary speech, when, though
                    spoken by all classes, it was written only for the lower classes, there was no
                    longer any fixed literary standard; the grammatical forms therefore became
                    confused and inaccurate. We see the change at once in those parts of the
                    Chronicles which were written in the twelfth century. On the other hand, the
                    English tongue had taken in a few foreign words from the first coming of j the
                    English into Britain. The Roman missionaries brought &lt; in another stock. Tbe
                    Normans brought in a third. But <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the third stock,
                    like the second, consisted for a while mainly of words which were more or less
                    technical, they were new names for new things. Through the twelfth century the
                    two languages stood side by side, without either borrowing much from, the other.
                    It was not till tbe thirteenth century that French words came in to any great
                    extent to express things for which the English tongue had names already. Thus
                    the English tongue gradually put on its later character<pb break="no"

                    its grammatical forms. But it lost its inflexions, more thoroughly than some
                    kindred tongues, not more thoroughly than some others. It also received a vast
                    infusion of Romance words into its vocabulary, an infusion far greater in
                    degree, but exactly the same in kind, as the Teutonic infusion into the
                    vocabulary of the Romance languages, especially into French.</p>
                <p>In literature, as distinguished from language, and also in art, the Norman
                    Conquest is one of the most strongly marked epochs in our history. The breaking
                    down of the barrier between the insular and the continental world did much for
                    both. Learning had gone down again in England through the Danish invasions; and
                    Eadward the Confessor, with all his fondness for foreigners, did little for
                    foreign scholars. Under William, and his son Henry things altogether changed.
                    The first two occupants of the see of Canterbury after the Conquest were the two
                    greatest scholars of their day. Both of them were strangers in Normandy no less
                    than in England: Lan franc came from Lombard Pavia, Anselm from Burgundian
                    Aosta. After them England herself produced a goodly crop of scholars among her
                    children of both races. λVhile the Chronicle was still writing in our own
                    tongue, a crowd of learned pens recorded English history in Latin. Florence of
                    Worcester told the unvarnished tale of the early Norman reigns in a chronicle
                    which is English in all but language. Henry of Huntingdon preserved to us large
                    fragments of our ancient songs in a Latin dress. William of Malmesbury aspired
                    to the character of a critical historian, a character still more nearly reached
                    somewhat later by William of Newburgh. The statesmen historians of Henry II.’s
                    day follow, and lead us on to the monastic historians of the thirteenth century.
                    Yet, after all, one would gladly exchange much of the light which they give us
                    for a continuation of the English Chronicle in the English tongue.</p>
                <p>One form of influence on language was the almost com- plete exchange of the
                    Old-English proper names for a new set of names which came over with the
                    Conqueror. The strictly Norman proper names, those which the Normans either
                    brought with them from the North or had borrowed from the Franks, are as truly
                    Teutonic as the English names; a few names only were common to both countries.
                    But, just at the time of the Conquest, the Normans were beginning to adopt
                    scriptural and saintly names, which were all but unknown in England. With the
                    Conquest a new fashion set in, and the names, whether Teutonic or saintly, which
                    were in Norman use gradually displaced the ancient English names. A few
                    specially royal and saintly names, like Eadward and Eadrnund, alone survived.
                    Throughout the twelfth century we constantly find the father bearing an English
                    name, while the son has one of the new fashion. This point is of importance. It
                    at once marks and hides the fusion of races. It helps us to see that many a man
                    who was to all outward appearance a stranger was in truth of genuine English
                    descent.</p>
                <p>Along with the change in personal names came in the use of hereditary surnames.
                    Surnames, in the sense of mere personal descriptions or nicknames, were already
                    common both in England and in Normandy. But the hereditary surname, the name of
                    the family handed on from father to son, was at the time of the Conquest unknown
                    in England, and it was only just coming into use in Normandy. The Normans
                    brought the fashion into England, and the circumstances of the Conquest gave it
                    a fresh impulse. While many of the Norman settlers brought with them the
                    surnames which they had already taken from their estates or birth-places in
                    Normandy, a crowd of men of both races now took surnames from their estates and
                    birth-places in England. The fashion to some extent affected local nomenclature
                    also. On the whole, the Norman Conquest made but little change in this way. Few
                    places, if any, lost their names. But some towns, castles, and monasteries of
                    Norman foundation received French names; and a crowd of English towns and
                    villages did, as it were, take Norman surnames, by taking the name of a Norman
                    lord to distinguish them from other places of the same name.</p>
                <p>In those days art is almost synonymous with architecture, and the changes in that
                    art which were wrought by the Norman Conquest were great indeed. There was then
                    but little room for great displays of artistic architecture anywhere but in
                    churches. But in this, as in all periods of genuine art, the style used for
                    buildings of all classes was the same. Up to the eleventh century all Western
                    Europe had built in one style, in that older form of the Romanesque or
                    round-arched architecture which came direct from Italy and was known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">mos Romanus.</hi> Its most striking feature is the tall, slender
                    bell-towers which in England are a sign of work not later than the eleventh
                    century, while in Germany they go on through the twelfth, and in Italy they
                    never went out of use at all. In the course of the eleventh century several
                    parts of Europe struck out new styles of their own, which still keep the round
                    arch, and which are therefore properly classed as later varieties of the
                    Romanesque type. One of these arose in Normandy, and was, among other Norman
                    fashions, brought into England by Eadward in the building of his new church at
                    Westminster. After the Conquest the Norman style naturally became the prevailing
                    fashion, One part of that fashion was the building of churches on a gigantic
                    scale, such as had never before been seen in England. This fashion led the
                    Norman bishops and abbots to pull down and rebuild most of the minsters of
                    England. The earliest Norman style was an advance on the Primitive Romanesque in
                    proportion and in vigour of style, casting off the mere imitation of Roman
                    models which had lingered for so many ages. But in mere amount of ornament it
                    was certainly no advance. The enriched Norman style comes in later. However,
                    from the reign of William, one might perhaps say from the reign of Eadward, the
                    older style gave way to the new. The Primitive models were now followed only in
                    smaller and less important churches, where the use of the slender belltowers
                    lasted longer than any other feature. Yet the Norman style, in supplanting the
                    earlier English fashion, was in some measure influenced by it. The Norman
                    churches of England have some distinctly English features of which there is no
                    sign in those of Normandy.</p>
                <p>We are told that great improvements in domestic architecture were brought in by
                    the Normans; but, when we see the few Norman houses that are left to us, we may
                    be inclined to think that the chief change was the freer application of stone to
                    domestic work. It was only in houses of the very highest class, as in kings’
                    palaces, that there was room for any great display of art. Such buildings
                    allowed of the great hall, with rows of columns and arches, like those of a
                    church. For municipal architecture there was as yet no room in our island. But
                    military architecture took one of its greatest steps in this age. Fortification
                    had advanced in England from the hedge or palisade which Ida built at Bamburgh
                    to the wall of squared stones with which Aethelstan had surrounded Exeter. But
                    the Nc17nan <hi rend="italic">castle,</hi> name and thing, was brought in as
                    something new in the days of Eadward, and the land was covered with them in the
                    days of William. The massive square tower, of which the Conqueror’s Tower of
                    London is the greatest example, is one type. The shell keep, the polygonal wall
                    raised most commonly on a mound of English work, is another type. In the days of
                    our forefathers the castle was the very embodiment of wrong and oppression. The
                    Chronicle never speaks of castle-building without some epithet of horror.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n316/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0316-0301"/>
                <p>One result of these changes in the art of fortification was largely to change the
                    character of the warfare as well as the tactics of the age immediately following
                    the Conquest. The older warfare of England is a warfare of pitched battles. Such
                    is the warfare of Aelfred; such is the warfare of Brihtnoth and Ulfcytel and
                    Eadmund Ironside. But the warfare of the twelfth century is mainly a warfare of
                    sieges. The taking of towns and castles is endless; but between Senlac and the
                    wars of the thirteenth century we hardly meet with more than two great battles
                    in the open field, those of Tinchebrai and the Standard.</p>
                <p>The changes'in the character of warfare were accompanied by a more general change
                    in the art of war. An ancient English army fought on foot; the horse was used
                    only to carry the warrior to the field. "When the time for action came, the king
                    or ealdorman and all his following dismounted. The old national weapon was the
                    sword, which under Cnut was exchanged for the heavy Danish axe. The English
                    armies of the eleventh century consisted of two classes, both footmen. The
                    housecalls, the paid force, and the thegns and other personal followers of the
                    king, wore coats of mail and carried shields, which could be made into a kind of
                    fortification called the shield-wall. They hurled javelins at the beginning of
                    the fight, and came to close conflict with the axe. The irregular levies of the
                    shires came armed with axes, javelins, clubs, or any other weapons that they
                    could bring. But there was no cavalry, and there were but few archers. In the
                    Norman system of warfare, cavalry and archers are the chief arms. The mailed
                    knights charge on horseback with long lances raised high in the air; they use
                    the sword, and sometimes the iron mace, for close combat. The infantry are
                    mainly archers; the mounted archer is rare. With the Conquest the Norman tactics
                    naturally displaced the English. The Englishman grasped the weapon of his
                    conqueror, and the fame of the English archers began. Yet the Norman manner of
                    fighting was itself to some ex tent influenced by English practice. The English
                    archer, though he had changed his weapon, was really the true heir of the
                    English axeman. In the fourteenth century, as in the eleventh, the main strength
                    of an English army lay in its infantry. And, earlier than this, the old
                    traditions of English warfare were sometimes followed by the Normans themselves.
                    More than once in wars of the twelfth century we find kings and nobles getting
                    down from their horses and fighting on foot, axe in hand, like Cnut or
                    Harold.</p>
                <p>We can now sum up the main results of the Norman Conquest. We can be hardly wrong
                    in calling it the most important event in English history since the first coming
                    of the English and their conversion to Christianity. It was a great and a
                    violent change, a change which, either in its immediate or in its more distant
                    results, touched everything in the land. Yet there was no break, no gap, parting
                    the times before it from the times after it. The changes which it wrought were
                    to a great extent only the strengthening of tendencies which were already at
                    work. The direct changes which we may look upon as forming the Conquest itself,
                    as distinguished from its more distant results, were done at once gradually and
                    under cover of legal form. No old institutions were uprooted, though some of
                    them were undermined by new institutions set up alongside of them. The
                    revolution which seemed to be the overthrow of English freedom led in the end to
                    its new birth. Under an unbroken succession of native kings, freedom might have
                    died out step by step, as it did in some other lands. As it was, the main effect
                    of the Conquest was to call out the ancient English spirit in a more definite
                    and antagonistic shape, to give the English nation new leaders in the conquerors
                    who were gradually changed into countrymen, and, by the union of the men of both
                    races, to win back the substance of the old institutions under new forms.</p>
                <p>Under the sons of the Conqueror England appears for the first time in her new
                    European character. Looking at her simply as a power, without regard to the
                    nationality of her inhabitants, she now appears as an insular power making
                    conquests on continental ground. William Rufus, placed on the throne by the
                    English people in opposition to a Norman revolt, broke all his promises of good
                    government, and ruled as one of the worst tyrants in our history. But it would
                    be hard to show that he was an oppressor of Englishmen as Englishmen. His rule
                    was rather a tyranny which pressed on all classes and all races, though the
                    native English would doubtless be the class which felt it most bitterly. Godless
                    and vicious beyond all parallel before or after, he was still a captain and a
                    statesman, and no king better knew how to make use of every art to advance the
                    power of his kingdom. He won a large part of Normandy by force of arms; and,
                    when his brother Robert set forth on the crusade, he obtained the whole duchy
                    under cover of a mortgage Maine revolted and was won back; a purchase of
                    Aquitaine was negotiated; Rufus was believed to have designs on the crown of
                    France itself. A short war was waged between Rufus and Philip of France, a war
                    which now begins to put on the character of a war between England and France,
                    rather than that of a mere war between the duke of the Normans and his overlord
                    at Paris. The wealth and strength of England now for the first time directly
                    told in continental affairs. But the schemes of the Red King were cut short by
                    the stroke of an arrow in the New Forest (2d August 1100). By an agreement
                    between William and Robert, if either died childless, his brother was to succeed
                    to his dominions. But at the death of Rufus, Robert was far away on the crusade,
                    and the English nation had never paid much heed to any attempts to settle the
                    succession of the crown before a vacancy. Henry, the youngest son of the
                    Conqueror, the only one of his sons who was the son of a crowned king and born
                    on English ground, was unanimously chosen and speedily crowned. An Englishman by
                    birth, if not by descent, he further married a wife who had some English blood
                    in her veins, and who, in the eyes of his subjects, passed for an Englishwoman.
                    This was Edith, the daughter of Malcolm of Scotland, who at her marriage took
                    the Norman name of Matilda. The English king and the English queen were mocked
                    at by the Norman courtiers, who again conspired to bring in the Norman duke.
                    Again a son of the Conqueror owed his crown to English loyalty. A second Norman
                    invasion of England followed. Robert landed at Portsmouth, as his father had
                    landed at Pevensey, but the policy of Henry found means to send him and his host
                    away without fighting (1101). One of the usual agreements was made, an agreement
                    which had little chance of being kept, by which again each brother was to
                    succeed to the dominions of the other in case of the failure of direct heirs.
                    But Robert was incapable of ruling his own dominions; a party in Normandy
                    invited the King of the English to save the duchy from anarchy. Two campaigns,

                    of Henry Men at the time looked on the day of Tinchebrai as the reversal of the
                    day <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of Senlac. Normandy was conquered by England,
                    as England had before been conquered by Normandy. Such a view put forth only one
                    side of the case; but from one side it was true.</p>
                <p>During the rest of Henry’s reign there was perfect peace in England; but nearly
                    the whole time was filled with continental wars. The warfare between France and

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0317-0302"/> England, of which there had been only a glimpse
                    in the days of Rufus, now began in earnest. It is true that the wars of Henry
                    were waged wholly for Norman and not at all for English interests, and
                    Englishmen at home bitterly complained of the taxes which were wrung from them
                    for wars beyond sea. But it is none the less true that, in their European
                    aspect, they were English wars, and that they tended to give the England of
                    Henry a wholly different position from the England of the days before the
                    Conquest. The later years of Henry were chiefly occupied in schemes of dynastic
                    policy on the continent. His only legitimate son, the Aetheling William, to whom
                    homage as his successor had been done both in Normandy and in England, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> was drowned in 1120. The king’s daughter Matilda had
                    been married to the emperor Henry V. Strict alliance with Germany formed part of
                    Henry’s policy, as it had formed part of the policy of Godwine and Harold; and
                    the two Henries, emperor and king, joined in warfare against Lewis of France. On
                    the death of the emperor, Matilda returned to England, and, by an act without
                    precedent either in his kingdom or in his duchy, Henry procured that homage
                    should be done to his daughter as his successor. No more striking comment can be
                    needed as to the growth of the new ideas of kingship. The crown was beginning to
                    be so thoroughly looked on as a possession that it was deemed that it might pass
                    to a woman. On the other hand, no settlement could be more opposed to modern
                    notions of hereditary right. When homage was fir5t done to Matilda, Robert’s son
                    William, who, according to modern notions, was the direct heir of the Conqueror,
                    was still living. In Normandy indeed he was his uncle’s enemy, and in England
                    his claims seem never to have been heard of. But, in the lack of legitimate male
                    heirs, the choice either of the king’s natural son Robert or of his sister’s son
                    Stephen would have been much less opposed to earlier ideas, both English and
                    Norman, than the succession of Matilda. The imperial widow was presently married
                    to Geoffrey of Anjou, a marriage clearly designed with a view to the enlargement
                    of the continental dominions of her father’s house.</p>
                <p>King Henry died in 1135, leaving, as ho deemed, the succession to his daughter
                    and her young son Henry. As usual, an arrangement made before the vacancy was
                    set aside, and the choice of England fell on Stephen. The case of the new king’s
                    election was not unlike the older and more famous case of the election of
                    Harold. In itself it was perfectly good. Against it stood the fact that Stephen
                    had, with the rest of the chief men, sworn to the succession of Matilda. Stephen
                    then was a perjurer as regarded his own soul; he was no usurper as regarded the
                    nation. He was accepted without opposition, and King Henry’s son Robert did
                    homage to him with the rest. But Stephen, a man of many winning personal
                    qualities, was utterly unable to reign in those times. Rebellions broke out;
                    Earl Robert asserted the rights of hi3 sister in England, and Normandy was
                    conquered by her husband Geoffrey. The empress landed in England (1139); she was
                    chosen Lady (1141)—the name Queen was not used; but she was never crowned. A
                    civil war, a time of utter anarchy and havoc raged, till (1153) another
                    agreement of the usual kind was made between Stephen and Matilda’s son Henry,
                    now duke of the Normans. He had been brought over to England as a child; he had
                    taken his share in the wars; and it was now agreed that Stephen should keep the
                    crown for life, and that Henry should succeed him. This time the agreement took
                    effect. When Stephen died in the next year, Henry succeeded without opposition.
                    Again a duke of the Normans succeeded to the crown of England; but Henry of
                    Anjou, by birth-place Henry of Le Mans, was far more than duke of the Normans
                    and king of the English, To the lands of his mother’s father be added the lands
                    of his father, Anjou, Maine, and Touraine; and a politic marriage gave him a
                    greater dominion still. The designs of William Rufus upon the duchy of Aquitaine
                    came to pass in another way. The great dominion of Southern Gaul, Poitou,
                    Aquitaine, and Gascony, had passed to Eleanor the daughter of their last duke.
                    She married Lewis, the heir of the crown of France, who almost immediately
                    succeeded to the kingdom (1137). For a moment France and Aquitaine, Northern and
                    Southern Gaul, the land of <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> and the land of or, were
                    joined together. It might seem that a kingdom of France, in the modern sense,
                    was about to begin. But the northern king and the southern duchess did not
                    agree. A canonical objection to the marriage was conveniently found, and it was
                    accordingly annulled. The divorced queen at once married the young duke of the
                    Normans (1152). Her dominions came with her, and the prince who now succeeded to
                    the crown of England already held the greatest power in Gaul, a power far
                    greater than that of his nominal lord at Paris. With that dominion he won the
                    undying hatred of the lord whose wife with her splendid heritage had passed to
                    him. The king of Paris was not yet to be master of Southern Gaul. He was to be
                    again shut up in his inland dominion, while his mighty vassal held the mouths of
                    .the great rivers and the fairest cities of the land. As England under Cnut
                    might seem to have become part of a Scandinavian empire, so under Henry she
                    might seem to have become part of a Gaulish empire. <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi> Γhe strictly Norman period of the English history comes to an end.
                    Normandy and England have alike become parts of the dominions of a king who by
                    female descent might be called either Norman or English, but who, both by birth
                    and by general character, was neither Norman nor English. In ruling over a vast
                    number of distinct states, widely differing in blood, language, and everything
                    else, ruling over all without exclusively belonging to any, Henry II., king,
                    duke, and count of all the lands from the Pyrenees to the Scottish border, was
                    the forerunner of the emperor Charles V.</p>
                <p>It was during the reigns of the two sous and the grandson of the Conqueror that
                    the chief steps were taken towards the fusion of English and Normans into one
                    people, or rather towards the change of Normans into Englishmen. At the
                    accession of Rufus the distinction was in full force; at the accession of Henry
                    I. it is clearly visible. In the course of Henry’s reign it so far died out
                    that, though it was doubtless not forgotten, it was no longer marked by outward
                    distinction. The name of Englishman now takes in all natives of England, of
                    whatever descent. A tale of a general conspiracy to kill all the Normans soon
                    after the accession of Stephen proves, when it is examined, to mean, just as in
                    the case of the massacre of St Brice, not a design to slay everyman of Norman
                    descent in England, but merely a design to slay a particular body of Norman
                    mercenary soldiers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    nearly together; nothing tended to keep them apart. The brutal tyranny of Rufus
                    wronged both races alike; yet men of native English descent could rise even
                    under him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The career of

                    a case in point. So at the accession of Henry I. there were several Englishmen
                    holding abbeys, one of whom, Godric of Peterborough, had been chosen by the
                    monks, who paid William Rufus a large sum for leave to elect freely.</p></note>
                    The cold despotism of Henry at once benefited and offended both races alike. At
                    one time of his reign we meet with a complaint that he would admit no Englishman
                    to high office. M hen the complaint is tested, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n320/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0320-0303"/> it is found that the exclusion extended to
                    natives of England of both races, that the preference was a preference for
                    absolute foreigners as such. The horrors of the anarchy in Stephen’s day fell on
                    both races alike; the foreign mercenaries who laid waste the land were hateful
                    to both alike. We may safely say that, at the time of the accession of Henry of
                    Anjou, the man of Norman descent born in England had, altogether in feeling and
                    largely in speech, become an Englishman.</p>
                <p>None of these three reigns was a time of great legislative changes, but the
                    reigns of Rufus and Henry were the time in which the new system of
                    administration grew up. Under Rufus the doctrine of military tenures, and of the
                    incidents consequent on such tenures, was put into systematic shape by his
                    rapacious minister Randolf Flambard, whom be raised to the bishopric of Durham.
                    This man is distinctly charged with having first subjected ecclesiastical
                    property to these burthens, and there can be little doubt that it was he who
                    laid them on lay property also. The evidence is this. Under the Conqueror we see
                    the germs and beginnings of certain usages, but nothing more. At the accession
                    of Henry they appear in a systematic shape as established usages, usages which
                    Henry does not promise to abolish, though he does promise to reform the abuses
                    of them. The feudal burthens were a logical deduction from the doctrine of
                    military tenure. The land is held of the lord on condition of certain services
                    being rendered. It passes from father to son; but in order that each successive
                    tenant may strictly hold it as a grant from the lord, the heir must receive it
                    again. For the new grant he must pay a <hi rend="italic">relief,</hi> the price
                    of the <hi rend="italic">relevatio,</hi> the taking up again, of the estate
                    which has lapsed to the lord. But it may be that the heir is from age or sex
                    incompetent to discharge the services due to the lord. In the case of the minor
                    heir, the lord takes the fief into his own hands till the heir is of age to
                    discharge them. The heiress can never discharge them in person, she must
                    discharge them through a husband. But the interests of the lord require that she
                    shall marry only with his approval, lest she should carry the fief into the
                    hands of an enemy All these occasions were turned by the perverse ingenuity of
                    Randolf Flambard into means for increasing the royal revenue. The wardship,
                    —that is, the temporary possession of the minor’s estate,—might be granted or
                    sold. So might the marriage, of the heiress. The lord might either sell her and
                    her estate for money, or else he. might take money from the heiress herself for
                    leave to marry according to her own inclinations So with bishoprics and abbeys;
                    Flambard found out that they too were held of the king by military service.
                    During the vacancy of the benefice, there was no one to discharge the service;
                    the king therefore took temporary possession of the ecclesiastical estate. And,
                    as the new prelate could not be chosen without the royal consent, the king might
                    prolong that temporary possession as long as he chose. All these inferences were
                    logically drawn out and sternly carried into practice by the minister of Rufus.
                    The utmost that Henry pledged himself to do was to reform the grosser
                    oppressions of his brother’s reign, and to limit his exactions within some
                    reasonable bounds. The claims themselves went on, to the oppression and sorrow
                    of successive generations of heirs and heiresses, till, as regards lay tenures,
                    the whole system was swept away by the famous Act of Charles II.</p>
                <p>There is nothing to make us think that the innovations of Flambard were ever put
                    forth in a legislative shape. At all events, no laws of William Rufus are
                    extant. A book is extant which calls itself the Laws of Henry; but, like the
                    codes called the law of Eadward and William, it is rather a private compilation
                    or law-book. It has a certain value, as a witness to the state of the law in
                    Henry I.’s time; but it must not be mistaken for a collection of real statutes
                    put forth by that king. It is remarkable for the strongly English character of
                    the jurisprudence described. There can be little doubt that the compiler
                    purposely gave his work as English a character as he could; but there is as
                    little doubt that Henry strove to give to his government, as far as he could, at
                    least the appearance of an English character. In his charter he grants to his
                    people the law of King Eadward —that is, the system of government which
                    prevailed in Eadward’s reign—with his father’s amendments. And, both in the
                    charter and in other documents of his reign, the time of King Eadward is
                    constantly taken as the standard. Henry however kept the forests in his own
                    hands, and preserved the stern forest law of his father. The reign of Henry is
                    also memorable as the time of the earliest extant charters, both of the king and
                    of other lords, granting new privileges to boroughs, often calling them into
                    legal existence for the first time. Thus the citizens of London are exempted
                    from various burthens of different kinds, and from the jurisdiction of any but
                    their own courts. They have further the farm of all Middlesex—their subject
                    district—and the appointment of their own sheriff. In the next reign or rather
                    anarchy, the citizens of London appear distinctly as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >communio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">commune.</hi></p>
                <p>But if this period was not marked by many formal changes in the law, the new
                    administrative system grew stronger and stronger. If the reign of Rufus
                    systematized the military tenures, the reign of Henry systematized the exchequer
                    and the great offices of state. A family of able ministers begins with Roger,
                    chancellor, justiciar, and bishop of Salisbury, a family of the secularized
                    churchmen of that day, most of whom rose from the king’s service to high
                    ecclesiastical office. Henry, a strict administrator of justice, looked no less
                    narrowly after his own interests. Under him we get the earliest pipe-roll of the
                    exchequer, and a wonderful document it is, showing how many and how strange were
                    the sources of income which flowed into the board of a Norman king.</p>
                <p>These ιeigns are also of the highest moment in ecclesiastical history. We now see
                    what the ecclesiastical effects of the Conquest really were. As we have seen,
                    the tendency of the time was to make bishoprics the reward of temporal services,
                    a practice which under Rufus easily sank into direct simony. Yet Rufus himself,
                    in a fit of sickness and repentance, put a saint at the head of the English
                    Church. After a vacancy of four years (1089-1093) Anselm succeeded Lanfranc in
                    the see of Canterbury. Anselm was forced into the office, but at this stage he
                    showed no objection whatever to the ancient English mode of investiture, by
                    which the prelate received his staff from the king, and became his man. But, in
                    such a reign as that of Rufus, the tendencies of such a man as Anselm could not
                    fail to be Romewards. Rome might well seem to be the seat of law, as opposed to
                    the <hi rend="italic">unlaw</hi> of the reigning king. The quarrel began about
                    the acknowledgment of a pope of disputed title, it went on about various
                    matters, till Anselm crossed the sea to confer with Pope Urban. He remained in
                    banishment till the death of Rufus, and learned at Bari and at Rome that the
                    laws of England were evil, that no churchman ought to receive investiture from a
                    lay lord or do homage to a lay lord for the lands of his church. He was recalled
                    by Henry, and served him loyally during Robert’s invasion. But he refused to do
                    homage or to consecrate the bishops whom the king had invested. A second absence
                    from England (1103-1106) followed, till a compromise was made between the king
                    and Pope Paschal. The king gave up the claim to invest with the staff; but the
                    prelate was to do homage to the king for his lands. Anselm then came back.</p>

                <p>The controversy is a memorable one, not the least so because Henry and Anselm are
                    an almost solitary example of a king and a bishop who could each maintain claims
                    which he held to be right without loss of temper or breach of personal
                    friendship. Anselm was a true saint. He wa3 no mere stickler for ecclesiastical
                    privileges, but a denouncer of moral evil. One of his canons again denounces the
                    slave-trade, and indeed denounces slavery itself. Yet it is plain that through
                    Anselm the power of the Roman see in England greatly advanced, and he laboured
                    hard to forbid the English use which allowed marriage to the clergy. Under his
                    successors the claims of Rome grew yet faster, and a succession of canons were
                    passed against the married clergy. Under the anarchy it is not wonderful if the
                    ecclesiastical power grew: it was the only thing in the realm which kept any
                    likeness of law. Ecclesiastical synods took upon themselves to judge the king;
                    and the right of succession to the English crown was argued in a solemn pleading
                    before the court of Rome. The doctrine of clerical exemptions grew; it was held
                    that no clerk might be tried in a temporal court for any crime whatsoever.
                    Nothing did greater damage to Stephen than his imprisoning two bishops, the
                    famous Roger of Salisbury and his nephew Alexander of Lincoln. On the other
                    hand, the ecclesiastical courts continued to draw to themselves a large class of
                    causes which concerned laymen. Nor was this in those days altogether without a
                    good side. The bishops’ courts had a bad name for corruption, that is,
                    for·letting off offenders for money. But at least they were not bloody. As they
                    could not inflict death, so neither could they inflict the horrible mutilations
                    which were common, even in the case of very trifling offences, in the courts of
                    the king.</p>
                <p>This period was also marked by the introduction of the Cistercian order into
                    England. Houses of this order, a reform of the older Benedictine rule, never
                    reached the wealth and importance of the Benedictine houses; but they have added
                    a special feature to English scenery. The monks of this order habitually sought
                    wild and lonely spots; the ruined abbey is most commonly Cistercian. At the same
                    time, we see the first beginnings of the university 3ystem in England. Oxford, a
                    flourishing borough, a strong military post, a favourite seat of national
                    assemblies, and an occasional royal residence, now became for the first time a
                    seat of learning. The teaching of divinity began under Robert Pullein in the
                    days of Henry; that of law began under Vacarius in the days of Stephen. This is
                    really all that we know of the beginnings of that great university; but its
                    growth must have been steady during the whole of this century; for at the
                    beginning of the next the scholars of Oxford were a numerous and important
                    body.</p>
                <p>The relations of England to the rest of Britain are of considerable importance
                    during this time. The marriage of Malcolm and Margaret had most important
                    results on both countries. The Scottish kings became in truth English kings,
                    more truly English than the Normans and Angevins who reigned in England. Their
                    culture was English; they dwelled mainly in the English or Anglicized parts of
                    their dominions; strangers from England of both races were welcome at their
                    court. This English influence began under Malcolm; after a period of struggle,
                    it became fully established under David. Malcolm invaded England more than once,
                    both in the days of the Conqueror and in those of Rufus, and his last invasion
                    saw also his death at Alnwick (November 14, 1093). This invasion was perhaps
                    caused by an act of the king of the English which may well have been dangerous
                    to Scotland. Rufus was the one king of his race who enlarged the actual kingdom
                    of England. He made Cumberland, meaning by that name the old diocese of
                    Carlisle, an integral part of England; he peoplod it with colonists from
                    southern England, and he rebuilt or repaired the local capital, which became a
                    strong fortress against Scotland. After Malcolm came a time of struggles between
                    the Scottish and the new English party in Scotland, which was ended by Eadgar,
                    the son of Malcolm and Margaret, being placed on the throne by English help.
                    Under his reign and those of Alexander and David (1097-1153) the relations
                    between England and Scotland were close, and, as long as Henry of England lived,
                    perfectly peaceful. In Stephen’s day David asserted the rights of his niece the
                    empress; he twice invaded England; he suffered a great defeat in the battle of
                    the Standard; but he obtained the cession of the newly won land of Cumberland,
                    aud also of the earldom of Northumberland. Like Lothian at a former time, these
                    lands were to be held as English earldoms. Their possession by the Scottish
                    kings was short; but it doubtless tended, along with other things, to make
                    Lothian become more directly a part of the Scottish realm.</p>
                <p>Along the Welsh frontier the power of England greatly advanced under the two
                    Williams and under Henry. We may say, roughly speaking, that South Wales was
                    conquered at this time. But the conquest amounted to little mo than the
                    settlement of Norman lords with a following of all nations, who kept up from
                    their castles an endless warfare against the Welsh in their mountains. But one
                    part of the land was settled in another way. The southern peninsula of
                    Pembrokeshire, and seemingly the peninsula of Gower in Glamorgan, were under
                    Henry (1111) planted with a Flemish colony, which may be fairly called the last
                    of the Teutonic settlements in Britain. In the Flemish district of Pembrokeshire
                    the Britons and their tongue vanished as utterly as they had done from Kent. Two
                    of the chief to&gt;vns, Pembroke and Tenby, keep Welsh names in a corrupt form;
                    the rest of the local nomenclature preserves the names of the Flemish
                    leaders.</p>
                <p>With the accession of Henry of Anjou a new period begins. The purely English
                    period lias ended. The Norman period has ended also; England and Normandy are
                    alike under the rule of the cosmopolitan prince from Le Mans. Englishmen tried
                    to see a native king in the man who sprang through three generations of females
                    from the son of Eadmund Ironside.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See especially the dedication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Genealogia Regum,</hi> by Aethelred of Rievaux to Henry II. The king’s pedigree
                    is there traced up to Adam, without any reference to his Angevin father or to
                    his Norman grandfather.</p></note> And Henry was too wise to refuse to listen.
                    Whatever he was, he was not Norman, and under him the last traces of distinction
                    between men of English and of Norman birth in England altogether died out. Of
                    all the kings between the Conqueror and Edward the First, he has the best right
                    to the name of lawgiver. He is not the author of any formal code; but he is the
                    author of a greater number of actual enactments than any king before him. His
                    reign falls naturally into three parts. The first is taken up with the
                    restoration of order after the anarchy. To this work the young prince of
                    twenty-one, who had already won a name beyond the sea, gave himself with a good
                    will. He was helped in the work by one of the clerical statesmen of the age,
                    Thomas the son of Gilbert Becket of London, archdeacon of Canterbury and the
                    &lt; king’s chancellor. Thomas is one of the great examples of the fusion of
                    Normans and English. Born in London of Norman parents, he appears throughout his
                    career as a passionate lover of his native land and his native city. He •was a
                    favourite with the English people, nor is fhere a word to show that he deemed
                    himself, or was deemed by them, to be other than their countryman in the fullest
                    sense. King Henry and Chancellor Thomas worked hard for eight years to restore
                    the rule of law. One great difficulty in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n322/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0322-0305"/> their path was the new doctrine of the immunity
                    of the clergy from secular jurisdiction. These years were a time of comparative
                    peace, broken chiefly by a war (1159) with Lewis of France for the succession of
                    Toulouse. This war was, as we shall presently see, of great importance in a
                    constitutional point of view; and in it the chancellor’s functions,
                    ecclesiastical and civil, did not hinder him from showing himself in the third
                    character of a stout man-at-arms. At last, on the death of Archbishop Theobald
                    (1162), Henry committed the fatal mistake of raising his great minister to the
                    see of Canterbury, and the further mistake of expecting the new archbishop to
                    remain his minister. The step was in every way new; other bishoprics had been
                    used as rewards for temporal services; the primacy had been reserved, if not
                    always for saints, at least for men whose character was not prominently worldly.
                    Most archbishops had been monks. And though, both before and after the Conquest,
                    archbishops of Canterbury had been rulers of the realm in more characters thau
                    one, no archbishop had ever held a post in the king’s service like that of
                    chancellor. The see was forced upon Thomas; but, once archbishop, he put on the
                    character of his new office in all its fulness. As a mere deacon holding secular
                    office, he had been the king’s most trusty servant; now become priest, bishop,
                    archbishop, he threw up his secular post, and became the champion of the
                    ecclesiastical claims in their most extravagant shape. Quarrels soon arose
                    between him and the king, quarrels which neither king nor primate carried on in
                    the spirit of Anselm and Henry I. Thomas showed himself violent and provoking;
                    Henry showed himself mean and spiteful. The first great quarrel arose out of the
                    ecclesiastical claims; for Thomas, in his new position, tried to shelter even
                    the most guilty churchman from any punishment at the hands of the temporal
                    courts. The king caused a body of ordinances, known as the Constitutions of
                    Clarendon, to be drawn up, which professed to state the law as it stood under
                    Henry I. before the anarchy. They were certainly not, as the ecclesiastical
                    party called them, innovations of his own; but it was only natural that they
                    should seem innovations to the ecclesiastical party. There was to be no appeal
                    to any power out of the realm without the king’s special leave. As a natural
                    consequence, the clergy were not to leave the realm without the king’s licence.
                    Tfie ecclesiastical courts were no longer to shelter offenders against the laws
                    of the land. Advowsons were declared to be lay fees. The baronial character of
                    the estates of bishops and abbots was distinctly asserted, and on this followed,
                    as a logical consequence, the rule that those estates should pass into the
                    king’s hands during a vacancy. Elections of prelates were to be made in the
                    king’s chapel, with his consent. Another provision was added, not wholly new,
                    and which hardly touched the general question, but which still marks the growth
                    of the new ideas. The villain was not to be admitted to holy orders without the
                    consent of his lord.. The ecclesiastical legislation of Henry II. was, in fact,
                    only a little more than a codification of the practice of Henry I.; it was only
                    a little less than a forestalling of the legislation of Henry VIII. It contained
                    innovations on the practice of England before the Norman Conquest; but’they were
                    the innovations of Flambard, not of Henry himself. But the attempt was
                    premature. Thomas, in a moment of weakness, assented to the Constitutions, and
                    then withdrew his consent. Henry, thus far in the right, put himself in the
                    wrong by raking up all kinds of forgotten and frivolous demands against the
                    archbishop. Thomas fled from England and found shelter in France. It was the
                    interest of Lewis to support any enemy of Henry. A weary time of dispute and
                    intrigue followed, in -which Thomas was but feebly supported by the pope
                    Alexander III. Henry sometimes threatened to acknowledge the imperial antipope;
                    sometimes he forsook his own position; once, men said at the time, he went so
                    far as himself to accept a legation from the pope. At last the first quarrel was
                    patched up (1170). Thomas came back to England only to find a new and distinct
                    ground of quarrel. The king had caused his eldest son Henry to be crowned by
                    Roger archbishop of York, to the prejudice of the rights of the see of
                    Canterbury. New excommunications, new disputes, followed. At last four knights
                    in the king’s service, mistaking a few hasty words of their master, crossed from
                    Normandy to England, and slew the archbishop in his own church.</p>
                <p>Thomas really died for the rights of the church of Canterbury, not for any more
                    general principle. But the second quarrel, as could not fail to happen, got
                    mixed up in men’s minds with the first; and the murdered archbishop was looked
                    on as a saint and as a martyr to the general privileges of the church. The dead
                    martyr was a more dangerous enemy to the king than the living primate had been.
                    We now enter on the third period of Henry’s reign, a time of niueteen years, in
                    which Henry had to struggle against foes on every side, but chiefly against foes
                    that were of his own household. His overlord of France, his vassal of Scotland,
                    his own nobles, his wife and his own children, were all arrayed against him. As
                    far as England was concerned, Henry was successful against all. The rebellion of
                    the earls and the Scottish invasion (1174) both failed. On the continent his
                    fate was harder. The death of his eldest son, the rebellion of the youngest, the
                    loss of the city of his birth, utterly broke down his spirit. At the age of
                    fifty-six he died (1189) at Chinon, far away alike from England and from
                    Normandy, a worn-out and broken-hearted man.</p>
                <p>The great lawgiver was gone, and bis dominions passed to his rebellious son
                    Richard. This king has in popular belief become one of the heroes of England.
                    That he should ever have been looked upon as such, that he should by strangers
                    have been so looked upon even in his own time, shows how England had come to be
                    looked on as the head and centre of the vast dominion of her kings. Personally
                    Richard, though born on English ground, was the least English of all our kings.
                    Invested from his earliest years with his mother’s Southern dominions, Richard
                    of Poitou had little in him either of England or of Normandy: he was essentially
                    the man of Southern Gaul. Twice in his reign he visited England; to be crowned
                    on his first accession, to be crowned again after his German captivity. The rest
                    of his time was spent in his crusade, and in various continental disputes which
                    concerned England not at all, except so far as she had to pay for them. The
                    mirror of chivalry was the meanest and most insatiable of all the spoilers of
                    her wealth. For England, as a kingdom, all that he did was to betray her
                    independence by a homage to the emperor, which formed a precedent for a more
                    famous homage in the next reign. His reign is an important one in constitutional
                    progress, but as such it was the reigu of his ministers and not of himself. One
                    event towards the end of his reign has been often misunderstood. A commotion was
                    raised in London (1196) by William the son of Osbert, known as William with the
                    Long Beard, a fellowcrusader and seemingly a personal friend of the king’s.
                    William professed to be the champion of the poor against the rich. Out of this a
                    romantic story grew that he was the champion of the English against the Normans.
                    The writers of his own time show that he was deemed a martyr by his followers
                    and a traitor by his enemies; but they give no hint that he was the champion of
                    one race against another. Nor do they give us any clue as to his own descent,
                    English or Norman. There is not a word in any writer of the rei≤rn of Henry or
                    Richard to make us think <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n323/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0323-0306"/> that the distinction between the two races was at
                    all remembered in any hostile sense. Everything shows that all the inhabitants
                    of the kingdom were fast drawing together, in opposition to men born out of the
                    realm, whether in Normandy or anywhere else.</p>
                <p>Richard died, as he had lived, far away from England and Normandy, in a petty
                    quarrel with a Southern vassal (1199). Constitutional progress had gone on
                    silently in his absence. In the next reign freedom had to be won openly from a
                    tyrant by force of arms. No period of our history, save those of the Conversion
                    and the Conquest, is of greater importance than the seventeen years of John. A
                    popular confusion has to be got rid of with regard to his accession at the death
                    of Richard. John, the youngest son of Henry, was the only survivor of his
                    brothers; but Geoffrey, the third son of Henry, had left a son Arthur. Richard
                    seems at one time to have designed Arthur for his successor. But his last
                    bequest was in favour of his brother; and, even without that bequest, all
                    English precedent was in favour of the brother rather than of the nephew. Arthur
                    does not seem to have had a single partisan either in Normandy or in England.
                    John was received as duke, chosen and crowned as king, without opposition. But
                    on the continent generally the new doctrine of hereditary right had made much
                    greater advances than it had in England. Anjou acknowledged Arthur; and Philip
                    of France was led by an obvious policy to receive his homage for all the
                    continental dominions of his uncle. But Arthur and his followers were soon
                    crushed by the king-duke (1202), and the disappearance of Arthur left little
                    room for doubt that he had been put out of the way by his uncle. The king of the
                    French called into being a new jurisprudence out of the romances of Charlemagne,
                    and called on the twelve peers of France to sit in judgment on their felon
                    brother. Sentence of forfeiture of all lands held of the French crown was
                    pronounced against John. The sentence was carried out by an easy conquest of
                    continental Normandy. The islands clave to their duke, and they have ever since
                    remained possessions of the English crown, keeping their local independence and
                    their ancient laws. On behalf of the duchy John did not strike a blow; but he
                    led more than one expedition to secure or to win back his southern dominions,
                    and the final result was that, of all the continental possessions of Henry and
                    Richard, Aquitaine alone remained to their successors. The relations of England
                    to the continent were thus completely changed. Under Henry and Richard England
                    had been only one, though the greatest, among the endless possessions of her
                    king. Now that Normandy, Maine, and Anjou became provinces of France, Aquitaine
                    became distinctly a distant dependency of England To the crown of France the
                    gain was beyond words; the king was now a greater potentate than any of his
                    vassals. He had won back those old possessions of the French duchy which had so
                    long cut off its dukes and kings from the sea. To England the loss was the
                    greatest of gains. It broke the last tie which bound any part of the inhabitants
                    of England to any land beyond the four seas of England. If anything was still
                    wanting to wipe out every trace of distinction between the descendants of those
                    who a hundred and forty years earlier had been the conquerors and the conquered,
                    the French conquest of Normandy did the work. Every man in England was now an
                    Englishman, and nothing but an Englishman. One question only has to be asked:
                    Why did Normandy, the old foe of France, submit so tamely to a French conquest!
                    The reason seems plain. Normandy was a conquered land. With Henry I. the line of
                    her national dukes had ended. K the French king was a stranger, he was.not more
                    a stranger than the king of England and count of Anjou. The duchy really lost
                    nothing by passing from a state which might seem that of a dependency, to become
                    an integral portion, often a royal apanage, of a kingdom of its own speech.
                    Aquitaine, on the other hand, foreign alike to England, Normandy, and France,
                    found its account in cleaving to the more distant sovereign. The nobles were
                    drawn to France by community of feeling in many ways; but the cities clave to
                    the distant king, who was their ally and protector rather than their master.</p>
                <p>The English nation was now united: the smaller mass of the conquerors had been
                    received and assimilated by the greater mass of the conquered. Events now
                    thickly press one upon another, and all of them tended to draw all the sons of
                    the soil closer and closer together. John, like Richard, was born in England;
                    but, like Richard, he was in feeling neither English nor Norman. He surrounded
                    himself with foreign counsellors and with foreign soldiers. He presently plunged
                    into an ecclesiastical quarrel which showed the weak side of the ecclesiastical
                    policy of the Conqueror. It reeded William himself to carry out William’s
                    system. A disputed election to the see of Canterbury gave Innocent III. an
                    opportunity for putting in a nominee of his own, and his choice—it must have
                    been unwittingly—fell on one of the foremost of English patriots, on the first
                    of the noble band who defied pope and king alike on behalf of the freedom of
                    England. The candidate of the king and the candidate of the monks both gave way
                    to Stephen Langton. John had so utterly turned away from him all the hearts of
                    his people that none stood by him, even when the pope took upon him to declare
                    the king of the English deposed from his crown, and to offer that crown to the
                    king of the French. In his despair John became the man of the Roman pontiff, as
                    his brother had become the man of the Roman Caesar. Archbishop Stephen now came
                    back to England. The laws of king Eadward were renewed. When John flew to arms,
                    the barons and people of England, with the primate at their head, swore to bring
                    back the ancient laws, the laws of Eadward, the laws of Henry. Those names are
                    now heard for the last time. John was constrained (1215) to sign the Great
                    Charter; and from that day Englishmen called for the observance of the Great
                    Charter, as they had hitherto called for the laws of Eadward. By that charter
                    resistance to the royal power was legalized; in the struggle that followed it
                    was the king who was the rebel. John had hardly sealed the charter, when he sent
                    to his overlord at Rome, and the pontiff took upon him to annul the recovered
                    liberties and to denounce suspensions and excommunications against those who had
                    won them. At the head of his foreign mercenaries, the king laid waste his own
                    dominions. The barons in despair chose a new king, and offered the crown to
                    Lewis of France. Such a choice seems to us yet more strange than the speedy
                    submission of Normandy to Lewis’s father. That the step was most unwise was
                    presently proved; but at the time it was intelligible alike to Normans and to
                    Englishmen. If Lewis was a stranger, so was John. Personally Lewis promised far
                    better than John, nor was it easy to find any other available candidate. If not
                    Lewis himself, yet his wife, came by female descent of the royal stock; and the
                    only likely competitor, the emperor Otto, was at once closely allied with his
                    uncle John and had shown that he could not keep the kingdoms which he trad
                    already. But, even before John died, men began to feel that, in inviting a
                    French king, they had invited a French conquest. In a few months (1216) the
                    death of John cut the knot; all English feeling turned to the side of his young
                    and innocent son. He was indeed a minor, but a minor was better than a stranger.
                    Henry III. succeeded as a national king, and a burst of national feeling drove
                    the French out of the land. A long and weary time followed, in which the freedom
                    of England was slowly growing up, <pb break="no"

                    had to be again asserted on the field of battle.</p>
                <p>No time is richer than this in legal history. The whole reign of Henry II. was a
                    reign of legislation, and the work was not interrupted even during the time of
                    the great struggle with the archbishop. In the year before the promotion of
                    Thomas to the primacy, king and chancellor had dealt one direct blow at all
                    feudal ideas. In the war of Toulouse the <hi rend="italic">scutage</hi> was
                    first devised; a money payment was accepted instead of personal military
                    service. The money was of course spent in hiring mercenaries; and it was Largely
                    by the help of mercenaries that Henry subdued his rebels in England. But later
                    in his reign, by the Assize of Arms (1181), he regulated the old constitutional
                    force of the country, and enjoined that every free Englishman should be ready to
                    serve with the weapons belonging to his rank. Other incidental notices show us
                    that much legislation was done while Henry still had Thomas to his minister. But
                    the ordinances of which the text is preserved belong to a later time. The reign
                    of Henry is rich in charters to boroughs, several of which are early enough in
                    his reign to bear the signature of chancellor Thomas. And a reference iu the
                    Constitutions of Clarendon shows that, thus early iu his reign, Henry had begun
                    that great step towards the development of jury trial which is one of the
                    special marks of his reign. By the work of Henry and his chancellor the system
                    of recognition was organized, by which sworn men gave a verdict, but as yet a
                    verdict given from their own knowledge. The great legal writer of Henry’s reign,
                    the justiciar Randolf of Glauville, speaks of the recognition as a special gift
                    of Henry to his people, and enlarges on its superiority to the wager of battle.
                    All this comes within the chancellorship of Thomas; and we shall do the
                    chancellor great injustice, if we think wholly of his later ecclesiastical
                    character, and forget his services in the days when he was the chief minister of
                    one of our greatest kings. Of the extant ordinances of Henry’s reign, the oldest
                    after the charter issued at his coronation are the Constitutions of Clarendon
                    themselves (11G4). The Assize of Clarendon— a wholly distinct document
                    (1166)—and the Inquest of Sheriffs (1170) came during the time of the quarrel
                    with Thomas. On these, after the death of Thomas, follows in 1176 the Assize of
                    Northampton, in 1181 the Assize of Arms, and in 1184 the Assize of the Forest.
                    All these bear witnese to Henry’s care, even when he was most occupied with
                    other matters, to preserve the peace of the land, and to enable all his subjects
                    to have justice done to them in the king’s name. And in all, the mode of inquisi
                    tian by the oath of twelve lawful men grows at each step The Assizes of
                    Clarendon and Northampton have a special reference to one of Heury’s great
                    measures, that by which the visitation of the country by itinerant judges going
                    regu lar circuits was finally established. It was not an invention of his own;
                    the visits of the king’s judges had begun to take a regular shape under Henry I.
                    But it was Henry II. who organized the whole system afresh after the anarchy <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi>. It was he who finally established the specially
                    English principle that justice should be administered in different parts of the
                    kingdom by judges not belonging to the particular district, but immediately
                    commissioned by the king. When the king’s judges came and received the
                    inquisitions of the local jurors, though the complete modern ideal of a judge
                    and jury had not been readied, yet something had been reached which could grow
                    into that ideal without, any one moment of change so great as the changes
                    wrought by Henry himself. By him the jury was applied to all manner of purposes.
                    The Assize of Arms was distinctly a return to the old military εy <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi> stem. It gave a new life to thβ∕yrJ, the ancient
                    militia, which had never goue out of use, but which had been overshadowed by
                    feudal levies on the one hand and by the use of mercenaries on the other. Each
                    man was to have the arms which befitted the amount of his property. It was by a
                    jury that the liability of each man to be ranked in such or such a class was to
                    be fixed. Even in the Assize of the Forest, an ordinance framed to protect the
                    most exceptional and most oppressive of all the royal rights, the popular
                    element comes in. Sworn knights are appointed iu each shire to protect those
                    rights. Lastly, when in 1188 the tithe was levied for the defence of Eastern
                    Christendom against Saladin, the liability of each man to the impost was
                    assessed by a local jury. In all these ways the appeal to the oath of lawful
                    men, as opposed to any other form of fiuding out truth, was strengthened by
                    every step in the legislation of Henry.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the administrative system which had been growing up ever since the
                    Conquest took firm root under Henry. We have a contemporary picture of it, drawn
                    by one of Henry’s own officials, in the <hi rend="italic">Dialogus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Scaccariο,</hi> This was the work of Richard, treasurer of the
                    exchequer and bishop of London, one of the family of officials founded by Roger
                    of Salisbury. Alongside of this, we have our first strictly legal treatise, as
                    distinguished from private compilations and codes, in the work of the great
                    justiciar Randolf of Glanville. Iu short, we may say that under Henry the legal
                    system of England took a shape which it has practically kept ever since. The
                    endless changes of the last seven hundred years are rather special amendments of
                    Henry’s work than anythiug which can be said to start altogether afresh from a
                    new point. Strictly constitutional advance rather belongs to the reigns of
                    Heury’s sons than to that of Henry himsçlf. Nor is this wonderful.
                    Constitutional advance commonly means the lessening of the royal power, and acts
                    which lessen the royal power do not often issue from the free will of kings In
                    Henry’s time, above all, a time when law aud order had to be restored after the
                    reign of anarchy, the momentary need was rather to strengthen the royal power
                    than to lessen it. Legal reforms are often, as in this case, the free gift of
                    wise kings; constitutional reforms lιave commonly to be wrested from weak or
                    wicked kings. But the legal reforms of Henry supplied an element which largely
                    entered into the constitutional reforms of the next stage. Out of Henry’s
                    favourite institution of recognitions on oath grew, not only trial by jury, but
                    also the House of Commons.</p>
                <p>By the time of Henry IT. the force of circumstances, especially the working of
                    the practice of summons, had gradually changed the aucient assembly of the whole
                    nation into a mere gathering of the great men of the realm. The work which had
                    now to be done, and which, in the space of about a hundred years, was gradually
                    done by a number of instruments, conscious aud unconscious, was to call into
                    being a secoud and more popular assembly alongside of the assembly which had
                    lost its popular character. To use language which belongs to a somewhat later
                    time than that with which we are now dealing, the House of Lords already
                    existed; the House of Commons had to be called into being alongside of it. The
                    details of this great process of constitutional growth must be drawn out by the
                    strictly constitutional historian. All that can be done here is to call
                    attention to the main lines of the process and to its more remarkable landmarks.
                    And it may be well from the very beginning to give the warning tlιat the two
                    Houses of the English Parliament did not arise out of any theoretical preference
                    for two houses over one or three. The number was fixed, like everything else in
                    English history, by what we are apt to call circumstances or accidents. Our
                    whole parliamentary system was eminently one which was not made, but grew. Thus,
                    for instance, it was only gradually established that the barons should be
                    personally summoned.</p>

                <p>to the same house as the bishops and earls, while the knights should appear only
                    by their representatives along with the smaller freeholders and the burgesses of
                    the towns. It is in the reign of Richard I. that we begin to see the first faint
                    glimmerings of parliamentary representation. The one object of the absentee king
                    was to screw all the money that he could out of the kingdom for which he cared
                    not. The object of his wise ministers, of Archbishop Hubert among the first, was
                    to gain the greatest amount of money for their master with the least amount of
                    oppression towards the nation. Under Hubert’s administration, chosen bodies of
                    knights or other lawful men, acting in charactere which become more and more
                    distinctly representative, were summoned for every kind of purpose. How far they
                    were nominated, how far freely elected, is not always clear. It seems most
                    likely that in one stage they were nominated by the sheriff in the county court,
                    while at a later stage they were chosen by the county court itself. In other
                    words, the principle of representation was first established, and then the next
                    stage naturally was that the representatives should be freely chosen. Summoned
                    bodies of knights appear in characters which are the forerunners of grand jurors
                    and of justices of the peace. They appear also in a character which makes them
                    distinctly forerunners of the knights of the shire which wero soon to come. A
                    chosen body of knights have to assess the imposts on each shire. From assessing
                    the taxes the next stage was to vote or to refuse them. In 1213 the sheriffs aré
                    called on to summon four discreet men from each shire, to come and speak with
                    the king about the affairs of the realm. When we have reached this stage, we
                    have come very near to a <hi rend="italic">parliament,</hi> name and thing.</p>
                <p>The reign of John, in short, is marked by common consent as the time from which
                    Englishmen date the birth of their national freedom in its later form. From his
                    day men no longer asked for the observance of the laws of Eadward. They asked
                    for the observance of John’s own charter, which was deemed to be nothing else
                    than the laws of Eadward in a new shape. By that charter all the great
                    principles of constitutional government were affirmed. They were so fully
                    affirmed as to be in advance of the age; only a few years later men shrank from
                    affirming them again with so clear a voice. Stephen Langton doubtless saw
                    further than other men of his day; but, if in one or two points he claimed more
                    than his generation was ready for, the great mass of his legislation took root
                    at once, and so prepared men for the final acceptance of all a generation or two
                    later. The Charter is the first’ solemn act of the united English nation after
                    Norman conquerors and Norman settlers had become naturalized Englishmen. Of
                    distinction of race or law there is not a word. The one distinction drawn is
                    that between freeman and villain, and even the villain has rights which the
                    Charter protects. It ordains nothing new, except the temporary provisione for
                    its own enforcement, provisions which give a legal sanction to the natural right
                    of resisting a king who rebels against the law. Novel abuses areto be redressed;
                    new means of redressing them are supplied; but the old law of England, the law
                    of Eadward, the law of Henry, stands firm. But it is with the strictly
                    constitutional provisions of theCharter that we are here most concerned.
                    Representation was already fast growing up; but it had hardly yet reached such a
                    stage that it could be ordained in legal form. But rules are laid down out of
                    which, even if it had not begun already, representation in the strictest sense
                    could not fail shortly to arise. The distinction which had been growing up ever
                    since the Conquest, and indeed before, between the <hi rend="italic">Witaη</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Landsittiny men</hi> now receives a legal sanction.
                    The practice of summons makes the distinction. Certain great men, prelates,
                    earls, and greater barons, are to receive the personal summons. The rest of the
                    king’s tenants-inchief are to be summoned only in a body. Here we have almost
                    come to a separation of Lords and Commons. But in modern ideas those names imply
                    two distinct houses; and it was not yet settled, it had not yet come into men’s
                    minds to consider, whether the national council should consist of one house or a
                    dozen. But it is decreed in so many words that the acts of those who came would
                    bind those who stayed away. On such a provision representation, and not only
                    representation but election of the representatives, follows almost as a matter
                    of course. The mass stay away; a few appear, specially commissioned to act in
                    the name of the rest. The Charter mentions only the king’s tenants-inchief; so
                    far had things been marred and feudalized by the influence of the Conquest. But
                    as the election could only be made in the ancient county court, every freeholder
                    at least, if not every freeman, won back his ancient right. If he could not come
                    himself to cry Yea or Nay, he at least had a voice in choosing those who could
                    do so with greater effect.</p>
                <p>The point in which the legislation of the Charter seems to have bθθn in advance
                    of the age was with regard to the power of the purse. The old threefold burthen,
                    the <hi rend="italic">lriηoda</hi><hi rend="italic">necessitas,</hi> seeme, in
                    the new feudalized state of things, to have given way to the three cases in
                    which the lord might lawfully call on his man for an aid. These were his own
                    ransom from captivity, the knighting of his eldest son, and the marriage of his
                    eldest daughter. This right is allowed to the king; but he could call for money
                    in no other case, unless it was voted to him by the national council. This was
                    the old law, and in quite recent times both Thomas of London and St Hugh, the
                    Burgundian bishop of Lincoln, had, in full assembly, withstood exactions on the
                    part of Henry and Richard. But, though both ancient law and modern precedent
                    were for the clause, men were not ready for the direct assertion of its
                    principle. The clause was left out at the later confirmations of the Charter,
                    and the right was not again fully established till the end of the century. The
                    provisions which were temporary were not the least important. Twenty-five barons
                    were appointed to carry them out, and, to show the advance of municipal rights,
                    among them was the mayor of London. If the king broke his oath, they were to
                    call the whole commons of the kingdom to their help, and to constrain the rebel
                    king by forco. When John again rebelled, his barons and people drew the sword
                    against him, and they were but carrying out the letter of the law.</p>
                <p>The main principles of constitutional government had thuβ been established; the
                    old freedom had been won back in a new shape. England was England again. But the
                    European position of England had altogether changed. The final outcome of Norman
                    and Angevin rule in England had been to make England an European and a
                    continental power, holding two Gaulish dependencies, the duchy of Aquitaine and
                    the insular Normandy. But the vast extension of the Angevin dominions before
                    they were thus cut short had brought England into connexion with most parts of
                    Europe. The daughters of Henry IL, like the daughters of Eadward the
                    Unconquered, were married to princes in distant lands, in Ca3tile, Sicily, and
                    Saxony. This last marriage, that of Matilda with Henry the Lion, gave the old
                    connexion between England and Germany a special direction. During the dispute
                    with the archbishop, Henry was more than once tempted to forsake the obedience
                    of Alexander III., and to accept the pontiffs who were successively set up by
                    the emperor Frederick. But the Saxon marriage caused kings whose internal policy
                    was distinctly Ghibeline to appear in foreign lands as the allies of the Guelf.
                    Otto IV., the son of Henry the Lion and Matilda, was constantly at the court of
                    his uncles, and he received <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0326-0309"/> from them earldoms and promises of kingdoms. It
                    was in alliance with him that Englishman, German, and Fleming stood side by side
                    when all three were overcome by the French king at Bouvines. In other parts of
                    the empire, we find Henry seeking a wife for his son John in Savoy, and bringing
                    a saint from Grenoble to rule at Witham and at Lincoln. But more than all,
                    England, as a power, began at this period to take a direct share in the
                    crusades. Individual Englishmen of both races had fought in earlier crusades,
                    aud had entered the service of the eastern emperors. But Henry himself took the
                    vow of a crusader, and Richard carried that vow into effect. In foreign lands
                    the Poitevin count appeared as an English king, and his followers, of whatever
                    race or speech, were looked on as Englishmen. The fame of England was thus
                    spread through all lands; yet it was in the reigns of Richard and John that the
                    crown of England was humbled as it never was before or since Richard became the
                    man of the emperor for his kingdoms; John became the man of the pope. That he
                    also offered to become the man of the Almohade Commander of the Faithful reads
                    almost like a piece of satire; but the evidence on which the story rests cannot
                    be lightly cast aside.</p>
                <p>Within the island world of Britain the power of England rose for a moment under
                    Henry II. to a greater height than it had ever risen at any earlier time. Or we
                    might say that another island world, less only than Britain itself, was brought
                    into relation with the world of Britain, as the world of Britain was brought
                    into relation with the world of Europe. The first Angevin king of England became
                    the first English lord of Ireland. The connexion between the two islands had
                    been growing close for a long time. Shadowy tales are told of a dominion
                    exercised by Eadgar and by Cnut on the eastern shore of Ireland. It is more
                    certain that, under the two Williams and under Henry I., first the Danish
                    settlers, and then the Irish themselves, entered into spiritual relations with
                    the see of Canterbury which could hardly fail to grow into temporal relations
                    with the crown of England. One Irish king was, if not the vassal, at least the
                    attached friend, of Henry I. One of the first acts of Henry II. was to obtain a
                    bull from the one English pope, Hadrian IV., granting him the dominion of the
                    island of Ireland. But the conquest of the new realm was begun only by private
                    adventurers in 11 G9. For one moment, in 1171, the conquest seemed to be a
                    reality. The Irish princes became the men of Henry, who presently granted the
                    kingdom of Ireland to his son John. But in truth all that was done was to begin
                    that long and dreary tale of half-conquest and local warfare which gave Ireland
                    five centuries of greater wretchedness than England had endured in the first
                    five years of Norman domiuion. As if from a feeling how unreal the claim was,
                    the kingly style granted to John was dropped by John himself; and, till the
                    reign of Henry VIII., the king of England took from his precarious Irish
                    dominion no higher title than Lord.</p>
                <p>On the Welsh frontier the endless warfare vent on; but this cannot be called a
                    period of conquest. The armies of Henry II. suffered at least one defeat at the
                    hands of the Britons; and the contemporary writer John of Salisbury ventures to
                    regret that England had not in his day a leader like Harold to guard her
                    frontier. Under John we find the first connexion by marriage between the ruling
                    houses of England and Wales. A natural daughter of John was married to the Welsh
                    prince Llywelyn. From this time the position of the Welsh princes changes, and
                    they begin to play a certain part in the internal affairs of England. On the
                    Scottish frontier Henry II. took back the earldoms of Northumberland and
                    Cumberland, which had been yielded to David and his son. Presently the share
                    taken by William the Lion in the revolt of the English barons was avenged in
                    1174 by his defeat and captivity, aud bj his acknowledgment of a supremacy of an
                    altogether new kind on the part of the English overlord. For the firsl time,
                    Scottish lords, as well as Scottish kings, did homage to Henry; aud, for the
                    first time also, Scottish castles were placed in his hands. But when the
                    chivalrous Richard was selling everything, he sold back these newly acquired
                    rights. The relations in which the kingdom of Scotland, the earldom of Lothian,
                    and the territorial fief of what we may now best distinguish as Scottish
                    Cumberland, stood tc the English crown fell back to their former state, to form
                    materials for a great controversy a hundred years later.</p>
                <p>With regard to language, this period is one in which the use of Latin becomes
                    universal in all public documents. There are still a few English writs of the
                    early days of Henry IL, and the first known French document comes from the hand
                    of Stephen Langton in the year of the Great Charter. The truth is that the men
                    of this time were so familiar with the use of all three languages, English,
                    French, and Latin, that it is rarely indeed that any writer thinks it needful to
                    mention which of the three a man spoke at any particular moment. But it is clear
                    that, by the end of the 12th century, English was understood and spoken by all
                    classes. It is equally clear that a fashion now set in in favour of French
                    merely as a fashion. Richard was altogether non-resident, and could have had
                    little influence on such matters. But John, and after him Henry III., kept a
                    foreign court in England. Though born in the land, they were far more strangers
                    than Henry II. bad been. Thus, at the very moment when French had lost its
                    position as the natural speech of one class of the inhabitants of England, it
                    came to the front again as a mere courtly speech, foreign to all. In short, in
                    regard to language, as in regard to matters of fashion generally, the Norman
                    period was succeeded by a French period. But neither French nor English was at
                    this time the tongue of solid literature, as distinguished from writings which
                    are merely popular or merely courtly. Such writings were severally English and
                    French. But all the learned writings of a learned age were in Latin. Neither in
                    English nor in French is there any original English history of this time, unless
                    we except the rhyming chronicles of Wace and Benoît de Sainte More, which are
                    writings essentially Norman, though incidentally bearing on English matters. Our
                    Latin materials for the history of this time are abundant. We have the so-called
                    Beuedict of Peterborough; we have Roger of Howden and Gervase of Canterbury; we
                    have Ralph de Diceto and the critical William of Newburgh. The quarrel between
                    Henry and Thomas gave rise to an endless crop of letters, lives, and documents
                    of all kinds. The expedition of Richard I. finds its place among the histories
                    of the crusades. And, while history was thus, abundant, legend was not wanting.
                    The actual life of Geoffrey of Monmouth belongs to the days of Henry I. and
                    Stephen; but it was in the second half of the century that his writings began to
                    have a lasting influence. His wild fables of Arthur and earlier British kings
                    seem at the outside to have preserved a few distorted scraps of genuine
                    West-Welsh history. But they gave birth to a vast legendary literature, Latin,
                    French, aud English, which has done more perhaps than any other one cause to
                    make Englishmen forget that they were Englishmen. And, beside history and
                    legend, there was also at this time no lack of Latin literature of a more
                    general kind, such as the writings of John of Salisbury, Peter of Blois, and the
                    often misunderstood Walter Map or Mapes. Among many others these may pass as
                    some of the chief; but the literature of this age, of all classes, is
                    overflowing. Many of these writers were real scholars, <pb break="no"

                    In Giraldus we see something higher still. He was vain, spiteful, and careless
                    of truth. But, as we see in William of Malmesbury and William of Newburgh the
                    beginnings of historical criticism, so in Giraldus we see the first approaches
                    to something like scientific observation alike in language aud in natural
                    history.</p>
                <p>In the history of art this age is one of the greatest turning-points. It is the
                    time of transition between the round and the pointed arch, between the
                    Romanesque and the so-called Gothic style. The richer and lighter Norman style
                    of Roger of Salisbury was through the reign of Henry II. gradually getting still
                    richer and still lighter. The pointed arch, first introduced in the vaults, then
                    in the main arcades, gradually spread itself into every part of the building.
                    The change in the form of the arch was at first unaccompanied by any change in
                    detail; the Romanesque ornaments continued in use. Gradually they were changed
                    for a system of ornament which better suited the new constructive forms. By the
                    first years of the thirteenth century, the change was complete; a style all but
                    peculiar to England, quite peculiar to England and Normandy, a style marked by
                    the use of untraceried lancets as windows, combined with the use of purely
                    Gothic detail, was fully developed. The stages of the change may perhaps be best
                    studied in the churches of Canterbury and Lincoln. Along with the development of
                    architecture, there was an even more remarkable development of sculpture. The
                    carvers of the eleventh century and of the first half of the twelfth could
                    hardly represent the human figure; and when they attempted foliage, as in
                    capitals, it was rude and inartistic. The later years of the twelfth century
                    produced capitals almost rivalling the old Corinthian types. The next generation
                    struck out more original, but equally perfect, forms of beauty. The scul <hi

                    if it never shook itself free from a certain amount of conventional stiffness,
                    if its artists had neither the modern artist’s anatomical science nor the old
                    Greek’s familiarity with the human figure, was at least a vast advance on works
                    of the times immediately before them. English sculpture indeed leaped in the
                    thirteenth century to a point of excellence which it found hard to keep.</p>
                <p>The next period in English history may be measured in different w ays, according
                    to the point of view from which that history is looked at. The English nation
                    has now taken its later form. It has assimilated its Romance conquerors, and in
                    so doing it has received a certain Romance infusion in language, laws, and
                    manners. The connexion with Normandy has made England an European power. The
                    separation from Normandy has made England again an English power. The nation has
                    now to struggle against a new form of foreign invasion. Englishmen, of whichever
                    race, have to hold their own against the Poitevin and the Savoyard. They have to
                    wage the long struggle of the thirteenth century at once against the king at
                    home and against the pope beyond sea. This time is marked by the reign of Henry
                    III. But the time of struggle is also a time of constitutional progress, and
                    under Edward I. the law and constitution of England put on the essence of their
                    later form. Here then, in a purely constitutional view, is one of the landmarks
                    of our history, a landmark to be placed alongside of the Conquest and the Great
                    Charter. But our former landmarks, the Conquest, the accession of Henry IL, the
                    reign of John, were not merely constitutional landmarks, but landmarks in the
                    history of England as an European power. This last the legislation of Edward I.
                    can hardly be said to be. The next great European landmark is the beginning of
                    the long wars between England and France. From the reign of John to the reign of
                    Edward III., the foreign relations of England hold a secondary place as compared
                    with her constitutional pro gress. There are frequent wars with France; but they
                    are rather the wars of the duke of Aquitaine than of the king of England. Under
                    Edward III. a wholly new state of foreign relations begins. The rivalry between
                    England and France, which had grown out of the older rivalry between Normandy
                    and France and which had survived the separation of Normandy from England and
                    its union with France, now becomes, for a hundred years and more, the leading
                    feature in English history, one of the leading features in European history. In
                    this European aspect, the period which follows the claim of a French prince to
                    the crown of England comes to its natural end when a king of England claims the
                    crown of France. We take then our present start from the day when Lewis was
                    driven out of England, and we next draw our breath when Edward III. invades
                    France.</p>
                <p>The reign of Henry III. was, down almost to our own day, the longest in our
                    annals. The first forty years of it are, on the whole, the dreariest time in our
                    history. No time of so great a length has so few events which stand out as
                    prominent landmarks. First comes the minority of Henry, the time when,
                    notwithstanding the vigour of the great Earl Marshal, England was largely ruled
                    by papal legates. The homage of John had, according to feudal principles, made
                    the pope the guardian of his minor heir; and it was not the policy of Rome to
                    let that guardianship be a mere name. The Charter is confirmed over and over
                    again; but, as we have seen, with the loss of some of its most important
                    clauses. In 1227 the king declares himself of age; presently he gets rid of his
                    great minister Hubert of Burgh; he fills the land with Poitevins and other
                    kindred of his mother; he drives his nobles, his brother Earl Richard at their
                    head, into discontent, and some of them into rebellion. The new struggle of
                    Englishmen against strangers has begun. A new phase opens when help comes from
                    the quarter from which it could least have been looked for, when Englishmen find
                    a leader against strangers in one who was himself by birth a stranger. In 1238
                    Simon of Montfort first appears; he receives the king’s sister in marriage, with
                    the earldom of Leicester to which he had an hereditary claim. Suspected at first
                    as a foreigner, the earl grows into the truest of Englishmen. A reformer from
                    the beginning, he gradually widens his basis, till he becomes, above all men,
                    the leader of the people. Meanwhile the king’s marriage with Eleanor of Provence
                    brings a second shoal of strangers to feed on the good things of England. A
                    border war is waged against France with small good luck. In 1259 that war is
                    ended by a treaty, by which Normandy is given up for ever, and the English king
                    keeps nothing on the continent except part of the Aquitanian heritage of the
                    elder Eleanor. Meanwhile, during part of this time, Aquitaine is placed under
                    the rule of Earl Simon, a ruler beloved of the cities and hated of the nobles.
                    Meanwhile pope and king are draining the wealth of the nation; but their very
                    extortions help the growth of freedom. Parliament after parliament meets to make
                    grants indeed, but in making grants to protect and to assert its powers. In
                    1256, in 1257, new entangleμιents, new forms of extortion arose, while Earl
                    Richard, the one Englishman who was ever called to the throne of the Caesars,
                    passed into Germany to receive his almost nominal kingship. The crown of Sicily
                    was offered by Alexander IV. to the king’s younger son Edmund. More money is
                    demanded, more money is granted; but each grant leads to a fresh demand, and at
                    last the spirit of nobles and people is thoroughly roused. Forty-two years after
                    the accession of Henry, we reach the first great landmark of his reign, the
                    famous Provisions of Oxford.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n328/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0328-0311"/>
                <p>By these provisions the royal power was practically put in commission, very much
                    as it had been by the Great Charter in the latter days of John. It is specially
                    to be noticed that at this stage the king’s eldest son Edward, afterwards King
                    Edward I., appears on more than one occasion on the popular side. He and Simon
                    were for a while fellow-workers. But Henry, like John, rebelled against the
                    provisions which cramped his power, and about the same time Edward was
                    reconciled to his father. The matters at issue between the king and his people
                    were now submitted to the judgment of the king of the French, St Lewis himself.
                    But Lewis, if a saint, was also a king. By the mise of Amiens (1274) he annulled
                    the Provisions of Oxford, as overthrowing the royal authority; but at the same
                    time he decreed that the nation should keep its ancient liberties. To men who
                    held that the Provisions of Oxford were, like the Great Charter, simply a
                    re-enactment of ancient liberties, such an award seemed inconsistent on the face
                    of it. There was now no hope but in arms. The civil war now begins; Earl Simon,
                    a stranger by birth, is the leader of the barons and people of England. King
                    Richard of Germany, who once seemed destined to hold the place which Simon had
                    come to hold, was now fighting on the side of his brother and fellow-king. So
                    were the two kings’ sons, Edward of England and Henry of Germany. Kings and
                    kings’sons were overthrown at Lewes (May 13, 1264), and the royal authority
                    passed into the hands of the earl. By him, early in the next year, was held the
                    great Parliament, the first to which representatives of the boroughs were
                    summoned along with prelates, earls, barons, and knights of the shire. But
                    quarrels presently arose between Earl Simon and his fellow barons. Edward, kept
                    for a while in ward with his father, escaped and gathered an army. In the fight
                    of Evesham (4th August 1265) Simon was overthrown and killed, and was canonized,
                    not by the Rome which he had always withstood, but by the popular voice of
                    England. The war lingered at Simon’s castle of Kenilworth, and, as in the days
                    of Here ward, in the marshes of Ely. Peace was at last made (1267); and the
                    terms on which it was made, and the generally conciliatory character of Edward’s
                    policy towards the vanquished, already showed how much he had learned from the
                    uncle who had fallen before him, but whose work he was destined to bring to
                    perfection. The peace of the last few years of Henry’s reign seems wonderful
                    after the storm3 which had filled up the greater part of it. Edward could leave
                    the land in safety to go on the crusade; and, when his father died (1272) in his
                    absence, his succession to the crown was at once recognized and his peace
                    proclaimed. To say that he was the first king who reigned without election is
                    almost a question of words. At no time in our history would there have been, in
                    such a case as this, any chance of opposition to the eldest son of the last
                    king. What really shows how fast the new ideas of kingship had advanced is the
                    fact that Edward reigned for nearly two years without coronation. Henry died
                    November 16, 1272. The reign of Edward was held to begin with his proclamation
                    four days later; the doctrine that the king never dies is a later device still.
                    Edward was then in Sicily, nor was his return a hasty one. He passed leisurely
                    through several parts of Europe; he suppressed disturbances in his duchy of
                    Aquitaine, and was crowned seventeen days after his arrival in England (August
                    19, 1274). Nothing could show more clearly than this how fast the office
                    conferred by election and coronation was passing into the possession handed on
                    by simple hereditary succession.</p>
                <p>The reign of Edward which thus began is one of the most memorable in the whole
                    course of English history. It is more than an accident that he was the first
                    king since the Conquest who bore one of the ancient kingly names. Under him we
                    feel at once that the work is done, that all traces of conquest, all traces of
                    distinction of races, have passed away. We have again an united English nation,
                    under a king English in name and in heart. For the first time since the Norman
                    came, England has a king whose whole policy is thoroughly English, whose work
                    seems in so many ways a falling back on the work of the old native kings,
                    specially of the king whose name he bore. For the first time since the Conquest,
                    we have a king who is neither surrounded by foreign favourites nor has his
                    policy directed to foreign objects. As duke of Aquitaine, Edward could not avoid
                    wars and controversies with France; but wars and controversies with France were
                    in his days something altogether secondary. His objects were those of the old
                    West-Saxon kings, to be the lawgiver of England, and, as far as might be, to
                    make England coextensive with Britain. Still, like some other kings, Edward has
                    been misunderstood through not attending to the chronology of his reign. His
                    Scottish warfare, which is perhaps the first tiling which is suggested by his
                    name, takes up only the last nine years of a reign of thirty-five. He had been
                    king nineteen years before the controversy as to the Scottish crown arose. So in
                    the earlier part of his reign the Welsh warfare, which in the popular conception
                    stands alongside of the Scottish warfare, has very much the air of an episode in
                    a time mainly given to internal legislation. The reign naturally falls into two
                    divisions. In the first, from 1272 to 1291, internal affairs are most prominent,
                    though it also takes in the conquest of Wales and some important dealings with
                    France. In the latter part, from 1291 to 1307, Scottish affairs are, or seem to
                    be, predominant. And yet it is during this time that the greatest constitutional
                    step of all is taken, and that parliament distinctly assumes its later form.</p>
                <p>The immediate occasions of the Welsh war arose out of &lt; the disputes of the
                    last reign. The Welsh prince Llywelyn, &lt; who still held the north-western
                    part of Wales by the title of Prince of Aberffraw and Lord of Snowdon, had been
                    allied with Simon; his subjects had shared in the earl’s warfare, and he was
                    himself betrothed to the earl’s daughter. Disputes arose out of Llywelyn’s
                    refusal to meet the English king and do his homage. In 1276 he was declared to
                    have forfeited his fiefs, and in the next year he was constrained to surrender
                    the eastern part of his territory and to do homage for the rest. In 1282 a
                    revolt began, in which David, the brother of Llywelyn, who had been hitherto in
                    Edward’s favour and was enriched with English honours, seized the castle of
                    Hawarden and massacred all who were in it. The revolt was put down; the land was
                    speedily conquered; Llywelyn died in war; his brother was put to death as a
                    traitor. The part of Wales which had thus far kept its separate being as a
                    vassal state was now forfeited to the overlord. Throughout a great part of the
                    land English law was introduced. Shires, with their system of administration,
                    were formed; boroughs were founded; castles were built to keep down the
                    malcontents. The principality was designed to form a separate apanage for a
                    younger son of the English king; but, as Edward, the first English prince,
                    succeeded to the crown by the death of his elder brother, the title of Prince of
                    Wales has since commonly been borne by the eldest son of the English king. The
                    Welsh revolted again, even in Edward’s own time; but their revolt was only for a
                    moment. Later revolts were of importance only when the malcontents contrived to
                    connect themselves with English rebels or with foreign enemies of England. The
                    general tendency of things was to closer union between the kingdom and the
                    principality, down to the complete incorporation of Wales with England in the
                    sixteenth century.</p>

                    interval much of the legislation of Edward’s reign went on. He visited Gascony,
                    and confirmed his power there; and in 1290 he freed England from the presence of
                    the Jews. The next year began those negotiations with Scotland which led to war
                    between the two kingdoms of Britain, to the momentary conquest of Scotland, and
                    to its final independence.</p>
                <p>Rightly to understand this great controversy, we must look back to the older
                    relations in which the various possessions of the Scottish crown stood to the
                    crown of England. These were threefold. Between Scotland proper and England the
                    relation was that degree of dependence, whatever it might be deemed to be, which
                    arose out of the old commendation to Edward the Elder. The special burthens
                    imposed by Henry II. had been withdrawn by Richard. Over Scotland proper the
                    utmost claim that could be made w as that of a mere external supremacy, a
                    supremacy older than the feudal law and undoubtedly carrying with it none of the
                    recently devised feudal incidents. Scottish Cumberland, on the other hand, was a
                    territorial fief in the strictest sense, though again a fief older than the
                    later feudal jurisprudence. Lothian or northern Northumberland was in strictness
                    an earldom within the English kingdom, just as Northumberland in the latest
                    sense was when that earldom too came for a while into the hands of the Scottish
                    kings. Here then, in strictness, were three distinct relations for three
                    different parts of the Scottish dominions. But it had never been the interest of
                    either side to define the claims very strictly. As long as the two kingdoms were
                    at peace, as they had been through a large part of the twelfth and thirteenth
                    centuries, the English king had been satisfied to receive the homage of the
                    Scottish kings, without defining very strictly for what territories or on what
                    terms it was rendered. In any case, English interference in the internal affairs
                    of any part of those dominions was unknown. The distinction between the
                    different tenures of Scotland, Strathclyde or Cumberland, and Lothian, passed
                    out of sight. It was remembered on the English side that some kind of homage was
                    due from all. It was remembered on the Scottish side that the kingdom of
                    Scotland at least was no territorial fief of the crown of England. But while the
                    relations of the two kingdoms were in this uncertain state, the whole feudal
                    jurisprudence had grown up, and neither side could any longer look on the matter
                    in its strict historical bearing. The different tenures of different parts of
                    the Scottish dominions were forgotten on both sides, and the question finally
                    took the shape, Are the Scottish dominions, as a whole, a fief of the English
                    crown or not? It was hardly possible that the question should take any other
                    form; yet such a form altogether confused ancient rights and distinctions. In
                    claiming the ordinary superiority of a feudal lord over the' whole Scottish
                    dominions, Edward claimed more than his historic right over the kingdom of
                    Scotland. He claimed less than his historic right over the earldom of Lothian.
                    But the confusion was natural and unavoidable. It was only according to the
                    ordinary workings of human nature, that the full feudal claims should be
                    asserted on the one side, and that, on the other side, the only question should
                    seem to be between accepting of denying them in their fulness. But it is
                    eminently characteristic of Edward’s mind that, while his evident policy was to
                    seize every opportunity for bringing the whole of Britain into a more perfect
                    union, he should take care to be guided throughout by the rules of at least a
                    formal justice.</p>
                <p>His first attempt to unite the kingdoms was by the obvious means of a marriage
                    between his son Edward and the Scottish queen Margaret. This scheme was put an
                    end to by the young queen’s death. Then came the disputed succession, a dispute
                    which Edward was in 1291 called on to decide. Such an opportunity was not to be
                    lost; Edward demanded to be first of all formally recognized as superior lord of
                    the crown which he was called on to dispose of. He was so recognized; the claims
                    of the competitors were fairly heard before a mixed commission; and the judgment
                    given was strictly according to the laws of hereditary succession, as they were
                    now beginning to be understood. The question between John Balliol and Robert
                    Bruce was a question between primogeniture and nearness of kin. That question
                    was in truth settled by the decision in favour of Balliol. The crown of Scotland
                    was assigned to the candidate to whom it would have passed by the later law
                    either of England or of Scotland. The decision in truth created that later law.
                    The new king John at once entered into a relation of homage which involved a
                    more complete dependence on England than any Scottish king had ever before
                    acknowledged. But, though it was to Edward’s manifest interest to have three
                    weaker vassals rather than a single powerful one, he at once rejected the demand
                    of Bruce and Hastings that the kingdom should be divided. It must be remembered
                    that all three competitors, Bruce no less than Balliol and Hastings, though they
                    held Scottish estates and came by female descent of the Scottish royal family,
                    were essentially English barons, who felt no kind of degradation in a renewed
                    homage to their own king. But it is plain that they did not carry with them the
                    general feeling of what we must now begin to call the Scottish people. The older
                    names of things are now strangely reversed. The English of northern
                    Northumberland, so long under Scottish rule, had adopted the Scottish name, and
                    had learned to feel a national patriotism, distinct from, and even hostile to,
                    southern England. They were the Scots from whom the English kings had to endure
                    so stubborn a national resistance. The true Celtic Scots, the men of the
                    highlands and islands, had in truth but little to do with the matter. Whenever
                    they had any share in fhe disputes of the time, dislike to the king of Scots,
                    the nearer enemy, commonly drove them to the English side.</p>
                <p>In 1292 John of Balliol received the Scottish crown as a vassal of England. A
                    claim which we may be sure was without precedent, but which was strictly
                    according to the rules of the feudal jurisprudence which had grown up, was
                    before long brought to bear upon him. From the courts of the vassal there was,
                    according to that jurisprudence, an appeal to the courts of the lord. Scottish
                    subjects, dissatisfied with the justice which they got in the courts of King
                    John, appealed to the courts of King Edward. Just as in the case of the
                    arbitration, an opportunity was thrown in Edward’s way, of which it was not in
                    human nature to refuse to take advantage. John, having acknowledged himself a
                    vassal, refused to do what was now held to be a vassal’s duty. He was presently
                    found to be negotiating against his lord with that lord’s foreign enemies. That
                    war followed was not wonderful; that, when John renounced his allegiance, he was
                    held to have forfeited his fief was according to received feudal notions. The
                    fief was forfeited; the kingdom was conquered; the separate kingdom of Scotland
                    was abolished; it was incorporated with England, and was meant to have some
                    share of representation in that parliament of England to which Edward had just
                    given its perfect form. In 1304 the whole island of Britain, so far as its most
                    northern parts could be said to be under the obedience of any one, was under the
                    obedience of the English king.</p>
                <p>In all this Edward simply acted as any man would act in his view of the case. He
                    carried out the law as he understood it. There is thus far nothing to wonder at,
                    nothing <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n330/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0330-0313"/> to blame. On the other hand, that the mas3 of the
                    Scottish people—defined as above—should resist his claims was as little to be
                    wondered at, as little to be blamed. Each side acted according to the ordinary
                    workings of human nature in their several positions. The real greatness of
                    William Wallace is shown in the fact that he was essentially a popular leader,
                    one who kept up the heart of a nation w hose natural chiefs had forsaken it. On
                    the other hand, even setting aside the charges of special cruelties, William
                    Wallace could not fail to seem, in the eyes of Edward and of every Englishman, a
                    rebel who had despised the offers of mercy which w ere accepted by every one
                    else. That an English court condemned him as a traitor was in no way wonderful,
                    in no way blameworthy; that Scottish patriotism revered him as a martyr .was as
                    little wonderfid, as little blameworthy.</p>
                <p>This first war of Edward with Scotland thus began with the taking of Berwick in
                    1296, and ended with the taking of Stirling in 1304. Meanwhile Edward was
                    engaged in disputes and warfare with France, which began at nearly the same time
                    as the Scottish war. The points in controversy between France and England supply
                    a striking and instructive parallel to the points in controversy between England
                    and Scotland.</p>
                <p>As the king of Scots was the man of the king of England, so was the duke of
                    Aquitaine the man of the king of the French. In both cases the vassalage was
                    older than the new feudal jurisprudence. But the doctrines of that jurisprudence
                    now began to be pressed against Edward himself. A quarrel arose between Gascons,
                    subjects of Edward, and Normans, now subjects of Philip of France. The quarrel
                    grew into a war which was waged by the subjects of the two kings without any
                    commission from their respective sovereigns. Edward, summoned to appear in the
                    court of his lord to answer for the doings of his subjects, did not deny his
                    obligation, though he appeared only by deputy. Presently his duchy was declared
                    forfeited, by a process which in England at least was deemed unjust; and it was
                    in the end recovered only by a negotiation and arbitration and a double
                    marriage. In this war, as in earlier French wars, England had the alliance of
                    Germany and of Flanders. And, as the same years saw the beginnings of the long
                    alliance between Scotland and France, we may say that we have come to the
                    beginning of European arrangements which lasted till very modern times.</p>
                <p>The second Scottish war, the war of Bruce, was quite distinct from the first, the
                    war of Wallace. The interval which divides them is short; but the change of
                    circumstances was enough altogether to change the conduct of Edward. As long as
                    the w ar took the form of resistance to the establishment of his authority, his
                    general clemency was remarkable. Severity began only when the war took the form
                    of revolt against established authority. The conquest of Scotland had been
                    completed in 1304. Robert Bruce, the grandson of the original competitor, having
                    lost all hope of Edward’s favour by the murder of his rival John Cornyn,
                    revolted and assumed the Scottish crown in 1306. In the next year, 1307, the
                    cause of Bruce seemed again altogether hopeless, when things were changed by the
                    death of Edward on his march to Scotland. With the single exception of the
                    execution of Wallace, the whole of Edward’s acts of severity in Scotland come
                    within a single twelvemonth, from July 1306 to July 1307. After the death of the
                    great king and the accession of Edward II., the war naturally lingered; it was
                    interrupted by truces; and a series of successes on the part of Robert Bruce
                    were crowned in 1314 by the overwhelming defeat of the English at Bannockburn.
                    Then comes, from 1315 to 1318, the attempt to establish Edward Bruce as king of
                    Ireland. For ten years follows a time of truces and of occasional invasions on
                    both sides, till, after Edward had been deposed in 1327, a peace between
                    Scotland and England was concluded in the next year, by which the independence
                    of Scotland was fully acknowledged. The old claims, of whatever kind or over
                    whatever territory, must be looked on as being from this time definitely given
                    up. Scotland, in the sense which the word then bore, a sense which, with the
                    exception of the fluctuating possession of Berwick, is the same which it bears
                    still,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>That is, as
                    regards the English frontier. The relations between Scotland and the
                    Scandinavian islands do not concern English history.</p></note> must be looked
                    on from henceforth as a kingdom absolutely independent of England. To carry on
                    the analogy already drawn between the relations of Scotland to England and those
                    of Aquitaine to France, the treaty of Northampton in 1328 answers to the treaty
                    of Bretigny thirty-two years later.</p>
                <p>The change in the fortune and character of the war with Scotland which followed
                    when Edward II. succeeded Edward I. was only part of the general change which
                    naturally followed on such a change of sovereign. The ruler, lawgiver, and
                    conqueror had passed aw ay, to make room for a son who inherited none of these
                    characters. Legislation and conquest come to an end; constitutional progress
                    becomes indirect. Edward II. was ruled by favourites; that his earliest
                    favourite, Piers Gaveston, was a foreigner from Gascony doubtless tended to
                    increase the usual dislike to favourites; but the fact was no longer of the same
                    political importance as the predominance of foreign favourites had been in
                    earlier times. There was no longer any fear of England again becoming the prey
                    of the stranger. Still the reign of Edward II. is, in some respects, a
                    repetition of the reign of Henry III. The national dislike to the favourite led
                    to an opposition to the king, which in 1310-1311 brought about the practical
                    transfer of the royal power—in imitation, it would seem, of the Provisions of
                    Oxford—to a body of prelates and barons, called the Ordainers. The almost
                    immediate recall of Gaveston, in defiance of the new ordinances, led to a new
                    Barons’ War, in which the king’s cousin, Earl Thomas of Lancaster, appears
                    rather as a parody than as a follower of the great Simon. We now reach the
                    beginning of a series of political executions which have no parallel in earlier
                    days, but which from this time disfigure our history for many centuries. The
                    first blood shed was that of Gaveston himself, in 1312. It was avenged ten years
                    after by the execution of Thomas of Lancaster. Meanwhile the strife between the
                    king and his barons had gone on. A second time, in 1318, the royal power was
                    transferred to a council. Then came the choice of new favourites, the
                    Despensers, father and son. They were at least Englishmen, bearing a name which
                    had been glorious in former civil strife. But they were no less hated than the
                    stranger Gaveston. In a moment of recovered power on the king’s part follows the
                    execution of Earl Thomas, a martyr in the belief of his party no less than Simon
                    himself. Presently Edward has to meet with foes, not only in his own house but
                    in his own household. Dark and mysterious causes drew on him the deadly hatred
                    of his own wife, and gave him a rival in his own son. In the revolution of 1326,
                    the queen is the leader; the favourites die in their turn the death of traitors.
                    The year 1327 opens with the practical assertion of the highest right which the
                    national council in its new form had inherited from the earliest times. By a
                    solemn vote of the parliament of England, the king was deposed, and his own son
                    Edward was placed on the throne. In earlier times the deposition of a king in no
                    way implied his murder, any more than the fall from power of a great earl or
                    prelate implied either his murder or his legal execution. But the days of blood
                    had now set in; before the end of the year the deposed king died by <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n331/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0331-0314"/> i foul assassination. The new king was still a
                    minor, and the first years of his reign were the reign of his mother Isabel and
                    her favourite Roger Mortimer. Another revolution was needed to break their
                    power. In 1330, with the execution of Mortimer and the imprisonment of Isabel,
                    the real reign of Edward I ΓT. begins. And within a short space the struggle
                    with Scotland has again begun, to be merged in a few years in the long abiding
                    struggle between England and France.</p>
                <p>In a constitutional point of view, as well as in many others, the period which we
                    have just gone through may be deemed the most important of all periods in
                    English history. It is the time during which our nation, our laws, our language,
                    finally assimilated whatever was to be assimilated of the foreigu elements
                    brought in by the Norman Conquest, and finally threw off whatever was to be
                    thrown off. At the beginning of the period we saw the English nation debating
                    between an Angevin and a French king. At the end of it England, as England, is a
                    great European power, waging war on the continent for the conquest of France. So
                    it is with everything else. It is during this time that most of the things which
                    go to make up the national life put on their later form. Above all things, this
                    was the case with the great council of the English nation. It is for
                    constitutional historians to trace the minuter details; the main outline may be
                    traced in the assemblies of the reigns of Henry III. and Edward I. The name of
                    the assembly had hitherto been fluctuating. During this period the name of
                    ZWioffrøtf became finally established. The name is a translation of an
                    Old-English phrase. The Conqueror is said in the English Chronicle to have had
                    “very deep speech with his Witan.” This deep speech, in Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >colloquium,</hi> in French <hi rend="italic">parlement,</hi> was the
                    distinguishing feature of a meeting between king and people; in the end it gave
                    its name to the assembly itself. The constitution of the assembly, as defined in
                    the Great Charter, did not absolutely imply representation; but it showed that
                    the full establishment of representation could not be long delayed. The work of
                    this period was to call up, alongside of the gathering of prelates, earls, and
                    other great men specially summoned, into which the ’ ancient Witenagemδt had
                    shrunk up, another assembly directly representing all other classes of the
                    nation which enjoyed political rights. This assembly, chosen by various local
                    bodies, <hi rend="italic">communitates</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >universitates,</hi> having a <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> corporate being, came
                    gradually to bear the name of the <hi rend="italic">commons.</hi> The knights of
                    the shire, the barons, citizens, and burgesses of the towns, were severally
                    chosen by the <hi rend="italic">communa</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >communitas</hi> of that part of the people which they represented. We thus get
                    the two houses of Lords and Commons, of which we have seen foreshadowings
                    getting more and more clear from the days of the Conqueror onwards. But it was
                    only gradually fixed that the members of the national council should sit in two
                    bodies, and not in one or in more than two. The notion of local representation,
                    by which shires and boroughs ch03e representatives of their own communities, had
                    to some extent to strive with another doctrine, that of the representation of
                    <hi rend="italic">estates</hi> or classes of men. The thirteenth century was the
                    age when the national assemblies, not only of England but of most other European
                    countries, were putting on their definite shape. And, in most of them, the
                    system of <hi rend="italic">estates</hi> prevailed. These in most countries were
                    three— clergy, nobles, and commons. By these last were commonly meant only the
                    communities of the chartered towns, while the <hi rend="italic">noblesse</hi> of
                    foreign countries answered to the lesser barons and knights who in England were
                    reckoned among the commons. The English system thus went far to take in the
                    whole free population, while the estates of other countries, the commons no less
                    than the clergy and nobles, must be looked on as privileged bodies. In England
                    we had in truth no estates; we had no nobility in the foreign sense. Such a
                    nobility was inconsistent with the institution of peerage, which gradually grew
                    out of the practice of personal summons. The English peerage is strictly
                    official. Two official classes, bishops and earls, have always kept their right
                    of personal summons. With regard to others, both lay barons and churchmen under
                    the rank of the bishops and chief abbots, it is plain that in the early
                    parliaments the king summoned very much whom he would. It was only gradually
                    that the right of summons was held, first to be vested for life in every man who
                    had once been summoned, and afterwards to be hereditary in his descendants.·
                    Thus was formed the House of Lords, consisting of certain lay members succeeding
                    by hereditary right, and of certain heads of ecclesiastical foundations. The
                    office of the peer, the office of legislator and judge, passes by hereditary
                    succession in the one case, by ecclesiastical succession in the other. The
                    holder of the hereditary office was gradually clothed with various personal
                    privileges, but his children remained unprivileged members of the general body
                    of the commons. So far as nobility exists at all in England, it is confined to
                    the person of the peer for the time being. But in truth there is in England no
                    nobility, no estate of nobles, in the continental sense of those words.</p>
                <p>Yet the continental theory of estates so far worked in the development of our
                    parliamentary system that the “Three Estates of England” became a familiar
                    phrase. It was meant to denote the lords, the commons, and the clergy in their
                    parliamentary character. For it is plain that it was the intention of Edward I.
                    to organize the clergy as a parliamentary estate, alongside of the lords and
                    commons. This scheme failed, mainly through the unwillingness of the clergy
                    themselves to attend in a secular assembly. This left, so far as there were any
                    estates at all, two estates only, lords and commons. This led to the common
                    mistake—a mistake of respectable antiquity—cf fancying the three estates to be
                    king, lords, and commons. The ecclesiastical members of the House of Lords kept
                    their seats there; but the parliamentary representation of the clergy as an
                    estate came to nothing. So far as the clergy kept any parliamentary powers, they
                    exercised them in the two provincial convocations. These anomalous assemblies,
                    fluctuating between the character of an ecclesiastical synod and of a
                    parliamentary estate, kept, from Edward I. to Charles IL, the parliamentary
                    power of self-taxation. For a long time lords and commons taxed themselves
                    separately. So did the clergy; so sometimes did other bodies. It was only very
                    gradually that the final constitution of parliament was settled. That the barons
                    should sit with the bishops and earls, that the citizens and burgesses should
                    sit with the knights, were points which gradually settled themselves. And more
                    than once things looked as if, besides separate assemblies of the clergy, we
                    might have had also separate assemblies of merchants and of lawyers. The great
                    fact is that, while at the beginning of the thirteenth century the name and the
                    constitution of the national assembly were still unsettled, at the beginning of
                    the fourteenth century we had a regular parliament of Lords and Commons. The
                    chief point which still remained unsettled was the position of the estate of the
                    clergy.</p>
                <p>This seems to be the general result of the constitutional growth of the
                    thirteenth century, as traced out by our great constitutional historian. Leaving
                    the minuter details, we may here mark some of the chief steps in the progress.
                    During the reign of Henry III. assemblies were constantly held, and their
                    constitution is often vaguely described. But in a great many cases phrases are
                    used which, however <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n332/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0332-0315"/> vague, imply a popular element. We read of
                    knights, of tenants-in-chief, of freemen, sometimes even of freemen and
                    villains, sometimes, more vaguely still, of “universi,” “universitas Angliae,”
                    and the like. In some cases we are able better to interpret these vague phrases.
                    For instance, in 1224 each shire sends four knights chosen by the “milites et
                    probi homines.” Whether these knights were or were not to vote along with the
                    magnates, they were at all events to transact business with them. We must always
                    remember that in these times formal voting in the modern sense is hardly to be
                    looked for. In 1254 we have a distinct case of two knights summoned from each
                    shire by royal writ. In the Oxford parliament of 1258 four knights are ordered
                    to be chosen in each shire, who are to report to another parliament within the
                    same year. At that parliament they seem to appear by the title of “Communitas
                    Bachelariae Angliae.” It may be doubted whether this is strictly a case of the
                    knights acting as part of the parliament. Still every instance of the kind must
                    have helped to strengthen the growing doctrine of representation. From this time
                    the attendance of elected knights seems to be fully established, and along with
                    the knights we find in many cases distinct representatives of the clergy. It is
                    in Earl Simon’s parliament of 1265 that we first find distinct representatives
                    of the boroughs. Each county sends two knights, each city or borough two
                    citizens or burgesses, and the cinque ports four each. But this same parliament
                    shows how fluctuating the practice of summons still was. The earl, strong among
                    the clergy, strong among the people at large, was much less strong among the
                    great men of the realm. Besides summoning the citizens for the first time, he
                    summoned a crowd of churchmen, regular and secular, greater than appeared in any
                    other parliament. But he summoned only five earls, including himself, those
                    namely whom he could trust. We should call such a body a packed parliament; but
                    for a long time every parliament was a packed parliament. That is to say, some
                    barons, some abbots, were always personally summoned, some towns were always
                    called on to send representatives; but the barons, the abbots, and the
                    represented towns were by no means the same in every parliament. This kind of
                    irregularity is always found till institutions have finally stiffened into some
                    particular shape. Our whole law and constitution rests far more on precedent
                    than on formal enactments, and in unsettled times precedents are slow in
                    establishing themselves.</p>
                <p>The parliament of 1265 was the model parliament, the assembly whose pattem, in
                    its essential features, set the standard which was in the end followed, and
                    which has lasted till our own time.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the great political poem which forms the manifesto of the
                    patriotic party are two lines which have been often quoted :—</p><p>“Igitur
                    communitas regni consulatur, Et quid universitas sentiat, sciatur.”</p><p>But
                    what follows shows that the duties of a popular assembly were held to be, not to
                    enact new laws, but to declare the old ones, and to procure their better
                    observance :—</p><p>“Cui leges propriae maxime sunt notre, Nec cuncti proviπcire
                    sic sunt idiotae, Quin sciant plus creteris regni sui mores, Quos relinquunt
                    posteris hii qui sunt priores. Qui reguntur legibus magis ipsas sciunt; Quorum
                    sunt in usibus plus perita fiunt, Et quia res agitur sua, plus curabunt, Et quo
                    pax adquiritur sibi procurabunt.’</p></note> But the pattern which it set did
                    not become the invariable rule till the great parliament of 1295. In the earlier
                    parliaments of Edward I. the knights and citizens are often mentioned; but, on
                    the other hand, we meet also with the same vague descriptions as in earlier
                    times. But in 1295 Edward definitely adopted the model which Simon has set him,
                    and the summoning of knights, citizens, and burgesses, though with great
                    irregularity as to the places from which representativcs were summoned, has ever
                    since been the rule. It was thus under Edward I. that parliament finally put on
                    the essentials of its present form. But we must still allow for irregularities
                    in practice. It does not follow that every enactment was always passed with the
                    consent of all the classes of which the parliament was made up. A doctrine had
                    come in that the king was the legislator, that the votes of the parliament, or
                    of any part of it, were petitions which he could accept or reject, or again that
                    he might legislate on a petition from one house or branch of the assembly apart
                    from the others. The national council had now won back its ancient constitution
                    as an assembly of the freemen of the realm, either personally or by
                    representation. But it was only step by step that it won back the full powers of
                    the ancient Witenagemôt. There are some indeed which it still shrinks from
                    exercising directly, some which it shrinks from exercising at all.</p>
                <p>The reign of Henry III. was a reign of constant parliamentary action, but it was
                    not a time rich in legislation in the strictest sense. The most direct case of
                    change in the law during Henry’s reign was the abolition of the ordeal at its
                    beginning. This led incidentally to further changes in judicial procedure, and
                    it is one of the chief landmarks in the development of the jury system. But it
                    is in itself not so much independent legislation as the application to England
                    of a decree of a General Council of the church. In short the parliaments of
                    Henry III. are less famous for changing the law than for refusing to change it.
                    The famous saying “Nolumus leges Angliae mutari” dates from the council of
                    Merton in 1236, when the barons refused to agree to the proposal of the prelates
                    for assimilating the law of England to the civil and canon law in the matter of
                    children born before wedlock. By the former systems of jurisprudence, the
                    subsequent marriage of their parents admitted them to the rights of legitimate
                    birth. But the barons chose to maintain the harsher rule of the common law of
                    England.</p>
                <p>But, if the reign of Henry III. was not a time rich in legislation, it forms an
                    important stage in the growth of our parliamentary life. The chief work of that
                    reign was that the first steps were taken towards the practical establishment of
                    the doctrine set forth in the omitted clauses of the Great Charter, the
                    doctrine, in modern phrase, that the power of the purse belongs to parliament.
                    In Henry’s day England and her parliament had to wage a never-ending strife
                    against her two enemies, king and pope. The main duty of the nation was to
                    withstand the extortions of both alike. The king was always asking for money;
                    the conditions of a grant commonly were that the charters should be again
                    confirmed and be better observed. And gradually another demand arises, that the
                    great officers of state shall be appointed, if not by parliament, at least with
                    the assent of parliament. But demands like these, demands for the removal of
                    aliens and the like, are all demands for the reform of abuses and the execution
                    of the old laws; new laws are never asked for. The Oxford Provisions of 1258
                    show the ideas of reform which were then entertained; it is not legislation, it
                    is reform of bad administration, even at the cost of transferring the king’s
                    authority to other hands, which is asked for. Simon himself, the greatest of
                    constitutional reformers, was not a legislator. His Parliament is famous, not
                    for anything that it did, but for what it was. Nor after Simon’s fall do we meet
                    with much legislation strictly so called. The ordinances of Kenilworth and
                    Marlborough are ordinances for the settlement of the kingdom, ordinances for the
                    better observance of the Charter and of the statutes of 1259. They are not
                    legislation in the strictest sense, the enactment of absolutely new laws.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n333/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0333-0316"/>
                <p>On the other hand, the reign of Edward I., like the reign of Henry IL, is
                    emphatically a time of legislation strictly so called, as well as of
                    constitutional progress. At no time were so many memorable statutes passed.
                    Edward’s first great act, the first Statute of Westminster, in 1275, has been
                    described as “almost a code by itself.” But it was followed almost yearly by
                    enactment upon enactment. The statute <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >religiosis</hi> in 1279 forbade the alienation of lands in mortmain without the
                    consent of the superior lord. Ten years later, after a mass of legislation in
                    intermediate years, came the statute <hi rend="italic">quia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">emptores,</hi> which forbade subinfeudation. The holder of land
                    could no longer grant it to be held of himself; he could alienate it only so as
                    to be held of the higher lord by the tenure by which he held it himself. Other
                    statutes regulated the local administration, the range of the ecclesiastical
                    courts, almost every detail of English law. At last, in 1297, the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Confirmatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Cartarum</hi> was wrung from the
                    king; the power of arbitrary taxation was surrendered; no tax is any longer to
                    be levied by the king without parliamentary sanction. That is to say, those
                    clauses of the Great Charter which were left out in the confirmations under
                    Henry III. were now restored and put in force. As in all other things in these
                    ages, we must allow for what seems to us amazing irregularity of practice. It
                    does not follow that, because a certain course was ordained by law, therefore
                    the law was always carried out. But the principle was established, and it could
                    always be appealed to in case of any breach of the law. By the end of Edward’s
                    reign, a national assembly, composed of much the same elements of which it is
                    composed still, was acknowledged to possess what is practically the greatest of
                    parliamentary powers.</p>
                <p>The extreme legislative activity of this reign is one of many, signs that the
                    immediate effects of the Norman Conquest had now quite passed away. A thoroughly
                    united nation, which had forgotten the foreign origin of certain classes of the
                    nation, could bear to have new laws enacted, to have old institutions put into
                    new forms. But the particular form which the great constitutional triumph of
                    this reign took looks both forward and backward. It looks forward, as showing
                    that we have reached what is really modern history. The parliamentary power of
                    the purse is the ruling principle of all later constitutional struggles. But it
                    also looks backward. An ancient Witenagemôt possessed the power of the purse,
                    like all other powers. But in those days the power of the purse was a power of
                    secondary importance. In early times taxation never holds the same prominent
                    place in politics wlιich it does afterwards. But the rule of a series of kings
                    in whose eyes kingship was rather a possession than an office, in whose eyes the
                    kingdom was an estate out of which they had to squeeze the greatest possible
                    income, had made it the most needful thing of all to check the king’s power of
                    taking his subjects’ money. From this time each parliamentary struggle takes the
                    form of a bargain. The king will redress such and such a grievance, if he
                    receives such and such a grant. By constantly pressing this new power,
                    parliament, and above all that house of parliament in which the power of the
                    purse came to be specially lodged, has gradually won back the powers of the
                    older assemblies. It no longer in form makes war and peace, or elects and
                    deposes kings. It does not even in form elect or depose their ministers. But the
                    body which can grant or refuse the means of carrying on the machinery of
                    government has gradually come to have, in an indirect way, the powers of
                    government once more in its own hands.</p>
                <p>Another sign that the remembrance of old wrongs and old distinctions of race had
                    passed away is supplied by a feature of these times which at first sight might
                    seem to prove the contrary. The reigns of the first two Edwards are exactly the
                    time when the French language was most universally in use as the language of
                    public acts. From this time the laws of England begin to be written in French.
                    The truth is that the predominance of French at this period is no direct
                    tradition of the days of the Norman Conquest. It is simply a sign of the fashion
                    which made French to be looked on as the most polite, as it certainly was the
                    most widely spoken, of Western languages. It was merely a fashion; Edward and
                    his nobles knew and spoke English thoroughly well.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>When Walter of Hemingburgh (i. 337) records
                    that Edward I. spoke to the Turkish ambassadors in English, it must not be
                    taken, as it has sometimes been misunderstood, as if it meant that Edward’s
                    speaking of English was something exceptional. It would have had this meaning,
                    if Edward had been speaking to an Englishman of low degree who was not likely to
                    understand French. But when Edward speaks English to Turks, and has his words
                    interpreted to them by some one who could translate from English into Turkish or
                    Arabic, it shows how familiarly English was spoken by Edward himself and by
                    those about him. So again, in the famous dialogue between Edward and Roger earl
                    of Norfolk, the play on the earls name <hi rend="italic">Bigοd,</hi> which is
                    found both there and elsewhere, has no force in any language but
                    English.</p></note> But the fact that such a fashion could take root showed that
                    the use of the French language had ceased to call up any memories of the
                    conquest of England by men whose tongue was French. If the use of French called
                    forth any hostile feelings on the part of Englishmen, it was now, not as the
                    speech of a forgotten conquest in their own land, but as the speech of a rival
                    nation beyond the sea. And when French had come to be used simply as a matter of
                    fashion, its supremacy was doomed; in the course of the fourteenth century,
                    English, modified as it was by the indirect effects of the Conquest, gradually
                    won back its old place as the dominant speech of England.</p>
                <p>This age, so great in our political history, is of equal importance in the
                    intellectual and religious development of England. It was an age when difference
                    as to theological dogmas was still unknown in England, but when a strong
                    national opposition was growing to the exactions and oppressions of the see of
                    Rome. In the thirteenth century there is no sign of any revolt against the
                    national Church; the nation and the national Church are one in opposition to the
                    foreign enemy. The most remarkable feature of the reigu of Henry III. is the
                    union of all classes, barons, clergy, and commons, in the common struggle
                    against pope and king. The series of patriot prelates which begins with Stephen
                    Langton is carried on in Archbishop Edmund the saint—in Robert Grosseteste,
                    saint, scholar, and philosopher—in Walter of Cantelupe, a statesman of a Norman
                    baronial house. The first signs of any jealousy felt towards the national clergy
                    do not begin till the great national strife is over, and till some at least of
                    the English prelates had given in to the new-fangled teaching at Rome. When, at
                    the papal bidding, the English clergy refused for a moment to contribute to the
                    needs of the English state, the great Edward found the means to put them beyond
                    the pale of English law.</p>
                <p>The intellectual activity of the thirteenth century, the great creative and
                    destructive century throughout all Europe and civilized Asia, was not small in
                    England. It was the age of the friars. As in the twelfth century the Cistercians
                    had appeared as a reform on the Benedictines, so now the Franciscans, the
                    Dominicans, and· the other mendicant orders, began a far more thorough reform of
                    the monastic system. The Cistercians in their wildernesses might practise an
                    ascetic discipline for the good of their own souls; but they did little for
                    other men. The rest of the nation knew them chiefly as diligent growers of wool.
                    But the friars, carrying the vow of poverty to the extremest point, rejecting
                    corporate as well as personal property, fixed themselves by choice in the most
                    squalid quarters of the towns. · They were confessors and preachers; presently
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n334/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0334-0317"/> they became scholars also, and they had a large
                    share in the increased intellectual activity of the universities. Oxford and
                    Cambridge were now established seats of learning, thronged by crowds of masters
                    and scholars. Up to this time masters and scholars had lived where they could
                    and how they could. In the course of the thirteenth century colleges began to be
                    founded. That is, by the bounty of some founder, societies of masters and
                    scholars were brought together as corporate bodies, holding a house for their
                    dwelling-place, and lands or other revenues for their maintenance. The first
                    beginnings of this system were seen in Merton College in Oxford and Peterhouse
                    in Cambridge. The growth of these colleges, which in the end came in a manner to
                    swallow up the universities, is the most distinguishing feature of the English
                    universities, as distinguished from those of other lands. But, though the
                    foundation of the colleges and the influence of the friars in the universities
                    were both fruits of the same movement, it must be remembered that they were
                    wholly distinct fruits. The colleges of Oxford and Cambridge were not monastic
                    foundations, except in a few cases where a great monastery established a college
                    in one of the universities for the education of its own younger members.
                    Otherwise the colleges were strictly secular, and religious vows carried with
                    them a forfeiture of membership. The colleges lived on; the intellectual as well
                    as the religious life of the friars was short. They presently fell away from
                    their first love, and became yet more corrupt than the older orders which held a
                    higher temporal position. But, while the first life of the friars lasted, it was
                    brilliant indeed. They were encouraged by Robert Grosseteste; the friar Adam
                    Marsh was the chosen adviser of Earl Simon. The friar Roger Bacon was the wonder
                    of his own day, a master of knowledge beyond his day, and one who paid the
                    penalty of thus outstripping his fellows.</p>
                <p>The thirteenth century saw the growth of a new kind of monastic order in the form
                    of the friars. The early part of the fourteenth century saw the fall of one of
                    the great military orders which had arisen in the enthusiasm of the crusades.
                    The Templars, the victims of Philip the Fair and his puppet Pope Clement V.,
                    were suppressed in England as elsewhere; but it is something that, even in so
                    bad a time as the reign of Edward IL, England had no share in the torturings and
                    murderings which marked the suppression of the order in France. The property of
                    the Templars was for the most part granted to the rival military order of St
                    John, which kept it till the general dissolution of monasteries.</p>
                <p>The literature of the thirteenth century was abundant in all the three languages
                    which were then in use in England. The statesmen and historians of Henry II.’s
                    day now give way to the monastic annalists. Pre-eminent over other houses is the
                    school of annalists of St Albans, and preeminent among them is the patriotic
                    historian Matthew Paris. He writes of earlier times with little criticism; he
                    cannot be classed on this score either with William of Malmesbury or with
                    William of Newburgh. But he stands at the head of all our annalists aβ a
                    vigorous, outspoken, narrator of contemporary history, not only in England but
                    in the world in general. He is a bold champion of the popular side, a
                    representative of the English Church and nation against pope and king alike. But
                    it should be noted that all the monastic annalists take the popular side, with
                    the single exception of Thomas Wykes of Oseney, the one royalist chronicler cf
                    his day. The civil wars called forth a mass of literature in all three
                    languages. The praises of Earl Simon are sung in French and in Latin; and the
                    English tongue now comes forth with a new mission, as the vehicle, sometimes of
                    satire, sometimes of panegyric upon the great ones of the earth. The
                    Englishman’s right of grumbling is immemorial, and from the thirteenth century
                    onwards his grumbling has very commonly taken the shape of outspoken rhymes in
                    his own tongue. But, in an historical and political point of view, the most
                    important work of the time of the civil war is the great political poem in Latin
                    rhyme which sets forth the platform of Earl Simon and the patriots. A clearer
                    and more vigorous assertion of popular principles has never been put forth in
                    any age. English had hardly yet reached the dignity of being employed in such a
                    document as this; but the native literature was advancing during the whole of
                    the thirteenth century. Besides devotional works in prose and verse, it was used
                    in long continued poems on various subjects early in the century. The Ormulum of
                    Ormin is religious; the Brut of Layamon is legendary. It shows how the tales of
                    Arthur had, even in the minds of Englishmen writing in the English tongue,
                    supplanted the history of their own people. Towards the end of the century our
                    language was put to a better use, in the form of rhyming chronicles, such as
                    those of Robert of Gloucester and the English version of Peter of Langtoft. For
                    a successor to the Peterborough Chronicler, for an English history in English
                    prose, we have still a long time to wait.</p>
                <p>In the department of art, the pointed arch, with the details appropriate to that
                    form, was now thoroughly established. In the time of Edward I. the long narrow
                    window of the earlier part of the century began to be exchanged for the large
                    window with tracery, different forms of which lasted as long as mediaeval
                    architecture lasted at all. But alongside of development in this way, the
                    sculpture of the early part of the century gradually gave way, even early in the
                    fourteenth century, to flatter and less bold forms. In ecclesiastical
                    architecture a new type of church, long, narrow, and simple, quite unlike the
                    picturesque outlines of the older minsters, came in with the friars. Houses
                    began to be larger and more elaborate in plan; but the great change was in
                    military architecture. The massive donjons and shell-keeps of the Norman type
                    grew under the Edwards into castles of vast size and complicated arrangement,
                    planned with great skill according to the military needs of the time. The castle
                    of Caernarvon, begun by the first and continued by the second Edward, shows what
                    is called the Edwardian type of castle in its highest perfection.</p>
                <p>By this time the art of warfare in England had seemingly changed altogether from
                    what it had been before the Normans came. And yet the change was after all more
                    seeming than real. In the Scottish wars the English array of cavalry and
                    archers, matched against the Scottish spearmen, seemed to show that the English
                    had altogether adopted the tactics of their Norman conquerors. And so, as
                    regards the weapons in use, they had. But an English army still kept its ancient
                    character of having a national infantry as its main strength. It was the
                    preservation of England as a military power that this was the case. We are now
                    coming to the days of chivalry, the days of brutal contempt for all classes of
                    mankind outside the favoured pale, the days which, in warfare, went far to put
                    mad personal enterprise instead of rational military calculation. England was
                    not wholly untouched by these follies; but she was far less deeply touched by
                    them than their native land of France. The difference showed itself when the two
                    nations were matched together in a long and deadly struggle. The French were in
                    the end successful in war, because England had undertaken a task beyond her
                    powers or the powers of any other nation, the task of subduing and holding a
                    country greater than herself. But the English were invariably successful, even
                    with much smaller numbers, in all the great battles. The cause lay in the
                    different constitution of their armies; and the difference in the constitution
                    of their armies lay <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n335/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0335-0318"/> deep in the difference of the political condition
                    of the two countries. In France political privilege was the exclusive possession
                    of the <hi rend="italic">noblesse</hi> and the chartered towns. In England
                    freedom was the birthright of all above the villain, and even the villain had
                    many ways of reaching freedom open to him. France therefore had a gallant
                    cavalry in her <hi rend="italic">noblesse;</hi> for infantry she had either
                    foreign mercenaries or au unwarlike rabble. In an English army the infantry,
                    furnished by the mass of the freemen, formed its main strength, and, more than
                    any other arm, won the great battles. In the course of the fourteenth century,
                    the chivalrous type of warfare received a series of deadly blows dealt by a
                    trained infantry of burghers or yeomen. The Flemings at Courtrai, the men of the
                    Three Lands at Morgarten, the men of the more extended League at Sempach, the
                    Scots at Bannockburn, the English at Crecy, are all instances of the same law.
                    Edward III., preeminently the chivalrous king, helped to give chivalry its
                    death-stroke.</p>
                <p>Of his reign the most prominent feature was the war with France in which that
                    death-stroke was dealt. It is a war which may be looked at from two sides. On
                    the part of the king himself, it was less the warfare of an English king than
                    the warfare of a French prince seeking the French crown. On the part of the
                    English nation it was distinctly a national war. The French influence on
                    England, as distinguished from the earlier Norman element in England, the
                    influence -which had been going on ever since the beginning of the thirteenth
                    century, reached its height in Edward the son of the Frenchwoman Isabel. The
                    follies of chivalry, follies so conspicuously French as distinguished from
                    either English or Norman, were now in all their glory. We have reached the days
                    of Froissart, chronicler of knights and ladies. We instinctively feel that
                    Edward III. is less of an Englishman than Edward I. But the nation is purely
                    English. H anything was needed to wipe out the last feeble memory of old
                    distinctions, it was the warfare which Englishmen waged in what was now the
                    French province of Normandy. But, in common justice both to Edward and to his
                    people, it must not be forgotten that, though the French war was in form a war
                    waged to win the crown of France for an English king, it wa3 a war which neither
                    king nor people could well have avoided. Edward was goaded into the war by the
                    ceaseless attempts which the French king made on his duchy of Aquitaine, and by
                    the help which the French king gave to the Scottish enemies of England.</p>
                <p>In 1328 the French throne became vacant by the death of Charles IV., the youngest
                    son and last male descendant of Philip the Fair. Edward claimed the crown in
                    right of his mother, the sister of the deceased king. The claim found no support
                    in France, and the crown passed to Philip of Valois, the first cousin of
                    Charles, and the next in succession to the male line. By this decision, just as
                    by the decision of the dispute for the crown of Scotland, a principle was
                    settled, a principle which ever after made the French law of succession
                    different from that of England, Scotland, and Spain. During the 341 years which
                    had passed since the election of Hugh Capet, every king of the French had been
                    succeeded by his own son, and in several cases the succession had been made yet
                    more certain by the coronation of the son in the lifetime of his father. It thus
                    came about that both the notion of hereditary succession as opposed to election,
                    and the notion of direct male succession as opposed to any other rule of
                    succession, had, by this time, taken firmer root in France than in any other
                    kingdom in Europe. The result of a genealogical accident was therefore supposed
                    to spring from an aucient law of the kingdom. As a new jurisprudence had been
                    called up out of the romances of Charlemagne to insure the forfeiture of John,
                    so a new rule of succession was called up out of the ancient Frankish codes to
                    bar the claim of Edward. We now hear for the first time of the imaginary Salic
                    law, which was held to shut out females from the succession to the French crown.
                    According to modern English law, neither Edward nor Philip was the heir; there
                    were females nearer to the crowm than either of them. But Edward's doctrine was
                    that, though a female could not herself inherit, yet her son could inherit
                    through her. He claimed as the male person nearest of kin to the late king.
                    Philip claimed in the simpler character of the next in the male line, passing by
                    females altogether. The question was new; but, as the French crown had never
                    passed either to or through a female, the claim of Philip naturally seemed more
                    in accordance with earlier precedent. But, had the argument lain the other way,
                    had female succession been asserted by the Frenchman and male succession by the
                    foreign prince, we may believe that the native candidate would have found his
                    way to the French crown all the same. How little these genealogical subtleties
                    really went for was shown a little later, when, in the dispute for the duchy of
                    Britanny, Edward appeared as the champion of male, and Philip of female
                    succession.</p>
                <p>When Edward’s claim to the French crown was rejected, he did homage (1329) to his
                    rival for his Gascon duchy, though with some reservations -which might keep
                    controversy alive. Matters -were hastened by a new Scottish war. The English
                    lords who had held and lost estates in Scotland were, by the treaty of
                    Northampton, to receive them again. This article had not been carried out, and
                    in 1332 the disinherited lords made an attempt on Scotland under Edward Balliol,
                    son of the former king John. Once by their own forces, and a second time by
                    English help, they succeeded in placing their candidate on the Scottish throne.
                    He rewarded his allies by ceding southern Scotland to England, and renewing the
                    old dependent relation for the rest of the kingdom. The state of war between
                    England and Scotland thus began again, and with far less show of reason on the
                    English side than there had been in the days of Edward I. But the Scottish war
                    led to consequences still more important than itself. Philip, ever on the watch
                    for opportunities against Aquitaine, gave help to the Scots (1337), as his
                    predecessor had done in the earlier war. It appears that Edward now for the
                    first time called himself King of France, though the regular use of the title
                    did not begin till three years later. As in former wars with France, Edward
                    formed alliances with the Flemish cities and with the emperor Lewis; and it was
                    to satisfy the scruples of the Flemings, whose land was a French fief, that he
                    finally took the title of King of France.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The usual Latin title of the French kings had always been
                    national and not territorial: “Rex Francorum,” not “Rex Franciae.” But, as the
                    territorial style was now fully established in England, Edward called himself
                    “Rex Franciae et Angliae.” The territorial style was finally adopted by the
                    French kings when the French crown passed to a king of Navarre. The style then
                    became “Rex Franciae et Navarra?,’ till the ancient title was revived in
                    179L</p></note> Then followed the first part of the War of a Hundred Years, a
                    struggle of twenty years, broken once or twice by truces. This stage is famous
                    for the naval victory of Sluys in 1340, for the more famous land fights of Crecy
                    in 1346 and Poitiers in 1356, and for the capture of Calais in 1347. The
                    captivity of King John of France at Poitiers led to negotiations, and this first
                    stage of the war ended with the peace of Bretignyin 1360. By its terms Edward
                    renounced all claim to the French crown and gave up his French title. On the
                    other hand, all his possessions on the continent, both his hereditary dominions
                    and Iris recent conquests, Aquitaine, Ponthieu, and Calais, were released from
                    all homage to the French crown. Calais may be said to have been incorporated
                    with England, and it was afterwards <pb break="no"

                    now become independent of France, as Scotland had become in dependent of
                    England, was granted by Edward to his famous son Edward the Black Prince, who
                    kept his court at Bour deaux, now the capital of a sovereign state.</p>
                <p>The long alliance between France and Scotland against England had now fairly set
                    in, and the Scottish war went on alongside of the French war. In 1346 the king
                    of Scots, David Bruce, invaded England and was taken prisoner, as John of France
                    was ten years later. In the same year as this last event Edward Balliol
                    surrendered his claim to Edward of England, who presently invaded Scotland in
                    the new character of its immediate sovereign. In 1357 David was released, and
                    was described in the treaty as King of Scotland. In later documents however the
                    title was not given either to him or to his successor Robert, the first of the
                    Stewart kings. A desultory and occasional warfare long went on, and the claims
                    of the English kings, either to the old superiority or, by the cession of Edward
                    Balliol, to the Scottish crown itself, are ever and anon put forward. England
                    had now, in the form of Scotland and France, a standing enemy on each side.</p>
                <p>The peace of Bret.igny was not long kept. The English rule in Aquitaine was,
                    speaking generally, acceptable to. the cities; but the French connexion was more
                    to the taste of the nobles. The prince of Aquitaine presently embroiled himself
                    in the affairs of Spain, supporting Pedro the Cruel of Castile against his
                    brother Henry. In 1367 he won the splendid but useless victory of Navarete or
                    Najara; but the cost of the expedition led to injudicious taxation in Aquitaine.
                    Though the principality no longer owed homage to the French crown, those who
                    deemed themselves aggrieved appealed to the French king as superior lord.
                    Charles V., who had succeeded John in 1364, accepted the appeal, and summoned
                    the prince of Aquitaine to his court. A new war began, which, often carried on
                    with much languor, often interrupted by truces, but not ended by any formal
                    peace, lasted till the treaty of Troyes in 1420. The peace was clearly broken by
                    the French, and Edward again took up the title of King of France. But fortune
                    now distinctly turned to the French side. The most striking event of the war was
                    the recovery and massacre of Limoges by the prince of Aquitaine in 1370. The
                    prince now came to England to end his days more worthily as a patriotic
                    statesman. The war went on, till in 1374 all was lost save Calais, the great
                    southern cities of Bourdeaux and Bayonne, and a few other points in the south.
                    The last few years of Edward’s reign were a time of truce.</p>
                <p>The change from the reign of Edward III. to that of Richard II. is in some points
                    like the change from the reign of Edward I. to that of Edward II. The leading
                    events again touch the internal rather than the external history. The internal
                    history of the reign of Edward III. is of the highest importance. But it is of
                    an importance wholly constitutional and social. It is not marked on the surface
                    by any striking internal events. In the reign of Richard we have over again the
                    same kind of internal events which mark the reign of Edward II, but with the
                    addition of a great social struggle to which we have seen no parallel in earlier
                    times. But, if there is much in common in the two reigns, there is a marked
                    difference between the two men. Richard, if foolish and extravagant, was not
                    weak; he had distinct political aims; he seems to have seriously designed the
                    establishment of a despotic power in the crown. His accession marks another
                    stage in the growth of the doctrine of hereditary succession. Richard, the minor
                    son of the Black Prince, succeeded his grandfather without opposition, without
                    any public mention of any claims on the part of his uncles, the surviving sons
                    of the late king. In fact the dissatisfaction which was shown at a vague rumour
                    that the young king’s eldest uncle John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, had designs
                    on the crown, shows how men’s ideas on such matters had changed, not only since
                    the days of Aelfred, but even since the days of John. In the reign which thus
                    began foreign affairs become quite secondary. The war3 both with France and
                    Scotland <hi rend="italic">go on,</hi> but they go on for the most part
                    languidly; occasional raids alternate with truces. But the very beginning of
                    Richard’s reign saw an actual French invasion of England, in which the Isle of
                    Wight was ravaged and Hastings burned. The French war was ended, as far as this
                    reign is concerned, by Richard’s second marriage with Isabel of France in 1396,
                    which was accompanied by a truce for twenty-five years.</p>
                <p>The first marked internal event of Richard’s reign was the result of political,
                    social, and religious causes which had been busily at work during the reign of
                    Edward. The immediate occasion of the famous outbreak of Richard’s time was a
                    poll-tax which was laid on by parliament in 1380. The peasant revolt of the next
                    year followed. The spirit shown by the young king in the famous story of the
                    death of Wat Tyler has often been dwelled on, as if it were something
                    exceptional. But Richard did not lack spirit at any time; and at this time his
                    spirit was chiefly shown in making promises which were not, and could not be,
                    carried out. The revolt was put down, and the rest of the internal history of
                    the reign consists of disputes, not so much between the king and the people or
                    the barons in general as among his uncles, his-favourites, and his ministers.
                    One of Richard’s favourites, Michael de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, deserves
                    notice, less on his own account than as one who, sprung from a merchant family
                    at Kingston-ou-Hull, rose to the height of power. Though he himself fell from
                    power and died in obscurity, yet he was in the end the founder of a ducal house.
                    We thus see that the contempt for trade which had lately come in among the other
                    follies of chivalry was, after all, not very deep set. Richard’s other chief
                    favourite was Robert Vere, of the house of the earls of Oxford, whom he raised
                    to the rank of marquess of Dublin, and at last to that of duke of Ireland. The
                    year 1386 saw the fall of the favourites; and the impeachment of the earl of
                    Suffolk by the Commons marks a constitutional stage. This time the accused
                    escaped with a slight punishment; but, as in the times of Henry III. and Edward
                    II., the royal authority was transferred to a council under the duke of
                    Gloucester. The next year the king attempted a revolution; but a new impeachment
                    followed, on which both the favourites were condemned to death as traitors in a
                    parliament known as the Wonderful and the Merciless; but they escaped beyond
                    sea. In 1389 the king, by a sudden stroke, won back his power. For a while his
                    rule was constitutional and seemingly not unpopular; but he gradually aimed at
                    despotism. In 1397 he procured the overthrow of his uncle the duke of Gloucester
                    and the chief of the nobles of his party, contriving that all that was done
                    openly should be under legal forms. Duke Thomas died in a mysterious way. His
                    chief adherent, the earl of Arundel, was beheaded. In the next year, on occasion
                    of a judicial combat between Thomas Mowbray, duke of Norfolk, and the king’s
                    cousin Henry, duke of Hereford, the son of John of Gaunt, the king arbitrarily
                    banished both disputants, but promised them the possession of their estates. But
                    in breach of this promise, when John of Gaunt died in 1399, Richard seized on
                    the inheritance of his son. He then chose this very inopportune moment to go
                    personally to settle the disturb-' ances of Ireland. During his absence Henry
                    came back; Richard, on his return, found himself generally forsaken, and he was
                    presently deposed by parliament. The election <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0339-0320"/> of Henry in his place was perfectly regular
                    according to ancient precedent. But two things again mark the growth of the new
                    ideas. Not only, as in the case of Edward II., was the deposed king made to
                    resign, but Henry himself, in claiming the crown, did not rely solely on his
                    perfectly good parliamentary title, but mixed up with it a vague claim by
                    hereditary right. He was “descended by right line of blood coming from the good
                    lord King Henry III.” This phrase makes it needful to explain a little more
                    fully the state of the royal succession, which becomes of such importance in the
                    next period.</p>
                <p>Richard himself had, as we have seen, succeeded without opposition, according to
                    the doctrine of representation, though in earlier times the choice of parliament
                    would have rather fallen on one of his uncles. The new ideas were carried yet
                    further when, under Richard, Roger Mortimer, earl of March, was declared
                    presumptive heir to the throne. The doctrines both of representation and of
                    female succession were here implied, as Roger was through his mother grandson of
                    Lionel, duke of Clarence, second son<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Lionel was strictly the third son of Edward III.; but he was
                    the second of those who left descendants. As all the three elder sons of Edward
                    died before their father, John of Gaunt was the eldest surviving son of Edward
                    at his father’s death.</p></note> of Edward III. In earlier times, whatever
                    might have been thought of Richard’s own claim, such a claim as this of Roger
                    would have seemed ridiculous while three sons of Edward, the dukes John of
                    Lancaster, Edmund of York, and Thomas of Gloucester, were all living. And in
                    fact the claim of Roger was not put forward at the deposition of Richard and
                    election of Henry; but it was not forgotten, and later events again gave it
                    importance. Henry’s own‘challenge by descent from Henry III. was shrouded in
                    purposed vagueness. He is commonly thought to have referred to a claim of his
                    own yet more strange than the claim of Earl Roger. He was, through his mother,
                    the direct representative of Edmund, earl of Lancaster, the second son of Henry
                    III., who, according to an absurd rumour, was really his eldest son. Such a
                    claim could hardly be put forward publicly; and Henry’s vague words might be
                    taken as meaning only that he was the next to the crown in male succession. But
                    that any claim of the kind should have been thought of, when Henry had a
                    perfectly good right by parliamentary election, shows how the ancient right of
                    the nation freely to choose its sovereign, at all events from among the members
                    of the royal house, was gradually dying out of men’s minds.</p>
                <p>The short and troubled reign of Henry IV. has commonly led to forgetfulness of
                    his earlier fame as a gallant and popular prince, a pilgrim to Jerusalem, a
                    crusader in Africa and Prussia. The fourteen years of his reign are almost
                    wholly filled with plots, civil wars, and the endless warfare in Scotland and
                    France. Now again Wales becomes of importance, through the union of a Welsh
                    pretender with the discontented party in England. In the early insurrections, as
                    in that of 1400, the name of the late king Richard was used. The fate of the
                    deposed king was never certainly known; but there seems no just ground for
                    doubting that he either died or was murdered soon after this first revolt. That
                    a pretended Richard appeared, that he was made use of by Henry’s French and
                    Scottish enemies, was simply what commonly happens in such cases. The revolt of
                    1400 was hardly suppressed when it was followed by the more dangerous revolt of
                    Owen Glyndwr, who restored for a while the old independence of North Wales, and
                    acted in concert with the French, the Scots, and the English rebels. In fact,
                    down to his death in 1415, he was never fully subdued. His English allies, the
                    Percies and Mortimers, were defeated at Shrewsbury in 1403; and other plots and
                    revolts, in all of which the house of Percy had a hand, were crushed in 1405 and
                    1408. At the time of Henry’s death, in 1413, there was a truce with Scotland;
                    but the war in France, which had gone on during the whole of his reign, was
                    being waged with a greater vigour than usual.</p>
                <p>In 1406 the crown was settled by parliament on Henry and his sons; and on his
                    death his eldest son Henry succeeded without opposition. A new aera in the
                    French war at once began. France, under its weak or rather mad king Charles VI.,
                    was torn in pieces by the factions of Orleans and Burgundy. Henry IV. had, in
                    the latter years of his reign, employed the policy of playing off one party
                    against the other, and had given help to each in turn. The war, which had gone
                    on, though mostly in a desultory way, ever since the return of the Black Prince
                    to England in 1370, now began again in earnest under a king who was one of the
                    greatest of warriors and statesmen. The character of Henry’s enterprise is often
                    misunderstood. It is said that, whatever claim Edward III. might have had to the
                    crown of France, Henry V. could have none. It is said that, according to Edward
                    III.’s doctrine, by which the right to the crown might pass through females to
                    their male representatives, the rights of Edward III. had passed to Roger of
                    March. So, as a matter of genealogy, they certainly had; and, as a matter of
                    genealogy, there was doubtless an inconsistency in the use of the French title
                    by Henry IV. and Henry V. But the true way of looking at the matter is that both
                    the peace of Bretigny and the truce made in the latter years of Richard II. had
                    been broken by the French, that the war was going on at Henry’s accession, that
                    it was just then being more vigorously pressed than it had been for some time,
                    and that all that Henry V. did was to throw the whole national power, guided by
                    his own genius, into its vigorous prosecution. At his accession, his only
                    continental possessions were Calais and its small territory, and a small part of
                    Aquitaine, including Bourdeaux and Bayonne. In Henry’s policy, Southern Gaul,
                    which had been so nearly lost, becomes secondary. He puts forward the treaty of
                    Bretigny, as he also puts forward his claim to the French crown; but his real
                    object seems to have been the conquest of as large a continental territory as
                    possible, but in any case the conquest of Normandy. At this distance of time, we
                    see that such a scheme was neither just nor politic. His own age did not condemn
                    it on either ground. He was checked for a moment, first by a Lollard revolt,
                    then by a conspiracy on behalf either of Richard or of the earl of March. But in
                    1415 he was able to begin his great enterprise. A negotiation, in which Henry
                    claimed, first the crown of France, then the whole continental possessions of
                    the Angevin kings, and lastly the territory ceded at Bretigny, naturally failed.
                    He then crossed the sea in 1415, took Harfleur, and won the battle of Agincourt.
                    The three next years saw his alliance with Duke John of Burgundy, and completed
                    the conquest of Normandy. In 1419 the murder of Duke John by the partisans of
                    the dauphin Charles drove Philip, the new duke of Burgundy, and the whole
                    Burgundian party, altogether to the English side. Paris itself received Henry.
                    Next year (1420), by the treaty of Troyes, Henry gave up his title of King of
                    France. Charles VI. was to keep the French crown for life; Henry was to marry
                    his daughter Katharine, to be declared his heir, and to be meanwhile regent of
                    the kingdom. But the party of the disinherited dauphin still held out, and the
                    war went on in the centre of France, while the rule of Henry was established in
                    the north and south. On August 31, 1422, Henry V. died, revealing the true
                    object of his policy by his last injunction that in no case should peace be
                    made, unless Normandy was ceded to England.in full sovereignty. The infant son
                    of Henry and Katharine, Henry VI., succeeded to the kingdom of England and the
                    heirship of France. Two months later, by the death of his grandfather the French
                    king, he succeeded, <pb break="no"

                    crown of France. His two kingdoms were intrusted to the regency of his two
                    paternal uncles, England to Humfrey duke of Gloucester, and France to John, the
                    great duke of Bedford. The babe was king at Rouen and Paris, and either king or
                    sovereign lord at Bourdeaux;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    intermediate land he had a rival in a third uncle, his mother’s brother, Charles

                <p>A time of thirty years follows, in which the English were gradually driven out of
                    France and Aquitaine, till nothing was left of the old heritage except the
                    Norman islands, and nothing was left of the new conquests except Calais and its
                    small territory. Even after Henry was dead, the great regent was far stronger
                    than the French claimant; but several causes, one after the other, joined to
                    break the English power on the continent. The mainstay of England was the
                    Burgundian alliance. This was first put in jeopardy by the marriage of Duke
                    Humfrey, the regent of England, with Jacqueline, countess of Holland and
                    Hainault, and his attempt to get possession of her dominions. Then, in 1429,
                    came the wonderful career of the Maid, Joan of Arc. She raised the siege of
                    Orleans; she led Charles to be crowned at Rheims, a ceremony which gave him a
                    certain advantage over his uncrowned rival. Her intervention turned the tide for
                    a while on the French side; but Charles seemed quite unable to press his
                    advantage, and he did absolutely nothing for the deliverance of the Maid when in
                    1430 she was taken prisoner, and was the next year burned as a heretic and
                    sorceress. Meanwhile Henry was crowned in England in 1429 and in Paris in 1431.
                    In the next year the death of the duchess of Bedford, sister of the duke of
                    Burgundy, broke the tie between her husband and her brother. At last, in 1435,
                    at the peace of Arras, Philip altogether forsook the English alliance. Almost at
                    the same moment the duke of Bedford died, and from this time the English power
                    in France gradually fell back. Paris was lost in 1436. Presently comes a time of
                    truces and negotiations; and in 1445, on the king’s marriage with Margaret of
                    Anjou, Maine and Anjou were surrendered. In 1449 Rouen was lost, and the second
                    French conquest of Normandy was completed in the next year. In 1451 the French
                    conquered all that was left to England in the south, Bourdeaux being the last
                    town to hold out. But here the tide once more changed for a moment. The
                    Aquitanian cities found that they had gained nothing by their transfer to the
                    nearer instead of the more distant master. In 1453 John Talbot, the great earl
                    of Shrewsbury, came with an English force, and was welcomed as a deliverer. He
                    was slain at Castillon in July; Bourdeaux was again taken by the French in
                    October, and the tie of three hundred years which united England and Aquitaine
                    was broken for ever. Less striking in the history of the world, the French
                    conquest of Aquitaine is, in the history of Western Europe, almost as marked an
                    epoch as the Turkish conquest of Constantinople which happened nearly at the
                    same moment. Two great questions were decided by it. The Norman Conquest first
                    made England a continental power; the succession of the Angevins greatly
                    increased her continental position. That position now wholly passed away.
                    England is now again shut up within her own four seas. From this time she
                    constantly takes a part in continental affairs; but she holds no continental
                    possessions save such outlying posts as Calais, Boulogne, Dunkirk, or Gibraltar.
                    Calais she kept for another century, partly no doubt because the cessions made
                    by France to Burgundy at Arras cut off Calais from the French territory, and
                    made Burgundy the one continental neighbour of England. Again, the French
                    conquest of Aquitaine is no less an epoch in the history of France itself. It
                    completed the formation of France in the modern sense. Ever since the twelfth
                    century, the French kings had been striving after dominion south of the Loire,
                    that is, after the union of Southern with Northern Gaul. They gained their point
                    for a moment by the marriage of Lewis and Eleanor. They gained it again for a
                    moment by the surrender of Aquitaine to Philip the Fair. They now gained it for
                    ever. The whole relations between England and France were now changed. There
                    were to be many later wars between the two kingdoms, and for a while the old
                    claims of England were always remembered and were now and then asserted. But any
                    serious hope of an English conquest of France, or even of an English conquest of
                    Normandy or Aquitaine, passed away when Bourdeaux opened its gates to the French
                    in 1453. From that day the modern relations between England and France
                    begin.</p>
                <p>The period of the Hundred Years’ War was the time in which what we may call the
                    growth of England came to an end. The nation in its later shape was fully formed
                    at the end of the thirteenth century. The great lines of its later law and.
                    constitution have been already drawn. During the following period law and
                    constitution have to take their perfect shape at home, and the nation, now fully
                    formed, has to take its final position among the powers of Europe. During this
                    time England and the English people became essentially all that they have been
                    ever since. The changes in later times have been great and important; but they
                    have been changes of detail. In the thirteenth century it was still by no means
                    clear what was to be the final shape of English institutions, what was to be the
                    final position of the English people at home and abroad. In the fifteenth
                    century all this had been fixed. The constitution, the laws, the language, the
                    national character, of Englishmen had all taken a shape from which in their main
                    points they were never again to change. The island realm, with the character of
                    islanders impressed upon its people, with its political constitution and its
                    social state differing from that of any other European nation, was by the end of
                    this period fully formed. When we have reached the end of this period, we know
                    what England is. The personal character of the nation is now fixed. Up to this
                    time the history of the nation has been the record of its growth; our study has
                    had somewhat of a physical character. From this time our study is rather
                    biographical; our history ceases to be the record of the growth of a nation; it
                    becomes the record of the acts of a nation after it has taken its final
                    shape.</p>
                <p>In a specially constitutional aspect, the reign of Edward III., the central time
                    of the period with which we are dealing, is hardly less important than the reign
                    of Edward I. But its importance is of a different kind. The earlier reign fixed
                    the constitution of parliament; it decreed that in an English parliament certain
                    elements should always be present. It laid down as a matter of broad principle
                    what the essential powers of parliament were. In the later reign, the essential
                    elements of parliament finally arrange themselves in their several places and
                    relations to one another. The powers, rights, and privileges of each element in
                    the state, and the exact manner of exercising them, were now fixed and defined.
                    The Commons are now fully established as an essential element in parliament. It
                    is further established that prelates, earls, and barons are to form one body,
                    that knights, citizens, and burgesses are to form another. That is to say, as
                    the attempt to make the clergy act as a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n341/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0341-0322"/> parliamentary estate came to nothing, parliament
                    now definitely took its modern form of an assembly of two houses, Lords and
                    Commons. A statute of Edward II. in 1322 distinctly asserted the right of the
                    Commons to a share in all acts which touched the general welfare of the kingdom.
                    But a distinction was for a long time drawn between the older and the newer
                    element in the assembly. For a long time the doctrine was that the Commons
                    petitioned, and that their petitions were granted by the king with the assent of
                    the Lords. This position of the Commons as a petitioning body is of the deepest
                    importance, and looks both forwards and backwards. Looking backwards, it was an
                    almost necessary result of the way in which parliament had grown up. The Lords
                    were, and the Commons were not, representatives by direct succession of the
                    ancient sovereign assemblies of the land. It was for them by immemorial right to
                    advise the king and to consent to his acts. The Commons had been called into
                    being alongside of them; they had no such traditional powers; they could win
                    them only step by step. Looking forwards, the position of the Commons as a
                    petitioning body was a source of immediate weakness and of final strength. For a
                    while they simply petitioned; not only might their petitions be refused, but, if
                    they were granted, they had no control over the shape in which they were
                    granted. If the king granted a petition which involved any change in the law, it
                    was by royal officers that the petition was put into the form of a statute after
                    the representatives of the Commons had gone back to their homes. Such a practice
                    gave opportunity for many tricks. It was a frequent subject of complaint that
                    the petitions which were said to be granted, and the statutes which were enacted
                    in answer to them, were something quite different from what the Commons had
                    really asked for. This evil was first seriously checked in the reign of Henry
                    VI., when the practice was established which still prevails, that of bringing
                    in, instead of a mere petition, a bill drawn in the form which the proposed
                    statute was intended to take. Again, as long as the Commons were mere
                    petitioners at whose request a law was enacted, it might be held that the king
                    was equally able to enact at the request of some other petitioning body. Thus we
                    still find statutes sometimes enacted, without the petition of the Commons,
                    sometimes, for instance, at the petition of the clergy. So again, this same
                    position of the Commons as a petitioning body led to one distinction between
                    them and the Lords which has gone on to our own times. In one chief function of
                    the ancient assemblies the Commons never obtained a direct share. Parliament,
                    like those ancient assemblies, has always been the highest court of justice. But
                    its strictly judicial powers have always been exercised by the Lords only. The
                    Commons, by virtue of their petitioning power, have become denouncers and
                    accusers; but they have never become judges. By virtue of their petitioning
                    power, they began, as early as the reign of Edward III., to denounce the
                    ministers of the king, and to demand their dismissal. In the Good Parliament of
                    1376, and again in the parliament of Richard ten years later, this power grows
                    into a regular impeachment of the offenders, which is brought by the Commons as
                    accusers before the Lords as judges. Whenever the Commons have taken part in
                    action which was practically judicial, it has always been under some other form.
                    They have exercised a somewhat arbitrary and anomalous authority in defence of
                    their own privileges. They have passed bills of attainder and bills of pains and
                    penalties; but these take the form of legislative acts. Strictly judicial
                    functions like those of the Lords they have never claimed.</p>
                <p>One effect of the growth of the Commons was to give a more definite position to
                    the Lords. As long as there was only one body, and that a fluctuating body,
                    membership of the assembly could not be looked on as conferring any definite <hi
                    rend="italic">status.</hi> None but the bishops and earls had any undoubted
                    personal claim. Some abbots, some barons, were always summoned; but for a long
                    time they were not always the same abbots or the same barons, and the memory of
                    the old right of attendance on the part of the whole free population had not
                    altogether died away. So long as this state of things lasted, no definite line
                    could be drawn between those who were members of the assembly and those who were
                    not. It was only when a new body arose by the side of the old one, a body which
                    confessedly represented all persons who had no place in the elder body, that
                    membership of the elder body became a definite personal privilege. The vague and
                    fluctuating gathering of the great men of the realm now grew into a peerage of
                    known members, and possessing defined rights. The very change which made the
                    Lords, as we may now call them, sharers in their powers in every way raised the
                    position of the Lords as a class. The peerage, with its several ranks and its
                    defined privileges, grew up in the reigns from Edward III. to Henry VI. It was
                    gradually established that the king’s writ of summons, by which he called this
                    or that man to give his attendance in parliament, conveyed a perpetual right,
                    not only to himself but to his heirs. And now that the peerage has taken this
                    more definite character, we hear of new and more solemn ways of admission to its
                    ranks, such as creations in parliament and by letters patent. New titles of
                    peerage of foreign origin were devised. Edward III. first created dukes,
                    beginning with his own sons. The duchy of Cornwall has ever since belonged of
                    right to the eldest son of the sovereign. Under Richard dukes became more
                    common; under him too the title of <hi rend="italic">mαrchio</hi> or marquess,,
                    properly the lord or guardian of a <hi rend="italic">march</hi> or frontier,
                    came to denote another honorary rank of peerage. Under Henry VI. another new
                    rank of peerage first appears, that of <hi rend="italic">vicecomes</hi> or
                    viscount, a word which had hitherto meant the sheriff of a county. All these new
                    titles were, as titles, purely honorary; they expressed mere rank, with no
                    rights or duties but such as were common to the whole peerage. The creation of
                    these new titles completed the change in the position of the earls, about whom
                    some trace of their original official character long hung. The earldom now
                    became a mere rank in the peerage, like any other. The new dukes and marquesses
                    were set above the earls, while the viscounts were thrust in between the earls
                    and the barons. But both the old titles and the new kept the same position as
                    ranks in an official peerage, in a body of legislatorsand judges, the temporal
                    portion of which held their seats by genealogical succession.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Genealogical succession,”
                    because the phrase “hereditary succession” is, in the older use of the word,
                    applicable alike <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> to the spiritual and the
                    temporal peers, at least as both classes stood till the union with Scotland. In
                    older language “jus hereditarium” means a right handed on from one holder to
                    another, whether the successor be the son of the last holder, or a person chosen
                    .or appointed to succeed him after his death. In this sense, the seats attached
                    to the sees of Canterbury, York, London, Durham, and Winchester, are still as
                    strictly hereditary as any earldom or barony. But that name cannot apply to
                    various modern forms of peerage, such as the elective peers of Scotland and
                    Ireland, to the rotatory bishops of Ireland now abolished, to those bishops of
                    England who succeed only by seniority, or to the last newly created judicial
                    peerages.</p></note> But no nobility in the foreign sense was, or could be,
                    created. Because the peer was raised above other men as hereditary legislator
                    and hereditary judge, therefore his children remained, like other men, members
                    of the general body of the Commons.</p>
                <p>As the growth of the Commons at once raised and defined the position of the
                    Lords, so the general growth of the power of parliament at once defined, and by
                    defining strengthened, the king’s prerogative. It now became a question what
                    acts were lawful to the king without the consent of parliament, and what acts
                    needed that consent. It is clear that, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0342-0323"/> whenever prerogative was defined, it was at once
                    limited and strengthened. But the very strengthening was of the nature of a
                    limitation. A power which was directly or indirectly bestowed by parliament
                    ceased to be a power inherent in the crown. The struggle was therefore a hard
                    one. The kings strove to hold their ground at every point, and to escape from
                    the fetters which the nation strove to lay upon them. When the Commons tried to
                    make the king dismiss evil counsellors or moderate the expenses of his
                    household, when they tried to regulate the oppressive right of purveyance, the
                    king was apt to find a loop-hole in some protest or reservation or saving
                    clause. So the kings strove to keep the power of arbitrary taxation in their own
                    hands by drawing distinctions between customs and other sources of revenue. So
                    they strove to keep the power of legislation without the consent of parliament,
                    by drawing a distinction between statutes and ordinances, and by pretending to a
                    right to suspend the operation of statutes. The claim to legislate by ordinance
                    is closely connected with the way in which all our legislative and judicial
                    bodies arose. The parliament, the privy council, the courts of justice, have all
                    grown out of the ancient assembly. For some while after the Conquest it is not
                    always easy to see whether the words <hi rend="italic">curia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">regis</hi> mean the great council of the nation or the smaller
                    council of the king’s immediate advisers. The greater and the smaller council
                    were alike fragments of the national assembly, and both alike derived their
                    special shape from the practice of personal summons. If one body so formed had
                    the right of legislation, it might be argued that the other body so formed had
                    it also. So again, as the Commons grew, the form of their petitions, praying
                    that such and such an enactment might be made by the king with the consent of
                    the Lords, seemed to recognize the king as the only real lawgiver. It might
                    suggest the thought that he could, if he would, exercise his legislative powers,
                    even though the Commons did not petition, and though the Lords did not assent. A
                    crowd of loop-holes were thus opened for irregular doings of all kinds—for
                    attempts on the part of the kings to evade every constitutional fetter—for
                    attempts to reign without parliaments, to impose taxes by their own authority,
                    or to legislate with the consent only of their own council or of some other body
                    other than a regular parliament. Every point had to be struggled for over and
                    over again. Eut by the end of the fourteenth century we may say that the
                    constitution and the powers of parliament were, as far as the letter of the law
                    went, much the same as they are now. But it took three hundred years more to
                    secure the observance of the letter of the law, while the two hundred years that
                    have followed have, by the side of the written law, developed the unwritten
                    constitution.</p>
                <p>For the peculiar character of that unwritten constitution, for the system by
                    which a crowd of powers which the Commons shrink from directly exercising are
                    now exercised by them indirectly, we have to wait for some ages. In those days a
                    power was either exercised directly or it was not exercised at all. Thus one
                    most important power which was freely exercised by our most ancient assemblies,
                    but which modern parliaments shrink from directly exercising, the power of
                    making peace and war, was in the fourteenth century in a very irregular state.
                    Sometimes parliament claims a voice in such matters; sometimes the king seems to
                    thrust a control over them on an unwilling parliament. I hat iβ to say, the
                    kings wished to make parliament share the responsibility of their acts. A
                    parliament could hardly refuse to support the king in a war which it had itself
                    approved. The wars of Edward III., and his constant calls for money, made
                    frequent parliaments needful. Perhaps no other series of events in our history
                    did so much to strengthen and define every parliamentary power. But it was
                    mainly by the petitioning position of the Commons that all power has thus been
                    drawn into the hands of parliament. Any matter might become the subject of a
                    petition of the Commons. It followed that, as their petitions gradually grew
                    into demands which could not be resisted, every matter might become the subject
                    of legislation by the Commons. In their position as petitioners lay their
                    strength. They only petitioned, while the king enacted and the Lords assented.
                    But the humbler position gave them the first word. The enacting power of the
                    king gradually came to be a mere power of refusing to enact, a power which has
                    long ceased to be exercised. The humble petitioners came to be the proposers of
                    everything, and so to be the masters of everything. They had the privilege of
                    the <hi rend="italic">prcerogativa</hi><hi rend="italic">tribus.</hi></p>
                <p>The power of parliament to settle the succession to the crown, that is, the
                    ancient right of election in another shape, comes more largely into play at a
                    later period. We have however one of the greatest instances of its exercise in
                    the deposition of Richard and the settlement of the crown on Henry IV. and his
                    heirs. And twelve years before the ancient doctrine was carried out in practice,
                    it was solemnly declared by Bishop Arundel and Thomas duke of Gloucester,
                    speaking in the name of parliament, that, by an ancient statute, parliament,
                    with the common consent of the nation, had a right to depose a king who failed
                    to govern according to the laws and by the advice of his peers, and to call to
                    the throne some other member of the royal family in his stead. Most certainly
                    there never was such a statute in the form of a statute; but the doctrine simply
                    expressed the immemorial principle on which the nation had always acted whenever
                    it was needful. And the statement that there was a statute to that effect was
                    perhaps simply an instance of the growth of the doctrines of the professional
                    lawyers. Men were beginning to forget that the earliest written law was nothing
                    more than immemorial custom committed to writing. They were beginning to think
                    that, wherever there was law or even custom, it must have had its beginning in
                    some written, even if forgotten, enactment.</p>
                <p>After all, nothing better shows the power of parliament than the attempts which
                    were often made by those in power to procure a packed House of Commons.
                    Complaints were made that the sheriffs returned knights of the shire who were
                    not really the choice of the electors, and that they summoned, or failed to
                    summon, boroughs to send burgesses, according to their arbitrary will. Lastly,
                    in the early days of Henry VI., we find the rights of the electors restricted by
                    parliament itself. The constitution of the House of Commons was clearly growing
                    too popular for the ruling powers, and it was thought needful to legislate in
                    the interests of oligarchy. By the statute of 1429 the electors of “small
                    substance and of no value” were disfranchised, and the right of voting was
                    confined to those who had a freehold of forty shillings yearly, a not
                    inconsiderable amount at that time. By another statute of the same reign (1444-
                    45) it is enacted that the knights chosen shall be “notable knights or notable
                    esquires, gentlemen by birth.” This enactment is instructive in many ways. It
                    shows, what we find to have been the case almost from the beginning, that the
                    knights of the shire were not always knights in the strict sense. The electors
                    were clearly trying to break down all distinctions of rank and birth, and an
                    attempt is made to enforce these distinctions by law. Happily no definition of
                    “gentlemen by birth” was or could be attempted. This backsliding statute has
                    therefore become a dead letter, as its fellow has no less through the change in
                    the value of money.</p>
                <p>The powers of parliament in this age, and the external influences under which
                    parliaments acted, cannot be better illustated than by a comparison of the last
                    two parliaments <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0343-0324"/> of Edward III. The parliament of 1376, which
                    lived in men’s memories by the name of the Good Parliament, had the full support
                    of the prince of Wales. It was able to overthrow the king’s ministers, to remove
                    his favourite Alice Perrers from court, and to encumber him with a council. A
                    crowd of petitions of various kinds were presented, some of them insisting on
                    freedom of election. The houses separated; the prince died; all the acts of the
                    parliament were set at nought; most of them were reversed by a packed parliament
                    the next year. Yet even this packed parliament established some wholesome
                    doctrines, and amongst others enacted that no statute should be made at the
                    petition of the clergy without the consent of the Commons. The same alternation
                    of reforming and reactionary parliaments is found under Richard II. There is no
                    surer witness to the importance of any assembly or other institution than the
                    fact that the ruling powers find it convenient to corrupt or pervert it.</p>
                <p>When we turn to the religious, the social, and the literary aspect of this
                    period, we may be amazed at the way in which the three are all intertwined
                    together, and in which they all gather round a single man. We cannot write the
                    history of the fourteenth century in any of these aspects, we cannot write the
                    history of the fifteenth as affected by causes which had their beginning in the
                    fourteenth, without bringing in the name of John Wickliffe., As a man who was
                    employed in important negotiations with foreign powers, he has earned his place
                    in any minute record even of the outward political history of his time. But it
                    is in these other three branches that he stands out as the foremost figure of
                    his time. But, while he is prominent in all three alike, it is his religious
                    position which is primary. His influence on our social and literary history is
                    secondary, and acts wholly through his religious position. Wickliffe, a renowned
                    schoolman and doctor of Oxford, a well beneficed secular priest, and not unknown
                    in the political world, made himself the centre and the mouth-piece of the great
                    need of his time. The fourteenth century saw the beginning of a cry for a
                    religious reformation in a wider sense than a mere reform of the abuses of the
                    moment. Reforms of that kind have been demanded, promised, and indeed partly
                    attempted, in almost every age. The day of the monks was past when the day of
                    the friars began; and now the day of the friars was past also. They too had
                    fallen from their first love, and the abuses of the mendicant orders formed one
                    of the chief subjects of declamation for the reformers of the time. The bounty
                    of founders now took another form. The foundation of colleges in the
                    universities went on briskly all through the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
                    Schools and hospitals, chantries and colleges of priests attached to parish
                    churches, were largely founded; but the foundation of monasteries was now rare.
                    The great foundations of William of Wykeham at Winchester and Oxford, followed
                    by those of Henry VI. at Eton and Cambridge, form an aera in the history of
                    education in England.</p>
                <p>It is singular that this new class of foundations was largely helped by an act of
                    legislation which might well pass for spoliation of the Church. The fourteenth
                    century and the beginning of the fifteenth was a busy time of legislation on
                    ecclesiastical matters. The political strife with the Roman see went on in full
                    vigour, with all the more vigour because the Roman see had in some sort ceased
                    to be a Roman see. In the fourteenth century the popes were no longer the common
                    fathers of Christendom, ruling from the centre of Christendom. They had forsaken
                    Rome for Avignon, a city close to the French border, and where they were the
                    tools of the king of the neighbouring realm. The popes of Rome had been
                    oppressors and spoilers of England; the popes of Avignon were her political
                    enemies, the allies of her rivals in Britain and on the continent. When, later
                    in the century, Rome and Avignon became the seats of rival popes, England was
                    naturally found on the side of the pope of Rome, France and Scotland on the side
                    of the pope of Avignon. But, whether at Rome or at Avignon, the foreign
                    ecclesiastical power had to be kept in check. A series of statutes designed to
                    check papal encroachments marks the reign of Edward III., and still more
                    conspicuously marks the reign of Richard II. The statute of provisors checked
                    the interference of the popes with the disposal of English benefices. The
                    statute of <hi rend="italic">prcemunire</hi> denounced the heaviest penalties
                    against the unauthorized introduction of papal bulls into the kingdom.
                    Legislation of this kind was indeed only repressing innovations; it was bringing
                    the law back to what it had been in the days of King Eadward and King William.
                    Under the house of Lancaster, the spirit of opposition to the papal claims grew
                    fainter, at all events on the part of the kings. In the appointment of
                    bishoprics especially, pope and king found it easy to play into one another’s
                    hands, at the expense of the ecclesiastical electors. Meanwhile, from the reign
                    of Edward III. onwards, opposition to the aggressions of the head of the Church
                    abroad grew into a dangerous hankering after the possessions of the Church at
                    home. In the later days of Edward a strong party of the baronage, headed by John
                    of Gaunt, were zealous for ecclesiastical reform, in the sense of confiscation
                    of ecclesiastical property and of the exclusion of churchmen from political
                    office. In the reign of Henry IV. a scheme was proposed in the Commons for the
                    general confiscation of ecclesiastical’revenues. This storm was turned aside,
                    but the hand of disendowment fell heavily in the next reign on one class of
                    ecclesiastical foundations, though, as it turned out, greatly to the profit of
                    another class. The new colleges and other foundations were largely endowed out
                    of the revenues of the alien priories. These were monasteries in England which
                    were dependent on greater monasteries in Normandy or elsewhere beyond the sea.
                    During the wars with France these alien houses were looked on as outposts of the
                    enemy, and in the reign of Henry V. they were finally suppressed. By far the
                    greater part of their revenues went to the educational and secular foundations
                    which were growing up at Oxford, Cambridge, and elsewhere. A king and a primate,
                    both of them of a piety unusual in that age, Henry V. and Archbishop Chicheley,
                    were the chief actors in this alienation of ecclesiastical revenues by the
                    secular power.</p>
                <p>But changes of this kind were not religious reformation; they were hardly
                    ecclesiastical reform. It is plain that the corruptions of the Church were
                    growing; everything shows the prevalence of a hard, secular, grasping spirit in
                    ecclesiastical relations. The primates of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
                    are, if we except the momentary primacy of Thomas Bradwardine, an inferior race
                    to those of the thirteenth. Men cried, as they had ever cried, for the reform of
                    practical evils, and they now began to go much further. They began to attack the
                    whole ecclesiastical system, and even the received doctrines of the Church. It
                    was held that heresy was a crime at common law; but, as a matter of fact,
                    religious dissent of any kind was rarely heard of in England from the earliest
                    times till the fourteenth century. The most remarkable case in earlier times was
                    in the reign of Henry II., when a company of foreigners, belonging to some of
                    the sects of Southern Europe, succeeded in making a single English proselyte.
                    But the teaching of Wickliffe in the fourteenth century· was the beginning of
                    the religious changes of the sixteenth ∣ century. Wickliffe, the founder of a
                    sect which suffered ' much persecution, can hardly be said to have been <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n344/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0344-0325"/> persecuted himself. His doctrines led directly to
                    the unlawfulness of the whole ecclesiastical system, and specially to the
                    unlawfulness of ecclesiastical property. Those doctrines he sent forth his poor
                    priests to teach; but he himself lived and died in quiet possession of the
                    rectory of Lutterworth. A reformer, theological, moral, and political, he allied
                    himself with John of Gaunt, as the Puritans did in after times with Robert
                    Dudley, though the duke’s schemes of reform were certainly of a more earthly
                    kind than those of the doctor. But this union came to an end when another side
                    of Wickliffe’s teaching, one which was doubtless not designed by Wickliffe
                    himself, came into notice. This age was beyond all others the age of social
                    change, or at least of events which led to the greatest social change. Causes
                    which had doubtless been working long before came to a head under the joint
                    influence of a fearful physical stroke and of the new religious teaching.</p>
                <p>We may safely set down the great plague of 1349, known as the Black Death, as the
                    greatest of all social landmarks in English history. While the chivalrous king
                    was keeping the feast of the foundation of the Order of the Garter, half the
                    inhabitants of his kingdom were swept away by the pestilence. The natural
                    results followed. We have seen that one of the gradual results of the Norman
                    Conquest was to fuse together the churls, the lowest class of freemen, along
                    with the slaves in the intermediate class of villains. By this time personal
                    slavery had pretty well died out; but villainage was still in full force. But
                    various causes—among them the frequent emancipation of the villains—had called
                    into being a class of free labourers alongside of the villains. When the plague
                    cut off so large a proportion of the whole people, labour became scarcer, and
                    higher wages were naturally demanded. Parliament after parliament, beginning in
                    the very year of the Black Death, tried, in the interests of the employers of
                    labour, to keep wages at their old rate. The Good Parliament itself did not
                    shrink from this selfish and impossible attempt. The discontent caused by these
                    statutes, the general stirring of men’s minds of which Wickliffe and the Vision
                    of the Ploughman are alike witnesses, led, under the preaching of some of
                    Wickliffe’s wilder and fiercer disciples, to the great peasant outbreak of 1381,
                    the insurrection which has chiefly become famous through the story of Wat Tyler.
                    The young king, undoubtedly outstripping his legal powers, promised freedom to
                    all the villains. This promise the next parliament not unnaturally refused to
                    confirm. Two results followed. Though the villains were not at once emancipated,
                    yet from this time villainage gradually died out, as slavery had already died
                    out. Neither institution was ever abolished by law; but all the slaves gradually
                    became villains, all the villains gradually became freemen. By the end of the
                    fifteenth century, villainage was hardly known, except here and there on
                    ecclesiastical estates. The clergy had always preached the emancipation of the
                    villains as a good work. Yet they were the slowest of all landowners to
                    emancipate their own villains. In this there is no real inconsistency. The
                    layman might do what he would with his own; he might dispense with services
                    owing to himself. Those who were at any moment the members of an ecclesiastical
                    corporation might be held not to have the same right to emancipate their
                    villains, that is, to make away with the rights of the corporation itself.</p>
                <p>The other great result of the peasant uprising was to associate in men’s minds
                    the two ideas of religious reformation and political, or rather social,
                    revolution. ΛVickliffe was himself as guiltless of the revolt of the villains as
                    Luther was of the Peasants’ War or of the reign of the Anabaptists. But in both
                    cases the teaching of the more moderate reformer had a real connexion with the
                    doings of the reformers who outstripped him. From this time Lollardy, as the
                    teaching of Wickliffe was called, was under a cloud. It was held to be all one,
                    not only with heresy, but with revolution. Wickliffe himself died in peace; but
                    for the few years that he outlived the revolt, he lost all political influence
                    and political support. The reign of Richard was hostile to the ecclesiastical
                    order at home and abroad. Let it produced in 1382 the first statute against
                    heresy, the penalties of which did not go beyond imprisonment. It was regularly
                    passed; yet the Commons in the next parliament expressly demanded that it should
                    be declared null. The first statute for the burning of heretics dates from the
                    reign of Henry IV., from which time the stake was their legal doom. Bût the
                    number of heretics to burn was not great. The most famous victim was Sit John
                    Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, who was hanged and burned under Henry V. on a combined
                    charge of treason anl heresy. Thus far the political character of Lollardy shows
                    itself. But through the rest of the fifteenth century, though we ever and anon
                    hear of a martyrdom, religious dissent was so thoroughly discredited as to be of
                    no political importance.</p>
                <p>Wickliffe was thus the direct author of a religious change. He was indirectly, if
                    not the author, at least the unintentional abettor, of a social and political
                    change. His place in the history of English literature is at least equal to his
                    place in religious and political history. He was the father of later English
                    prose writing. Since the sudden close of the Peterborough Chronicle, English
                    prose writing had never quite died out, but it had remained something quite
                    secondary by the side of English verse. But in the fourteenth century the
                    English language again won back its own place. Now that the English nation had
                    been formed again in its new shape, it was needful to proclaim the fact to the
                    world by some unmistakable outward sign. That sign was found in the restoration
                    of the national language to its rights as the acknowledged speech of the land,
                    and that restoration was brought about by the same cause which first showed the
                    regenerate English nation in the character of a great European power. It was the
                    French war which completed the triumph of the English tongue. The men who had
                    overcome the French enemy on his own soil could not endure that the French
                    tongue should remain in use on the soil of England even as the speech of
                    fashion. In the course of Edward III.’s reign English displacedFrench as the
                    speech of education and as the speech of the courts of law. Statutes are still
                    drawn up in French, but speeches in parliament are now in English. The ministers
                    of the crown address the houses, and Henry of Lancaster claims the crown, in the
                    native speech of the land. At last, under Henry V., negotiations were carried on
                    with France by ambassadors who knew not the French tongue. From this time the
                    use of French in public documents, an use which still lingered till the end of
                    the fifteenth century, was as mere a survival as the two or three formulae which
                    are couched in French still.</p>
                <p>Thus after the ups and downs of three hundred years, English was now again the
                    acknowledged speech of England, the one common speech of Englishmen of all
                    ranks. But the ancient tongue, in winniug back its ancient place, had greatly
                    changed its ancient character. The two great changes in language which the
                    effects of the Norman Conquest had rather strengthened than begun, the loss of
                    inflexions and the coustant introduction of foreign words, had had more and more
                    effect as the speakers of the two tongues grew closer together, as the use of
                    one or the other marked no longer a national but merely a social distinction.
                    The English tongue which thus, in the course of tho fourteenth century, won back
                    its place from French, was a form of English which had lost or corrupted most of
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n345/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0345-0326"/> old grammatical forms, which had adopted a crowd
                    of foreign words, and which had even displaced many English words to make way
                    for them. Still the unbroken continuity, the personal being as it were, of the
                    native tongue remained untouched. We may say that in one age French displaced
                    English, that in another age English displaced French. But the English tongue
                    always remained the English tongue. The tongue of Chaucer did not displace the
                    tongue of Beowulf; the elder form of the language changed into the younger by
                    gradual and imperceptible shades. The fourteenth century was one of the great
                    periods of English literature. The devotional vein which had never ceased, the
                    satirical vein which had begun-—most likely begun again— in the thirteenth
                    century,-flowed together in the fourteenth to form the great work, religious,
                    moral, and social, of William Langland, the Vision of Piers the Ploughman. And
                    after the English poet of the people soon came the English poet of more courtly
                    life and more courtly speech in the person of Geoffrey Chaucer. And alongside of
                    these more famous names we have a considerable mass of verse, political and
                    satirical, on the events of the times. But while a hundred years earlier
                    compositions of this kind were written indifferently in three languages, we have
                    them now in two only; they are written in Latin and in English, but never in
                    French. We have indeed one French chronicle of this time, that which records the
                    deposition and death of Richard; but it is the work of a Frenchman. But it is
                    now that English prose comes to the front in thé hands of Wickliffe, in the form
                    of his translation of the Bible and of his countless popular tracts. From his
                    time a series of prose writers has never failed us. The English version of the
                    travels of Sir John Mandeville in the fourteenth century, the theological
                    writings of Bishop Reginald Peacock in the fifteenth, carry on the series from
                    the days of the great master. Prose history in Euglish does not appear in the
                    fourteenth century, and it is of small importance in the fifteenth. But that is
                    the case with our history generally. The old series of the Latin historians of
                    England is but feebly represented in the fourteenth century, and it can hardly
                    be said to be represented at all in the fifteenth. The great school of St Albans
                    comes down to Thomas of Walsingham and Abbot Whethamstead. But we now look in
                    vain at St Albans for successors of Matthew Paris, as we look in vain elsewhere
                    for successors of William of Malmesbury or William of Newburgh.</p>
                <p>It is therefore not too much to say that, in the course of this period, the
                    period of the Hundred Years’ War, Englaud finally took its modern shape. The
                    essence of the constitution, the main points of the law, the dominant language,
                    all took a shape which has since been changed only in detail. In all these
                    things the formation of the England that was to be was brought to perfection in
                    this age. And if the remaining distinctive characteristic of England was not
                    brought to perfection in this age, the first steps to it were already taken. The
                    papal claims were narrowly limited by law; ecclesiastical revenues were
                    alienated by authority of parliament; if strictly religious reformation obtained
                    no legal sanction, yet its seeds were now for the first time sown in the heart
                    of the people. And if this was the age when the main features of English
                    political life put on their present form, it was no less so with the main
                    features of English social life. The distinguishing elements of English society,
                    the peer as distinguished from the continental noble, the country gentleman, the
                    farmer, the free labourer—all of them elements so specially English—all take
                    nearly their present shape during this time. Villainage, if not actually
                    abolished, received its death-blow. The mingling of classes is shown even by the
                    oligarchic statutes which tried in some measure to hinder it. Esquires had long
                    represented shires as well as actual knights. The rich citizen could buy a
                    landed estate, and in a generation or two his children counted as esquires. The
                    towns were growing in wealth and political importance, but their internal
                    constitutions were getting narrower. The law was administered by nearly the same
                    courts as it is now, and the abundance of lawsuits kept all courts, great and
                    small, fully supplied with business. This growth of the law, the specially
                    English law, statute and common, led to the rapid growth and increasing
                    importance of the class of professional lawyers, men who practised the statute
                    and common law of England, as distinguished from the professors of the law of
                    Rome, civil and canon. Their importance is shown in the fourteenth century, by a
                    petition of the Commons that the practitioners of the law might not be returned
                    as knights of the shire; it was more terribly shown towards the end of that
                    century in the bitter hatred towards the whole lawyer class which was shown in
                    the peasant revolt. But notwithstanding both laws and lawyers, we find that
                    powerful men, to say nothing of the king himself, were often able to interfere
                    with the due administration of the law. But this fault is common to all lands.
                    What is specially English is that, though the law was often broken, yet the law
                    remained to rebuke those who broke it, and to triumph over them in the end.</p>
                <p>Thus, on the whole, practical peace and order, as well as constitutional freedom,
                    steadily advanced during this age. Not the smallest sign of its advance is the
                    marked improvement in domestic architecture. The style which came in with the
                    latter half of the fourteenth century and went on in use during the fifteenth,
                    is commonly looked on as a decline from the style of the thirteenth and early
                    fourteenth century. Yet, even as applied to churches, this style is not without
                    its own merits, and it is the characteristic domestic style of England. Up to
                    the end of the thirteenth century, we have but small remains of houses, houses
                    as distinguished from castles and not built within the walls of a town. But in
                    the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries England was covered with houses of all
                    classes, manor-houses, parsonages, houses of substantial yeomen, of wood or
                    stone according to their district, often excellent examples of the architecture
                    of the time, and witnessing to the general state of security in the greater part
                    of the country. We at once contrast them with the houses of the same and of a
                    much later date on the Scottish border and in Ireland, where the esquire and the
                    priest still had to live for safety’s sake in the pele-tower. This last is in
                    truth nothing but a continuation of the square Norman keep in a smaller and
                    ruder form. In short, in Englaud security, liberty, and political rights were
                    spread over the whole country. They were not, as in most other lands, confined
                    to the inhabitants either of fortified towns or of private strongholds.</p>
                <p>Three hundred and fifty years of struggle had thus made England once more fully
                    herself after the great overthrow of the Norman Conquest. In a formal narrative
                    of English history, our tale would now, as it draws nearer and nearer to our own
                    time, be fittingly told in greater detail at each stage. In a sketch like the
                    present the opposite process would seem to be no less fitting. We now know what
                    England is. She has made herself; she has won her rights; she has now to defend,
                    to secure, when needful to reform; she has no longer any need to create. The
                    only exception is with regard to her religious history. In other respects all
                    that has henceforth to be done is to keep what has already been gained. In the
                    religious department alone, there is still something to be gained, something, if
                    not to be created, at least to be put into a wholly uew shape.</p>

                <p>This great period of three hundred and fifty years, broken, as we have dealt with
                    it, into several smaller periods, this period of creative struggle, is followed
                    by another great period of about two hundred and fifty years. This is still a
                    time of struggle, but in political matters of mainly defensive struggle, while
                    in religious matters the struggle is still, in a lower sense, creative. This
                    long period again falls into three smaller periods. The first is the time of the
                    civil wars of York and Lancaster, a time during which the fabric of freedom
                    which had been built up with so much toil begins to yield, in outward appearance
                    at least, to the growth of an almost despotic power in the crown. Then comes the
                    time of Tudor dominion, the time which, while it saw the greatest development of
                    royal power, saw also the great religious change which was needed to complete
                    the later character of England. Lastly, there is the time of renewed struggle,
                    political and religious alike, against the feebler despotism of the Stewarts. Of
                    these three periods, the first, answering nearly to the second half of the
                    fifteenth century, has little religious interest. In the second, answering
                    nearly to the sixteenth century, though the political interest is great, the
                    religious interest surpasses it. In the third period, answering nearly to the
                    seventeenth century, the religious and the political interest go side by side.
                    But through the whole both of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it is the
                    importance of the religious interest which gives the period its special
                    character. While, in political matters, men are simply striving to preserve or
                    to win back an old freedom, in religious matters they are striving to establish
                    a wholly new freedom.</p>
                <p>Beginning then, as before, with the most prominent outward characteristics of the
                    several periods, the feature which first strikes us is that the hundred years of
                    foreign war are followed by a period of about half the length, the chief feature
                    of which is the great civil strife of the fifteenth century, the strife between
                    the houses of York and Lancaster, commonly known as the Wars of the Roses. It
                    would seem as if the failure of schemes of continental dominion on the part of
                    England had driven Englishmen to spend their energies in biting and devouring
                    one another at home. The fifty years after the final loss of Aquitaine form a
                    time which, especially towards its end, is of much importance in other ways. But
                    this feature of constant civil war, war waged to settle the disputed succession
                    to the crown, is that which gives to the time its most distinguishing character.
                    Wars with Scotland and with France go on very much as before. One year there is
                    a raid; the next year there is a truce. But warfare of this kind is of little
                    importance in a general view of the period. All hope of the conquest or serious
                    dismemberment of either of the hostile countries has passed away. The origin of
                    this great civil strife was to appearance purely genealogical. The claim of
                    Roger earl of March to succeed Richard IL, by virtue of descent in the female
                    line from an elder son of Edward III., showed the new doctrines in their
                    extremest form. But all claims on this score had been set aside by the repeated
                    acts of parliament which gave the crown to Henry IV. and his heirs. No title
                    could be better than that of the Lancastrian kings; and, amid the glories of the
                    reign of Henry V., the genealogical fancy which was all that could be pleaded
                    for the other family seems gradually to have been forgotten But, just about the
                    time of the loss of Aquitaine, a number of circumstances joined together to give
                    a renewed importance to their claims. Those claims had now passed to Richard
                    duke of York, who in the male line represented a son of Edward HI. younger than
                    John of Gaunt, but who in the female line represented the elder brother Lionel.
                    The weakness of Henry VI., sometimes growing into absolute imbecility, was now
                    manifest. His foreign queen and his ministers, the dukes of Suffolk and
                    Somerset, were unpopular on various grounds, specially on account of the losses
                    in France. Duke Richard, on the other hand, was an able and popular nobleman,
                    who had won reputation both in France and in Ireland. As long as. Henry was
                    childless, he might be looked on as heir-presumptive to the crown. The only
                    possible competitor was the duke of Somerset himself. Somerset represented a
                    branch of the royal family which was of doubtful legitimacy, that of the natural
                    children of John of Gaunt, who had been legitimated by Parliament, but whose
                    position as regarded the royal succession was not clear.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The case of the Beaufort family, earls and
                    dukes of Somerset, is clearly stated by Lingard, iii. 357. The original patent
                    of 1397 did not in so many words except the succession to the crown, but it did
                    so by implication, by making the persons legitimated capable of all dignities
                    short of the crown, but making no mention of the crown itself. In the later
                    copies the crown was expressly excepted.</p></note> In 1450 a popular
                    insurrection under Jack Cade, who called himself Mortimer, might pass for a sign
                    that the claims of that family were not forgotten. The duke of Suffolk,
                    impeached by the Commons, but not sentenced by the Lords, had been irregularly
                    put to death. Somerset now remained as the unpopular minister, while Richard of
                    York was the leader of a popular opposition. The birth of the king’s only son in
                    1453 took away the duke’s hope of a peaceful succession, and in 1455 the civil
                    war began.</p>
                <p>The war of York and Lancaster, like the great war with France, with its
                    occasional lulls and truces, must be looked on as really lasting,
                    notwithstanding reconciliations, restorations, and momentary reigns, from the
                    time when the sword was first drawn against Henry VI. to the time when it was
                    last drawn against Henry VII. One thing is to be noted throughout, that, after
                    every revolution, a parliament was always found ready to condemn the defeated
                    side, and to acknowledge the rights of the conqueror. Thus, in the early stage
                    of the war, the duke of York was attainted in 1459. In 1460 the victory of
                    Northampton put him in a position to make good his claim to the crown. A
                    compromise was brought about by the Lords, which sounds as if it had been
                    suggested by the treaty of Troyes. By their award it was agreed that Henry
                    should keep the crown for life, but that the duke should displace the king’s son
                    in the rank of heir apparent. Such an award implied the admission of the new
                    doctrine of absolute hereditary right in its extremest form. At the same time,
                    it saved the personal rights of the crowned king to whom the claimant had sworn
                    allegiance. But this settlement on paper had no practical effect. The queen and
                    the lords of her party disregarded it. In 1460 Duke Richard fell at Wakefield,
                    and his claims passed to his son Edward. The compromise was now set aside on
                    both sides. Henry had joined, or had been made to join, the queen’s forces after
                    the victory of Wakefield. The Yorkist doctrine was that, by so doing, he had
                    broken the award, and had thereby forfeited the crown, which therefore passed to
                    Edward. The claims of Edward were confirmed by a kind of popular election in
                    London. After his crowning victory at Towton followed his coronation, and a
                    fresh parliamentary settlement, which declared the victor of Agincourt an
                    usurper. The reign of Edward IV. is now held to begin; but the war was not yet
                    over. Margaret sought help in Scotland and France, and Scottish help was bought
                    by the surrender of Berwick. The war began again in 1463, and this stage of it
                    maybe looked on as ended by the Yorkist victory at Hexham in 1464. The next year
                    Henry was captured. But by this time Edward had taken a step which led to the
                    estrangement of his most powerful supporters. His marriage with one of his
                    subjects, Elizabeth Grey, and the growing influence of her family <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, the Woodvilles, began to offend the house of
                    Neville, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n347/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0347-0328"/> and its head Richard earl of λVarwick. After a
                    series of almost unintelligible intrigues and insurrections, Edward was in 1470
                    driven out of the kingdom by an union between Warwick and the king’s own
                    brother, George duke of Clarence. Henry VI. was now taken from prison and again
                    declared king. The crown was settled by parliament on him and his son, with
                    remainder to Clarence. But in the next year Edward came back; Clarence again
                    changed sides, and the crown was secured to Edward by the fights of Barnet and
                    Tewkesbury. At Tewkesbury Edward the son of Henry was killed; the death—we may
                    feel sure that it was the murder—of Henry himself followed. The legitimate male
                    line of Lancaster was now extinct; no descendant of any one of the son3 of Henry
                    IV. survived. There were foreign princes descended from John of Gaunt in the
                    female line, and among them the famous Charles duke of Burgundy, who seems,
                    among the other objects of his ambition, to have sometimes dreamed of the
                    English crown for himself. Such claims were not likely to meet with any support
                    in England; and Edward, by a stroke of real policy, won Charles to his side by
                    the hand of his sister Margaret, and found shelter at his brother-in-law’s court
                    during his exile. In England the hopes of the Lancastrian party now turned in a
                    new direction, to legitimated descendants of John of Gaunt of the house of
                    Somerset. That house also was extinct in the male line; its representative was
                    Margaret, countess of Richmond. Her young son, Henry Tudor, earl of Richmond,
                    was now, in the lack of any better claimant, looked on as the heir of Lancaster.
                    It is needless to say that no genealogical subtlety could be held to give him
                    any share in the royalty which the choice of the nation had conferred on the
                    line of Henry IV. But something of the sentiment of royal descent might be held
                    to have come to Henry in a strange way through his father’s mother. She was no
                    other than Katharine of France, the widow of Henry V., who married a Welshman
                    named Owen Tudor, in whose descendants the crown of England passed, by a strange
                    genealogical accident, to the ancient stock of Britain.</p>
                <p>For the remaining twelve years of his life Edward IV. reigned without any
                    important disturbance at home. But the members of the house of York had already
                    begun to turn one against another. The validity of Edward’s marriage, and
                    therefore the legitimacy of his children, was doubtful. Clarence was in any case
                    the next in succession after them, while, by the statute passed during Henry’s
                    second reign, he had a claim before Edward himself. In 1478 this dangerous
                    brother was condemned in parliament on a vague charge of treason; and he
                    presently died, though not by any public execution. The latter years of Edward
                    IV. were taken up chiefly with foreign policy and foreign war, both of which
                    were on rather a small scale. A Scottish war from 1480 to 1482 is remarkable for
                    the recovery of Berwick. In continental politics Edward was specially busy. His
                    policy took largely the form of planning foreign marriages for his children,
                    none of which were carried into effect. Even before he was driven out in 1470,
                    he was trying to form alliances against France, especially with Charles of
                    Burgundy. But, though Charles sheltered Edward in his exile, he gave him no real
                    support when in 1475 he actually began an invasion of France. Edward, as well as
                    Charles, was outwitted by Lewis XI. The king and his counsellors went home,
                    without glory or conquest, but with large bribes of French money.</p>
                <p>The death of Edward in 1483 again, nominally at least, gave the crown to a minor,
                    Edward, the eldest son of the late king. The suspicions which had been vaguely
                    raised against John of Gaunt during the minority of Richard II. became realities
                    in the case of the ambitious uncle of Edward V. This was Richard duke of
                    Gloucester, the youngest son of Richard duke of York, who was declared protector
                    of the young king. His protectorate was marked by the illegal slaughter of
                    several of the lords of the party of the queen mother. Presently Richard’s own
                    adherents claimed the crown for him. The claim was based on the alleged
                    invalidity of Edward IV. ’s marriage. Some ventured on the more improbable
                    scandal that neither Edward nor Clarence was really a son of Duke Richard, and
                    that Richard of Gloucester was his only real representative. A more decent
                    argument was found in the attainder of George of Clarence, which, it was held,
                    shut out his children from the succession. An irregular kind of election, which
                    however professed to be made by the estates of the realm, called on Richard to
                    assume the crown. He was crowned instead of his nephew; and there can be little
                    doubt that both Edward and his brother Richard duke of York were made away with,
                    like Arthur in earlier days, at the bidding of their uncle. The ancient custom
                    of England would have spared all these crimes. Richard, who had in other
                    respects many of the qualities of a good ruler, would doubtless have been chosen
                    on the death of his brother. As it was, his crown was at once threatened by
                    Henry of Richmond, who now passed for the representative of the house of
                    Lancaster. The aim of his party was to marry him to Elizabeth, daughter of
                    Edward IV., who now represented the more regular succession of the house of
                    York. Richmond was in banishment in Britanny. The first attempts of himself and
                    his partisans were crushed. At this stage of our history everything turns on
                    marriages and genealogies. The deaths of Richard’s queen Anne Neville and his
                    son Edward open a new stage in the tale. John earl of Lincoln, the son of the
                    king’s sister Elizabeth duchess of Suffolk, was now declared the presumptive
                    heir. But Richard now designed a marriage with his own niece Elizabeth, to which
                    she and her mother seem to have consented. This plan hastened the schemes of
                    Richmond. He landed, raised an army, and, helped by the treachery of the
                    Stanleys and Percies, he overthrew Richard at Bosworth, August 22, 1485. Henry
                    was crowned, and a parliament settled the crown on him and the heirs of his
                    body, and none other. The new king clearly wished that his claims should be in
                    no way dependent on his intended marriage with Elizabeth. Parliament, on the
                    other hand, was clearly unwilling to give its formal sanction either to a right
                    of conquest or to Henry’s strange hereditary claim. Henry, in short, reigned by
                    a parliamentary title, by an election which followed his coronation. In the next
                    year however he carried out his promise of marrying Elizabeth; and, before the
                    end of the year 1486, the birth of his eldest son, who, as the son of the first
                    British king of England, received the name of Arthur, seemed to put the
                    succession on a sure ground.</p>
                <p>We are apt to look on Henry VII. as the founder of a dynasty, and on his reign as
                    marking the beginning of a new aera. Both views are true; but they must not be
                    allowed to put out of sight the fact that, till quite the end of his reign, his
                    throne was as insecure as that of any of his predecessors. The civil wars were
                    not yet ended; in foreign lands Henry was looked on as a mere adventurer, who
                    had won the crown by the chances of one battle, and who was likely to lose what
                    he had won by the chances of another. Hence he was, like Edward IV. in th¾same
                    case, specially anxious to establish his position among foreign princes. To
                    obtain, as he did at last, an infanta for his son, even to give his daughter to
                    the king of Scots, were in his view important objects of policy. But those
                    objects were not attained till after he had strengthened his position at home by
                    successfully withstanding more than one enemy.</p>
                <p>The revolts against Henry began early. Before the birth of his son, he had to
                    crush the first insurrection of Lord! Lovell. The next year enemies arose
                    against him in '</p>

                <p>Ireland. There the rule of the elder duke of York had been popular, and the
                    Yorkist party had always been the stronger. A claimant appeared, one Lambert
                    Simnel, who professed to be Edward earl of Warwick, son of George duke of
                    Clarence, the male representative of the house of York. Edward was indeed alive
                    in the Tower, and was shown in public to prove the imposture. Yet Simnel was
                    crowned in Ireland, and was presently supported by John earl of Lincoln, who had
                    been himself declared heir presumptive under Richard. The impostor and his
                    partisans landed in England, and weιe overthrown at Stoke-upon-Trent. In 1492
                    another and more dangerous claimant, who professed to be Richard duke of York,
                    the son of Edward IV., and whose real name was understood to be Perkin Warbeck,
                    appeared also in Ireland. His cause was taken up by more than one foreign
                    potentate, by James IV., king of Scots, and by Margaret, the duchess dowager of
                    Burgundy, who, if he was what he pretended to be, was his own aunt. He made more
                    than one attempt at invasion, some of them in company with the king of Scots.
                    Meanwhile, early in 1497, the men of Cornwall rose and marched as far as
                    Blackheath, close to London. There they were defeated; but when, a few months
                    later, Perkin landed in Cornwall, he found enough support there to besiege
                    Exeter. But he shrank from a battle with the royal army; he submitted to the
                    king, and was put to death in the next year, 1499. Immediately afterwards
                    followed the beheading of Edward of Warwick. From this time, for the last ten
                    years of his reign, Henry reigned in safety.</p>
                <p>The wars with France still lingered on, and in 1492 Henry had actually undertaken
                    the siege of Boulogne. The enterprise was however ended by a treaty of peace.
                    After Henry’s throne was secured by the deaths of Perkin and of Edward of M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi> arwick, his European position speedily rose. In 1501
                    Katharine of Aragon was married to Arthur, and, on his death in the next year,
                    she was contracted to his younger brother Henry. Earlier in this year, 1502, a
                    treaty of peace was concluded with Scotland, which was followed in 1503 by the
                    marriage of James king of Scots and Henry’s elder daughter Margaret. This marks
                    an aera in the relations between England and Scotland. Up to this time, ever
                    since the enterprise of Edward Balliol, there had been constant warfare,
                    interrupted only by truces. Now, for the first time, a peace, strictly so
                    called, was concluded. All claims either to the crown of Scotland or to a
                    superiority over it on the part of England must be looked on as being finally
                    given up. There was still more than one war between England and Scotland before
                    the union of the crowns; but the state of constant warfare broken only by truces
                    now comes to an end.</p>
                <p>In 1509 Henry VII. died. His eldest surviving son, Henry VIII., who now united
                    the claims of York and Lancaster, succeeded without a breath of opposition. He
                    was the first king since Richard II. who reigned by an undisputed title; and he
                    was, strangely enough, the last king who was formally elected in ancient fashion
                    in the ceremony of his coronation. With him, rather than with his father, a new
                    period opens; or, more accurately still, the new period opens with the second
                    period of Henry VII. ⅛ reign, after all opposition to his title had passed away.
                    When the first Tudor king felt himself safe, the Tudor despotism began. Under
                    the second Tudor king that despotism allied itself with ecclesiastical change,
                    and the sixteenth century put on its most characteristic aspect.</p>
                <p>It was during this period that England came within the range of those general
                    causes of change which were now beginning to affect all Europe. The revival of
                    learning, as it is called, was now spreading from Italy into other lands. The
                    three great inventions which in the course of the fifteenth century affected the
                    general state of mankind, gunpowder, printing, and the compass, began in the
                    course of the second half of that century to do their work on England also. The
                    Wars of the Roses differ widely, in their military character, from the civil
                    wars of earlier times. The personal displays of chivalry in the field, as well
                    as the older style of fortification, both became useless before the new engines
                    of destruction. But, above all things, it was during this time that, in most
                    parts of Europe, the chief steps were taken towards that general overthrow of
                    ancient liberties which reached its highest growth in the sixteenth century.
                    Europe was massing itself into a system of powers, greater in extent and smaller
                    in number, than heretofore. The masters of these powers were learning a more
                    subtle policy in foreign affairs than those who went before them, and they were
                    beginning to rest their trust at home on standing armies. We have reached the
                    time of Lewis XI. and of Ferdinand of Aragon. While France had grown by the
                    annexation of nearly all its vassal states, and of some states which were not
                    its vassals, the new power of Spain was growing up, to develop in the next
                    period into the gigantic dominion of the house of Austria. Italy, with the mass
                    of its small commonwealths grouped together among a few larger states, some
                    princely, some republican, becomes during this age the battlefield of the rival
                    powers. This new state of things was not without its influence on England,
                    though our insular position saved us from being so completely carried away as
                    the continental nations. The power of the crown grew to a pitch which was
                    altogether unknown at any earlier time except under the Conqueror and his
                    immediate successors. Parliaments become more servile; sometimes they are
                    dispensed with altogether. Arbitrary acts on the part of the crown are perhaps
                    not more common than in earlier times; but they take a new character. When law
                    is generally weak and is easily broken, the king’s breaches of the law do not
                    seem very different from breaches of the law on the part of other men. When the
                    king has become powerful enough to enforce the law on other men, but fails to
                    observe the law in his own acts, the fault is of another kind. It is no longer
                    general lawlessness, but deliberate arbitrary rule.</p>
                <p>It was to this state of things that England was tending during the whole of this
                    time. The stir of civil war alternated with the repose of despotism. It might
                    almost be said that the two went on side by side; for the Wars of the Roses were
                    not a period of anarchy like the wars of Stephen and Matilda. The crown was
                    fought for by contending princes at the head of great armies; but there was
                    little or nothing of the wasting local and personal warfare of the earlier time.
                    Except where the actual strife was waging, things went on much as usual. The
                    king in possession was obeyed wherever his enemies were not in military
                    occupation. After each revolution a parliament was ready to approve the change,
                    to acknowledge the conqueror, to regulate the succession according to his
                    pleasure, and commonly to attaint the defeated prince and his supporters. It
                    marks that the age of revolution was drawing to an end when the famous statute
                    of Henry VII. declared that no man would be called in question for adhering to a
                    king in possession, be his title good or bad. The care taken by every claimant
                    of the crown to obtain a parliamentary acknowledgment of his right was at once a
                    homage paid to the formal authority of parliaments and a heavy blow struck at
                    their moral weight. The parliaments of this time were fast losing the spirit of
                    the elder parliaments. The number of the temporal lords was lessened by battles,
                    executions, and banishments. The spiritual lords had become more thoroughly
                    servants of the crown than at any time since the twelfth century. The lower
                    house had also undergone a change. In one sense <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n349/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0349-0330"/> its position had risen. The place of
                    representative of a city or borough was now sought for by men who were not
                    actual citizens or burgesses. And, owing to the restrictive statute of Henry VI.
                    and to the change in the constitutions of the boroughs, both knights and
                    burgesses were now chosen by less popular constituencies than those who chose
                    them in earlier times, Yet, low as parliaments had fallen from their ancient
                    standard, they still kept virtue enough for kings to dread them. Every king of
                    this age who deemed himself safe on his throne tried to reign without a
                    parliament. During the first reign of Edward IV., parliament met, formally at
                    least, with one exception, every year. In the latter part of his reign five
                    years passed without a parliament. So it was with Henry VII. Parliaments were
                    frequent while insurrections were frequent. The last-eleven years of Henry’s
                    reign saw only a single parliament. On the other hand, Richard III., whose
                    throne was not safe during a moment of his short reign, was the least
                    unconstitutional king of this period. He had time only for a single parliament,
                    but that was a parliament rich in legislation, and which passed one great law
                    restraining a special abuse of royal power. Edward IV., in the times when he
                    dispensed with parliaments, brought in a practice of gathering what were called
                    <hi rend="italic">benevolences,</hi> gifts to the crown which were nominally
                    freewill offerings, but which it was dangerous for the subject to refuse. These
                    benevolences were expressly declared illegal by the statute of Richard. But
                    Richard himself broke his own law; and later kings found it convenient to follow
                    his practice rather than his legislation. And when the statute of Richard was
                    quoted against them, they were not ashamed to plead that the act of the usurper
                    was of itself null.</p>
                <p>This then was the time of trial for England and her liberties. She and they were
                    now full grown, and their strength had to be proved. Her probation went on for
                    more than two hundred years; but now it began. In the end the nation and its
                    liberties proved too strong for the kings. Parliaments were bullied, packed, and
                    corrupted; their sittings were stopped for years together; but they were never
                    abolished. The great laws which secured freedom were often broken, but they were
                    never repealed or set aside. At the beginning of this period the distinction
                    between an absolute and a limited monarchy was as clearly drawn out by a
                    minister of Henry VI. as it could be by any modern political writer. And, if the
                    practice did not always conform to the model traced by Sir John Fortescue, the
                    law always did. The old principles of freedom were never so utterly forgotten,
                    never so utterly trodden under foot, that they could not be called to life again
                    when the favourable moment came. In this, it is plain, the history of England
                    differs from the history of France, of Spain, of most continental countries. And
                    certainly one reason for the difference was that they were continental
                    countries, while England is insular. Constant rivalries, constant warfare with
                    immediate neighbours, gave better pretexts for the maintenance of standing
                    armies than could be found in England. The only immediate neighbour of England
                    was Scotland. And the wars with Scotland, though working constant damage to the
                    border shires, were not so dangerous to the kingdom in general that either
                    prince or people would have dreamed of keeping up a standing army on their
                    account. And, after Henry VII.’s treaty, war with Scotland ceased to be the
                    regular state of things. Our kings therefore, without a standing army, could not
                    utterly root out freedom as their continental brethren did. In the worst times
                    they were driven to summon parliaments from time to time, and those parliaments
                    now and then showed traces of the old spirit. Still from this time onward the
                    administration becomes highly arbitrary. The king and his council were guilty of
                    constant illegal interference with the liberty of the subject. The court of
                    Star-Chamber, an offshoot from the Privy Council and so from the old <hi
                    rend="italic">curia</hi><hi rend="italic">regis,</hi> though sometimes useful in
                    punishing offenders who were too strong for the ordinary course of law, became a
                    terrible engine of oppression. It is characteristic of the time that judicial
                    torture, unknown at all times to English law, and unknown to English practice at
                    all times before the fifteenth century and after the seventeenth, now began to
                    be freely used. But it was used in every case by a special and illegal exercise
                    of prerogative. No man was ever tortured to extort confession in any of the
                    regular courts of English law.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Torture strictly so called, torture to bring the prisoner to
                    confess, was never known to English law. It must not be confounded either with
                    the painful form of death which formed the penalty of treason, or with the <hi

                    plead.</p></note></p>
                <p>The age which brought in the rack could hardly fail to be a merciless age. In
                    fact the civil struggles of each age had, from the twelfth century onwards, been
                    getting more and more bloodthirsty. During the Wars of the Roses each
                    revolution, each battle, was followed by something that might be called a
                    massacre, by a general slaughter of the leading men on both sides. On the other
                    hand, the slaughter was mainly confined to the leading men. But the murders or
                    executions wrought at every stage of these wars undoubtedly had a political
                    effect in lessening the numbers of the old nobility to a degree which mere
                    slaughter in battle could never have done. In this age too began the general
                    practice of attainder by Act of Parliament. That is, a man is placed by a
                    legislative act in the same position as if he had been convicted after a regular
                    trial. This process was now freely used, not only against the living, but
                    sometimes against the dead. The main object in the latter case was of course the
                    confiscation of the estate of the attainted person. It at first sight seems
                    singular that the man who stands out as the foremost actor in the cruelties of
                    this time was the man who was also foremost as a scholar and patron of learning.
                    This was John Tiptoft, earl of Worcester, who in the one character was bewailed
                    by Caxton, while in the other he gained the popular surname of the Butcher. But
                    Tiptoft brought his learning from Italy; he was in fact the first-fruits of the
                    Italian <hi rend="italic">Renaissance</hi> in England. And the Italian <hi
                    rend="italic">Renaissance,</hi> if it was a school of taste and learning, was
                    hardly a school of either justice or mercy. Arbitrary power cruelly exercised
                    can easily exist alongside of learning and refinement. This truth England began
                    to learn in the present period. It learned it yet more thoroughly in the
                    next.'</p>
                <p>The Italian studies of the earl of Worcester were certainly not shared by many of
                    the contemporary nobles. Yet before this time, Humfrey duke of Gloucester had
                    appeared as a patron of learning, and the foundation of colleges in both
                    universities went on through the whole of the fifteenth century. But the new
                    learning, as it was called, that wider field of study of which Greek learning
                    was the most easily recognized outward badge, hardly took root in England till
                    quite the end of this period, under Henry VII. Caxton had already begun to print
                    under Edward IV., at a time when the native literature of England had sunk lower
                    than it ever sank before or after. Yet signs were not wanting that the practice
                    of writing, and writing in English, was now widely spread. The Paston Letters,
                    which let us into the inmost life of a knightly family of Norfolk, are worth any
                    amount of courtly Latin. But they are hardly literature. Mediaeval art too now
                    entered on its latest phase immediately before its final overthrow. The
                    architectural style of this time loses the aspiring lines of earlier times, and
                    gives us instead a lavishness and intricacy of ornament, such as we see at St
                    George’s at Windsor and in Henry VII.’s chapel <pb break="no"

                    still for the most part pure. It is in tombs and woodwork that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Renaissance</hi> details first creep in, and that hardly till the
                    reign of Henry VIII. But, just at the end of this period and the beginning of
                    the next, English domestic architecture reached its highest perfection. Houses
                    had now quite outstripped the alternatives of the period immediately before,
                    when the choice lay between the fortress and the simple manor-house. In the
                    latter part of the fifteenth century and the beginning of the sixteenth, we come
                    to palaces, as distinguished from castles. Vast houses arose, where
                    fortification was quite secondary or in truth had come to be a mere survival,
                    and where we see the true English style just before it became corrupted. From
                    Haddon Hall the series goes on, till in days which chronologically belong to our
                    next period, we get such piles as Cowdray, Hampton Court, aud the unfinished
                    castle of Thornbury. These are buildings of the reign of Henry VIII.; but the
                    architectural periods cannot be made exactly to fit in with the more obvious
                    divisions of our history. The buildings of Henry VIII.’s reign must be classed
                    with those of the fifteenth century, rather than with those of the latter half
                    of the sixteenth. The <hi rend="italic">Renaissance</hi> did not affect
                    architecture, as distinguished from furniture aud decorations, till the time of
                    Edward VI.</p>
                <p>While two of the three great discoveries were causing a revolution in the worlds
                    of warfare and literature, the third, the compass, was no less doing its work in
                    its own region. Under Edward aud Richard the commerce of England advanced
                    swiftly. From the north-western seas it was now spread over the whole
                    Mediterranean. At no time did it make greater advances than under Edward IV.,
                    who was a considerable merchant in his own person. In Henry VII.’s days the New
                    World was thrown open to the adventurers of the Old. As far as mere discovery
                    went, England had, before the end of the fifteenth century, her full share in
                    the work through the American discoveries of Sebastian Cabot. But, as far as
                    England was concerned, it was as yet mere discovery. The time for English
                    settlements beyond the ocean, or even for English enterprise in those distant
                    waters, had not yet come. The path towards them was shown, aud that was all.</p>
                <p>We have seen that the civil wars really end, and that the time of unrestrained
                    Tudor domination begins, in the middle of the reign of Henry VII. His later rule
                    was the rule of a despot, who strove as far as might be to reign without a
                    parliament. His desire to be independent of his people led to that rule of
                    grasping avarice which has caused his rule to be chiefly remembered for the
                    endless shifts by which his greed of money was satisfied. His reign is important
                    chiefly as leading the way to the more brilliant time which followed, a time
                    which can be understood only if we throw ourselves into the point of view from
                    which men looked upon it at the time. The next king, Henry VIII., began his
                    reign in two characters which at once marked it off from any reign since that of
                    Henry V., we might almost say from any reign since that of Edward III. After a
                    long time during which the strength of England had been wasted in deciding in
                    arms between rival pretenders to the crown, England had again a king whose title
                    was undisputed, and who led Englishmen to conquest beyond the sea. That was the
                    first aspect in which Henry VIII. appeared to England and to Europe. The real
                    historical characteristics of his reign are different. The special features of
                    his reign are the working of a despotism of a very peculiar kind, and the
                    application of that despotism to work a great ecclesiastical revolution. But,
                    though this last is the special characteristic of the age and the reign of
                    Henry, yet it did not become a characteristic of his reign till he had already
                    been many years on the throne. The acts which his name first suggests to the
                    popular mind, the suppression of monasteries and the beheading of wives, do
                    indeed effectually distinguish his reign from any other; but they are features
                    which belong to the latter years of his reign only. They no more make up the
                    whole of Henry’s reign than the Scottish wars make up the whole of the reign of
                    Edward I. During the gτeater part of Henry’s reign the characteristic feature of
                    the time seemed to be the unusually high place which England held in the general
                    affairs of Europe.</p>
                <p>There was much in the general character of the age which helped to give England
                    this special European importance. It was a transitional age; new ideas had come
                    in, but the old ideas had not been wholly forgotten. The powers of Europe were
                    now beginning to put on some approach to the shape and the relations to one
                    another which they kept down to very modern times. We have come to the beginning
                    of the long rivalry between France and the house of Austria. France had, on
                    different grounds, hereditary enmities both with the empire and with the houses
                    σf Burgundy and Aragon. The pretensions of the French kings to the kingdom of
                    Naples and the duchy of Milan were the chief cause of the long struggles in
                    Italy iu which all the neighbouring powers had their share. Henry stood apart,
                    and was eagerly sought by. all as ally or as arbiter. Here is a wholly new state
                    of things, the beginning of that wider system of European policy which deems
                    that no European state is wholly without interest in the affairs of any other.
                    We are on the road to the days of the doctrine of the balance of power. On the
                    other hand, the old enmity between England and France had not died out, nor had
                    the old grounds for that enmity been forgotten. The memories of the days of
                    Edward III. and Henry V. are at this time strangely mingled up with political
                    ideas which might be a century or two later. Henry is called in as the arbiter
                    of Italy and of Europe. He is the defender of the pope and the enemy of the
                    Turk. He dreams of the empire for himself, and of the papacy for his great
                    minister. Negotiations and changes of side are endless. Of the two successive
                    kings of Frauce, Lewis XII. and Francis I., he is alternately the friend and the
                    enemy. He has wars with both; yet he becomes the brother-in law of Lewis and the
                    sworn brother of Francis. When the empire and the powers of Castile, Burgundy,
                    and Aragon were all united in the person of Charles V., the old alliance between
                    England and Burgundy, and the far older alliance between England aud the empire,
                    united Charles and Henry for several years against Francis. Henry’s very failure
                    to obtain the imperial crown seems not so much to have embittered him against
                    the successful candidate as to have turned his thoughts towards the crown which
                    he professed to claim by hereditary right. From 1519 to 1525, Henry and his
                    imperial nephew seemed steady friends. From about this time till quite the end
                    of Henry’s reign, foreign affairs are almost sunk in the surpassing interest of
                    events at home. But, as those events depended on the divorce of the emperor’s
                    aunt, the friendship of England at this stage leaned to Francis against Charles.
                    But, amidst all these shiftings of friendship and enmity, the only real warfare
                    in which England either did or suffered anything was waged with the two old
                    enemies, France and her firm ally Scotland. The two periods of really active
                    warfare under Henry come at the two ends cf his reign. From 1512 to 1514 was a
                    time of war, a time of victory on the part of England. The one year 1513 saw the
                    defeat of the invading Scots at Flodden, and the conquest of Terouanne and
                    Tournay by the king of Englaud in person, with the emperor-elect as his ally,
                    almost as his mercenary. All this within the space of a few weeke seemed to
                    bring back the most triumphant days of Edward <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n351/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0351-0332"/> III. Again in 1522 and 1523 Scotland and France
                    were both successfully invaded. Eighteen years later, in 1541, the Scottish wars
                    began again; two years later England and the empire were again allied against
                    France and Scotland. In 1544 England was again successful over both enemies:
                    while the king in person took Boulogne, his brother-in-law burned Edinburgh and
                    laid waste Scotland, as far as came under his power, with a barbarity which can
                    certainly not be laid to the charge of Edward I. It is certain that England in
                    the end g lined nothing by either the negotiations or the warfare of tlιe reign
                    of Henry. But they are enough to account for the fact, which to us seems so
                    strange, that Henry was, on the whole, popular during his life, and that his
                    memory was cherished after his death. He was the last native king who in his own
                    person waged war, and that successful war, on the mainland. His victories were
                    useless; but they were victories; and, as such, they fed the national
                    imagination. After the dreary time of the civil wars, England again stood forth
                    as a great power, a conquering power, a power in some sort greater than it had
                    ever been before. To the conqueror much was forgiven in the way of wrong doing
                    at home. More still was forgiven to the king who at last accomplished the work
                    which Henry II. had begun but was not able to finish.</p>
                <p>The traditions of arbitrary power and unscrupulous shedding of blood had been
                    handed on to Henry by his predecessors, as far back as his Yorkist grandfather.
                    It was the peculiar direction which was given to ‘despotism and slaughter iu the
                    latter part of his reign which was wholly his own. The darkest side of Henry’s
                    character came more and more into prominence in his later years; but his rule
                    was arbitrary, aud on occasion bloody, from the beginning. He could from the
                    beginning put men to death, either to gratify a popular cry or to shield himself
                    from purely imaginary dangers. Empson and Dudley, the ministers of his father,
                    had fully deserved the hatred of the people; but their execution, almost the
                    first act of Henry’s reign, could be justified on no possible ground of law. In
                    the midst of Henry’s French wars, in 1521, Edward Stafford, duke of Buckingham,
                    was put to death, rather because his royal descent was deemed to make him
                    dangerous than on account of any proved crime. But, in these and in all Henry’s
                    acts, we see that attention to formal legality which is the special
                    characteristic of his reign. At no time, unless during the first years of the
                    Conquest, -was so much wrong done under legal form, and the Conqueror at least
                    did not send those whom he despoiled to the scaffold. It would be going a great
                    deal too far to say that all Henry’s acts could be justified by the letter of
                    the law of England; but it may be fairly said that he could always plead either
                    law or precedent. For his worst acts he was always able to show at least some
                    pretence of legal sanction; his tyranny never became a reign of mere violence.
                    In his days law emphatically became unlaw. Parliaments legislated as he thought
                    good; judges and juries gave such judgments and verdicts as he thought good;
                    and, when their action was too slow, parliament was ready to attaint, even
                    without a hearing, any one whom the king wished to destroy. When Henry’s mind
                    turned to ecclesiastical change, parliaments and convocations alike were ready
                    to shape the creed of the nation according to the caprice of its ruler. That
                    such a tyranny could in this way be carried out, never by mere force, often
                    under strict'y legal forms, makes the character both of the man and ol the time
                    a study of special interest. It is a time which specially deserves and needs an
                    historian.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The historian
                    has been found—though the history is not generally accessible, and is not
                    complete—in Mr Brewer, who has traced the story of a large part of Henry’s reign
                    in the Prefaces to the Calendars of State Papers. The general character of Henry
                    is well sketched by Hallam, who prophesies beforehand against some modern
                    delusions.</p></note> Here nothing more can be done than to trace its most
                    general features.</p>
                <p>The ecclesiastical work of Henry’s reign was not religious reformation in the
                    sense in which those words would have been understood by Wickliffe or Luther.
                    Henry now and then, in the endless shiftings of his course, looked in the
                    direction of the German Reformers, but it was rather for political than for
                    religious ends. One or two of his theological productions at one stage do indeed
                    show a slight Protestant tendency on one or two points.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As for instance, in the “Book of Articles,”
                    and the “Godly and Pious Institution of a Christian Man,” put forth in 1536.
                    Here is a certain amount of wavering as to the number of sacraments. That is
                    about the whole advance in a Protestant direction; the six articles of 1541
                    enforce the Roman theology on pain of death.</p></note> But this was only for a
                    moment; Henry’s later legislation went towards the establishment of the most
                    rigid orthodoxy, according to the Roman type, in all matters of dogma. To the
                    end of his days Henry and his prelates, Cranmer conspicuously among them, took
                    care to send to the flames any who swerved in the least degree from the received
                    doctrine of transubstantiation. Henry’s scheme was to carry out in its fulness
                    that after which earlier kings had so often striven, the complete emancipation
                    of England from the power of the Roman see, and the transfer of the highest
                    ecclesiastical jurisdiction to the crown In this he did little more than put
                    into a more distinct shape the authority which the Conqueror had exercised, and
                    which Henry II. had striven to win back. The ancient kings had allowed the
                    authority of the pope to be exercised only so far as they thought good; Henry
                    threw it off altogether. The acts of 1534, which swept away the Roman supremacy,
                    were the climax of the legislation which had been begun in the Constitutions of
                    Clarendon, and which had been carried on in the statutes of Provisors and of <hi
                    rend="italic">prae-</hi><hi rend="italic">munire.</hi> A few special points of
                    Henry’s legislation which were likely to give special offence lasted only during
                    his own reign and that of his son. Such were the title of. Head of the Church,
                    and that personal iurisdiction in ecclesiastical matters which Henry claimed to
                    exercise either by himself or though his vicar-general. Such again were the
                    commissions from the crown which were taken out by bishops under Henry and
                    Edward. These things formed no essential part of the royal supremacy. They were
                    abolished under Mary, and they were not re-established under Elizabeth. The
                    essence of the change which Henry wrought was the abolition of all foreign
                    jurisdiction within the island realm. And it must not be forgotten that, though
                    the Roman bishop was chiefly aimed at, the Roman emperor was aimed at also. It
                    was not without reason that the ancient imperial style of England now reappears.
                    Since the Conquest the use of that style had been rare, and the instances of its
                    use always mark some special need of the time. Its increased frequency under
                    Henry marks a special need of his time. When the imperial power was in the hands
                    of Charles V., and when Charles V. was an enemy, it was not without reason that
                    it was declared that the kingdom of England was an empire, and that its crown
                    was an imperial crown. Separation from the see of Rome was not meant to carry
                    with it any change of doctrine, or to imply any breach of communion with the
                    Churches which remained in the Roman obedience. It was strictly a scheme .of
                    ecclesiastical independence, and no more. But the acts of Henry put on a
                    peculiar character from the circumstances which led to his ecclesiastical
                    changes, and from the way in which many of them were carried out. And, when
                    ecclesiastical change had once begun, it could not fail to ally itself with
                    other influences, however little such alliance formed any part of the scheme of
                    Henry himself. «</p>

                    stand quite separate. Practically the two form two stages in a great series of
                    cause and effect. The system of Henry has been epigrammatically described as
                    Popery without the Pope. And the experience of a few years showed that Popery
                    without the Pope was a visionary scheme. But the various stages which are often
                    confounded under the one name of “the Reformation” must be carefully
                    distinguished. There was not in England, as there was in some foreign countries,
                    a particular act of a particular year which might fairly be called “the
                    Reformation.” In England, if the formula “The Reformation” has any meaning at
                    all, it means the whole period of ecclesiastical change which was spread over a
                    time of about forty years. It was a time of constant change, of change backwards
                    and forwards; its result was that, by the middle of the reign of Elizabeth,
                    there was an established state of things wholly different from the established
                    state of things which there had been in the middle of the reign of Henry VIII.
                    But in the development of the ecclesiastical constitution of England, just as in
                    the development of her political constitution, there was no moment when an old
                    state of things was altogether swept away, and when a wholly new stateof things
                    was set up in its place. The ecclesiastical development was far swifter, far
                    more violent, than the political development, but the two were essentially of
                    the same kind. Both were brought about by the gradual working of causes and
                    their effects. As the· political development of England was something wholly
                    unlike the violent change of the French Revolution, so the ecclesiastical
                    development of England was wholly unlike the violent change of the Reformation
                    in the Swiss Protestant cantons.</p>
                <p>The English Reformation then, including in that name the merely ecclesiastical
                    changes of Henry as well as the more strictly religious changes of the next
                    reign, was not in its beginning either a popular or a theological movement. In
                    this it differs from the Reformation in many continental countries, and
                    especially from the Reformation in the northern part of Britain. The Scottish
                    Reformation began much later; but, when it began, its course was far swifter and
                    fiercer. That is to say, it was essentially popular and essentially theological.
                    The result was that, of all the nations which threw off the dominion of the
                    Roman see, England, on the whole, made the least change, whilst Scotland
                    undoubtedly made the most.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>On the whole, because, in some points of sacramental doctrine and ritual,
                    the Lutheran Churches, especially in Sweden, have made less change than the
                    Church of England has. ' But nowhere did the general ecclesiastical system go on
                    with so little change as it did in England.</p></note> In England change began
                    from above. But there is no reason to doubt that the acts with which the period
                    of change began received the general approbation of the nation. It is plain that
                    there was no general desire among Englishmen for strictly theological change.
                    The old Lollard teaching, which had never quite died out, began to be of
                    increased importance in the early days of Henry. There can belittle doubt that
                    this revival of strictly theological dissent was part of the same general
                    movement which gave life to the new learning. But the men of the new learning,
                    the English friends of Erasmus, Colet and More, with their patron Archbishop
                    Warham, were not, strictly speaking, theological reformers. They aimed at
                    general enlightenment and at the reform of practical abuses and superstitions;
                    but they designed no change in dogma or ritual. Their more strictly intellectual
                    movement merged in the wider theological movement; but in the beginning they
                    were so far distinct that the author of <hi rend="italic">Utopia</hi> showed
                    himself in the strangely incongruous character of a persecutor. The small party
                    of theological reform undoubtedly welcomed the changes of Henry, as being likely
                    in the end to advance their own cause; but the mass of the nation was
                    undoubtedly favourable to Henry’s system of Popery without the Pope. For three
                    hundred years the pope had been the standing grievance of Englishmen, and they
                    were now rejoiced to get rid of him altogether. They were glad too to get rid of
                    gross practical abuses, to reform the corruptions and oppressions of the
                    ecclesiastical jurisdiction, to bring the clergy thoroughly under the power of
                    the law. But they were attached to their old religious customs and ceremonies,
                    and they had no love for new dogmas. In all this Henry and the mass of his
                    people went heartily together. There were of course dissentients on both sides,
                    men who wished for no change at all and men who wished for far greater changes.
                    But there can be no doubt that the mass of the nation was satisfied with what
                    their king gave them, ecclesiastical independence without theological change. On
                    these points, the great body of Henry’s statesmen and prelates were of one mind.
                    Cranmer and Gardiner accepted and carried out the same system. We can discern
                    then, as at all other times, two parties with opposite tendencies; but they are
                    merely opposite tendencies; there is no open breach. We are tempted to think
                    that there was from the beginning an organized Catholic and an organized
                    Protestant party.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These
                    names are used, without any attempt at theological accuracy, as those which will
                    most generally be understood, to point out the two opposite tendencies which at
                    this stage were no more than tendencies.</p></note> But this is the idea of a
                    later time. The mass of the nation and the great body of the leading men were
                    substantially of one mind. There was a party favourable to more change and a
                    party favourable to less, but both accepted the degree of change that was given
                    them. A few zealots were embowelled for denying the supremacy; a few zealots
                    were burned for denying transubstantiatiυn. The great body of the nation, the
                    great body of its representatives and its leaders, accepted transubstantiation
                    and the supremacy together. Nor is there any need to charge either Cranmer or
                    Gardiner with hypocrisy. No broad line was yet drawn, such as was drawn
                    afterwards. Men obeyed and administered the ecclesiastical law, though they
                    might wish it to be in some things different, just as men in all ages have
                    obeyed and administered the temporal law, though they may have in some things
                    wished it to be different. In truth Cranmer and Gardiner alike were trying to
                    work a system which could not be permanently worked. They were trying to
                    reconcile two things which could not be permanently reconciled. At last it
                    became clear that Popery without the Pope would not work, and that men must take
                    one side or the other. When it came to this, men in the position of Cranmer and
                    Gardiner had to choose a side, and they chose opposite sides. Still, among all
                    changes, under Henry, under Edward, under Mary, under Elizabeth, the mass of the
                    nation conformed to every change. Again there is no need to charge them with
                    hypocrisy. They obeyed the law, whether wholly approving it or not. A few on
                    each side had consciences so susceptible that they deemed it their duty to defy
                    the law. Among the mass of the nation some might be inclined one way and some
                    another; but they felt no call to court martyrdom on either side.</p>
                <p>For it must be borne in mind throughout that as yet the idea of religious
                    toleration, though it had presented itself to the mind of More as a matter of
                    philosophical speculation, was unknown in Europe in any practical shape.
                    Everywhere the dominant party, whichever it might be, forbade, and that in most
                    cases under pain of death, the practice of any religion except that of the
                    dominant party. Those who clave to the old religion forbade the practice of the
                    new; and the professors of the new doctrines, the moment they had the power,
                    forbade the practice of the old. So in England, through the whole period of
                    Reformation, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n353/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0353-0334"/> the existing system, whatever it was, was the
                    only system that was allowed. Every other form of worship was forbidden under
                    penalties, heavier or lighter. And there was always some form or degree of
                    theological error which sent its professors to the flames. And, besides burnings
                    for heresy, as heresy was understood at each successive stage, this period of
                    English history is especially distinguished for the cloaking of what was really
                    religious persecution under the guise of punishment for political offences.
                    During the reign of Henry, every man who would now be deemed a conscientious
                    Catholic was liable to die the death of a traitor. Every man who would now be
                    deemed a conscientious Protestant was liable to die the death of a heretic.
                    Under Edward and Elizabeth the standard of belief was changed, so changed that
                    only a few extreme sectaries were now in danger of the flames. But the
                    difference simply was that the line was drawn at a different point. Those who
                    went beyond that point were burned by those who a few years before might have
                    been burned themselves.</p>
                <p>For twenty years after his accession, Henry was famous, not only for strict
                    orthodoxy of dogma, but for special devotion to the Roman see. He had received a
                    learned education, and he believed himself to be a special master of theology.
                    His writings in that character, as a defender of Roman doctrine against Luther,
                    won him in 1521 the title of Defender of the Faith, which by a singular irony
                    was conferred by Leo X. Through all this first period of his reign, the series
                    of ecclesiastical statesmen still goes on. For fourteen years, from 1515 to
                    1529, ecclesiastical statesmanship was in truth at its highest pitch in the
                    person of Thomas Wolsey, archbishop, cardinal, and chancellor. During the
                    administration of this famous man, we are instinctively reminded of the joint
                    rule of an earlier Henry and an earlier Thomas; bill the fate of the two great
                    chancellors was widely different. No English minister before Wolsey, and few
                    after him, ever attained so great an European position. He dreamed of the
                    popedom, while his master dreamed of the empire. In his home administration
                    Wolsey carried out the policy which had become usual since Edward IV., and
                    summoned parliament as seldom as possible. On the other hand, his administration
                    of justice won the highest general confidence, and his hand was far from heavy
                    on the maintainers of the new religious doctrines. On the whole his position is
                    rather European than English. He is the minister of Henry in his earlier
                    character as warrior, conqueror, and arbiter of Europe. He is more like the
                    great cardinals who ruled in other lands than anything to which we are used in
                    England. The purely English work of Henry’s reign was done by the hands of men
                    of another kind. The aera of the lay statesmen now begins in the mightiest and
                    most terrible of their number, Thomas Cromwell. From this time the highest
                    offices are still occasionally held by churchmen, even as late as the middle of
                    the seventeenth century. But the holding of office by churchmen now becomes
                    exceptional; lay administration is the rule.</p>
                <p>There is no' need to go through the endless tale of Henry’s marriages, divorces,
                    and beheadings of wives, except so far as they have a political or
                    ecclesiastical bearing. The mere number of Henry’s wives is unparalleled in our
                    history, and has not many parallels in any history; and the king was, to say the
                    least, unlucky, who, out of six wives, found himself obliged to divorce two and
                    behead two others. But, even in these matters, the peculiar character of Henry’s
                    tyranny stands forth. Everything is done with some show of legal form. When he
                    wishes to get rid of a wife, or to exchange one wife for another, the first is
                    divorced or beheaded by some process which ’ has at least the show of legal
                    authority.</p>
                <p>“Non nisi legitime vult nubere.”</p>
                <p>Of all Henry’s doings in this way, the long story of the divorce of Katharine of
                    Aragon is the first, and the most remarkable in its historical bearings. We may
                    pass by details and points of controversy; but it is plain that the validity of
                    the marriage of Henry and Katharine was on any showing doubtful, and that doubts
                    had been from time to time raised on the point before the great controversy
                    arose. It is further plain that it was most desirable for the kingdom to have an
                    heir whose legitimacy could not be called in question. It is also plain that it
                    is quite in the character of Henry, if he w ished to get rid of Katharine and to
                    marry Anne, to seize upon every shadow either of political expediency or of
                    canonical subtlety which might help him to put a fair show on the course to
                    wflιich his own fancy led him. What he did he would do with some shadow of legal
                    right, even though such’shadow of legal right was to be had only by devising a
                    new jurisprudence, by upsetting the relations of Church and State as they were
                    then understood, by jeoparding the relations of his kingdoms with foreign
                    powers, and by shedding any amount of innocent blood, provided always that it
                    could be shed in legal form. It is enough for our purpose that Henry’s wish to
                    put Anne in the place of Katharine led to the endless disputes as to the
                    validity of Katharine’s marriage, and, as its first great result in England, to
                    the fall of the great cardinal in 1529, followed by his death in the next year.
                    Events now follow fast on one another. In 1531, by one of the meanest tricks
                    that ever king played, the whole estate of the clergy was held to have fallen
                    into a <hi rend="italic">praemunire</hi> by admitting the legat ine authority of
                    Wolsey, which he had exercised with the king’s full sanction. Their pardon was
                    bought only by an enormous subsidy, and by acknowledging the king as Supreme
                    Head on earth of the Church of England, a form of words now heard for the first
                    time. In 1532, when all hope of a favourable sentence from Rome had passed by,
                    Henry is believed to have privately married Anne. In 1533 the death of
                    Archbishop Warham made room for the promotion of Thomas Cranmer to the see of
                    Canterbury, a promotion which was still made by papal authority. The first act
                    of the new primate was to hold a court which declared the marriage of Katharine
                    null and the marriage of Anne lawful. Then camo the great legislation of the
                    year 1534. by which the papal authority was wholly abolished, while the Act of
                    Submission on the part of the clergy subordinated all ecclesiastical legislation
                    within the kingdom to the royal will. The succession to the crown was settled in
                    favour of the issue of Anne, to the exclusion of the issue of Katharine, and the
                    punishment of treason was denounced against all who refused to swear to the
                    succession so ordained. The title of Supreme Head of the Church, already voted
                    by the clergy, was now bestowed by parliament, and full ecclesiastical powers w
                    ere annexed to it. These powers were allowed to be exercised by deputy, and in
                    1535 Cromwell was made vicegerent for the king in ecclesiastical matters, with
                    precedence in the ecclesiastical convocation over ihe metropolitan himself. On
                    the other hand, a strict statute was passed for the suppression of heresy. The
                    scheme of Henry was now fully established; the religion of England was Popery
                    without the Pope.</p>
                <p>It was only in an indirect way that such a changeas this could give any
                    encouragement to the professors of the reformed doctrines. It was only in a
                    still more indirect way that it could tend to the establishment of religious
                    toleration or the acknowledgment of liberty of conscience. Still, however
                    indirectly, the first steps were now taken towards change in the received
                    doctrines of the Church, and towards the toleration of dissent from those
                    doctrines. So great a change could not fail to lead to further changes, and the
                    next six years of Henry’s reigu w ere a time in which all <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0354-0335"/> the influences at work were in the direction of
                    further change. It was the time of the administration of Cromwell, and of the
                    highest influence of Cranmer. The ' new state of things was ushered in by the
                    beheading of Sir Thomas More and of John Fisher, bishop of Rochester. No greater
                    mockery of all the forms of justice was ever done in any age or in any land. But
                    the execution of these two worthies calls for a special notice on account of the
                    great constitutional point which it involves. They were called on to swear both
                    to the succession to the crown, as settled on the issue of Anne, and also to the
                    preamble of the act which declared the marriage of Katharine invalid. This
                    latter oath involved a theological proposition of which their consciences
                    disapproved; to the succession they were perfectly ready to swear. That is to
                    say, More, the great thinker of his generation, utterly cast aside the whole
                    figment of hereditary right. In his view the children of Henry and Anne would be
                    illegitimate; but, in his view, it was within the power of parliament to settle
                    the ’crown on the king’s illegitimate children or on any persons whatsoever. To
                    the succession therefore, which was all that was of any practical moment, he
                    would swear; to a proposition which he held to be doctrinally false he would not
                    swear. On these grounds Henry sent his wisest and greatest subject to the
                    scaffold.</p>
                <p>Cromwell’s reign of terror, as it has been well called, now sets in. It is
                    specially remarkable for the constant use of acts of attainder, acts sometimes
                    passed without giving the accused person the opportunity of making any defence.
                    Not that in Henry’s reign a defence went for anything, even when the regular
                    forms of trial by a man’s peers were observed. It was deemed for the king’s
                    honour that those whom the king accused should be convicted, and the Lords or
                    the jury convicted accordingly. In more than one case, entries were found in
                    Cromwell’s papers, directing that such and such a person should be “tried and
                    executed.” Meanwhile new treasons and other crimes were invented. Martyrs were
                    made on both sides; the supposed traitor and the supposed heretic were sometimes
                    drawn to death on the same hurdle. Two of the martyrdoms of this period deserve
                    special notice. In one case at least, but seemingly in one only, the penalties
                    of heresy were held to attach to the denial of the king’s supremacy. For this
                    crime a friar, Forrest by name, was burned with special circumstances of brutal
                    mockery. On the other side, the case of Lambert in 1538 well illustrates both
                    the new jurisprudence and the peculiar position of some of the actors at the
                    time. The men who were afterwards burned themselves were the foremost in burning
                    others. Lambert was denounced by Taylor and Barnes, and condemned by Cranmer,
                    for the denial of transubstantiation. He appealed to the king in his character
                    of Head of the Church. Henry heard the cause in person, and, when his own
                    arguments and those of Cranmer failed to convince the heretic, he was sentenced
                    to the stake by the voice of Cromwell.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A modern writer thus comments on the death of Lambert :—“In
                    a country which was governed by law, not by the special will of a despot, the
                    supreme magistrate was neither able, nor desired, so long as a law remained
                    ∙unrepealed by parliament, to suspend the action of it.” This singular argument
                    forgets, among several other things, the royal prerogative of mercy.</p></note>
                    About the same time a general persecution took place of all who were guilty of
                    having the blood of kings in their veins. Margaret countess of Salisbury was the
                    daughter of George duke of Clarence, the mother of Reginald Pole. Pole was in
                    theology the very opposite to Henry. As the system of Henry was Popery without
                    the Pope, so Pole might be said to be inclined to the Pope without Popery. With
                    a distinct leaning to the Reformers on some strictly theological points, he was
                    a zealot for the papal supremacy. On this point, and on all the practical points
                    which flowed from it, Pole was a vigorous disputant against his royal kinsman.
                    But he was beyond the sea, safe from the grasp of Henry, Cromwell, or Cranmer.
                    The head of his aged mother, sentenced to die by act of attainder, paid the
                    penalty of his crime.</p>
                <p>This last deed of blood was specially Henry’s own. The attainder of the countess
                    was indeed passed while Cromwell was still in power, but she was not put to
                    death till after his fall. But the deaths of particular persons seem but a small
                    matter beside the great revolution which Cromwell wrought over the whole face of
                    the country by his great work of the suppression of the monasteries. This work
                    indeed incidentally supplied him with not a few personal victims. That the power
                    of the state was supreme, as over everything else, so over ecclesiastical
                    foundations, no man in England could doubt. Monasteries had been suppressed on
                    occasion from the earliest times. Special attention has been already called to
                    the suppression under Henry V.; and during Henry’s own reign Wolsey had
                    suppressed a considerable number of small monasteries to supply endowments for
                    his colleges at Ipswich and Oxford. A general suppression of all the monasteries
                    in the kingdom was clearly within the power of parliament, and strong reasons
                    might have been brought for such a course. We must however remember that at this
                    stage Protestant objections to the monastic life do not apply. Henry, while
                    destroying the monasteries, enforced the obligation of the chief monastic vow.
                    But it might well be argued that the number and wealth of these institutions
                    were excessive, that they had ceased to fulfil their original purposes, that on
                    any showing they needed a sweeping reform,· and that possibly reform could not
                    be carried out without suppression. For the measure itself then much might be
                    said. The way in which it was carried out was characteristic of Henry VIII. Mere
                    violence was inconsistent with his character; something of the form of law must'
                    be had. In 1536 the smaller monasteries were regularly suppressed by act of
                    parliament, a course against which nothing can be said. But the greater
                    monasteries were surrendered one by one into the king’s hands by their actual
                    occupants, an act of most doubtful legality. W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    here a surrender was refused, as at Reading, Colchester, and Glastonbury, the
                    abbots were ordered, according to Cromwell’s formula, to be “tried and executed”
                    on such charges as were thought good. In these cases, by a strange construction
                    of law, the monastery was held to fall by the attainder of its abbot. The
                    suppression was justified by the reports of visitors, which in most cases
                    charged the mcnks with crimes of various kinds. No one will believe that such a
                    report was either wholly true or wholly false; but it is to be noted that
                    monasteries which were reported to be wholly blameless, and for whose
                    preservation the visitors themselves pleaded, were suppressed with the rest. It
                    is to be further noted that, where abbots and priors surrendered easily, of
                    whatever crimes they had been accused, their compliance was rewarded either with
                    considerable pensions or with church preferment.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus the last abbot of Peterborough became
                    the first bishop, and the prior of St Andrews at Northampton, who, in the act of
                    surrender, had drawn a dark picture of the doings of himself and his monks,
                    became the first dean.</p></note> Of no monastery in England was a worse
                    character given than of the priory of Christ Church at Canterbury, that which
                    was attached to the metropolitan church. Yet, when that church was refounded as
                    a secular chapter, Henry and Cranmer chose most of the canons and other officers
                    of the church out of the body of men who had just before been branded with the
                    blackest crimes. In the suppression under Henry V., nearly the whole of the
                    confiscated revenues was applied to works of general <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n355/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0355-0336"/> usefulness, chiefly to the great educational
                    foundations which were then rising. In the suppression under Henry VIII., by far
                    the greater part of the vast revenues of the monastic houses was squandered or
                    gambled away among Henry’s courtiers. Churches and churchyards were granted to
                    private men, to be destroyed or desecrated at their pleasure. The tithe which
                    the monasteries had taken to themselves, to the great wrong of the parish
                    priests and their flocks, was now seized with their other property, and was
                    granted away to lay rectors. Cranmer, who gave up several estates of his see to
                    the king, did not scruple to receive grants of lands aud tithe for the
                    enrichment of his own family. Only a small portion of the monastic revenues was
                    saved for public purposes of any kind. A little was spent on the defence of the
                    coasts. Of a magnificent scheme for the foundation of new bishoprics, a small
                    part only was carried out in the foundation of six slenderly endowed sees. Those
                    cathedral churches which had been served by monks, and which therefore came into
                    the king’s hands with the other monasteries, were, with the exceptions of Bath
                    and Coventry, refounded as churches of secular canons. Henry also gained the
                    reputation of a benefactor in both universities. At Oxford his claim rests on
                    several suppressions and refouudations of the college which had been begun by
                    Wolsey, aud on his charging the chapters of Oxford and Westminster with the
                    maintenance of certain professors. At Cambridge the like reputation was gained
                    by rolling several small colleges into one large one. The statutes of Henry’s
                    various foundations, drawn up in some cases by his own hand, breathe a spirit of
                    piety and zeal worthy of Alfred or St Lewis. Here again there is no need to
                    suspect conscious hypocrisy. It only makes the character of Henry a more
                    wonderful moral study. Besides the suppression-of monasteries, a great deal of
                    wealth, to be squandered in the like sort, was brought in by the destruction of
                    shrines and by the seizure of the movable ornaments of many churches which were
                    not suppressed. On the other hand, most of the inmates of the suppressed
                    monasteries<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>All perhaps,
                    except the nuns of the lesser monasteries, who were sent away with only a gown
                    apiece.</p></note> received pensions, small in many cases, but enough for their
                    maintenance; and these pensions seem to have been honestly paid. With the usual
                    long life of annuitants, some of them still received their pensions in the reign
                    of James I.</p>
                <p>The foundations and refoundations just spoken of went on to the very end of
                    Henry’s reign. An Act of 1545 placed the secular foundations, the colleges and
                    hospitals, at his mercy; and he destroyed, refounded, or left untouched,
                    according to his pleasure. But the two great suppressions, the suppression of
                    the greater and of the esser monasteries, were all done under the rule of
                    Cromwell, and in his time came their immediate political results.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to say what was the general feeling of the nation towards the
                    suppressed monasteries. It doubtless differed widely in different places,
                    according to the character of particular houses. It is certain that in 1536 the
                    whole north of England rose in revolt on occasion of the suppression of the
                    lesser monasteries. This revolt, called the Pilgrimage of Grace, was distinctly
                    a religious movement; but it was a political movement as well. We seem to have
                    gone back to the days of Edward the Confessor, when we find the northern
                    insurgents demanding that no man north of Trent should be compelled to appear in
                    the ordinary course of justice anywhere but at York. They demanded also the
                    holding of a parliament at York, which Henry promised, but neglected· to summon.
                    The revolt began again, and it was suppressed with a large amount of hanging,
                    beheading, and burning of the abbots, lay lords, ladies, and others who were
                    concerned. A Lord President and Council of the North were now appointed to keep
                    that dangerous region in order.</p>
                <p>But after all, in Henry’s reign it is the marriages, the divorces, and the
                    beheadings of his several queens which form, if not the causes, at least the
                    occasions, of the greatest changes. Henry’s dissatisfaction with one marriage
                    had led to the fall of Wolsey and the rise of Cromwell; his dissatisfaction with
                    another marriage led to the fall of Cromwell himself. England and Europe had
                    been turned upside down in order that Henry might marry Anne Boleyn. Three years
                    after her marriage, she was got rid of by the twofold process of a divorce
                    pronounced by Cranmer which declared the nullity of her marriage, and of a
                    conviction for adultery by the House of Lords which implied its validity. Anne
                    was beheaded, and the next morning Henry, acting, as we have been told, from the
                    severest principles of public duty, married her maid Jane Seymour. It was now
                    made treasonable to assert the validity of Anne’s marriage, as before it had
                    been treasonable to deny it. Anne’s daughter Elizabeth was declared
                    illegitimate, as Katharine’s daughter Mary had been declared illegitimate, and
                    the crown was settled on the issue of Jane only. The new queen, by unusual good
                    luck, died, neither divorced nor beheaded, at the birth of her only child,
                    Henry’s only legitimate son, the future Edward VI. Except as regards the
                    succession of the crown, all this is little more than an episode. Henry’s fourth
                    marriage was of greater political importance. Katharine, Anne, and Jane had been
                    at least his own choice. Anne of Cleves was chosen for him by his vicegerent.
                    Her marriage was part of a political scheme for an union between Henry and the
                    Protestant princes of Germany against the emperor. Cromwell, it is plain, went
                    further than the king approved in advances towards these heretical allies, and
                    the queen whom he found for Henry among them found no favour in Henry’s eyes.
                    Cromwell had in fact chosen his time badly for any advances in a Protestant
                    direction. While his negotiations with the German princes were going on, the
                    statute of six articles was passed by the parliament of 1539, which enforced the
                    old belief under the deadliest penalties. The marriage took place at the very
                    beginning of 1540. In the course of the year Cromwell was created Earl of Essex,
                    arrested, attainted without a hearing, and beheaded. In the interval between his
                    attainder and his execution, the marriage which he <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> had brought about was annulled by convocation, and on the day of his
                    beheading Henry married his fifth wife, Katharine Howard.</p>
                <p>The administration of Cromwell, remarkable as it is in other ways, derives its
                    greatest constitutional importance from the new relations between crown and
                    parliament which now begin. Wolsey, after the example of Edward IV. and Henry
                    VII., had shrunk from meeting the assembly of the nation. Under his rule
                    parliaments were summoned as seldom as might be. Cromwell, on the other hand,
                    never feared to face parliament. From the time of his accession to power till
                    the end of Henry’s reign, parlia ments were constantly held. And from this time,
                    a practice which had been already followed sometimes rose into special
                    importance. The king’s powers of prorogation and dissolution of parliament now
                    come into notice. The early parliaments met; they did the business.for which
                    they were summoned, and then they went home again. The prolongation of the life
                    of the assembly beyond the time of its session was not thought of. Each meeting
                    implied a new election of the House of Commons. But it was gradually found that
                    a parliament which suited the king’s purposes might be kept in being by
                    prorogations . from one session to another. This practice began to be &lt; used
                    under Henry VI. and Edward IV., in which last <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    reign the practice became usual; under Henry VHL <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0356-0337"/> it became systematic. Some of his parliaments
                    lived in this way for four successive years. Cromwell was thoroughly master of
                    the art of packing and managing parliaments, an art to which the succeeding
                    reigns added the practice of summoning members from a crowd of petty places,
                    with the express object of securing subservient returns. The parliaments of
                    Henry’s time passed, though not always without opposition, whatever the king
                    wanted, even to the act which gave the king’s proclamation, with certain
                    exceptions, the force of a statute. But in the fact that parliaments for a while
                    became so slavish lay the hope of the final revival of freedom. It was under the
                    despotism of Henry exactly as it had been under the despotism of the Conqueror.
                    There was no need to abolish institutions which could so easily be turned to
                    work the despot’s will. There was no need seriously to encroach upon their
                    formal powers. The institutions and their powers thus remained, to be again
                    quickened into full life in the seventeenth century, as they had before been
                    quickened in the thirteenth century. Had Henry met with a stronger parliamentary
                    opposition, our liberties might have passed away, like the liberties of the
                    lands which went to make up the monarchies of France and Spain. Parliaments went
                    on, because parliaments voted whatever the king wished. Juries went on, because
                    they convicted whomever the king wished. But, because they were allowed to go
                    on, a time came when parliaments learned to pass measures which kings did not
                    wish to have passed, and when juries learned to acquit men whom kings wished to
                    destroy. In this way, as William the Conqueror in one age, so Thomas Cromwell in
                    another, may be looked on as the indirect preserver of English freedom.</p>
                <p>After the fall of Cromwell the reign of Henry loses much of its interest; or at
                    least the interest is, as at the beginning of his reign, again transferred to
                    the wars with France and Scotland. But these wars, with their momentary
                    successes, are of little importance, except that in the course of the Scottish
                    war we see the beginning of the train of eveuts which sixty years later united
                    the English and Scottish crowns. James V. of Scotland, it must be remembered,
                    was Henry’s nephew, the son of his sister Margaret. According to genealogical
                    notions, he was next in succession to the crown after Henry’s own children. The
                    prospect of this contingent succession was dangled by Henry before the eyes of
                    James. And when James died, leaving an infant daughter, the famous Queen Mary,
                    Henry’s schemes now took the form of a marriage between her and his son Edward.
                    This was exactly the same scheme which had been proposed by Edward I. when
                    Scotland had an earlier child queen. In neither case did the scheme bear
                    immediate fruit. The marriage of Edward and Mary formed one of the terms of a
                    momentary peace between England and Scotland in 1543. But the war began again,
                    and was carried on, in connexion with the reforming party in Scotland, both
                    during this reign and during the early years of the next, with the avowed object
                    of bringing about the marriage. It is needless to say that the marriage was
                    never carried out. But Mary came to be, on other grounds, a claimant of the
                    crown of England, and her son came to possess it.</p>
                <p>During these later years of Henry, no commanding figure stands out like those of
                    Wolsey and Cromwell. Henry himself, towards the end of his reign, lost much of
                    his energy. Martyrdoms on both sides still went on, though, as compared with the
                    slaughter of later times, they were rare on both sides. There is yet no open
                    change; but the gap between the two parties gets wider and wider. Katharine
                    Howard, married in 1540, was beheaded early in 1542. In the next year Henry
                    married his last wife, a third Katharine, commonly called Katharine Parr, but
                    who was then the widow of Neville Lord Latimer. Her leaning was to the new
                    doctrines, and at one time she was in danger on their account. On the whole, the
                    tendency was now in favour of change. Things seemed to sway backwards and
                    forwards between Bishop Gardiner and the duke of Norfolk on one side and Cranmer
                    and Edward earl of Hertford, a brother of Queen Jane Seymour, on the other side.
                    At the moment of Henry’s death the reforming party had the greater influence.
                    The last who were sentenced to die in his time were Norfolk himself and his son
                    the famous earl of Surrey. The son perished; the father was saved by the king’s
                    death. But though the reforming party had politically the upper hand, no step
                    was taken as long as Henry lived in the direction of strictly religious
                    reformation.</p>
                <p>The most important question during these later years was the settlement of the
                    succession. By a statute passed in 1544, the crown was to pass to Henry’s three
                    children in order, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth. Both the king’s daughters had
                    been declared illegitimate; but now, without any reversal of their illegitimacy,
                    they were placed in the succession to the crown. On no theory could Mary and
                    Elizabeth both be legitimate; the law had declared that neither of them was. The
                    point is of importance, because in truth neither Mary nor Elizabeth reigned by
                    any right of birth, but by a purely parliamentary title. But the statute went on
                    further to bestow on Henry a power which never was bestowed on any other king
                    before or after. In default of the issue of his own children, the crown was to
                    pass to such persons as he might himself appoint by his last will, signed with
                    his own hand. By his last will he exercised this power by leaving the crown in
                    remainder to the issue of his younger sister, Mary the French queen, who, after
                    the death of Lewis XII., had married Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk. He thus
                    passed by the queen of Scots and the other issue of his elder sister Margaret.
                    The provisions of this will become of great importance at a later time; and it
                    shows on what small accidents great questions may depend, that it is matter of
                    controversy whether the will was signed by the king’s own hand, according to the
                    statute, or whether it was merely signed with a stamp.</p>
                <p>In this memorable reign then, though no strictly religious reformation was
                    wrought, yet a step was taken which made religious reformation inevitable. One
                    marked feature of the fully developed English character was now added. England
                    was from this time, with a momentary interruption, the enemy of the Roman see.
                    But the reign of Henry helped in another way towards the welding together of the
                    whole isle of Britain. Wales was now fully incorporated with the kingdom of
                    England. It was brought wholly under English law and was fully represented in
                    the English parliament. Ireland too was brought into more complete submission
                    than it had ever been before, and in 1542 Henry exchanged his title of Lord of
                    Ireland for that of King, or, as an Irish Act words it, “King and Emperor of the
                    realm of England and of the land of Ireland.” Ireland was a dependent kingdom;
                    still from this time it was a kingdom attached to the crown of England, and by
                    making it such a distinct-step was taken towards the union of the British
                    islands.</p>
                <p>On the reign of Henry followed the reigns of his three children in succession,
                    according to the order laid down in the statute of 1544. The marked historical
                    feature of these reigns is that they are the time of strictly religious
                    reformation. It was found that the middle system of Henry could not last, that
                    the English Church and nation must throw in its lot with one side or the other
                    in the great controversy of the age. Under Edward the religious reformation was
                    wrought. Under Mary, first the work of Edward, and then the work of Henry, was
                    undone, and the authority of the Roman see was again admitted. Under <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n357/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0357-0338"/> Elizabeth the work both of Henry and of Edward
                    was done again. Her reign, four times the length of the two reigns of her
                    brother and sister, is the time when the religious position of England took its
                    final form. The national Church was organized in its essential features as it
                    still remains, And, before the end of her reign, the two parties, those who
                    thought change had gone too far and those who thought that it had not gone far
                    enough, had ceased to be mere parties within the same body. They had become
                    distinct bodies of separatists on either side of the national Church. The reign
                    of Elizabeth saw the beginnings of the Roman Catholic body on the one side and
                    of the Protestant dissenters on the other. As yet both dissentient bodies
                    existed only as objects of persecution. A main feature of the later religious
                    history of England has been the steps by which, first the Protestant dissenters,
                    and then the Roman Catholics, have been admitted to full equality with the
                    members of the national Church.</p>
                <p>The political history of these reigns, domestic and foreign, is of high
                    importance, but it depends in a large measure on the religious history. It was
                    mainly owing to religious causes that the enmity towards France, so strong in
                    earlier times, so strong again in later times, was during this period exchanged
                    for a temporary enmity towards Spain. And during the reign of Elizabeth we see
                    the beginnings of that alliance between certain religious parties and certain
                    political parties which forms the leading feature of the history of the
                    seventeenth century. In truth, it was during this time that organized parties,
                    either religious or political, had their beginning. In a certain sense there
                    have been Whigs and Tories from the beginning. We can see the existence of
                    different political opinions, of different theories as to the relation of the
                    crown and people, in days before the Norman Conquest; and in every civil war, in
                    the wars of the thirteenth century above all, distinct political parties stand
                    forth and meet one another in arms. But it can hardly be said that such parties
                    lasted beyond the immediate occasion, or that the party of one age was connected
                    by direct succession with the party of an earlier age. * But from the days of
                    Elizabeth the political and religious parties of later times can be distinctly
                    traced. From her time they have an unbroken succession; from her time they have
                    the special characteristic of being parliamentary parties.</p>
                <p>The six years’ reign of the young son of Henry VIII. might almost be called a
                    revolutionary period - throughout. Its beginning marks a stage in the history of
                    kingship in England. Edward VI., succeeding by the express terms of an act of
                    parliament, was the first king at whose accession the last traces of the ancient
                    popular election were dispensed with.. He was a minor, and his authority was
                    struggled for by a knot of ambitious men, all of whom had risen into importance
                    during the late reign. The king’s uncle, Edward earl of Hertford, named by Henry
                    as one member of a council of regency, contrived to make himself duke of
                    Somerset and sole protector. Finding a rival in his younger brother Thomas, he,
                    Cromwell-fashion, procured his attainder without a hearing. In 1549 he himself
                    fell before the arts of John Dudley, earl of Warwick and duke of Northumberland,
                    the son of the notorious agent of Henry VII., the father of the notorious
                    favourite of Elizabeth. Somerset was partly restored to favour in 1550; but in
                    1551 came his trial and execution, strange to say on a charge of felony, though
                    a political felony, and not of treason. The remaining two years of the reign of
                    Edward are the reign of Northumberland. His last act was to persuade the young
                    king to do without parliamentary authority what his father had done by
                    parliamentary authority, and to settle the succession to the crown by will. By
                    this illegal instrument he disinherited both his sisters, and named Jane Grey as
                    his successor. As a granddaughter of the French queen Mary, Jane was in the line
                    named by Henry in case of the failure of his own children; but her immediate
                    promo- ' tion was due to her being the wife of a son of Northumberland. Jane,
                    proclaimed by the council, was rejected by the nation, and Mary, whose
                    parliamentary title was undoubted, was raised to the throne by a popular
                    movement. Northumberland of course paid his forfeit with his head; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ι</hi> but the execution of Jane herself, not at the time,
                    but after a later revolt in which she had no share, was an act of needless
                    harshness.</p>
                <p>England under Edward altogether fell from the great European position which she
                    had held under Henry. The chief foreign events of the time are the war with
                    Scotland, the useless and barbarous havoc done by the protector, and. the peace
                    both with Scotland and with France by which Boulogne was restored. But the real
                    character of the reign is marked by its ecclesiastical changes, changes which
                    are largely mixed up with a social revolution which was now going on. The
                    strictly religious changes began with the promulgation of a Book of Homilies in
                    the first year of Edward. It marks the state of things at the time that one of
                    these homilies, which are still to this day set forth by authority to be read in
                    churches, was the work of Edmund Bonner. The homilies were followed in 1548 by a
                    form for the administration of the communion in English, and in 1549 by the
                    publication of the complete English Prayer-Book and an act allowing the marriage
                    of the clergy. This first Prayer-Book of Edward marks the first stage of the
                    religious Reformation. It is a purely English stage; the influence of Rome has
                    been cast aside; the influence of continental Protestantism has not yet come in.
                    But some of the foreign Reformers were before long invited to England, and their
                    presence soon made itself felt. In 1552 the Prayer-Book was revised in a more
                    distinctly Protestant direction. Before this, in 1551, a Book of Articles of
                    Religion, forty-two in number, were put forth. The Prayer-Book and the Book of
                    Articles represent two sides of the Reformed English Church. The Prayer-Book,
                    chiefly formed out of ancient service-books, remained, even after the changes of
                    1552, a link with the older state of things. The Articles, even after some
                    changes in the time of Elizabeth, form a manifesto on behalf of the new state of
                    things and a link with the Reformed Churches in other lands. The Prayer-Book and
                    the Articles have ever since been severally the watchwords of two parties within
                    the Church. It is not too much to say that there has ever since been a party
                    which has loved the Prayer-Book and endured the Articles, and a party which has
                    loved the Articles and endured the Prayer-Book. By the end of Edward’s reign,
                    the English Church stood by itself, retaining the old fabric of ecclesiastical
                    government, with a service-book chiefly drawn from ancient sources, but with a
                    system of doctrine breathing the spirit of the more thorough-going Reformers of
                    the continent. Had Edward lived, further changes would probably have followed.
                    As it was, the reaction under Mary opened the way for the final settlement under
                    Elizabeth.</p>
                <p>The position of the prelates who clave to the old system during Edward’s reign
                    should be carefully noticed. They neither resigned their sees nor refused
                    obedience to the new law. It does not appear that any bishop declined the use of
                    the first Prayer-Book. Gardiner and Bonner were ’ imprisoned and deprived of
                    their sees on various pretences, as were several bishops later in the reign for
                    refusal to <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> comply with various orders, some of
                    which certainly had no parliamentary authority. A large body of the prelates and
                    others were dissatisfied with the changes that were made; but there was not only
                    no separation, there was no disobedience to the law. More than one bishop who
                    appears as a persecutor in Mary’s reign had gone considerable lengths under
                    Edward. And, as there was little nou-conformity<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n358/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0358-0339"/>, there was little persecution in this reign. The
                    Lady Mary, protected by the emperor, continued the private use of the old
                    service. The heresy statutes were abolished; yet Cranmer found means, under
                    cover of the common law, to send to the flames one Englishwoman and one stranger
                    who ventured to go further in the way of novelty than himself.</p>
                <p>But, besides ecclesiastical reform, this reign was beyond all other times the
                    time of ecclesiastical spoliation. It was even more distinctly so than the reign
                    of Henry. The suppression of the monasteries, the destruction of the shrines,
                    were at least acts of policy. But in Edward’s reign the possessione of the
                    Church were simply thrown to be scrambled for by the courtiers. One of the first
                    acts of the reign, the suppression of those colleges, chantries, and the like,
                    which Henry had spared, was at least done in legal form. But, during the rest of
                    Edward’s time, Somerset, Northumberland, and the rest simply seized on whatever
                    they thought good. The nearest approach to legal form in such cases was the show
                    of an exchange by which a valuable estate was exchanged for a paltry rectory.
                    And, as far as the courtiers were concerned, everything went to enrich private
                    men. The one act in which the public good was at all thought of came from the
                    king himself. Edward, of his own act, applied a part of the revenues of the
                    suppressed colleges and chantries to the foundation of that great system of
                    grammar schools which still bear his name.</p>
                <p>The legislation of this reign presents some good points. Many of the newly
                    created treasons of the late reign were abolished, and two witnesses were made
                    necessary on trials for that crime The act which gave the king’s proclamation
                    the force of a statute was repealed. On the other hand, there was the severe
                    Statute of Vagabonds, which went beyond even the old Statute of Labourers. This
                    reign too was marked, like those of Richard II. and Henry VI., by popular
                    revolts. One grievance was the throwing land out of tillage and taking it into
                    pasture. This was laid specially to the charge of the grantees of the monastic
                    lands, who were found to be in most respects harder landlords than the monks had
                    been. Risings of the lower people took place, both in the eastern couuties where
                    the Reformed doctrines were popular, and in the West where the religious changes
                    were disliked. The western insurrection broke out on the first use of the new
                    Prayer-Book. The insurgents demanded the continuance of the old service and a
                    partial restoration of the monasteries. This last demand perhaps points to the
                    state of feeling into which the various currents for and against the monastic
                    orders had at last settled down. The popular belief clearly was that, in the
                    former state of things, there had been more monasteries than enough, but that
                    the country had not gained by sweeping them away altogether. It was eminently
                    characteristic of the time that this revolt of Englishmen was put down by the
                    help of German and Italian mercenaries.</p>
                <p>The reign of Edward was followed by another reign, yet shorter than his own, but
                    not less memorable. The nine days wonder of Jane’s reign was followed by the
                    five years of Mary. It is singular that, though the crown of England had so
                    often passed to claimants whose descent was wholly in the female line, yet
                    England had never before seen a crowned queen. The empress Matilda was never
                    crowned, and she bore no higher title than Lady. The novelty gave rise to some
                    cavil, and it was found needful at a later stage of Mary’s reign for Parliament
                    to declare that a queen of England possessed all the rights and powers of a
                    king. This first female reign was the time which finally settled the religious
                    position of England. There can be little doubt that throughout Edward’s reign
                    the mass of the people were still attached to the system of Henry, that they did
                    not wish for the religious changes of Edward’s reign, but that they had not the
                    slightest wish to bring back the spiritual dominion of Rome. They were for the
                    mass, but not for the pope. The reign of Mary taught them that the middle system
                    would not work, that one side or the other must be taken, that the mass could
                    not be had without the pope. Furthermore, men learned to connect both mass and
                    pope with a political alliance which they hated, and with a persecution
                    different both in kind and in degree from anything which England had before
                    seen. As for Mary herself, it is as impossible to deny her many personal virtues
                    as it is to deny her share in a persecution which, whoever may have been its
                    advisers, she at least did nothing to stop. But her personal position had much
                    to do with the course of events, religious and political. She was the only
                    person in the realm who was bound, not only to the ancient faith and ritual, but
                    also to the supremacy of Rome, The supremacy of Rome was inseparably connected
                    with the validity of her mother’s marriage and the legitimacy of her own birth.
                    As it was, she was simply queen by act of parliament. She naturally wished to be
                    queen as the legitimate daughter of her father. And, if she was bound to Rome,
                    she was no less bound to Spain. The emperor had been her firm and her only
                    friend, whose influence had secured her life and her freedom of worship, Another
                    sovereign might have restored the ancient worship with the assent of the greater
                    part of the nation; but, with Mary as queen, the restoration of the ancient
                    worship meant spiritual submission to Rome and political subserviency to Spain;
                    and in this the nation was not prepared to follow her.</p>
                <p>The ecclesiastical changes of Mary’s reign began at the beginning. She caused the
                    old services to be used on several occasions before their restoration by law,
                    and, by virtue of the ecclesiastical supremacy which she inherited from Henry
                    and Edward, she caused the bishops who had been deprived during the late reign
                    to be restored to their sees. Foremost among these was Stephen Gardiner, bishop
                    of Winchester, who became the queen’s chancellor and chief adviser. There seems
                    reason to think that his share in the persecution has been greatly exaggerated.
                    It is certain that his conduct in secular matters was that of a patriotic, and
                    even a constitutional, statesman. A parliament shortly met, which declared the
                    validity of the marriage of Henry and Katharine and the legitimacy of their
                    daughter’s birth. The ancient worship was restored, and some special enactments
                    of the two late reigns were repealed; but the ecclesiastical power of the crown
                    was in no way touched, and nothing was said of the restoration of the papal
                    authority. The middle system of Henry was thus restored, but only for a moment.
                    The next great question was that of the queen’s marriage. Gardiner and her
                    English advisers favoured her marriage with Edward Courtenay, earl of
                    Devonshire, whose parents had been among the victims of Henry, and who was
                    descended from one of the daughters of Edward IV. But Mary’s fixed purpose from
                    the beginning was to marry her Spanish kinsman Philip. Sir Thomas Wyatt and the
                    duke of Suffolk, father of the imprisoned Jane, took arms to hinder the
                    marriage; but their enterprise led only to their deaths and to those of Jane and
                    her husband. More interesting in the history of our institutions is the fact,
                    almost unparalleled in these times, that one of the accused persons, Sir
                    Nicholas Throckmorton, was acquitted by the jury that tried him. His life was
                    saved; but be remained for a while in prison, and the jurors, according to a
                    custom which was not left oft” till more than a century later, were fined. In
                    the next year, 1554, the queen’s marriage with Philip, already king of Naples,
                    took place. This first husband of a reigning queen was made king of England and
                    of Mary’s other kingdoms for her life. In the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0359-0340"/> next year, by the abdication of Charles V.,
                    Philip succeeded to the Spanish, Italian, and Burgundian possessions of his
                    father. The difference between the position of Philip and that of Charles is to
                    be noticed. Charles V. was emperor; alliance with an emperor was simply the
                    continuation of a policy older than the Norman Conquest. But Philip was not
                    emperor; his policy was not imperial but Spanish. The marriage made England for
                    a moment, in an European point of view, a mere tool of Spain. At home it no
                    doubt strengthened the movement for complete reconciliation with Rome, and for
                    the persecution of those who, after being dominant in the last reign, were
                    deemed heretics in this.</p>
                <p>In the year of Mary’s marriage Reginald Pole, now cardinal, came back to England
                    as legate, and the Lords and Commons of England knelt to receive his absolution
                    for the national schism. He confirmed by papal authority various acts done
                    during the time of the separation, and it does not appear that the ordinations
                    of bishops and priests which had been made during Edward’s reign were ever
                    called in question. And, to quiet a doubt which made many minds uneasy, the
                    actual owners of church lands were confirmed in their possession. An act of
                    parliament followed, by which the papal authority was restored as it had stood
                    before the changes of Henry. Gardiner and Bonner, the strenuous opponents of the
                    pope in Henry’s days, and Thirlby, who had gone a long way with the changes
                    under Edward, were now bishops of a Church in full communion with Rome. That is
                    doubtless, they had seen that, at all events with a Spanish king consort, the
                    middle system could not be kept, and that those who clave to the mass must
                    accept the pope with it. From this time we have two distinct religious parties,
                    the party of the pope and the party of the Reformation. These last were now
                    deemed heretics, and the old heresy laws were revived for their destruction. In
                    1555 the persecution began, and it lasted till the end of Mary’s reign. It.
                    differed from the two-edged persecution of Henry’s reign in two points. Henry’s
                    victims of either faith were comparatively few, and they were mostly persons of
                    some importance. In the three years of the persecution of Mary, more victims
                    were burned than in all the reigns before and after put together. And it was a
                    persecution which, as far as the laity were concerned, fell mainly on victims
                    whom Henry would have scorned to destroy, on the poor, the halt, and the blind.
                    No layman of any distinction suffered; but on the Reformed clergy the hand of
                    the destroyer fell heavily. Five bishops perished. Of these were Ridley and
                    Latimer—true martyrs on one side, as More and Fisher on the other—Hooper, the
                    professor of a straiter sect of Protestantism, and the less famous Farrar of St
                    David’s. The primate followed the next year. He had been lawfully condemned to
                    death for his treason in the usurpation of Jane; and his execution under that
                    sentence, though it would have been a harsh measure, would have been a small
                    matter compared with many an execution of the days of Henry. He was spared,
                    probably in mercy; but he was spared only to bring on Mary and her government
                    the deeper infamy of burning one who had recanted his heresies. The persecution
                    was throughout more the work of the council— by whom Bonner was blamed for
                    slackness— than of the bishops. No one was more zealous for slaughter than
                    William Paulet, marquess of Winchester, one of the new men who conformed to
                    every change, and who died in honour under Elizabeth. After the burning of
                    Cranmer, and not till then, though the see had been for some while vacant by his
                    deprivation, Pole succeeded to the see of Canterbury, the last archbishop in
                    communion with Rome.</p>
                <p>The last days of Mary showed the impolicy of the Spanish match. Strange to say,
                    one of the first acts of Philip, so pre-eminently the Catholic king, was a war
                    with the pope, Paul IV., in his temporal character. Henry of France broke his
                    truce with Spain, and encouraged English traitors to attempt the betrayal of
                    Calais, and to make an actual landing in England. Mary declared war in 1557, and
                    English troops shared in the victory of St Quintin. But at the beginning of the
                    next year, the last of Mary’s reign, the French took Calais, and England ceased
                    to be a continental power. She has won back that character in later times by the
                    momentary possession of Dunkirk and the more lasting possession of Gibraltar;
                    but the last relic of the conquests of Edward III. now passed away, as the last
                    relics of the inheritance of Eleanor had passed away 105 years before. For a few
                    months Mary bore up against sickness and neglect, against sorrow and national
                    discontent. On November 17, 1558, she died, and the cardinal followed her,
                    having been for a few hours the subject of Elizabeth.</p>
                <p>This last fact brings us to the great reign which ends the period with which we
                    are now dealing. Under Elizabeth that which was wanting to complete the
                    character of England and of Englishmen was added. The religious character of the
                    nation was now fixed; and its religious character had no small share in fixing
                    its political position at home and abroad. The national Church retained so much
                    of the middle system of Henry as to hold in some sort a middle place between
                    Rome and the Protestant Churches of the continent. But this middle position at
                    no time extended to more than strictly religious points of doctrine, discipline,
                    and ceremony. As a nation, as a power, England has been essentially Protestant
                    from the time of Elizabeth. But the fact of the middle position of the English
                    Church led to the formation of religious bodies at home which parted off from it
                    in opposite directions. And from Elizabeth’s day onwards the party of further
                    religious reform has also been the party of political freedom. The Puritan
                    party, it must be remembered, had no more notion of toleration than any other
                    party of those days. Its object, like that of every other party, was not the
                    mere toleration, but the exclusive establishment, of its own system. But, on the
                    one hand, every change, every debate, helped to bring about religious toleration
                    in the end. And, as the Puritan movement was largely a movement against
                    arbitrary authority, it was necessarily a movement in favour of freedom. But in
                    England a movement in favour of freedom did not mean the establishment of
                    anything new, but the restoration of what was old. It meant the carrying out of
                    existing laws which Tudor despotism had trampled under foot. In any new
                    legislation that might be needed, it meant the falling back on the old
                    constitutional principles which had been always acknowledged, if not always
                    carried out in practice, from Edward I. to Henry VI. Politically the struggle of
                    the seventeenth century, which had its root in the controversies of the
                    sixteenth, was the repetition of the struggle of the thirteenth. Even in the
                    religious element in both cases there is a likeness. Earl Simon and his friends
                    did not swerve from the received orthodoxy of their day; for the time for
                    strictly religious controversy had not yet come. But they were none the less the
                    Puritans of their own day. A revived spirit of independence marks the
                    parliaments of Elizabeth, and marks them in proportion as the Puritan element
                    grows stronger. Elizabeth loved arbitrary power as well as any sovereign that
                    ever reigned; but she knew that one condition of holding any power was to know
                    hoxv to yield, and, when she yielded, she yielded gracefully.</p>
                <p>Whatever may have been Elizabeth’s personal religious convictions, there can be
                    little doubt that the middle system of Henry was that to which she was herself
                    inclined. But she found that its complete restoration was impossible, If it had
                    ever been possible, it was impossible now, after the reconciliation with Rome
                    and the persecution. Her reform <pb break="no"

                    system of her father, but a return, with some modifications, to the system of
                    her <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> brother. The second service-book of his reign
                    was taken as the standard; but some changes were made, the first of several
                    successive changes, all of which have been in the direction of a return to the
                    first book. It was Elizabeth’s policy to make her new system as little offensive
                    as might be to those who still preferred the old state of things. She refused
                    the title of Head of the Church which was offered to her by parliament, and
                    which had been borne by Henry, by Edward, aud by Mary up to the reconciliation
                    with Rome. She caused some passages in the prayer-book, which were specially
                    offensive to the papal party, to be left out. The forty-two articles of Edward
                    were not enforced in the earlier years of her reign, and when they were
                    euforced, they were cut down to thirty-nine. One favourite doctrine of the
                    Reformers, the lawfulness of marriage in the clergy, Elizabeth could never be
                    brought to sanction by any legal enactment. The practice was simply winked at
                    during the whole of her reign, and was not legalized till the reign of her
                    successor. On the other hand, the anti-papal legislation of Henry was restored
                    in its substance; but the refusal of the oaths, which under Henry had carried
                    with it the pains of treason, in Elizabeth’s first legislation carried with it
                    only loss of office. But we are met at the very beginning with the fact that the
                    changes under Elizabeth, less violent in every way than the changes of Henry and
                    Edward, met with a much more decided opposition from the bishops than the
                    changes of Edward and Henry had met with. Prelates who had gone all lengths with
                    Henry, who had gone a considerable way with Edward, refused the oath of
                    supremacy under Elizabeth. One only of the existing bishops conformed, Kitchen
                    of Llandaff, who had kept his see through all changes. The reason doubtless was
                    that the rest had seen the hopelessness of the middle system, that they had
                    chosen their side with the papacy, and that they could not either in conscience
                    or in decency change again. The mass of the clergy conformed; so did the great
                    body of the laity, including some of the lords who had voted in parliament
                    against all Elizabeth’s changes. In the early years of Elizabeth, though there
                    were two discontented parties in opposite directions, and though some still
                    practised the old rites in secret, there was no open separation either way
                    Elizabeth always professed that she did not force the conscience of any one, but
                    that the English service was established by law, and that the law must be
                    obeyed. And there doubtless were still many who were ready to conform without
                    approving, just as they were ready to obey the law-on any other subject, even
                    though they might wish the law to be altered. It has even been said that, when
                    Pope Pius IV. made overtures to the queen, he offered to admit the use of the
                    English service-book on condition of his supremacy being acknowledged.<note

                    statement is made will be found at length in Hook’s <hi rend="italic">Lives of
                    the Archbishops,</hi> viii. 321. It is certainly not such evidence as would be
                    needed to assert the fact with any positiveness; but the tale is not very
                    unlikely in 1560, though it would be quite out of place in 1570. The deliberate
                    invention of the story, unless perhaps at a much later time, would really be
                    more unlikely thau the story itself.</p></note> Such a compromise would have put
                    the English Church in the same position as the bodies known in the East as
                    United Greeks and United Armenians, who admit the papal authority, but keep thei
                    r own national usages. But the pontiffs before aud after Pius, Paul IV. and Pius
                    V., dealt with Elizabeth in another fashion. In their eyes, and in the eyes of
                    all the extreme supporters of papal claims, she was not only schismatic and
                    heretic, but an usurper of the English crown.</p>
                <p>On this last point much of the history of this reign turns, both domestic and
                    foreign. According to English law, nothing could be better than Elizabeth’s
                    parliamentary title, a title quite independent of the canonical legitimacy of
                    her birth. But, according to the papal theory, she was illegitimate, and,
                    according to the hereditary theory, her illegitimacy excluded her from the
                    crown. On this showing, the lawful queen was Mary of Scotland, who, at the
                    beginning of Elizabeth’s reign, was the wife of the dauphin, soon afterwards
                    Francis II., king of France. Francis and Mary took the titles of king and queen
                    of England and Ireland; and Mary, whether at the court of France, on the throne
                    of Scotland, or in her prison in England, was the centre of all the hopes and
                    all the conspiracies of the Roman party. This is not the place to go through her
                    story, closely connected as it is throughout with English history. As regards
                    the succession, it is clear that, by the will of Henry VIII., the claim of the
                    house of Suffolk was undoubted. But it was a kind of claim which needed a
                    claimant of position and ability, like Richard of York in former times, to
                    assert it. The house of Suffolk, on the other hand, was under a cloud, through a
                    series of low or doubtful marriages. Their claim therefore passed out of notice.
                    The queen obstinately refused to name any successor, or to allow any successor
                    to be named; and all claims might be looked on as set aside by an act w-hich
                    made it treasonable to maintain any one to be the lawful successor except the
                    queeu’s own issue. In this state of things, men’s minds naturally turned to the
                    Scottish line, which had at least hereditary descent in its favour. After the
                    death of Mary the religious objection no longer applied, and James, her
                    Protestant son, succeeded on Elizabeth’s death, without the slightest opposition
                    from any party. The house of Stewart however came in without any shadow of
                    parliamentary title, and directly in the teeth of the parliamentary title of the
                    house of Suffolk, if the will of Henry VIII. is to be looked on as valid and
                    unrepealed.</p>
                <p>The quiet of the first eleven years of Elizabeth’s reign was broken in 1569 by a
                    rising in the North in favour of the old religion. This was not a mere popular
                    movement, like the western and eastern revolts of Edward’s reign. Its leaders
                    were the greatest nobles of northern England, the earls of Northumberland and
                    Westmoreland. It was, in short, the Pilgrimage of Grace over again. The
                    insurrection was put down with a good deal of bloodshed, but not till mass had
                    been again sung in Durham abbey. In the next year, 1570, the bull of
                    excommunication and deposition pronounced by Pius V. changed all Elizabeth’s
                    relations at home and abroad. From this time the English Roman Catholics, from a
                    party dissatisfied with change, become a distinct and a persecuted religious
                    body. In the next year the Puritan movement for further change in the church
                    took a more definite shape in the motions of Strickland in the House of Commons.
                    About the same time the first separate Puritan congregations began to be formed.
                    From this time the queen and her ecclesiastical system had to struggle with
                    enemies on both sides, and to deal out persecution in different measures against
                    both. A terrible engine for this purpose was the special creation of the reign
                    of Elizabeth, the Court of High Commission. The queen, as ' Supreme Governor of
                    the Church, appointed commissioners, clerical and lay, to exercise the somewhat
                    undefined powers of her office. Alongside of the Star-Chamber a kindred, power
                    arose, to bring men’s souls and bodies into submission. And meanwhile a few men
                    who ventured on specially daring speculations, and whose tenets were condemned
                    alike by Roman, Anglican, and Puritan orthodoxy, 1 were still sent to the
                    flames. The Roman martyrs were <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> many; but in their
                    case religious and political disputes were hopelessly mixed up. Conspirators
                    against the queen’s life or crown could not be allowed to escape on any pretence
                    of religious duty. On the other hand, acts of simple religious <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0361-0342"/> worship were made criminal, though liable to the
                    fate of treason and not of heresy. Plots of all kinds went on till the execution
                    of Mary Stewart in 1587. After that time there was less material for plots; but
                    the persecution went on on both sides. But by this time the foreign relations of
                    the kingdom had become even more important than the condition of things at
                    home.</p>
                <p>At the death of Mary Tudor, England was at war with France and in close alliance
                    with Spain. This state of things lasted during the early part of Elizabeth’s
                    reign. She helped the French Protestants; but she concluded peace in 1564.
                    During the rest of her reign the old enmity towards France died out. Elizabeth
                    was at one time almost ready to accept a Catholic husband; at another time she
                    again encouraged the French Protestants. But the accession of Henry of Navarre
                    made France and England friends. Henry and Elizabeth had a common enemy. As
                    enmity against France died out, so friendship for Spain died out also. Philip,
                    Elizabeth’s first suitor, gradually changed into her most dangerous enemy, the
                    assertor of the claims of Mary, and, after her death, her wouldbe avenger, and
                    moreover the assertor of the claims of his own daughter as a remote descendant
                    of John of Gaunt. The Armada, the dealings of England with the insurgents in the
                    Netherlands, the expedition to Cadiz, are all events which stand out on the
                    surface of English history. England now stood cut as the great Protestant power
                    of Europe, the maintainer of the Protestant cause everywhere. In short, the
                    reign of Elizabeth finally gave to England and Englishmen their special
                    religious character, as earlier times had given them their special political
                    character. That special political character, overshadowed for a while by Tudor
                    despotism, showed itself again towards the end of her reign. The England of the
                    seventeenth century, free and Protestant, was now fully formed. The course of
                    the century of which Elizabeth only saw the opening was to win back the freedom
                    of England, to confirm the national Protestantism, and to take the first steps
                    towards that religious toleration on both sides of which the age of Elizabeth
                    had not dreamed.</p>
                <p>But another feature in the character of England was added in the reign of
                    Elizabeth. If England now took up a new and definite position as an European
                    power, the first steps were also taken towards making her more than an European
                    power. In the days of Edward and Mary English commerce and maritime enterprise
                    had a new range opened to them by the beginning of intercourse with Russia. That
                    nation, great in earlier days on the Euxine, was now shut out from all southern
                    and western outlets, and access to her one haven of Archangel could be had only
                    by the Frozen Ocean and the White Sea. Under Elizabeth maritime enterprise,
                    commercial and warlike, took a far wider range. American colonization did not as
                    yet begin; Indian do-niuion was yet more distant; but it was in these times that
                    the first steps were taken towards both. The seamen of England now broke into
                    the preserved maritime empire of Spain, and gave the land which was to give
                    birth to Washington a name in honour of their own virgin queen. The merchants of
                    England, chartered as usual as a company, now first made their way to the great
                    Indian continent, to behold, under the rule of Akbar, that religious toleration
                    which Elizabeth denied to Catholic and Puritan. It is hard for us to conceive
                    the effect which was made on men’s minds by a change which was practically an
                    enlargement of the bounds of the physical world. If it is absurd to set up the
                    great seamen of Elizabeth’s day, Drake and Gilbert and Cavendish and Raleigh, as
                    though they were faultless heroes, it is equally unfair to decry them as mere
                    pirates. They were the natural creation of a new state of things. It was not
                    theoretically justifiable, but it was in no way wonderful, if men of all nations
                    deemed that, in new and barbarous lands and seas, they were set free from the
                    obligations of public law which bound them in their European homes. But one
                    stain, deeper and more lasting, dates from Elizabeth’s days. At home personal
                    slavery had long been forgotten, and the last traces of villainage can now be
                    discerned only by the most prying eyes. The distant enterprises of England now
                    brought back in a new shape the shame of our earliest days. The kidnapping and
                    selling of negroes now became a chief branch of English commerce. And it must
                    not be forgotteu that, till the humane decisions of the last century, the negro,
                    like the British captive or the English criminal of ancient times, was as much a
                    slave on the soil of England as he was on the soil of America.</p>
                <p>The completed national character of England dates from the days of the Tudors,
                    and mainly from the reign of Elizabeth. From this time, in dealing with the
                    actors in English history, we seem, more thoroughly than in any earlier time, to
                    be dealing with men who are in all things our own fellows. One main cause of
                    this is that the language of the sixteenth century is the earliest form of
                    English which an ordinary modern reader can understand without an effort. The
                    handwriting of the sixteeenth century is harder to read than the handwriting of
                    any age before or since. The spelling of the sixteenth century is more chaotic
                    and unreasonable than the spelling of any age before or since. But the language
                    itself, when taken out of its uncouth clothing, is in the main intelligible,
                    even to those who have not made language a special study. The philologer sees
                    that the language of the nineteenth century is the same, by unbroken personal
                    unity, as the language of the fifth century. He sees that the changes which
                    distinguish the language of the nineteenth century from the language of the
                    fifth century were fully accomplished by the fourteenth. But all this is for the
                    philologer. The ordinary reader, who reads merely for the matter or the style of
                    his book, cannot understand the language of the fifth century at all; he can
                    understand the language of the fourteenth century only with an effort. But the
                    language of the sixteenth century is clear to every one who reads with decent
                    attention. It is near enough to the speech of our own times to be understood; it
                    is far enough removed from the speech of our own times to have an archaic
                    flavour, venerable or quaint, according to the matter in hand and its treatment.
                    The literature of the sixteenth century gives us the earliest English writings
                    in prose and verse which we read simply as literature. Spenser and Shakespere,
                    Hooker and Raleigh, stand to us in a different relation from Caedmon, or even
                    from Chaucer. And, greater than all, the sixteenth century has given us, in our
                    national prayerbook, in our national translation of the Bible,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The authorized version, as it
                    stands, is, as every one knows, a work of the seventeenth century, not of the
                    sixteenth. But it was the work of men whose minds had been formed in the
                    sixteenth century, and. the translation of the sixteenth century was taken as
                    its groundwork. Whenever it departs from that model, however much it may gain as
                    a more accurate representation of the original, it loses as a piece of English
                    and English rhythm. Compare the Psalms in the translation of Henry's day and in
                    that of the days of James.</p></note> models of the English tongue which, as
                    long as they survive, will survive to rebuke its corrupters. For them we have to
                    thank the reigns of Henry and of Edward. Henry first gave his people the
                    Scriptures in their own tongue, and then restricted their use. But his gift went
                    for more than his restriction. From that day to this, the English Bible has been
                    the only literary, as well as the only religious, food of millions of
                    Englishmen. The Puritan lived in the English Bible, as the mediaeval scholar had
                    lived in the Latin Bible. That two great works of sixteenth century English have
                    been familiar tous ever since, while no earlier writing has been commonly known
                    in the like sort, is <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0362-0343"/> doubtless one great reason why the English of the
                    sixteenth century is the earliest English which is commonly intel ligible. But
                    this is not the only reason. The reign of Elizabeth is in itself the most marked
                    epoch in English literature. The stirring of men’s minds which led to the great
                    political and religious events of the age led also to the sudden burst of a
                    whole literature in verse and prose. In the sixteenth century the English drama
                    began, modern English theology began, the writing of history in the modern sense
                    and in the English tongue began. And with the beginning of a school of new
                    writers came a time of more diligent care towards our ancient writers. The
                    fanatic religionists and greedy spoilers of Henry and Edward’s days had
                    destroyed ancient records and chronicles by wholesale. The hand of Elizabeth’s
                    first primate, the renowned Matthew Parker, was stretched out to save instead of
                    to destroy, to publish instead of to tear in pieces. To his pious care more than
                    to that of any other man, we owe it that the ancient history of England can be
                    read and written.</p>
                <p>And, as it was with language, so it was with everything else which goes to make
                    up the national life. Its modern form is now completed. We feel that the men of
                    Elizabeth’s day, her statesmen, her warriors, her poets, and her divines, are
                    men who come near to ourselves in a way which the men of earlier times cannot
                    do. A gap of more than a generation, of more than two generations, seems to part
                    Wolsey from Burghley. The main features of English social life had really been
                    fixed in the fifteenth century; they do not·thoroughly come home to us till the
                    sixteenth. We see this in its outward form in the houses of Elizabeth’s reign.
                    They are the earliest houses, great or small, in which a modern Englishman of
                    any class can live with any degree of modern comfort. In point of style, they
                    have fallen away from the models of the early part of the century, The
                    architecture of this age is primarily domestic. For ecclesiastical art there was
                    little room in a time when more churches were pulled down than were built.
                    Repairs were commonly done in a rough and clumsy fashion. Still there are a few
                    ecclesiastical buildings, ranging from Edward VI. to James I., such as the tower
                    of Probus in Cornwall and the choir of Wadham College chapel, in which the older
                    style is still faithfully carried on. The revived Italian style was brought in
                    by Protector Somerset; but, as applied to whole buildings, the fashion did not
                    take; the details became a strange mixture of corrupt English and corrupt
                    Italian; but the outlines are purely English. The Elizabethan houses, with their
                    endless shifting of gables, are often actually more picturesque in outline than
                    the houses of the beginning of the century. They are more distinctly houses; the
                    features handed down by tradition from the castle no longer linger, even as
                    survivals. And they are of all sizes, palaces, manor-houses, burgher dwellings
                    in towns, solitary farm-houses, cottages in the village street. And they are of
                    all materials, stone, brick, or timber, according to the district. They are the
                    houses of an age when law was fully established, and when the different ranks of
                    society, though the distinctions between them were far more sharply drawn, were
                    essentially the same as they are now.</p>
                <p>The objects of the bounty of founders were now necessarily changed; but their
                    bounty was by no means worn out. Mary restored several monasteries, which were
                    again suppressed by Elizabeth. Mary also restored a great part of the alienated
                    bishops’ lands. The plunder of the bishops also went on all through Elizabeth’s
                    reign, and Burghley, Hatton, and Raleigh, and other statesmen and courtiers,
                    made themselves great fortunes at the expense of the Church. But all was not
                    spoliation in this age. Mary and Elizabeth restored some of the collegiate
                    churches which had been suppressed under Edward; the foundation of colleges in
                    the universities went on under both sisters; and this was a special time for the
                    erection of schools and hospitals. Even Leicester has left a memorial of this
                    kind behind him. And it may pass for a kind of charitable foundation on the part
                    of the nation itself, when by a statute of Elizabeth a public provision was
                    first made for the relief of the poor.</p>
                <p>England and the English people are thus thoroughly formed in the shape which they
                    have kept to this day. Their political constitution has lived through its time
                    of trial, ready to come forth again in its full strength. The religious
                    character of England is fixed; her European position is fixed also. She has
                    become wholly insular, ready to play in European politics the special part of an
                    insular power. At home Wales is incorporated; Ireland, now a kingdom, is brought
                    more nearly than ever under the rule of its queen. The time has now come for a
                    nearer and a friendly union with the other kingdom which hitherto has divided
                    the isle of Britain with England. The lack of direct descendants of Henry, the
                    ill luck of the descendants of his sister Mary, carried the English crown to the
                    descendants of Margaret, and called the king of Scots to the English throne. The
                    union of the crowns led, as a necessary though not an immediate effect, to the
                    union of kingdoms, to the time when England and Scotland, political names, so
                    long rival and hostile names, were merged in the common geographical name of
                    Great Britain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>James I.
                    was very fond of calling himself “King of Great Britain,” a geographical
                    description which reminds one of Cnut’s “King of all England.” And the same
                    style was freely used by his successors. But the kingdom of Great Britain did
                    not really begin till Anne’s Act of Union. The more accurate, though rarer,
                    style of the Stewarts is “King of England, ∙¾&gt;otland, France, and
                    Ireland.”</p></note><hi rend="smallcaps">(e. a. f.)</hi></p>
                <p>The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 had been the final victory gained on
                    behalf of the independence of the English church and state. The fifteen years
                    which followed had been years of successful war; but they had been also years
                    during which the nation had been preparing itself to conform its institutions to
                    the new circumstances in which it found itself in consequence of the great
                    victory. When James arrived from Scotland to occupy the throne of Elizabeth he
                    found a general desire for change. Especially there was a feeling that there
                    might be some relaxation in the ecclesiastical arrangements. Roman Catholics and
                    Puritans alike wished for a modification of the laws which bore hardly on them.
                    James at first relaxed the penalties under which the Roman Catholics suffered,
                    then he grew frightened by the increase of their numbers and reimposed the
                    penalties. The Gunpowder Plot (1605) was the result, followed by a sharper
                    persecution than ever.</p>
                <p>The Puritans were invited to a conference with the king at Hampton Court (1604).
                    They no longer asked, as many of them had asked in the beginning of Elizabeth’s
                    reign, to substitute the Presbyterian discipline for the Episcopal government.
                    All they demanded was to be allowed permission whilst remaining as ministers in
                    the church to omit the usage of certain ceremonies to which they objected. It
                    was the opinion of Bacon that it would be wise to grant their request. James
                    thought otherwise, and attempted to carry out the Elizabethan conformity more
                    strictly than it had been carried out in his predecessor’s reign.</p>
                <p>In 1604 the Commons agreed with Bacon. They declared that they were no Puritans
                    themselves, but that, in such a dearth of able ministers, it was not well to
                    lose the services of any one who was capable of preaching the gospel. By his
                    refusal to entertain their views James <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n363/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0363-0344"/> placed himself in opposition to the Commons in a
                    matter which touched their deeper feelings. As a necessary consequence every
                    dispute on questions of smaller weight assumed an exaggerated importance. The
                    king had received a scanty revenue with his crown, and he spent freely what
                    little he had. As the Commons offered grudging supplies, the necessity under
                    which he was of filling up the annual deficit led him to an action by which a
                    grave constitutional question was raised.</p>
                <p>From the time of Richard II. to the reign of Mary no attempt had been made to
                    raise duties on exports and imports without consent of parliament. But Mary had,
                    under a specious pretext, recommenced to a slight extent the evil practice, and
                    Elizabeth had gone a little further in the same direction. In 1606 a merchant
                    named Bate resisted the payment of an imposition—as duties levied by the sole
                    authority of the crown were then-called. The case was argued in the Court of
                    Exchequer, and was there decided in favour of the crown. Shortly afterwards new
                    impositions were set to the amount of £70,000 a year. When parliament met in
                    1610 the whole subject was discussed, and it was conclusively shown that, if the
                    barons of the exchequer had been right in any sense, it was only in that narrow
                    technical sense which is of no value at all. A compromise attempted broke down,
                    and the difficulty was left to plague the next generation. The king was always
                    able to assert that the judges were on his side, and it was as yet an
                    acknowledged principle of the constitution that parliament could not change the
                    law without the express consent of the crown, even if, which was not the case in
                    this matter, the Lords had sided with the Commons. James’s attempt to obtain
                    further supplies from the Commons by opening a bargain for the surrender of some
                    of his old feudal prerogatives, such as wardship and marriage, which had no
                    longer any real meaning except as a means of obtaining money in an oppressive
                    way, broke down, and early iu 1611 James dissolved his first parliament in
                    anger. A second parliament, summoned in 1614, met with the same fate after a
                    session of a few weeks.</p>
                <p>The dissolution of this second parliament was followed by a short imprisonment of
                    some of the more active members, and by a demand made through England for a
                    benevolence to make up the deficiency which parliament had neglected to meet.
                    The court represented that, as no compulsion was used, there was nothing illegal
                    in this proceeding. But as the names of those who refused to pay were taken
                    down, it cannot be said that there was no indirect pressure.</p>
                <p>The most important result of the breach with the parliament of 1614, however, was
                    the resolution taken by James to seek refuge from his financial and other
                    troubles in a close alliance with the king of Spain. His own accession had done
                    much to improve the position of England in its relation with the Continental
                    powers. Scotland was no longer available as a possible enemy to England, and
                    though an attempt to bind the union between the two nations by freedom of
                    commercial intercourse had been wrecked upon the jealousy of the English Commons
                    (1607), a legal decision had granted the status of national subjects to all
                    persons born in Scotland after the king’s accession in England. Ireland, too,
                    had been thoroughly overpowered at the end of Elizabeth’s reign, and the flight
                    of the earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnnel in 1607 had keen followed by the
                    settlement of English and Scottish colonists in Ulster, a measure which, in the
                    way in which it was undertaken, sowed the seeds of future evils, but undoubtedly
                    conduced to increase the immediate strength of the English Government in
                    Ireland.</p>
                <p>Without fear of danger at home, therefore, James, who as king of Scotland had
                    taken no part in Elizabeth’s quarrel with Philip IL, not only suspended
                    hostilities immediately on his accession, and signed a peace in the following
                    year, but looked favourably on the project of a Spanish alliance, in order that
                    the chief Protestant and the chief Catholic powers might join together to impose
                    peace on Europe, in the place of those hideous religious wars by which the last
                    century had been disfigured. In 1611 circumstances had disgusted him with his
                    new ally, but in 1614 he courted him again, not only on grounds of general
                    policy, but because he hoped that the large portion which would accompany the
                    hand of an infanta would go far to fill the empty treasury.</p>
                <p>In this way the Spanish alliance, unpopular in itself, was formed to liberate the
                    king from the shackles imposed on him by the English constitution. Its
                    unpopularity, great from the beginning, became greater when Raleigh’s execution
                    (1618) caused the Government to appear before the world as truckling to Spain.
                    The obloquy under which James laboured increased when the Thirty Years’ War
                    broke out (1618), and when his daughter Elizabeth, whose husband, the Elector
                    Palatine, was the unhappy claimant to the Bohemian crown (1619), stood forth as
                    the lovely symbol of the deserted Protestantism of Europe. Yet it was not
                    entirely in pity for German Protestants that the heart of Englishmen beat. Men
                    felt that their own security was at stake. The prospect of a Spanish infanta as
                    the bride of the future king of England filled them with suspicious terrors. In
                    Elizabeth’s time the danger, if not entirely external, did not come from the
                    Government itself. Now the favour shown to the Roman Catholics by the king
                    opened up a source of mischief which was to some extent real, if it was to a
                    still greater extent imaginary. Whether the danger were real or imaginary, the
                    consequence of the distrust resulting from the suspicion was the reawakening of
                    the slumbering demand for fresh persecution of the Roman Catholics, a demand
                    which made a complete reconciliation between the crown and the Lower House a
                    matter of the greatest difficulty.</p>
                <p>In 1621 the third parliament of James was summoned to provide money for the war
                    iu defence of his sou-in-law’s inheritance in the Palatinate, which he now
                    proposed to undertake. But it soon appeared that he was not prepared immediately
                    to come to blows, and the Commons, voting a small sum as a token of their
                    loyalty, passed to other matters.</p>
                <p>Indolent in his temper, James had been in the habit of leaving his patronage in
                    the hands of a confidential favourite, and that position was now filled by
                    George Villiers, marquis and afterwards duke of Buckingham. The natural
                    consequence was that men who paid court to him were promoted, and those who kept
                    at a distance from him had no notice taken of their merits. Further, a system of
                    granting monopolies and other privileges had again sprung up. Many of these
                    grants embodied some scheme which was intended to serve the interests of the
                    public, and many actions which appear startling to us were covered by the
                    extreme protectionist theories then in vogue. But abuses of every kind had
                    clustered round them, anc in many cases the profits had gone into the pockets of
                    hangers-on of the court, whilst officials had given their assistance to the
                    grantors even beyond their legal powers. James was driven by the outcry raised
                    to abandon these monopolies, and an Act of Parliament in 1624 placed the future
                    grant of protections to new inventions under the safeguard of the judges.</p>
                <p>The attack on the monopolies was followed by charges brought by the Commons
                    before the Lords against persons implicated in carrying them into execution, and
                    subsequently against Lord Chaucellor Bacon as guilty of corruption. The sentence
                    passed by the Lords vindicated <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0364-0345"/> the right of parliament to punish officials who
                    had enjoyed the favour of the crown, which had fallen into disuse since the
                    accession of the House of York. There was no open contest between parliament and
                    king in this matter. But the initiative of demanding justice had passed from the
                    crown to the Commons. It is impossible to overestimate the effect of these
                    proceedings on the position of parliament. The crown could never again be
                    regarded as the sun of the governmental system.</p>
                <p>When the Commons met after the summer adjournment a new constitutional questiou
                    was raised. The king was at last determined to find troops for the defence of
                    the Palatinate, and asked the Commons for money to pay them. They in turn
                    petitioned the crown to abandon the Spanish alliance, which they regarded as the
                    source of all the mischief. James told them that they had no right to discuss
                    business on which he had not asked their opinion. They declared that they were
                    privileged to discuss any matter relating to the commonwealth which they chose
                    to take in hand, and embodied their opinion in a protest, which they entered on
                    their journals. The king tore the protest out of the book, and dissolved
                    parliament.</p>
                <p>Then followed a fresh call for a benevolence, this time more sparingly answered
                    than before. A year of fruitless diplomacy failed to save the Palatinate from
                    total loss. The ill-considered journey to Madrid, in which Prince Charles,
                    accompanied by Buckingham, hoped to wring from the Spanish statesmen a promise
                    to restore the Palatinate in compliment for his marriage with the infanta, ended
                    also in total failure. In the autumn of 1623 Charles returned to England without
                    a wife, and without hope of regaining the Palatinate with Spanish aid.</p>
                <p>He came back resolved to take vengeance upon Spain. The parliament elected in
                    1624 was ready to second him. It voted some supplies on the understanding that,
                    when the king had matured his plans for carrying on the war, it should come
                    together in the autumn to vote the necessary subsidies. It never met again.
                    Charles had promised that, if he married a Roman Catholic lady, he would grant
                    no toleration to the English Catholics in consideration of the marriage. In the
                    autumn he had engaged himself to marry Henrietta Maria, the sister of the king
                    of France, and had bound himself to grant the very conditions which he had
                    declared to the Commons that he never would concede. Hence it was that he did
                    not venture to recommend his father to summon parliament till the marriage was
                    over. But though there was but little money to dispose of, he and Buckingham,
                    who, now that James was sick and infirm, were the real leaders of the
                    Government, could not endure to abstain from the prosecution of the war. Early
                    in 1625 an expedition, under Count Mansfeld, was sent to Holland, that it might
                    ultimately cut its way to the Palatinate. Left without pay and without supplies,
                    the men perished by thousands, and when James died in March, the new' king had
                    to meet his first parliament burthened by a broken promise and a disastrous
                    failure.</p>
                <p>When parliament met (1625) the Commons at first contented themselves with voting
                    a sum of money far too small to carry on the extensive military and naval
                    operation in which Charles had embarked. When the king explained his
                    necessities, they intimated that they had no confidence in Buckingham, and asked
                    that, before they granted further supply, the king would name counsellors whom
                    they could trust, to advise him on its employment. Charles at once dissolved
                    parliament. He knew' that the demand for ministerial responsibility would iu the
                    end involve his own responsibility, and, believing as he did that Buckingham’s
                    arrangements had been merely unlucky, he declined to sacrifice the minister whom
                    he trusted.</p>
                <p>Charles and Buckingham did their best to win back popularity by strenuous
                    exertion. They attempted to found a great Protestant alliance on the Continent,
                    and they sent a great expedition to Cadiz. The Protestant alliance and the
                    expedition to Cadiz ended in equal failure. The second parliament of the reign
                    (1626) impeached Buckingham for crimes against the state. As Charles would not
                    dismiss him simply because the Commons were dissatisfied with him as a minister,
                    they fell back on charging him with criminal designs. Once more Charles
                    dissolved parliament to save Buckingham. Then came fresh enterprises and fresh
                    failures. A fleet under Lord Willoughby was almost ruined by a storm. The king
                    of Denmark, trusting to supplies from England which never came, was defeated at
                    Lutter. A new war, in addition to the Spanish war, broke out with France. A
                    great expedition to Rhé, under Buckingham’s command (1627), intended to succour
                    the Huguenots of Rochelle against their sovereign, ended in disaster. In order
                    to enable himself to meet expenditure on so vast a scale, Charles had levied a
                    forced loan from his subjects. Men of high rank in society who refused to pay
                    were imprisoned. Soldiers were billeted by force in private houses, and military
                    officers executed martial law on civilians. When the imprisoned gentlemen
                    appealed to the King’s Bench for a writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus,</hi>
                    it appeared that no cause of committal had been assigned, and the judges
                    therefore refused to liberate them. Still Charles believed it possible to carry
                    on the war, and especially to send relief to Rochelle, now strictly blockaded by
                    the French Government. In order to find the means for this object he summoned
                    his third parliament (1628). The Commons at once proceeded to draw a line which
                    should cut off the possibility of a repetition of the injuries of which they
                    complained. Charles was willing to surrender his claim to billet soldiers by
                    force, to order the execution of martial law in time of peace, and to exact
                    forced loans, benevolences, or any kind of taxation, without consent of
                    parliament; but he protested against the demand that he should surrender the
                    right to imprison without showing cause. It was argued on his behalf that in
                    case of a great conspiracy, it would be necessary to trust the crown with
                    unusual powers to enable it to preserve the peace. The Commons, who knew that
                    the crown had used the powers which it claimed, not against conspirators, but
                    against the commonwealth itself, refused to listen to the argument, and insisted
                    on the acceptance of the whole Petition of Right, in which they demanded redress
                    for all their grievances. The king at last gave his consent to it, as he could
                    obtain money in no other way. In after times, when any real danger occurred
                    which needed a suspension of the ordinary safeguards of liberty, a remedy was
                    found in the suspension of the law by Act of Parliament; such a remedy, however,
                    only became possible when king and parliament were on good terms of agreement
                    with one another.</p>
                <p>That time was as yet far distant. The House of Commons brought fresh charges
                    against Buckingham, whose murder soon after the prorogation removed one subject
                    of dispute. But when they met again (1629) they had two quarrels left over from
                    the preceding session. About a third part of the king’s revenue was derived from
                    customs duties, which had for many generations been granted by parliament to
                    each sovereign for life. Charles held that this grant was little more than a
                    matter of form, whilst the Commons held that it was a matter of right. But for
                    the other dispute the difficulty would probably have been got over. The strong
                    Protestantism of Elizabeth’s reign had assumed a distinctly Calvinistic form,
                    and the country gentlemen who formed the majority of the House of Commons were
                    resolutely determined that no other theology than the Calvinistic should be
                    taught in England. In the last few years a reaction against it had arisen,
                    especially in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n365/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0365-0346"/> the universities, and those who aùopted an
                    unpopular creed, and who at the same time showed tendencies to a more ceremonial
                    form of worship, naturally fell back on the support of the crown. Charles, who
                    might reasonably have exerted himself to secure a fair liberty for all opinions,
                    promoted these unpopular divines to bishoprics and livings, and the divines in
                    turn exalted the royal prerogative above parliamentary rights. He now proposed
                    that both sides should keep silence on the points in dispute. The Commons
                    rejected his scheme, and prepared to call in question the most obnoxious of the
                    clergy. In this irritated temper they took up the question of tonnage and
                    poundage, and instead of confining themselves to the great public question, they
                    called to the bar some custom-house officers who happened to have seized the
                    goods of one of their members. Charles declared that the seizure had taken place
                    by his orders. When they refused to accept the excuse, he dissolved parliament,
                    but not before a tumult took place in the House, and the speaker was forcibly
                    held down in his chair whilst resolutions hostile to the Government were put to
                    the vote.</p>
                <p>For eleven years no parliament met again. The extreme action of the Lower House
                    was not supported by the people, and the king had the opportunity, if he chose
                    to use it, of putting himself right with the nation after no long delay. But he
                    never understood that power only attends sympathetic leadership. He contented
                    himself with putting himself technically in the right, and with resting his case
                    on the favourable decisions of the judges. Under any circumstances, neither the
                    training nor the position of judges is such as to make them fit to be the final
                    arbiters of political disputes. They are accustomed to declare what the law is,
                    not what it ought to be. These judges, moreover, were not in the position to be
                    impartial. They had been selected by the king, and were liable to be deprived of
                    their office when he saw fit. In the course of Charles’s reign two chief
                    justices and one chief baron were dismissed or suspended. Besides the ordinary
                    judges there were the extraordinary tribunals, the court of High Commission
                    nominated by the crown to punish ecclesiastical offenders, and the court of Star
                    Chamber, composed of the privy councillors and the chief justices, and therefore
                    also nominated by the crown, to inflict fine, imprisonment, and even corporal
                    mutilation on lay offenders. Those w ho rose up in any way against the
                    established order were sharply punished.</p>
                <p>The harsh treatment of individuals only calls forth resistance when
                    constitutional morality has sunk deeply into the popular mind. The ignoring of
                    the feelings and prej udices of large classes has a deeper effect. Charles’s
                    foreign policy, and his pretentious claim to the sovereignty of the British
                    seas, demanded the support of a fleet, which might indeed be turned to good
                    purpose in offering a counterpoise to the growing navies of France and Holland.
                    The increasing estrangement between him and the nation made him averse to the
                    natural remedy of a parliament, and he reverted to the absolute practices of the
                    Middle Ages, in order that he might strain them far beyond the warrant of
                    precedent to levy a tax under the name of ship-money, first on the port towns
                    and then on the whole of England. Payment was resisted by John Hampden, a
                    Buckinghamshire squire; but the judges declared that the king was in the right
                    (1638). Yet the arguments used by Hampden’s lawyers sunk deeply into the popular
                    mind, and almost every man in England who was called on to pay the tax looked
                    upon the king as a wrong-doer under the forms of law.</p>
                <p>Any Government which, from want of sympathy with the feelings of the masses,
                    offends the sense of right by the levy of taxes for which it does not venture to
                    ask their consent, is also likely to treat with unfeeling harshness the religion
                    of thinking men. So it was in the reign of Charles. He gave authority to William
                    Laud, since 1633 archbishop of Canterbury, to carry out his design of reducing
                    the English Church to complete uniformity of ceremonial. The practice in most
                    churches differed from the laws under which public worship was intended to be
                    guided. Laud did his best to carry out the letter of the law, under the belief
                    that uniformity of worship would produce unity of spirit, and in some cases he
                    explained away the law in the direction in which he wished it to be bent. The
                    communion table was removed from the centre of the church to the east end, was
                    spoken of as an altar, and was fenced in with rails, at which communicants were
                    expected to kneel. At the same time offence was given to the Puritans by an
                    order that every clergyman should read the Declaration of Sports, in which the
                    king directed that no hindrance should be thrown in the way of those who wished
                    to dance or shoot at the butts on Sunday afternoon. Many of the clergy were
                    suspended or deprived, many emigrated to Holland or New England, and of those
                    who remained a large part bore the yoke with feelings of ill-concealed
                    dissatisfaction. Suspicion was easily aroused that a deep plot existed, of which
                    Laud was believed to be the centre, for carrying the nation over to the Church
                    of Rome, a suspicion which seemed to be converted into a certainty when it was
                    known that Panzani and Con, two agents of the pope, had access to Charles, and
                    that in 1637 there was a sudden accession to the number of converts to the Papal
                    Church amongst the lords and ladies of the court. The rising feeling may be
                    traced in the poems of Milton. <hi rend="italic">L</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Allegro</hi> and <hi rend="italic">II
                    Penseroso—</hi> probably written in 1632— are full of thoughts which denote him
                    to have been at that time of no special school. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cornus,</hi> written in 1634, is stamped with the impress of the Puritan ideal
                    without the Puritan asperity; whilst the <hi rend="italic">Lycidas,</hi> in
                    1637, contains lines directed aggressively against the system of Laud as serving
                    merely as a stepping-stone to Rome.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1638 Charles had long ceased to reign in the affections of his
                    subjects. But their traditionary loyalty had not yet failed, and if he had not
                    called on them for fresh exertions, it is possible that the coming revolution
                    would have been long delayed. Men were ready to shout applause in honour of
                    Puritan martyrs like Prynne, Burton, and Bastwick, whose ears were cut off in
                    1637, or in honour of the lawyers who argued such a case as that of Hampden. But
                    no signs of active resistance had yet appeared. Unluckily for Charles, he was
                    likely to stand in need of the active co-operation of Englishmen. He had
                    attempted to force a new Prayer-Book upon the Scottish nation. A riot at
                    Edinburgh in 1637 quickly led to national resistance, and when in November 1638
                    the General Assembly at Glasgow set Charles’s orders at defiance, he was
                    compelled to choose between tame submission and immediate war. In 1639 he
                    gathered an English force, and marched towards the border. But English laymen,
                    though asked to supply the money which he needed for the support of his army,
                    deliberately kept it in their pockets, and the contributions of the clergy and
                    of official persons were not sufficient to enable him to keep his troops long in
                    the field. The king therefore thought it best to agree to terms of pacification.
                    Misunderstandings broke out as to the interpretation of the treaty, and Charles
                    having discovered that the Scotch were intriguing with France, fancied that
                    England, in hatred of its ancient foe, would now be ready to rally to his
                    standard. After an interval of eleven years, in April 1640 he once more called a
                    parliament.</p>
                <p>The Short Parliament, as it was called, demanded redress of grievances, the
                    abandonment of the claim to levy ship-money, and a complete change in the
                    ecclesiastical <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n366/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0366-0347"/> system. Charles thought that it would not be
                    worth while even to conquer Scotland on such terms, and dissolved parliament. A
                    fresh war with Scotland followed. Wentworth, now earl of Strafford, became the
                    leading adviser of the king. With all the energy of his disposition he threw
                    himself into Charles’s plans, and left no stone unturned to furnish the new
                    expedition with supplies and money. But no skilfulness of a commander can avail
                    when soldiers are - determined not to fight. The Scotch crossed the Tweed, and
                    Charles’s army was well pleased to fly before them. In a short time the whole of
                    Northumberland and Durham were in the hands of the invaders. Charles was obliged
                    to leave these two counties in their hands as a pledge for the payment of their
                    expenses; and he was also obliged to summon parliament to grant him the supplies
                    which he needed for that object.</p>
                <p>When the Long Parliament met in November 1640, they were in a position in which
                    no parliament had been before. Though nominally the Houses did not command a
                    single soldier, they had in reality the whole Scottish army at their back. By
                    refusing supplies they would put it out of the kiug’s power to fulfil his
                    engagements to that army, and it would immediately pursue its onward march to
                    claim its rights.</p>
                <p>Hence there was scarcely anything which the king could venture to deny the
                    Commons. Linder Pym’s leadership, they began by asking the head of Strafford.
                    Nominally he was accused of a number of acts of oppression in the north of
                    England aud in Ireland. His real offence lay in his attempt to make the king
                    absolute, and in the design with which he was credited of intending to bring
                    over an Irish army to crush the liberties of England. If he had been a man of
                    moderate abilities he might have escaped. But the Commons feared his commanding
                    genius too much to let him go free. They began with an impeachment. Difficulties
                    arose, and the impeachment was turned into a bill of attainder. The king
                    abandoned his minister, and the execution of Strafford left Charles without a
                    single man of supreme ability on his side. Then came rapidly a succession of
                    blows at the supports by which the Tudor monarchy had been upheld. The courts of
                    Star Chamber and High Commission and the Council of the North were abolished.
                    The raising of tonnage and poundage without a parliamentary grant was declared
                    illegal. The judges who had given obnoxious decisions were called to answer for
                    their fault, and were taught that they were responsible to the House of Commons
                    as well as the king. Finally, a bill was passed providing that the existing
                    House should not be dissolved without its own consent.</p>
                <p>It was clearly a revolutionary position which the House had assumed. But it was
                    assumed because it was impossible to expect that a king who had ruled as Charles
                    had ruled could take up a new position as the exponent of the feelings which
                    were represented in the Commons. As long as Charles lived he could not be
                    otherwise than an object of suspicion; and yet if he were dethroned there was no
                    one available to fill his place. There arose therefore two parties in the House,
                    one ready to trust the king, the other disinclined to put any confidence in him
                    at all. The division was the sharper because it coincided with a difference in
                    matters of religion. Scarcely any one wished to see the Laudian ceremonies
                    upheld. But the members who ' favoured the king, and who formed a considerable
                    minority, wished to see a certain liberty of religious thought, together with a
                    return under a modified Episcopacy to the forms of worship which prevailed
                    before Laud had taken the church in hand. The other side, which had the majority
                    by a few votes, wished to see the Puritan creed prevail in all its strictness,
                    and were favourable to the establishment of the Presbyterian discipline. The
                    king, by his unwise action, tnrew power into the hands of his opponents. He
                    listened with tolerable calmness to their Grand Remonstrance, but his attempt to
                    seize the five members whom he accused of high treason made a good understanding
                    impossible. The Scottish army had been paid off some months before, and civil
                    war was the only means of deciding the quarrel.</p>
                <p>At first the fortune of war wavered. Edgehill was a drawn battle (1642), and the
                    campaign of 1643, though it was on the whole favourable to the king, gave no
                    decisive results. Before the year was at an end parliament invited a new
                    Scottish army to intervene in England. As an inducement, the Solemn League and
                    Covenant was signed by all Parliamentarian Englishmen, the terms of which were
                    interpreted by the Scotch to bind England to submit to Presbyterianism, though
                    the most important clauses had been purposely left vague, so as to afford a
                    loophole of escape.</p>
                <p>The battle of Marston Moor, with the defeat of the Royalist forces in the north,
                    was the result. But the battle did not improve the position of the Scots. They
                    had been repulsed, and the victory was justly ascribed to the English
                    contingent. The composition of that contingent was such as to have a special
                    political significance. It leader was Oliver Cromwell. It was formed by men who
                    were fierce Puritan enthusiasts, and who for the very reason that the intensity
                    of their religion separated them from the mass of their countrymen, had learnt
                    to uphold with all the energy of zeal the doctrine that neither church nor state
                    had a right to interfere with the forms of worship which each congregation might
                    select for itself. They were commonly known as Independents, from the
                    communities which had sprung up under the name of Separatists in the reign of
                    Elizabeth, and which maintained the principle of congregational independence;
                    though many other sects found a place in their ranks.</p>
                <p>The principle advocated by the army, and opposed by the Scotch and the majority
                    of the House of Commons, was liberty of sectarian association. Some years
                    earlier, under the dominion of Laud, another principle had been proclaimed by
                    Chillingworth and Hales, that of liberty of thought to be maintained within the
                    unity of the church. Both these movements conduced to the ultimate establishment
                    of toleration,—the one by permitting those to worship as they saw fit whose
                    faith was too definite to enable them to be content with outward forms by which
                    their particular belief was not clearly expressed, the other by allowing those
                    λvhose charity was greater than their polemical zeal to find a common ground to
                    worship side by side with others whose beliefs did not entirely coincide with
                    their own.</p>
                <p>For the present the Independents were to have their way. The Presbyterian
                    leaders, Essex and Manchester, were not successful leaders. The army was
                    remodelled after Cromwell’s pattern, and the king was finally crushed at Naseby
                    (1645). The next year (1646) he surrendered to the Scots. Then followed two
                    years of fruitless negotiation, in which after the Scotch abandoned the king to
                    the English parliament, the army took him out of the hands of the parliament,
                    whilst each in turn tried to find some basis of arrangement on which he might
                    appear to sit on the throne without again misdirecting the government. Such a
                    basis could not be found, and when Charles stirred up a fresh civil war and a
                    Scottish invasion (1648), the leaders of the army vowed that, if victory was
                    theirs, they would bring him to justice. To do this it was necessary to drive
                    out a large number of the members of the House of Commons, by what was known as
                    Pride’s Purge, and to obtain from the mutilated Commons the dismissal of the
                    House of Lords, and the establishment of a high court of justice, before which
                    the king was brought to trial, and sentenced <pb break="no"

                    the windows of Whitehall (1049).</p>
                <p>The government set up was a government by the committees of a council of state
                    nominally supporting themselves on the House of Commons, though the members who
                    still retained their places were so few that the council of state was
                    sufficiently numerous to form a majority in the House. During eleven years the
                    nation passed through many vicissitudes in its forms of government. These forms
                    take no place in the gradual development of English institutions, and have never
                    been referred to as affording precedents to be followed. To the student of
                    political science, however, they have a special interest of their own, as they
                    show that when men had shaken themselves loose from the chain of habit and
                    prejudice, and had set themselves to build up a political shelter under which to
                    dwell, they were irresistibly attracted by that which was permanent in the old
                    constitutional forms of which the special development had of late years been so
                    disastrous. After Cromwell had suppressed resistance in Ireland (1649), had
                    conquered Scotland (1650), and had overthrown the son of the late king, the
                    future Charles IL, at Worcester (1651), the value of government by an assembly
                    was tested and found wanting. After Cromwell had expelled the remains of the
                    Long Parliament (1653), and had set up another assembly of nominated members,
                    that second experiment was found equally wanting. It was necessary to have
                    recourse to one head of the executive government, controlling and directing its
                    actions. Cromwell occupied this position as Lord Protector. He did all that it
                    was in his power to do to prevent his authority from degenerating into tyranny.
                    He summoned two parliaments, of only one House, and with the consent of the
                    second parliament he erected a second House, so that he might have some means of
                    checking the Lower House without constantly coming into personal collision with
                    its authority. As far as form went, the constitution in 1658, so far as it
                    differed from the Stuart constitution, differed for the better. But it suffered
                    from one fatal defect. It was based on the rule of the sword. The only
                    substitute for traditional authority is the clearly expressed expression of the
                    national will, and it is impossible to doubt that if the national will had been
                    expressed it would have swept away Cromwell and all his system. The majority of
                    the upper and middle classes, which bad united together against Laud, was now
                    re-united against Cromwell. The Puritans themselves were but a minority, and of
                    that minority considerable numbers disliked the free liberty accorded to the
                    sects. Whilst the worship of the Church of England was proscribed, every
                    illiterate or frenzied enthusiast was allowed to harangue at his pleasure. Those
                    who cared little for religion felt insulted when they saw a Government with
                    which they had no sympathy ruling by means of an army which they dreaded and
                    detested. Cromwell did his best to avert a social revolution, and to direct the
                    energies of his supporters into the channels of merely political change. But he
                    could not prevent, and it cannot be said that he wished to prevent, the rise of
                    men of ability from positions of social inferiority. The nation had striven
                    against the arbitrary government of the king; but it was not prepared to shake
                    off the predominance of that widely spreading aristocracy which, under the name
                    of country gentlemen, had rooted itself too deeply to be easily passed by.
                    Cromwell’s rule was covered with military glory, and there can be no doubt that
                    he honestly applied himself to solve domestic difficulties as well. But he
                    reaped the reward of those who strive for something better than the generation
                    in which they live is able to appreciate. His own faults and errors were
                    remembered against him. He tried in vain to establish constitutional government
                    and religious toleration. When he died (1658) there remained branded on the
                    national mind two strong impressions which it tool· more than a century to
                    obliterate—the dread of the domination of a standing army, and abhorrence of the
                    very name of religious zeal.</p>
                <p>The eighteen months which followed deepened the im pression thus formed. The army
                    had appeared a hard master when it lent its strength to a wise and sagacious
                    rule. It was worse when it undertook to rule in its own name, to set up and pull
                    down parliaments and Govern ments. The only choice left to the nation seemed to
                    be one between military tyranny and military anarchy. Therefore it was that when
                    Monk advanced from Scotland and declared for a free parliament, there was little
                    doubt that the new parliament would recall the exiled king, and seek to build
                    again on the old foundations.</p>
                <p>The Restoration was effected by a coalition between the Cavaliers, or followers
                    of Charles I., and the Presbyterians who had originally opposed him. It was only
                    after the nature of a great reaction that the latter should for a time be
                    swamped by the former. When the Long Parliament of the Restoration met in 1661,
                    the Act of Uniformity entirely excluded all idea of reform in the Puritan
                    direction, and ordered the expulsion from their benefices of all clergymen who
                    refused to express approval of the whole of the Book of Common Prayer (1662). A
                    previous statute, the Corporation Act (1661), ordered that all members of
                    corporations should renounce the Covenant and the doctrine that subjects might
                    in any case rightfully use force against the king, and should receive the
                    sacrament after the forms of the Church of England. The object for which Laud
                    had striven, the compulsory imposition of uniformity, thus became part of the
                    law of the land.</p>
                <p>Herein lay the novelty of the system of the Restoration. The system of Laud and
                    the system of Cromwell had both been imposed by a minority which had possessed
                    itself of the powers of government. The new uniformity was imposed by
                    parliament, and parliament had the nation behind it. For the first time,
                    therefore, all those who objected to the established religion sought, not to
                    alter its forms to suit themselves, but to gain permission to worship in
                    separate congregations. Ultimately, the Dissenters, as they began to be called,
                    would obtain their object. As soon as it became clear to the mass of the nation
                    that the dissenters were in a decided minority, there would be no reason to fear
                    the utmost they could do even if the present liberty of worship and teaching
                    were conceded to them. For the present, however, they were feared out of all
                    proportion to their numbers. They counted amongst them the old soldiers of the.
                    Protectorate, and though that army had been dissolved, it always seemed possible
                    that it might spring to arms once more. A bitter experience had taught men that
                    a hundred of Oliver’s Ironsides might easily chase a thousand Cavaliers; and as
                    long as this danger was believed to exist, every effort would be made to keep
                    dissent from spreading. Hence the Conventicle Act (1664) imposed penalties on
                    those taking part in religious meetings in private houses, and the Five Mile Act
                    (1665) forbade the expelled clergyman to come within five miles of a corporate
                    borough, the very place where he was most likely to secure adherence, unless he
                    would swear his adhesion to the doctrine of non-resistance.</p>
                <p>The doctrine of non-resistance was evidently that by which, at this time, the
                    loyal subject was distinguished from those whom he stigmatized as disloyal. Yet
                    even ' the most loyal found that, if it was wrong to take up arms against the
                    king, it might be right to oppose him in other ways. Even the Cavaliers did not
                    wish to see Charles II. an absolute sovereign. They wished to reconstruct the
                    system which had been violently interrupted by the events of the autumn of 1641,
                    and to found government<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0368-0349"/> on the co-operation between king and parliament,
                    without defining to themselves what was to be done if the king’s conduct became
                    insufferable. Openly, indeed, Charles II. did not force them to reconsider their
                    position. He did not thrust members of the Commons into prison, or issue writs
                    for ship-money. He laid no claim to taxation which had not been granted by
                    parliament. But he was extravagant and self-indulgent, and he wanted more money
                    thau they were willing to supply. A war with the Dutch broke out, and there were
                    strong suspicions that Charles applied money voted for the fleet to the
                    maintenance of a vicious and luxurious court. Against the vice and luxury,
                    indeed, little objection was likely to be brought. The over-haste of the
                    Puritans to drill England into ways of morality and virtue had thrown at least
                    the upper classes into a slough of revelry and baseness. But if the vice did not
                    appear objectionable the expense did, and a new chapter in the financial history
                    of the Government was opened when the Commons, having previously gained control
                    over taxation, proceeded to vindicate their right to control expenditure.</p>
                <p>As far, indeed, as taxation was concerned, the Long Parliament had not left its
                    successor much to do. The abolition of feudal tenures and purveyance had long
                    been demanded, and the conclusion of an arrangement which had been mooted in the
                    reign of James I. is only notable as affording one instance out of many of the
                    tendency of a single class to shift burdens off its own shoulders. The
                    predominant landowners preferred the grant of an excise which would be taken out
                    of all pockets to a land-tax which would exclusively be felt by those who were
                    relieved by the abolition of the tenures. The question of expenditure was
                    constantly telling on the relations between the king and the House of Commons.
                    After the Puritan army had. been disbanded, the king resolved to keep on foot a
                    petty force of 5000 men, and he had much difficulty in providing for it out of a
                    revenue which had not been intended by those who voted it to be used for such a
                    purpose. Then came the Dutch war, bringing with it a suspicion that some at
                    least of the money given for paying sailors and fitting out ships was employed
                    by Charles on very different objects. The Commons accordingly, in 1665,
                    succeeded in enforcing, on precedents derived from the reigns of Richard II. and
                    Henry IV., the right of appropriating the supplies granted to special objects;
                    and with more difficulty they obtained, in 1666, the appointment of a commission
                    empowered to investigate irregularities in the issue of moneys. Such measures
                    were the complement of the control over taxation which they had previously
                    gained, and as far as their power of supervision went, it constituted them and
                    not the king the directors of the course of government. If this result was not
                    immediately felt, it was because the king had a large certain revenue voted to
                    him for life, so that, for the present at least, it was only his extraordinary
                    expenses which could be brought under parliamentary control. Nor did even the
                    renewal of parliamentary impeachment, wdιich ended in the banishment of Lord
                    Chancellor Clarendon (1667), bring on any direct collision with the king. If the
                    Commons wished to be rid of him because he upheld the prerogative, the king was
                    equally desirous to be rid of him because he looked coldly on the looseness of
                    the royal morals.</p>
                <p>The great motive power of the later politics of the reign was to be found beyond
                    the channel. To the men of the days of Charles IL Lewis XIV. of France was what
                    Philip II. of Spain had been to the men of the days of Elizabeth. Gradually, in
                    foreign policy, the commercial emulation with the Dutch, which found vent in one
                    war in the time of the Commonwealth, and in two wars in the time of Charles IL,
                    gave way to a dread, rising into hatred, of the arrogant potentate who, at the
                    head of the mightiest army in Europe, treated with contempt all rights which
                    came into collision with his own wishes. Nor was Lewis XIV. merely to be feared
                    as a military or political opponent. Even when he was on bad terms with the pope
                    he was a warm upholder of the Papal Church, and Protestants began to ask whether
                    their religion would long be safe if other states succumbed to his arms. Soon,
                    too, suspicions arose that there were those in England who might be glad to use
                    his assistance for the overthrow of Protestantism at home.</p>
                <p>In fact, the danger was to the full as great as it was imagined to be. The king
                    was as much a Roman Catholic as he was anything at all, and in his annoyance at
                    the interference of the Commons with his expenditure he thought it a fine thing
                    to lead an easy uncontrolled existence as the pensioner of the great king. Tn
                    1670 the secret treaty of Dover was signed. Charles was to receive from Louis
                    &lt;£200,000 a year, and the aid of 6000 French troops, to enable him to declare
                    himself a convert, and to obtain special advantages for his religion, whilst he
                    was also to place the forces of England at Lewis’s disposal for his purposes of
                    aggression on the Continent.</p>
                <p>Charles had no difficulty in stirring up the commercial jealousy of England so as
                    to bring about a second Dutch war (1672). The next year, unwilling to face the
                    dangers of his larger plan, he issued a Declaration of Indulgence (1673). By a
                    single act of the prerogative the king suspended all penal laws against Roman
                    Catholics and dissenters alike.</p>
                <p>The cavalier parliament had been gradually drifting into opposition to the crown.
                    But to the end it was true to its resolution to retain the political
                    predominance of the English Church. It dreaded the Roman Catholics. It hated and
                    despised the dissenters. Under any circumstances an indulgence would have been
                    most distasteful to it. But the growing belief that the whole scheme was merely
                    intended to serve the purposes of the Roman Catholics converted its dislike into
                    deadly opposition. Yet it resolved to base its opposition upon constitutional
                    grounds. The right claimed by the king to suspend the laws was questioned, and
                    his claim to special authority in ecclesiastical matters was treated with
                    contempt. The kiug gave way, and withdrew his declaration. But no solemn Act of
                    Parliament declared it to be illegal, and in due course of time it would be
                    heard of again.</p>
                <p>The Commons followed up their blow by passing the Test Act, making the reception
                    of the sacrament according to the forms of the Church of England, and the
                    renunciation of the doctrine of transubstautiation, a necessary qualification
                    for office. At once it appeared what a hold the members of the obnoxious church
                    had had upon the administration of the state. The lord high admiral, the lord
                    treasurer, and a secretary of state refused to take the test. The lord high
                    admiral was the heir to the throue, the king’s brother, the duke of York.</p>
                <p>Charles, as usual, bent before the storm. In Dan by he found a minister whose
                    views answered precisely to the <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> views of the
                    existing House of Commons. Like the Commons, Danby wished to silence both Roman
                    Catholics and dissenters. Like the Commons, too, he wished to embark on a
                    foreign policy hostile to France. But he served a master who regarded Lewis less
                    as a possible adversary than as a possible paymaster. Sometimes Danby was
                    allowed to do as he liked, and the marriage of the duke of York’s eldest
                    daughter Mary to her cousin the prince of Orange was the most lasting result of
                    his administration. More often he was obliged to follow where Charles led, and
                    Charles was constantly ready to sell the neutrality of England for large sums of
                    French gold. At <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n369/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0369-0350"/> last one of these negotiations was detected, and
                    Danby, who was supposed to be the author instead of the unwilling instrument of
                    the intrigue, was impeached. In order to save his minister, Charles dissolved
                    parliament (1678).</p>
                <p>Charles could not have chosen a more unlucky time for his own quiet. The strong
                    feeling against the Roman Catholics had been quickened into a flame by a great
                    imposture. The inventors of the so-called Popish plot charged the leading
                    English Roman Catholics with a design to murder the king. Judges and juries
                    alike were maddened with excitement, and listened greedily to the lies which
                    poured forth from the lips of profligate informers. Innocent blood was shed in
                    abundance.</p>
                <p>The excitement had its root in the uneasy feeling caused by the knowledge that
                    the heir to the throne was a Roman Catholic. Three parliaments were summoned and
                    dissolved. In each parliament the main question at issue between the Commons and
                    the crown was the Exclusion Bill, by which the Commons sought to deprive the
                    duke of York of his inheritance; and it was notorious that the leaders of the
                    movement wished the crown to descend to the king’s illegitimate son, the duke of
                    Monmouth.</p>
                <p>The principles by which the Commons were guided in these parliaments were very
                    different from those which had prevailed in the first parliament of the
                    Restoration. Those principles to which that party adhered which about this time
                    became known as the Tory party had been formed under the influence of the terror
                    caused by militant Puritanism. In the state the Tory inherited the ideas of
                    Clarendon, and, without being at all ready to abandon the claims of parliaments,
                    nevertheless somewhat inconsistently spoke of the king as ruling by a divine and
                    indefeasible title, and wielding a power which it was both impious and
                    unconstitutional to resist by force. In the church he inherited the ideas of
                    Laud, and saw in the maintenance of the Act of Uniformity the safeguard of
                    religion. But the hold of these opinions on the nation had been weakened with
                    the cessation of the causes which had produced them. In 1680 twenty years had
                    passed since the Puritan army had been disbanded. Many of Cromwell’s soldiers
                    had died, and most of them were growing old. The dissenters had shown no signs
                    of engaging in plots or conspiracies. They were known to be only a comparatively
                    small minority of the population, and though they had been cruelly persecuted,
                    they had suffered without a thought of resistance. Dread of the dissenters,
                    therefore, had become a mere chimaera, which only those could entertain whose
                    minds were influenced by prejudice. On the other hand, dread of the Roman
                    Catholics was a living force. Unless the law were altered a Roman Catholic would
                    be on the throne, wielding all the resources of the prerogative, and probably
                    supported by all the resources of the king of France. Hence the leading
                    principle of the Whigs, as the predominant party was now called, was in the
                    state to seek for the highest national authority in parliament rather than in
                    the king, and in the church to adopt the rational theology of Chillingworth and
                    Hales, whilst looking to the dissenters as allies against the Roman Catholics,
                    who were the enemies of both.</p>
                <p>Events were to show that it was a wise provision which led the Whigs to seek to
                    exclude the duke of York from the throne. But their plan suffered under two
                    faults, the conjunction of which was ruinous to them for the time. In the first
                    place, their choice of Monmouth as the heir was infelicitous. Not only was he
                    under the stain of illegitimacy, but his succession excluded the future
                    succession of Mary, whose husband, the prince of Orange, was the hope of
                    Protestant Europe. In the second place, drastic remedies are never generally
                    acceptable when the evil to be remedied is still in the future. When in the
                    third of the short parliaments held at Oxford the Whigs rode armed into the
                    city, the nation decided that the future danger of a Roman Catholic succession
                    was incomparably less than the immediate danger of another civil war. Loyal
                    addresses poured in to the king. For the four remaining years of his reign he
                    ruled without summoning any parliament. Whigs were brought before prejudiced
                    juries and partial judges. Their blood flowed on the scaffold. The charter of
                    the city of London was confiscated. The reign of the Tories was unquestioned.
                    Yet it was not quite what the reign of the Cavaliers had been in 1660. The
                    violence of the Restoration had been directed primarily against Puritanism, and
                    only against certain forms of government so far as they allowed Puritans to gain
                    the upper hand. The violence of the Tories was directed against rebellion and
                    disorder, and only against dissenters so far as they were believed to be
                    fomenters of disorder. Religious hatred had less part in the action of the
                    riding party, and even from its worst actions a wise man might have predicted
                    that the day of toleration was not so far off as it seemed.</p>
                <p>The accession of James II. (1685) put the views of the opponents of the Exclusion
                    Bill to the test. A new parliament was elected, almost entirely composed of
                    decided Tories. A rebellion in Scotland, headed by the earl of Argyll, and a
                    rebellion in England, headed by the duke of Monmouth, were easily suppressed.
                    But the inherent difficulties of the king’s position were not thereby over come.
                    It would have been hard, in days in which religious questions occupied so large
                    a space in the field of politics, for a Roman Catholic sovereign to rule
                    successfully over a Protestant nation. James set himself to make it, in his
                    case, impossible. It may be that he did not consciously present to himself any
                    object other than fair treatment for his co-religionists. On the one hand,
                    however, he alienated even reasonable opponents by offering no guarantees that
                    equality so gained would not be converted into superiority by the aid of his own
                    military force and of the assistance of the French king; whilst on the other
                    hand he relied, even more strongly than his father had done, on the technical
                    legality which exalted the prerogative in defiance of the spirit of the law. He
                    began by making use of the necessity of resisting Monmouth to increase his army,
                    under the pretext of the danger of a repetition of the late rebellion; and in
                    the regiments thus levied he appointed many Roman Catholic officers who had
                    refused to comply with the Test Act. Rather than submit to the gentlest
                    remonstrance, he prorogued parliament, and proceeded to obtain from the Court of
                    King’s Bench a judgment in favour of his right to dispense with all penalties
                    due by law, in the same way that his grandfather had appealed to the judges in
                    the matter of the post-nati. But not only was the question put by James II. of
                    far wider import than the question put by James I., but he deprived the court to
                    which he applied of all moral authority by previously turning out of office the
                    judges who were likely t&lt;χ disagree with him, and by appointing new ones who
                    were likely to agree with him. A Court of High Commission of doubtful legality
                    was subsequently erected (1686) to deprive or suspend clergymen who made
                    themselves obnoxious to the court, whilst James appointed Roman Catholics to the
                    headship of certain colleges at Oxford. The legal support given him by judges of
                    his own selection was fortified by the military support of an army collected at
                    Hounslow Heath; and a Roman Catholic, the earl of Tyrconnel, was sent as
                    lord-deputy to Ireland (1687) to organize a Roman Catholic army on which the
                    king might fall back if his English forces proved insufficient for his
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>Thus fortified, James issued a declaration of indulgence <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n370/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0370-0351"/> (1687) granting full religious liberty to all his
                    subjects. Tho belief that the grant of liberty to all religions was only
                    intended to serve as a cloak for the ascendency of one was so strong that the
                    measure roused the opposition of all those who objected to see the king’s will
                    substituted for the law, even if they wished to see the Protestant dissenters
                    tolerated. In spite of this opposition, the king thought it possible to obtain a
                    parliamentary sanction for his declaration. The parliament to which lie intended
                    to appeal was, however, to be as different a body from the parliament which met
                    in the first year of his reign as the bench of judges which had approved of the
                    dispensing power had been different from the bench which existed at his
                    accession. A large number of the borough members were in those days returned by
                    the corporations, and the corporations were accordingly changed. But so
                    thoroughly was the spirit of the country roused, that mauy even of the new
                    corporations were set against James’s declaration, and he had therefore to
                    abandon for a time the hope of seeing it accepted even by a packed House of
                    Commons. All, however, that he could do to give it force he did. He ordered the
                    clergy to read it iu all pulpits (1688). Seven bishops who presented a petition
                    asking him to relieve the clergy from the burthen of proclaiming what they
                    believed to be illegal were brought to trial for publishing a seditious libel.
                    Their acquittal by a jury was the first serious blow to the system adopted by
                    the king.</p>
                <p>Another event which seemed likely to consolidate his power was in reality the
                    signal of his ruin. The queen bore him a son. There was thus no longer a strong
                    probability that the king would be succeeded at no great distance of time by a
                    Protestant heir. Popular incredulity expressed itself in the assertion that, as
                    James had attempted to gain his ends by means of a packed bench of judges and a
                    packed House of Commons, he had now capped the series of falsifications by the
                    production of a supposititious heir. The leaders of both parties combined to
                    invite the prince of Orange to come to the rescue of the religion and laws of
                    England. He landed on November 5 at Brixham. Before he could reach London every
                    class of English society had declared in his favour. James was deserted even by
                    his army. He fled to France, and a convention parliament, summoned without the
                    royal writ, declared that his flight was equivalent to abdication, and offered
                    the crown in joint sovereignty to William and Mary (1689).</p>
                <p>The Revolution, as it was called, was more than a mere change of sovereigns. It
                    finally transferred the ultimate decision in the state from the king to
                    parliament. What parliament had been in the 15th century with the House of Lords
                    predominating, that parliament was to be again in the end of the 17th century
                    with the House of Commons predominating. That House of Commons was far from
                    resting on a wide basis of popular suffrage. The county voters were the
                    freeholders; but in the towns, with some important exceptions, the electors were
                    the richer inhabitants who formed the corporations of the boroughs, or a body of
                    select householders more or less under the control of some neighbouring
                    laudowner. A House so chosen was an aristocratic body, but it was aristocratic
                    in a far wider sense than the House of Lords was aristocratic. The trading and
                    legal classes found their representation there by the side of the great owners
                    of land. The House drew its strength from its position as a true representative
                    of the effective strength of the nation in its social and economical
                    organization.</p>
                <p>Such was the body which firmly grasped the control over every branch of the
                    administration. Limiting in the Bill of Rights the powers assumed by the crown,
                    the Commons declared that the king could not keep a standing army in time of
                    peace without consent of parliament; and they made that consent effectual, as
                    far as legislation could go, by passing a Mutiny Act year by year for twelve
                    months only, so as to prevent the crown from exercising military discipline
                    without their authority. Behind these legal contrivances stood the fact that the
                    army was organized in the same way as the nation was organized, beiug officered
                    by gentlemen who had no desire to overthrow a constitution through which the
                    class from which they sprung controlled the government. Strengthened by the
                    cessation of any fear of military violence, the Commons placed the crown in
                    financial dependence on themselves by granting a large part of the revenue only
                    for a limited term of years, and by putting strictly in force their right of
                    appropriating that revenue to special branches of expenditure.</p>
                <p>Such a revolution might have ended in the substitution of the despotism of a
                    class for'the despotism of a man. Many causes combined to prevent this result.
                    The landowners, who formed the majority of the House, were not elected directly,
                    as was the case with nobility of the French States General, by their own class,
                    but by electors who, though generally loyal to them, would have broken off from
                    them if they had attempted to make themselves masters of their fellow-citizens.
                    No less important was the almost absolute independence of the judges, begun at
                    the beginning of the reign, by the grant of office to them during good behaviour
                    instead of during the king’s pleasure, and finally secured by the clause in the
                    Act of Settlement in 1701, which protected them against dismissal except on the
                    joint address of both Houses of Parliament. Such an improvement, however, finds
                    its full counterpart in another great step already taken. The more
                    representative a Government becomes, the more necessary it is for the well-being
                    of the nation that the expression of individual thought should be free in every
                    direction. If it is not so the Government is iucliued to proscribe unpopular
                    opinion, and to forget that new opinions by which the greatest benefits are
                    likely to be conferred are certain at first to be entertained by a very few, and
                    are quite certain to be unpopular as soon as they come into collision with the
                    opinions of the majority. In the Middle Ages the benefits of the liberation of
                    thought from state control had been secured by the antagonism between church and
                    state. The Tudor sovereigns had rightfully asserted the principle that in a
                    well-ordered nation only one supreme power can be allowed to exist; but in so
                    doing they had enslaved religion. It was fortunate that, just at the moment wheu
                    parliamentary control was established over the state, circumstances should have
                    arisen which made the majority ready to restore to the individual conscience
                    that supremacy over religion which the mediaeval ecclesiastics had claimed for
                    the corporation of the universal church. Dissenters had, in the main, stood
                    shoulder to shoulder with churchmen in rejecting the suspicious benefits of
                    James, and both gratitude and policy forbade the thought of replacing them under
                    the heavy yoke which had been imposed on them at the Restoration. The exact mode
                    in which relief should be afforded was still an open question. The idea
                    prevalent with the more liberal minds amongst the clergy was that of
                    comprehension,—that is to say, of so modifying the prayers and ceremonies of the
                    church as to enable the dissenters cheerfully to enter in. The scheme was one
                    which had approved itself to minds of the highest order,—to More, to Bacon, to
                    Hales, aud to Jeremy Taylor. It is one which, as long as beliefs are not very
                    divergent, keeps up a sense of brotherhood over-ruling the diversity of opinion.
                    It broke down, as it always will break down in practice, whenever the difference
                    of belief is so strongly felt as to seek earnestly to embody itself in diversity
                    of outward practice. The greater part of the clergy of the church felt that to
                    surrender their accustomed formularies <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n371/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0371-0352"/> was to surrender somewhat of the belief which
                    those formularies signified, while the dissenting clergy were equally reluctant
                    to adopt the common prayer book even in a modified form. Hence the Toleration
                    Act, which guaranteed the right of separate assemblies for worship outside the
                    pale of the church, though it embodied the principles of Cromwell and Milton,
                    and not those of Chillingworth and Hales, was carried without difficulty, whilst
                    the proposed scheme of comprehension never had a chance of success (1689).</p>
                <p>The choice was one which posterity can heartily approve. However wide the limits
                    of toleration be drawn, there will always be those who will be left outside. By
                    religious liberty those inside gain as much as those who are without. From the
                    moment of the passing of the Toleration Act, no Protestant in England performed
                    any act of worship except by his own free and deliberate choice. The literary
                    spokesman of the new system was Locke. His <hi rend="italic">Letters concerning
                    Toleration</hi> laid down the principle which had been maintained by Cromwell,
                    with a wider application than was possible in days when the state was in the
                    hands of a mere minority only able to maintain itself in power by constant and
                    suspicious vigilauce.</p>
                <p>One measure remained to place the dissenters in the position of full membership
                    of the state. The Test Act excluded them from office. But the memory of the
                    highhanded proceedings of Puritan rulers was still too recent to allow
                    Englishmen to ruu the risk of a reimposîtion of their yoke, and this feeling,
                    fanciful as it was, was sufficient to keep the Test Act in force for years to
                    come.</p>
                <p>The complement of the Toleration Act was the abolition of the censorship of the
                    press (1695). The ideas of the author of the <hi rend="italic">Areopagitica</hi>
                    had at last prevailed. The attempt to fix certain opinions on the nation which
                    were pleasing to those in power was abandoned by king and parliament alike. The
                    nation, or at least so much of it as cared to read books or pamphlets on
                    political subjects, was acknowledged to be the supreme judge, which must
                    therefore be allowed to listen to what councillors it pleased.</p>
                <p>This new position of the nation made itself felt in various ways. It was
                    William’s merit that, fond as he was of power, he recognized the fact that he
                    could not rule except so far as he carried the good-will of the nation with him.
                    No doubt he was helped to an intelligent perception of the new situation by the
                    fact that, as a foreigner, he cared far more for carrying on war successfully
                    against France than for influencing the domestic legislation of a country which
                    was not his own, and by the knowledge that the conduct of the struggle which
                    lasted till he was able to treat with France on equal terms at Ryswick (1697)
                    was fairly trusted to his hands. Nevertheless these years of war called for the
                    united action of a national government, and in seeking to gain this support for
                    himself, he hit upon an expedient which opened a new era in constitutional
                    politics.</p>
                <p>The supremacy of the House of Commons would have been an evil of no common
                    magnitude, if it had made government impossible. Yet this was precisely what it
                    threatened to do. Sometimes the dominant party in the House pressed with
                    unscrupulous rancour upon its opponents. Sometimes the majority shifted from
                    side to side as the House was influenced by passing gusts of passion or
                    sympathy, so that, as it was said at the time, no man could foretell one day
                    what the House would be pleased to do on the next. Against the first of these
                    dangers William was to a great extent able to guard, by the exercise of his
                    right of dissolution, so as to appeal to the constituencies, which did not
                    always share in the passions of their representatives. But the second danger
                    could not be met in this way. The only cure for waywardness is responsibility,
                    and not only was this precisely w⅛at the Commons had not learned to feel, but it
                    was that which it was impossible to make them feel directly. A body composed of
                    several hundred members cannot carry on government with the requisite steadiness
                    of action and clearness of insight. Such work can only fitly be intrusted to a
                    few, and whenever difficult circumstances arise, it is necessary that the action
                    of those few be kept in harmony by the predominance of one. The scheme on which
                    William hit, by the advice of the earl of Sunderland, was that which has since
                    been known as Cabinet government. He selected as his ministers the leading
                    members of the two Houses who had the confidence of the majority of the House of
                    Commons. In this way, the majority felt an interest in supporting the men who
                    embodied their own opinions, and fell in turn under the influence of those who
                    held them with greater prudence or ability than fell to the lot of the average
                    members of the House. All that William doubtless intended was to acquire a ready
                    instrument to enable him to carry on the war with success. In reality he had
                    re-founded, on a new basis, the government of England. His own personal
                    qualities were such that he was able to dominate over any set of ministers; but
                    the time would come when there would be a sovereign of inferior powers. Then the
                    body of ministers would step into his place. The old rude arrangements of the
                    Middle Ages had provided by frequent depositions that an inefficient sovereign
                    should cease to rule, and those arrangements had been imitated in the case of
                    Charles I. and James II. Still the claim to rule had, at least from the time of
                    Henry III., been derived from hereditary descent, and the interruption, however
                    frequently it might occur, had been regarded as something abnormal, only to be
                    applied where there was an absolute necessity to prevent the wielder of
                    executive authority from setting at defiance the determined purpose of the
                    nation. After the Revolution, not only had the king’s title been so changed as
                    to make him more directly than ever dependent on the nation, but he now called
                    into existence a body which derived its own strength from its conformity with
                    the wishes of the representatives of the nation.</p>
                <p>For the moment it seemed to be but a temporary expedient. When the war came to an
                    end the Whig party which had sustained William in his struggle with France split
                    up. The dominant feeling of the House of Commons was no longer the desire to
                    support the crown against a foreign enemy, but to make government as cheap as
                    possible, leaving future dangers to the chances of the future. William had not
                    so understood the new invention of a united ministry as binding him to take into
                    his service a united ministry of men whom he regarded as fools and knaves. He
                    allowed the Commons to reduce the army to a skeleton, to question his actions,
                    and to treat him as if he were a cipher. But it was only by slow degrees that he
                    was brought to acknowledge the necessity of choosing his members from amongst
                    the men who had done these things.</p>
                <p>The time came when he needed again the support of the nation. The death of
                    Charles IL, the heirless king of the huge Spanish monarchy, had long been
                    expected. Since the peace of Ryswick, William and Lewis Xiy. had come to terms
                    by two successive partition treaties for a division of those vast territories in
                    such a way that the whole of them should not fall into the hands of a near
                    relation either of the king of F rance or of the emperor, the head of the house
                    of Austria. When the death actually took place in 1700, William seemed to have
                    no authority in Eugland whatever; and Lewis was therefore encouraged to break
                    his engagements, and to accept the whole of the Spanish inheritance for his
                    grandson, who became Philip <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n372/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0372-0353"/> V. of Spain. William saw clearly that such
                    predominance of France in Europe would lead to the development of pretensions
                    unbearable to other states. But the House of Commons did not see it, even when
                    the Dutch garrisons were driven by French troops out of the posts in the Spanish
                    Netherlands which they had occupied for many years (1701).</p>
                <p>William had prudently done all that he could to conciliate the Tory majority. In
                    the preceding year (1700) he had given office to a Tory ministry, and he now
                    (1701) gave his assent to the Act of Settlement, which secured the succession of
                    the crown to the house of Hanover to the exclusion of all Roman Catholic
                    claimants, though it imposed several fresh restrictions on the prerogative.
                    William was indeed wise in keeping his feelings under control. The country
                    sympathized with him more than the Commons did, and when the House imprisoned
                    the gentlemen deputed by the freeholders of Kent to present a petition asking
                    that its loyal addresses might be turned into bills of supply, it simply
                    advertised its weakness to the whole country.</p>
                <p>The reception of this Kentish petition was but a foretaste of the discrepancy
                    between the Commons and the nation, which was to prove the marked feature of the
                    middle of the century now opening. For the present the House was ready to give
                    way. It requested the king to enter into alliance with the Dutch. William went
                    yet further in the direction in which he was urged. He formed an alliance with
                    the emperor as well as with the States General to prevent the union of the
                    crowns of France and Spain, and to compel France to evacuate the Netherlands. An
                    unexpected event came to give him all the strength he needed. James II. died,
                    and Lewis acknowledged his son as the rightful king of England. Englishmen of
                    both parties were stung to indignation by the insult. William dissolved
                    parliament, and the new House of Commons, Tory as it was by a small majority,
                    was eager to support the king. It voted men and money according to his wishes.
                    England was tobe the soul of the Grand Alliance against France. But before a
                    blow was struck William was thrown from his horse. He died on March 8, 1702.
                    “The man,” as Burke said of him, “was dead, but the Grand Alliance survived in
                    which King William lived and reigned.”</p>
                <p>Upon the accession of Anne, war was at once commenced. The Grand Alliance became,
                    as William would have wished, a league to wrest the whole of the Spanish
                    dominions from Philip, in favour of the Austrian archduke Charles. It found a
                    chief of supreme military and diplomatic genius in the duke of Marlborough. His
                    victory at Blenheim (1704) drove the French out of Germany. His victory of
                    Ramillies (1706) drove them out of the Netherlands. In Spain, Gibraltar was
                    captured by Rooke (1704) and Barcelona by Peterborough (1705). Prince Eugene
                    relieved Turin from a French siege, and followed up the blow by driving the
                    besiegers out of Italy.</p>
                <p>At home Marlborough, caring nothing for politics, at first gave his support to
                    the Tories, whose church policy was regarded with favour by the queen. Their
                    efforts were directed towards the restriction of the Toleration Act within
                    narrow limits. Many dissenters had evaded the Test Act by partaking of the
                    communion in a church, though they subsequently attended their own chapels. An
                    Occasional Conformity Bill, imposing penalties on those who adopted this
                    practice, twice passed the Commons (1702, 1703), but was rejected by the House
                    of Lords, in which the Whig element predominated. The church was served in a
                    nobler manner in 1704 by the abandonment of first-fruits and tenths by the queen
                    for the purpose of raising the pittances of the poorer clergy. In 1707 a piece
                    of legislation of the highest value was carried to a successful end. The Act of
                    Union, passed in the parliaments of England and Scotland, joined the legislature
                    of the two kingdoms and the nations themselves in an indissoluble <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> bond.</p>
                <p>The ministry in office at the time of the passing of the Act of Union had
                    suffered important changes since the commencement of the reign. The Tories had
                    never been ns earnest in the prosecution of the war as the Whigs; and
                    Marlborough, who cared above ad things for the prosecution of the war, gradually
                    replaced Tories by Whigs in the ministry. His intention was doubtless to
                    conciliate both parties by admitting them both to a share of power; but the
                    Whigs were determined to have all or none, and in 1708 a purely Whig ministry
                    was formed to support the war as the first purely Whig ministry had supported it
                    in the reign of William. The years of its power were the years of the victories
                    of Oudenarde (1708) and of Malplaquet (1709), bringing with them the entire ruin
                    of the military power of Lewis.</p>
                <p>Such successes, if they were not embraced in the spirit of moderation, boded no
                    good to the Whigs. It was known that even before the last battle Lewis had been
                    ready to give up his grandson, and that his offers had been rejected because he
                    would not consent to join the allies in turning him out of Spain. A belief
                    spread in England that Marlborough wished the endless prolongation of the war
                    for his own selfish ends. Spain λvas far away, and, if the Netherlands were
                    safe, enough had been done for the interests of England. The Whigs were charged
                    with refusing to make peace when an honourable and satisfactory peace was not
                    beyond their reach.</p>
                <p>As soon as the demand for a vigorous prosecution of the war relaxed, the Whigs
                    could but rely on their domestic policy, in which they were strongest in the
                    eyes of posterity but weakest in the eyes of contemporaries. It was known that
                    they looked for the principle on which the queen’s throne rested to the national
                    act of the Revolution rather than to the birth of the sovereign as the daughter
                    of James IL, whilst popular feeling preferred, however inconsistently, to attach
                    itself to some fragment of hereditary right. What was of greater consequence was
                    that it was known that they were the friends of the dissenters, and that their
                    leaders, if they could have had their way, would not only have maintained the
                    Toleration Act, but would also have repealed the Test Act. In 1709 a sermon
                    preached by Dr Sacheverel denounced toleration and the right of resistance in
                    tones worthy of the first days of the Restoration. Foolish as the sermon was, it
                    was but the reflection of folly which was widely spread amongst the rude and
                    less educated classes. The Whig leaders unwisely took up the challenge and
                    impeached Sacheverel. The Lords condemned the man, but they condemned him to an
                    easy sentence. His trial was the signal for riot. Dissenting chapels were sacked
                    to the cry of High Church and Sacheverel. The queen, who had personal reasons
                    for disliking the Whigs, dismissed them from office (1710), and a Tory House of
                    Commons was elected amidst the excitement to support the Tory ministry of Harley
                    and St John.</p>
                <p>After some hesitation the new ministry made peace: with France, and the treaty of
                    Utrecht, stipulating for the permanent separation of the crowns of France and
                    Spain, and, assigning Milan, Naples, and the Spanish Netherlands to the Austrian
                    claimant, accomplished all that could reasonably be desired, though the
                    abandonment to the vengeance of the Spanish Government of our Catalan allies,
                    and the base desertion of our Continental confederates on the very field of
                    action, brought dishonour on the good name of England. The Commons gladly
                    welcomed the cessation of the war. The approval of the <pb break="no"

                    Tory peers. In home politics the new ministry was in danger of being carried
                    away by its more violent supporters. St John, now Viscount Bolingbrυke <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> with unscrupulous audacity placed himself at their
                    head. The Occasional Conformity Bill was at last carried (1711). To it was added
                    the Schism Act (1714), forbidding dissenters to keep schools or engage in
                    tuition. Bolingbroke went still further. He engaged in an intrigue for bringing
                    over the Pretender to succeed the queen upon her death. This wild conduct
                    alienated the moderate Tories, who, much as they wished to see the throne
                    occupied by the heir of the ancient line, could not bring themselves to consent
                    to its occupation by a Catholic prince, even if his birth marked him out for
                    sovereignty. Such men, therefore, when Anne died (1714) joined the Whigs in
                    proclaiming the elector of Hanover king as George I.</p>
                <p>The accession of George I. brought with it the predominance of the Whigs. They
                    had on their side the royal power, the greater part of the aristocracy, the
                    dissenters, and the higher trading and commercial classes. The Tories appealed
                    to the dislike of dissenters prevalent amongst the country gentlemen and the
                    country clergy, and to the jealousy felt by the agricultural classes towards
                    those who enriched themselves by trade. Such a feeling, if it was aroused by
                    irritating legislation, might very probably turn to the advantage of the exiled
                    house, especially as the majority of Englishmen were to be found on the Tory
                    side. It was therefore advisable that Government should content itself with as
                    little action as possible, in order to give time for old habits to wear
                    themselves out. The landing of the Pretender in Scotland (1715), and the defeat
                    of a portion of his army which had advanced to Preston,—a defeat which was the
                    consequence of the apathy of his English sapporters, and which was followed by
                    the complete suppression of the rebellion.— gave increased strength to the Whig
                    Government. But they were reluctant to face an immediate dissolution, and the
                    Septennial Act was passed (1716) to extend to seven years the duration of
                    parliaments, which had been fixed at three years by the Triennial Act of William
                    and Mary. Under General Stanhope an effort was made to draw legislation in a
                    more liberal direction. The Occasional Conformity Act and the Schism Act were
                    repealed (1719); but the majorities on the side of the Government were unusually
                    small, and Stanhope, who would willingly have repealed the Test Act so far as it
                    related to dissenters, was compelled to abandon the project as entirely
                    impracticable. The Peerage Bill, introduced at the same time to limit the royal
                    power of creating peers, was happily thrown out in the Commons. It was proposed
                    partly from a desire to guard the Lords against such a sudden increase of their
                    numbers as had been forced on them when the treaty of Utrecht was under
                    discussion, and partly to secure the Whigs in office against any change in the
                    royal councils in a succeeding reign. It was in fact conceived by men who valued
                    the immediate victory of their principles more than they trusted to the general
                    good sense of the nation. The Lords were at this time, as a matter of fact, not
                    merely wealthier but wiser than the Commons; and it is no wonder that, in days
                    when the Commons, by passing the Septennial Act, had shown their distrust of
                    their own constituents, the peers should show, by the Peerage Bill, their
                    distrust of that House which was elected by those constituencies. Nevertheless
                    the remedy was worse than the disease. A close oligarchy would not only have
                    held a dominant position for some twenty or thirty years, during which it would
                    really be fit to exercise authority, but would have been impenetrable to the
                    force of public opinion when the time came that a public opinion worthy of the
                    name was formed. It is essential to the permanence of an Upper House that it
                    should be unable to set at defiance the will of the nation expressed by its
                    representatives; and without the power of creation the House of Lords might
                    easily have attempted to do this till there was no alternative to a violent
                    alteration of the constitution.</p>
                <p>The excitement following on the bursting of the South Sea Bubble, and the death
                    or ruin of the leading ministers, brought Walpole to the front (1721). As a man
                    of business when men of business were few in the House of Commons, he was
                    eminently fit to manage the affairs of the country. But he owed his long
                    continuance in office especially to his sagacity. He clearly saw, what Stanhope
                    had failed to see that the mass of the nation was not fitted as yet to interest
                    itself wisely in affairs of government, and that therefore the rule must be kept
                    in the hands of the upper classes. But he was too sensible to adopt the coarse
                    expedient which had commended itself to Stanhope, and he preferred humouring the
                    masses to contradicting them.</p>
                <p>The struggle of the preceding century had left its mark in every direction on the
                    national development. Out of the reaction against Puritanism had come a
                    widely-spread relaxation of morals, and also, as far as the educated class was
                    concerned, an eagerness for the discussion of all social and religious problems.
                    The fierce excitement of political life had stirred up the fountains of thought,
                    and the most anciently received doctrines were held of little worth until they
                    were brought to the test of reason. It was a time when the pen was more powerful
                    than the sword, when a secretary of state would treat with condescension a witty
                    pamphleteer, and when such a pamphleteer might hope, not in vain, to become a
                    secretary of state.</p>
                <p>It was in this world of reason and literature that the Whigs of the Peerage Bill
                    moved. Walpole perceived that there was another world which understood none of
                    these things. With cynical insight be discovered that a great Government cannot
                    rest on a clique, however distinguished. If the mass of the nation was not
                    conscious of political wants, it was conscious of material wants. The merchant
                    needed protection for his trade; the voters gladly welcomed election day as
                    bringing guineas to their pockets. Members of Parliament were ready to sell
                    their votes for places, for pensions, for actual money. The system was not new,
                    as Dauby is credited with the discovery that a vote in the House of Commons
                    might be purchased. But with Walpole it reached its height.</p>
                <p>Such a system was possible because the House of Commons was not really
                    accountable to its constituents. The votes of its members were not published,
                    and still less were their speeches made known. Such a silence could only be
                    maintained around the House when there was little interest in its proceedings.
                    The great questions of religion and taxation which had agitated the country
                    under the Stuarts were now fairly settled. To reawaken those questions in any
                    shape would be dangerous. Walpole took good care never to repeat the mistake of
                    the Sacheverel trial. When on one occasion he was led into the proposal of an
                    unpopular excise he at once drew back. England in his days was growing rich.
                    Englishmen were bluff and independent, in their ways often coarse and
                    unmannerly. Their life was the life depicted on the canvas of Hogarth and the
                    pages of Fielding. All high imagination, all devotion to the public weal, seemed
                    laid asleep. But the political instinct was not dead, and it would one day
                    express itself for better ends than an agitation against an excise bill or an
                    outcry for a popular war. A Government could no longer employ its powers for
                    direct oppression. In his own house and in his own conscience, every Englishman,
                    as far as the Government was concerned, was the master of his destiny. By <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0374-0355"/> and by the idea would dawn on the nation that
                    anarchy is as productive of evil as tyranny, and that a Government which omits
                    to regulate or control allows the strong to oppress the weak, and the rich to
                    oppress the poor.</p>
                <p>Walpole’s administration lasted long enough to give room for some feeble
                    expression of this feeling. When George I. was succeeded by George II. (1727),
                    Walpole remained in power. His eagerness for the possession of that power which
                    he desired to use for his country’s good, together with the incapacity of two
                    kiugs born and bred in a foreign country to take a leading part iu English
                    affairs, completed the change which had been effected when William for the first
                    time entrusted the conduct of government to a united Cabinet. There was now for
                    the first time a prime minister iu England, a person who was himself a subject
                    imposing harmonious action on the Cabinet. The change was so gradually and
                    silently effected that it is difficult to realize its full importance. So far,
                    indeed, as it only came about through the incapacity of the first two kings of
                    the house of Hanover, it might be obliterated, and was in fact to a great extent
                    obliterated by a more active successor. But so far as it was the result of
                    general tendencies, it could never be obliterated. In the ministries in which
                    Somers and Moutagu on the one hand and Harley and St John on the other had taken
                    part, there was no prime minister except so far as one member of the
                    administration dominated over his colleagues by the force of character and
                    intelligence. In the reign of George III. even North and Addington were
                    universally acknowledged by that title, though they had little claim to the
                    independence of action of a Walpole or a Pitt.</p>
                <p> The change was, in fact, one of the most important of those by which the English
                    constitution has been altered from an hereditary monarchy with a parliamentary
                    regulative agency to a parliamentary government with an hereditary regulative
                    agency. In Walpole’s time the forms of the constitution had become, in all
                    essential particulars, what they are now. What was wanting was a national force
                    behind them to give them their proper work.</p>
                <p>The growing opposition which finally drove Walpole from power was not entirely
                    without a nobler element than could be furnished by personal rivalry or ignorant
                    distrust of commercial and financial success. It was well that complaints that a
                    great country ought not to be governed by patronage and bribery should be
                    raised, although, as subsequent experience showed, the causes which rendered
                    corruption inevitable were not to be removed by the expulsion of Walpole from
                    office. But for one error, indeed, it is probable that Walpole’s rule would have
                    been further prolonged than it was. In 1739 a popular excitement arose for a
                    declaration of war against Spain. Walpole believed that war to be certainly
                    unjust, and likely to be disastrous. He had, however, been so accustomed to give
                    way to popular pressure that he did not perceive the difference between a wise
                    and timely determination to leave a right action undone in the face of
                    insuperable difficulties, and an unwise and cowardly determination to do that
                    which he believed to be wrong and imprudent. If he had now resigned rather than
                    demean himself by acting against his conscience, it is by no means unlikely that
                    he would have been recalled to power before many years were over. As it was, the
                    failures of the war recoiled on his own head, and in 1742 his long ministry came
                    to an end.</p>
                <p>After a short interval a successor was found in Henry Pelham. All the ordinary
                    arts of corruption which Malpole had practised were continued, and to them were
                    added arts of corruption which Walpole had disdained to practise. He at least
                    understood that there were certain principles in accordance with which he wished
                    to conduct public affairs, and he had driven colleague after colleague out of
                    office rather than allow them to distract his method of government. Pelham and
                    his brother, the cowardly intriguing duke of Newcastle, had no principles of
                    government whatever. They offered place to every man of parliamentary skill or
                    influence. There was no opposition, because the ministers never attempted to do
                    anything which would arouse opposition, and because they were ready to do
                    anything called for by any one who had power enough to make himself daugerous;
                    and in 1743 they embarked on a useless war with France in order to please the
                    king, who saw in every commotion on the Continent some danger to his beloved
                    Hanoverian possessions.</p>
                <p>At most times in the history of England such a ministry would have been driven
                    from office by the roused outcry of an offended people. In the days of the
                    Pelhams, government was regarded as lying too far outside the all-important
                    private interests of the community to make it worth while to make any effort to
                    rescue it from the degradation into which it had fallen <hi rend="italic">;
                    yet</hi> the Pelhams had not been long in power before this serene belief that
                    the country could get on very well without a government in any real sense of the
                    word was put to the test. In 1745 Charles Edward, the son of the Pretender,
                    landed in Scotland. He was followed by many of the Highland clans, always ready
                    to draw the sword against the constituted authorities of the Lowlands; and even
                    in the Lowlands, and especially in Edinburgh, he found adherents, who still felt
                    the sting inflicted by the suppression of the national independence of Scotland.
                    The English army was in as chaotic a condition as its Government, and Charles
                    Edward inflicted a complete defeat cn a force which met him at Prestonpans.
                    Before the end of the year the victor, at the head of 5000 men, had advanced to
                    Derby. But he found no support in England, and the mere numbers brought against
                    him compelled him to retreat, to find defeat at Culloden in the following ycar
                    (174G). The war on the Continent had been waged with indifferent success. The
                    victory of Dettingen (1743) and the glorious defeat of Fontenoy (1745) had
                    achieved no objects worthy of English intervention, and the Peace of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle put an end in 1748 to hostilities which should never have been
                    commenced. The Government pursued its inglorious career as long as Henry Pelham
                    lived. He had at least some share in the financial ability of Walpole, and it
                    was not till he died in 1754 that the real difficulties of a system which was
                    based on the avoidance of difficulties had fairly to be faced.</p>
                <p>The change which was needed was not such as was to be expected from any mere
                    re-adjustment of the political machine. Those who cared for religion or morality
                    had forgotten that man was an imaginative and emotional being. Defenders of
                    Christianity and of deism alike appealed to the reason alone. Enthusiasm was
                    treated as a folly or a crime, and earnestness of every kind was branded with
                    the name of enthusiasm. The higher order of minds dwelt with preference upon the
                    beneficent wisdom of the Creator. The lower order of minds treated religion as a
                    kind of life-assurance against the inconvenience of eternal death.</p>
                <p>Upon such a system as this human nature was cerlaiu to revenge itself. The
                    preaching of Wesley and Whitfield appealed direct to the emotions. They preached
                    the old Puritan doctrine of conversion, and called upon each individual not to
                    understand, or to admire, or to act, but vividly to realize the love and mercy
                    of God. In all this there was nothing new. What was new was that Wesley added an
                    organization, in which each of his followers unfolded to one another the secrets
                    of their heart, and became accountable to his fellows. Large as the numbers of
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n375/mode/1up"

                    not to be measured by their numbers. The double want of the age, the want of
                    spiritual earnestness and the want of organized coherence, would find
                    satisfaction in many ways which would have seemed strange to Wesley, but which
                    were, nevertheless, a continuance of the work which he began.</p>
                <p>As far as Government was concerned, when Henry Pelham died (1754) the lowest
                    depth of baseness seemed to have been reached. The duke of Newcastle, who sue
                    ceeded his brother, looked on the work of corruption with absolute pleasure, and
                    regarded genius and ability as an awkward interruption of that happy arrangement
                    which made men subservient to flattery and money. Whilst he was in the very act
                    of trying to drive from office all men who were possessed of any sort of ideas,
                    he was surprised by a great war. In America, the French settlers in Canada and
                    the English settlers on the Atlantic coast were falling to blows for the
                    possession of the vast territories drained by the Ohio and its tributaries. In
                    India, Frenchmen and Englishmen had striven during the last war for authority
                    over the native states round Pondicherry and Madras, and the conflict threatened
                    to break out anew. When war commenced in earnest, and the reality of danger came
                    home to Englishmen by the capture of Minorca (1756), there arose a demand for a
                    more capable Government than any which Newcastle could offer Terrified by the
                    storm of obloquy which he aroused, he fled from office. A Government was formed,
                    of which the soul was William Pitt. Pitt was, in some sort, to the political
                    life of Englishmen what Wesley was to their religious life. He brought no new
                    political ideas into their minds, but he ruled them by the force of his
                    character and the example of his purity. His weapons were trust and confidence.
                    He appealed to the patriotism of his fellow-countrymen, to their imaginative
                    love for the national greatness, and he did not appeal in vain. He perceived
                    instinctively that a large number, even of those who took greedily the bribes of
                    Walpole and the Pelhams, took them, not because they loved money better than
                    their country, but because they had no conception that their country had any
                    need of them at all. It was a truth, but it was not the whole truth. The great
                    Whig families rallied under Newcastle - and drove Pitt from office (1757). But
                    if Pitt could not govern without Newcastle’s corruption, neither could
                    'Newcastle govern without Pitt’s energy. At last a com promise was effected, and
                    Newcastle undertook the work of bribing, whilst Pitt undertook the work of
                    governing.</p>
                <p>The war which had already broken out, the Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), was not
                    confined to England alone By the side of the duel between France and England, a
                    war was going on upon the Continent, in which Austria—with its allies, France,
                    Russia, and the German princes—had fallen upon the new kingdom of Prussia and
                    its sovereign Frederick II. England and Prussia, therefore, necessarily formed
                    an alliance. Different as the two Governments were, they were both alike in
                    recognizing, in part at least, the conditions of progress. The generations which
                    have succeeded the generation of Pitt and Frederick have learned gradually the
                    necessity of seeking strength from the embodiment of popular feeling in a
                    representative assembly, and of seeking order from the organization of
                    scientific knowledge. Even in Pitt’s day England, however imperfectly, rested
                    its strength on the popular will. Even in Frederick’s day Prussia was ruled by
                    administrators selected for their special knowledge. Neither France nor Austria
                    had any conception of the necessity of fulfilling these requirements. Hence the
                    strength of England and of Prussia. The war seems to be a mere struggle for
                    territory. There is no feeling in either Pitt or Frederick, such as there was in
                    the men who contended half a century later against Napoleon, that they were
                    fighting the battles of the civilized world. There is something repulsive as
                    well in the enthusiastic nationality of Pitt as in the cynical nationality of
                    Frederick. Pitt’s sole object was to exalt England to a position in which she
                    might fear no rival, and might scarcely look upon a second. But in so doing he
                    exalted that which, in spite of all that had happened, best deserved to be
                    exalted. The habits of individual energy fused together by the inspiration of
                    patriotism conquered Canada. The unintelligent overregulation of the French
                    Government could not maintain the colonies which had been founded in happier
                    times. In 1758 Louisburg was taken, and the mouth of the St Lawrence guarded
                    against France. In 1759 Quebec fell before Wolfe, who died at the moment of
                    victory. In the same year the naval victories of Lagos and Quiberon Bay
                    established the supremacy of the British at sea. The battle of Plassey (1757)
                    had laid Bengal at the feet of Clive; and Coote’s victory at Wandewash (1760)
                    led to tlιe final ruin of the relics of French authority in southern India. When
                    George II. died (1760), England was the first maritime and colonial power in the
                    world.</p>
                <p>In George III. the king once more became an important factor in English politics.
                    From his childhood he had been trained by his mother and his instructors to
                    regard the breaking down of the power of the great families as the task of his
                    life. In this he was walking in the same direction as Pitt was walking. If the
                    two men could have worked together in the same direction, England might have
                    been spared many misfortunes. Unhappily, the king could not understand Pitt’s
                    higher qualities, his bold confidence in the popular feeling, and his contempt
                    for corruption and intrigue. And yet the king’s authority was indispensable to
                    Pitt, if he was to carry on his conflict against the great families with
                    success. When the war came to an end, as it must come to an end sooner or later,
                    Pitt’s special predominance, derived as it was from his power of breathing a
                    martial spirit into the fleets and armies of England, would come to an end too.
                    Only the king, with his hold upon the traditional instincts of loyalty and the
                    force of his still unimpaired prerogative, could, in ordinary times, hold head
                    against the wealthy and influential aristocracy. Unfortunately, George III. was
                    not wise enough to deal with the difficulty in a high-minded fashion. With a
                    well-intentioned but narrow mind, he had nothing in him to strike the
                    imagination of his subjects. He met influence with influence, corruption with
                    corruption, intrigue with intrigue. Unhappily, too, his earliest relations with
                    Pitt involved a dispute on a point on which he was right and Pitt was wrong. In
                    1761 Pitt resigned office, because neither the king nor the cabinet were willing
                    to declare war against Spain in the midst of the war with France. As the war
                    with Spain was inevitable, and as, when it broke out in the following year
                    (1762), it was followed by triumphs for which Pitt had prepared the way, the
                    prescience of the great war-minister appeared to be fully established. But it
                    was his love of war, not his skill in carrying it on, which was really in
                    question. He would be satisfied with nothing short of the absolute ruin of
                    France. He would have given England that dangerous position cff supremacy which
                    was gained for France by Lewis XIV. in the 17th century, and by Napoleon in the
                    19th century. He would have made his country still more haughty and arrogant
                    than it was, till other nations rose against it, as they have three times risen
                    against France, rather than submit to the intolerable yoke. It was a happy thing
                    for England that peace was signed (1763).</p>
                <p>Even as it was, a spirit of contemptuous disregard of the rights of others had
                    been roused, which would not be <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0376-0357"/> easily allayed. The king’s premature attempt to
                    secure a prime minister of his own choosing in Lord Bute (1761) came to an end
                    through the minister’s incapacity (1763). George Grenville, who followed him,
                    kept the king in leading-strings in reliance upon his parliamentary majority.
                    Something, no doubt, had been accomplished by the incorruptibility of Pitt. The
                    practice of bribing members of parliament by actual presents in money came to an
                    end, though the practice of bribing them by place and pension long continued.
                    The arrogance which Pitt displayed towards foreign nations was displayed by
                    Grenville towards classes of the population of the British dominions. It was
                    enough for him to establish a right. He never put himself in the position of
                    those who were to suffer by its being put in force.</p>
                <p>The first to suffer from Grenville’s conception of his duty were the American
                    colonies. The mercantile system which had sprung up in Spain in the 16th century
                    held that colonies were to be entirely prohibited from trading, except with the
                    mother country. Every European country had adopted this view, and the
                    acquisition of fresh colonial dominions by England, at the peace of 1763, had
                    been made not so much through lust of empire as through love of trade. Of all
                    English colonies, the American were the most populous and important. Their
                    proximity to the Spanish colonies in the West Indies had naturally led to a
                    contrabrand trade. To this trade Grenville put a stop, as far as lay in his
                    power.</p>
                <p>Obnoxious as this measure was in America, the colonists had acknowledged the
                    principle on which it was founded too long to make it easy to resist it. Another
                    step of Grenville’s met with more open opposition. Even with all the experience
                    of the century which followed, the relations between a mother country and her
                    colonies are not easy to arrange. If the burthen of defence is to be borne in
                    common, it can hardly be left to the mother country to declare war, and to exact
                    the necessary taxation, without the consent of the colonies. If, on the other
                    hand, it is to be borne by the mother country alone, she may well complain that
                    she is left to bear more than her due share of the weight. The latter
                    alternative forced itself upon the attention of Grenville. The British
                    parliament, he held, was the supreme legislature, and, as such, was entitled to
                    raise taxes in America to support the military forces needed for the defence of
                    America. The Act (1765) imposing a stamp tax on the American colonies was the
                    result.</p>
                <p>As might have been expected, the Americans resisted. For them, the question was
                    precisely that which Hampden had fought out in the case of ship-money. As far as
                    they were concerned, the British parliament had stepped into the position of
                    Charles I. If Grenville bad remained in office he would probably have persisted
                    in his resolution. He was driven from his post by the king’s resolution no
                    longer to submit to his insolence.</p>
                <p>A new ministry was formed under the marquis of Rockingham, composed of some of
                    those leaders of the Whig aristocracy who had not followed the Grenville
                    ministry. They were well-intentioned, but weak, and without political ability;
                    and the king regarded them with distrust, only qualified by his abhorrence of
                    the ministry which they superseded.</p>
                <p>As soon as the bad news came from America, the ministry was placed between two
                    recommendations. Grenville, ou the one hand, advised that the tax should be
                    enforced. Pitt, on the other, declared that the British parliament had
                    absolutely no right to tax America, though he held that it had the right to
                    regulate, or in other words to tax, the commerce of America for the benefit of
                    the British merchant and manufacturer. Between the two the Government took a
                    middle course. It obtained from parliament a total repeal of the Stamp Act, but
                    it also passed a Declaratory Act, claiming for the British parliament the
                    supreme power over the colonies in matters of taxation, as well as in matters of
                    legislation.</p>
                <p>It is possible that the course thus adopted was chosen simply because it was a
                    middle course. But it was probably suggested by Edmund Burke, who was then Lord
                    Rockingham’s private secretary, but who for some time to come was to furnish
                    thinking to the party to which he attached himself. Burke carried into the world
                    of theory those politics of expediency of which Walpole had been the practical
                    originator. He held that questions of abstract right had no place in politics.
                    It was therefore as absurd to argue with Pitt that England had a right to
                    regulate commerce, as it was to argue with Grenville that England had a right to
                    levy taxes. All that could be said was that it was expedient in a wide-spread
                    empire that the power of final decision should be lodged somewhere, and that it
                    was also expedient not to use that power in such a way as to irritate those whom
                    it was the truest wisdom to conciliate.</p>
                <p>The weak side of this view was the weak side of all Burke’s political philosophy.
                    Like all great innovators, he was intensely conservative where he was not an
                    advocate of change. With new views on every subject relating to the exercise of
                    power, he shrunk even from entertaining the slightest question relating to the
                    distribution of power. He recommended to the British parliament the most
                    self-denying wisdom, but he could not see that in its relation to the colonies
                    the British parliament was so constituted as to make it entirely unprepared to
                    be either wise or self-denying. It is true that if he had thought out the matter
                    in this direction he would have been led further than he or any other man in
                    England or America was at that time prepared to go. If the British parliament
                    was unfit to legislate for America, and if, as was undoubtedly the case, it was
                    impossible to create a representative body which was fit to legislate, it would
                    follow that the American colonies could only be fairly governed as practically
                    independent states, though they might possibly remain, like the great colonies
                    of our own day, in a position of alliance rather than of dependence. It was
                    because the issues opened led to changes so far greater than the wisest
                    statesman then perceived, that Pitt’s solution, logically untenable as it was,
                    was preferable to Burke’s. Pitt would have given bad reasons for going a step in
                    the right direction. Burke gave excellent reasons why those who were certain to
                    go wrong should have the power to go right.</p>
                <p>Scarcely were the measures relating to America passed when the king turned out
                    the ministry. The new ministry was formed by Pitt, who was created Lord Chatham
                    (1766), on the principle of bringing together men who had shaken themselves
                    loose from any of the different Whig cliques. Whatever chance the plan had of
                    succeeding was at an end when Chatham’s mind temporarily gave way under stress
                    of disease (1767). Charles Townshend, a brilliant headstrong man, led parliament
                    in the way which had been prepared by the Declaratory Act, and laid duties on
                    tea and other articles of commerce entering the ports of America.</p>
                <p>It was impossible that the position thus claimed by the British parliament
                    towards America should affect America alone. The habit of obtaining money
                    otherwise than by the consent of those who are required to pay it would be
                    certain to make parliament careless of the feelings and interests of that great
                    majority of the population at home which was unrepresented in parliament. The
                    resistance of America to the taxation imposed was therefore not without<pb

                    Already there were signs of a readiness in parliament to treat even the
                    constituencies with contempt. In 1763, in the days of the Grenville ministry,
                    John Wilkes, a profligate and scurrilous writer, had been arrested on a general
                    warrant, —that is to say, a warrant in which the name of no individual was
                    mentioned,—as the author of an alleged libel on the king, contained in No. 45 of
                    <hi rend="italic">The North Briton.</hi> He was a member of parliament, and as
                    such was declared by Chief Justice Pratt to be privileged against arrest. In
                    1768 he was elected member for Middlesex. The House of Commons expelled him. He
                    was again elected, and again expelled. The third time the Commons gave the seat
                    to which Wilkes was a third time chosen to Colonel Lutrell, who was far down in
                    the poll. Wilkes thus became the representative of a great constitutional
                    principle, the principle that the electors have a right to choose their
                    representatives without restriction saving by the regulations of the law.</p>
                <p>For the present the contention of the American colonists and of the defenders of
                    Wilkes at home was confined within the compass of the law. Yet in both cases it
                    might easily pass beyond that compass, and might rest itself upon an appeal to
                    the duty of Governments to modify the law and to enlarge the basis of their
                    authority, when law and authority have become too narrow.</p>
                <p>As regards America, though Townshend . died, the Government persisted in his
                    policy. As resistance grew stronger in America, the king urged the use of
                    compulsion. If he had not the wisdom of the country on his side, he had its
                    prejudices. The arrogant spirit of Englishmen made them contemptuous towards the
                    colonists, and the desire to thrust taxation upon others than themselves made
                    the new colonial legislation popular. In 1770 the king made Lord North prime
                    minister. He had won the object on which he had set his heart. A new Tory party
                    had sprung up, not distinguished, like the Tories of Queen Anne’s reign, by a
                    special ecclesiastical policy, but by their acceptance of the king’s claim to
                    nominate ministers, and so to predominate in the ministry himself.</p>
                <p>Unhappily the Opposition, united in the desire to conciliate America, was divided
                    on questions of home policy. Chatham would have met the new danger by
                    parliamentary reform, giving increased voting power to the freeholders of the
                    counties. Burke from principle, and his noble patrons mainly from lower motives,
                    were opposed to any such change As Burke had wished the British parliament to be
                    supreme over the colonies, in confidence that this supremacy would not be
                    abused, so he wished the great land-owning connection resting on the rotten
                    boroughs to rule over the unrepresented people, in confidence that this power
                    would not be abused. Amidst these distractions the king had an easy game to
                    play. He had all the patronage of the Government in his hands, and beyond the
                    circle which was influenced by gifts of patronage he could appeal to the
                    ignorance and self-seeking of the nation, with which, though he knew it not, he
                    was himself in the closest sympathy.</p>
                <p>No wonder resistance grew more vigorous in America. In 1773 the inhabitants of
                    Boston threw ship-loads of tea into the harbour rather than pay the obnoxious
                    duty. In 1774 the Boston Port Bill deprived Boston of its commercial rights,
                    whilst the Massachusetts Government Bill took away from that colony the ordinary
                    political liberties of Englishmen. The first skirmish of the inevitable war was
                    fought at Lexington in 1775. In 1776 the thirteen colonies united in the
                    Congress issued their Declaration of Independence. England put forth all its
                    strength to beat down resistance. She increased her armies by hirelings bought
                    from the German princes. But not only did no military genius appear on the
                    English side, but the distance across the Atlantic was so great, and the immense
                    spaces of even the settled part of the American continent were so large, that it
                    was impossible to effect that conquest which seemed so easy at a distance. The
                    difficulties of the Americans, too, were enormous, but they had the advantage of
                    being at home; and in Washington they found a leader worthy of the great cause
                    for which he fought. In 1777 a British army under Burgoyne capitulated at
                    Saratoga; and in the same year France, eager to revenge the disasters of the
                    Seven Years’ War,, formed an alliance with the revolted colonies as free and
                    independent states, and was soon joined by Spain.</p>
                <p>Chatham, who was ready to make any concession to America short of independence,
                    and especially of independ ence at the dictation of France, died in 1778. The
                    war was continued for some years with varying results; but in 1781 the
                    capitulation of a second British army under Cornwallis at York Town was a
                    decisive blow, which brought home to the minds of the dullest the assurance that
                    the conquest of America was an impossibility.</p>
                <p>Before this event happened there had been a great change in public feeling in
                    England. The increasing weight of taxation gave rise in 1780 to a great meeting
                    of the freeholders of Yorkshire, which in turn gave the signal for a general
                    agitation for the reduction of unnecessary expense in the government. To this
                    desire Burke gave expression in his bill for economical reform, though he was
                    unable to carry it in the teeth of interested opposition. The movement in favour
                    of economy was necessarily also a movement in favour of peace; and when the
                    surrender of York Town was known (1782), Lord North at once resigned office.</p>
                <p>The new ministry formed under Lord Rockingham comprised not only his own
                    immediate followers, of whom the most prominent was Charles Fox, but the
                    followers of Chatham, of whom Lord Shelburne was the acknowledged leader. A
                    treaty of peace acknowledging the independence of the United States of America
                    was at once set on foot; and the negotiation with France was rendered easy by
                    the defeat of a French fleet by Rodney, and by the failure of the combined
                    forces of France and Spain to take Gibraltar.</p>
                <p>Already the ministry on which such great hopes had been placed had broken up.
                    Rockingham died in July 1782. The two sections of which the Government was
                    composed had different aims. The Rockingham section, which now looked up to Fox,
                    rested on aristocratic connection and influence; the Shelburne section was
                    anxious to gain popular support by active reforms, and to gain over the king to
                    their side. Judging by past experience, the combination might well seem
                    hopeless, and honourable men like Fox might easily regard it with suspicion. But
                    Fox’s allies took good care that their name should not be associated with the
                    idea of improvement. They pruned Burke’s Economical Reform Bill till it left as
                    many abuses as it suppressed; and though the bill prohibited the grant of
                    pensions above £300, they hastily gave away pensions of much larger value to
                    their own friends before the bill had received the royal assent. They also
                    opposed a bill for parliamentary reform brought in by young William Pitt. When
                    the king chose Shelburne as prime minister, they refused to follow him, and put
                    forward the incompetent duke of Portland as their candidate for the office. The
                    struggle was thus renewed on the old ground of the king’s right to select his
                    ministers. But while the king now put forward a minister notoriously able and
                    competent to the task, his opponents put forward a man whose only claim to
                    office was the possession of large estates. They forced their way back to power
                    by means as unscrupulous as their claim to it was unjustifiable. They formed a
                    coalition with Lord North whose pc.itics <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n378/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0378-0359"/> and character they had denounced for years. The
                    coalition, as soon as the peace with America and France had been signed (1783),
                    drove Shelburne from office. The duke of Portland became the nominal head of the
                    Government, Fox and North its real leaders.</p>
                <p>Such a ministry could not afford to make a single blunder. The king detested it,
                    and the assumption by the Whig houses of a right to nominate the head of the
                    Government without reference to the natioual interests could never be popular.
                    The blunder was soon committed. Burke, hating wrong and injustice with a bitter
                    hatred, had descried in the government of British India by the East India
                    Company a disgrace to the English name. For many of the actions of that
                    government no honourable man cau think of uttering a word of defence. The
                    helpless natives were oppressed and robbed by the Company and its servants in
                    every possible way. Burke drew up a bill, which was adopted by the coalition
                    Government, for taking all authority in India out of the hands of the Company,
                    and even placing the Company’s management of its own commercial affairs under
                    control. The governing and controlling body was naturally to be a council
                    appointed at home. The question of the nomination of this council at once drew
                    the whole question within the domain of party politics. The whole patronage of
                    India would be in its hands, and, as parliament was then constituted, the
                    balance of parties might be more seriously affected by the distribution of that
                    patronage than it would be now. When, therefore, it was understood that the
                    Government bill meant the council to be named in the bill for four years, or, in
                    other words, to be named by the coalition ministry, it was generally regarded as
                    an unblushing attempt to turn a measure for the good government of India into a
                    measure for securing the ministry in office. The bill of course passed the
                    Commons. When it came before the Lords, it was thrown out in consequence of a
                    message from the king that he would regard any one who voted for it as his
                    euemy.</p>
                <p>The contest had thus become one between the influence of the crown and the
                    influence of the great houses. Constitutional historians, who treat the question
                    as one of merely theoretical politics, leave out of consideration this essential
                    element of the situation, and forget that, if it was wrong for the king to
                    influence the Lords by his message, it was equally wrong for the ministry to
                    acquire for themselves fresh patronage with which to influence the Commons. But
                    there was now, what there had not been in the time of Walpole and the Pelhams, a
                    public opinion ready to throw its weight on one side or the other. The county
                    members still formed the most independent portion of the representation, and
                    there were many possessors of rotten boroughs who were ready to agree with the
                    county members rather thau with the great landowners. In choosing Pitt, the
                    young son of Chatham, for his prime minister, as soon as ho had dismissed the
                    coalition, George III. gave assurance that he wished his counsels to be directed
                    by integrity and ability. After a struggle of many weeks, parliament was
                    dissolved (1784), and the new House of Commons was prepared to support the
                    king’s minister by a large majority.</p>
                <p>As far as names go, the change effected placed in office the new Tory party for
                    an alm03t uninterrupted period of forty-six years. It so happened, however, that
                    after the first eight years of that period had passed by, circumstances occurred
                    which effected so great a change in the composition and character of that party
                    as to render any statement to this effect entirely illusive. During eight years,
                    however, Pitt’s ministry was not merely a Tory ministry resting on the choice of
                    the king, but a Liberal ministry resting on national support and upon advanced
                    political knowledge.</p>
                <p>The nation which Γ ’ itt had behind him was very different from the populace
                    which had assailed Walpole’s Excise Bill, or had shouted for Wilkes and liberty.
                    At the beginning of the century the intellect of thoughtful Englishmen had
                    applied itself to speculative problems of religion and philosophy. In the middle
                    of the century it applied itself to practical problems affecting the employment
                    of industry. In 1776 Adam Smith published the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of
                    Nations.</hi> Already in 1762 the work of Brindley, the Bridgewater canal, the
                    first joint of a network of inland water communication, was opened. In 1767
                    Hargreaves produced the spinning-jenny; Arkwright’s spinning machine was
                    exhibited in 1768; Crompton’s mule was finished in 1779; Cartwright hit upon the
                    idea of the power loom in 1784, though it was not brought into profitable use
                    till 1801. The Staffordshire potteries had been flourishing under Wedgwood since
                    1763, and the improved steam-engine was brought into shape by Watt in 1768.
                    During these years the duke of Bedford, Coke of Hoikham, and Robert Bakewell
                    were busy in the improvement of stock and agriculture.</p>
                <p>The increase of wealth and prosperity caused by these changes went far to produce
                    a large class of the population entirely outside the associations of the
                    landowning class, but with sufficient intelligence to appreciate the advantages
                    of a government carried on without regard to the personal interests and
                    rivalries of the aristocracy. The mode in which that increase of wealth was
                    effected was even more decisive on the ultimate destinies of the country. The
                    substitution of the organization of hereditary monarchy for the organization of
                    wealth and station would ultimately have led to evils as great as those which it
                    superseded. It was only tolerable as a stepping-stone to the organization of
                    intelligence. The larger the numbers admitted to in fluence the affairs of
                    state, the more necessary is it that they respect the powers of intellect. It
                    would be foolish to institute a comparison between an Arkwright or a Crompton
                    and a Locke or a Newton. But it is certain that for one man who could appreciate
                    the importance of the treatise <hi rend="italic">Gn the Human Understanding</hi>
                    or the theory of gravitation, there were thousands who could understand the
                    value of the water-frame or the power-loom. The habit of looking with reverence
                    upon mental power was fostered in no slight measure by the industrial
                    development of the second half of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>The supremacy of intelligence in the political world was, for the time,
                    represented in Pitt. In 1784 he passed an India Bill, which left tho commerce
                    and all except the highest patronage of India in the hands of the East India
                    Company, but which erected a department of the home Government named the Board
                    of Control to compel the Company to carry out such political measures as the
                    Government saw fit. A bill for parliamentary reform was, however, brown out by
                    the opposition of his own supporters in parliament, whilst outside parliament
                    there was no general desire tor a change in a system which for the present
                    produced such excellent fruits. Still more excellent was his plan of 'egislatiυn
                    for Ireland. Irishmen had taken advantage of he weakness of England during the
                    American war to j∏force upon the ministry of the day, in 1780 and 1782, in
                    abandonment of all claim on the part of the English Government and the English
                    judges to interfere in any way with Irishaffairs. From 1782, therefore, there
                    were two ndependent legislatures within the British Isles,—the one sitting at
                    Westminster and the other sitting in Dublin. With these political changes Fox
                    professed himself to be content. Pitt, whose mind was open to wider
                    considerations, proposed to throw open commerce to both nations by removing all
                    the restrictions placed on the trade of Ireland with England aud with the rest
                    of the world. The opposition<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n379/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0379-0360"/> of the English parliament was only removed by
                    concessions continuing some important restrictions upon Irish exports, and by
                    giving the English parliament the right of initiation in all measures relating
                    to the regulation of the trade which was to be common to both nations. The Irish
                    parliament took umbrage at the superiority claimed by England, and threw out the
                    measure as an insult, which, even as it stood, was undeniably in favour of
                    Ireland. The lesson of the incompatibility of two co-ordinate legislatures was
                    not thrown away upon Pitt.</p>
                <p>In 1786 the commercial treaty with France opened that country to English trade,
                    and was the first result of the theories laid down by Adam Smith ten years
                    previously. The first attack upon the horrors of the slave-trade was made in
                    1788; and in the same year, in the debates on the Regency Bill caused by the
                    king’s insanity, Pitt defended against Fox the right of parliament to make
                    provision for the exercise of the powers of the crown when the wearer was
                    permanently or temporarily disabled from exercising his authority.</p>
                <p>r When the king recovered, he went to St Paul’s to return thanks, on the 23d of
                    April 1789. The enthusiasm with which he was greeted showed how completely he
                    had the nation on his side. All the hopes of liberal reformers were now on his
                    side. All the hopes of moral and religious men were on his side as well. The
                    seed sown by Wesley had grown to be a great tree. A spirit of thoughtfulness in
                    religious matters and of moral energy was growing in the nation, and the king
                    was endeared to his subjects as much by his domestic virtues as by his support
                    of the great minister who acted in his name. The happy prospect was soon to be
                    overclouded. On the 4th of May, eleven days after the appearance of George III.
                    at St Paul’s, the French States General met at Versailles.</p>
                <p>By the great mass of intelligent Englishmen the change was greeted with
                    enthusiasm. It is seldom that one nation understands the tendencies and
                    difficulties of another; and the mere fact that power was being transferred from
                    an absolute monarch to a representative assembly led superficial observers to
                    imagine that they were witnessing a mere repetition of the victory of the
                    English parliament over the Stuart kings. In fact, that which was passing in
                    France was of a totally different nature from the English struggle of the 17th
                    century. In England, the conflict had been carried on for the purpose of
                    limiting the power of the king. In France, it was begun in order to sweep away
                    an aristocracy in church and state which had become barbarously oppressive. It
                    was not therefore a conflict touching simply on the political organization of
                    the state. The whole social organization of the country was at stake, and the
                    struggle would be carried on at every point of the territory, and would involve
                    every class of society. In such a conflict, therefore, there was nothing
                    necessarily antagonistic to the maintenance of the most absolute royal power. If
                    there had been a king on the throne who had understood the needs of the times,
                    and who could have placed himself without afterthought at the head of the
                    national movement, he would have been stronger for all good purposes than Lewis
                    XIV. had ever been. Unhappily, it was not in Lewis XVI. to do anything of the
                    kind. Well intentioned and desirous to effect the good of his people, he was not
                    clear-headed enough to understand how it was to be done, or strong-willed enough
                    to carry out any good resolutions to which he might be brought. The one thing
                    impossible for a king was to be neutral in the great division which was opening
                    in French society; and Lewis was too much a creature of habit to throw off the
                    social ties which united him to the aristocracy. It was the knowledge that the
                    king was in heart on the wrong side that made his continuance to rule
                    impossible. Undoubtedly the best thing that the French could have done, after
                    the king’s leanings were known, would have been to dethrone him. But this was
                    not a step which any nation was likely to take in a hurry; and the constitution
                    drawn up by the States General after it passed into the form of the National
                    Assembly was necessarily grounded on suspicion. The one indispensable requisite
                    for the working of a constitution is that it shall be possible to maintain a
                    certain degree of harmony between the various functionaries who are intrusted
                    with the work. Such a harmony was impossible between Lewis and the French
                    nation. Amongst the higher order of minds there might be a desire for liberty,
                    and the word liberty was on the lips of every one. But the thought of liberty
                    was rarely to be found. It was by the passion of equality that the nation was
                    possessed. For the new spirit it was necessary to find new institutions. The old
                    ones had broken down from absolute rottenness, and if they had been other than
                    they were, they were certain to be used on the antinational side. The force must
                    be given to the nation, not to the aristocracy—not to the king, the ally of the
                    aristocracy. Yet all this had to be done when the mass of the nation was rude
                    and uneducated, ignorant and unversed in political life to the last degree, and
                    when, too, it had been taught by the long course of monarchial government to see
                    force placed above right, and was therefore all the more inclined to solve its
                    difficulties by force. What wonder, therefore, if violence took the place of
                    argument, if mob-rule stepped in to enforce the popular over the unpopular
                    reasoning, and the king soon found that he was practically a prisoner in the
                    hands of his subjects.</p>
                <p>In proportion as the French Revolution turned away from the path which English
                    ignorance bad marked out for it, Englishmen turned away from it in disgust. As
                    they did not understand the aims of the French Revolutionists, they were unable
                    to make that excuse for even so much of their conduct as admits of excuse. Three
                    men, Fox, Burke, and Pitt, however, represented three varieties of opinion into
                    which the nation was very unequally divided.</p>
                <p>Fox, generous and trustful towards the movements of large masses of men, had very
                    little intellectual grasp of the questions at issue in France. He treated the
                    struggle as one simply for the establishment of free institutions; and when at
                    last the crimes of the leaders became patent to the world, he contented himself
                    with lamenting the unfortunate fact, and fell back on the argument that though
                    England could not sympathize with the French tyrants, there was no reason why
                    she should go to war with them.</p>
                <p>Burke, on the other hand, while he failed to understand the full tendency of the
                    Revolution for good as well as for evil, understood it far better than any
                    Englishman of that day understood it. He saw that its main aim was equality, not
                    liberty, and that not only would the French nation be ready, in pursuit of
                    equality, to welcome any tyranny which would serve its purpose, but would be the
                    more prone to acts of tyranny over individuals from the complete remodellingof
                    institutions, with the object of giving immediate effect to the will of the
                    ignorant masses, which was especially liable to be counterfeited by designing
                    and unscrupulous agitators. There is no doubt that in all this Burke was in the
                    right, as he was in his denunciation of the mischief certain to follow when a
                    nation tries to start afresh, and to blot out all past progress in the light of
                    simple reason, which is often most fallible when it believes itself to be most
                    infallible. Where he went wrong was in his ignorance of the special
                    circumstances of the French nation, and his consequent blindness to the fact
                    that the historical method of gradual progress was impossible where institutions
                    had become so utterly bad as they were in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n380/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0380-0361"/> France, and that consequently the system of
                    starting afresh, to which he reasonably objected, was to the French a matter not
                    of choice but of necessity. Nor did he see that the passion for equality, like
                    every great passion, justified itself, and that the problem was, not how to
                    obtain liberty in defiance of it, but how so to guide it as to obtain liberty by
                    it and through it.</p>
                <p>Burke did not content himself with pointing out speculatively the evils which he
                    foreboded for the French. He perceived clearly that the effect of the new French
                    principles could no more be confined to French territory than the principles of
                    Protestantism in the 16th century could be confined to Saxony. He knew well that
                    the appeal to abstract reason and the hatred of aristocracy would spread over
                    Europe like a flood, and, as he was in the habit of considering whatever was
                    most opposed to the object of his dislike to be wholly excellent, he called for
                    a crusade of all established Governments against the anarchical principles of
                    dissolution which had broken loose in France.</p>
                <p>Pitt occupied ground apart from either Fox or Burke. He had neither Fox’s
                    sympathy for popular movements nor Burke’s intellectual appreciation of the
                    immediate tendencies of the Revolution. Hence, whilst he pronounced against any
                    active interference with France, he was an advocate of peace, not because he saw
                    more than Fox or Burke, but because he saw less. He fancied that France would be
                    so totally occupied with its own troubles that it would cease for a long time to
                    be dangerous to other nations. A resolution formed on grounds so hopelessly
                    futile was not likely to stand the test of time.</p>
                <p>Even if France had been spared the trial of external pressure, it is almost
                    certain that she would have roused resistance by some attempt to maintain her
                    new principles abroad. When the king of Prussia coalesced with the emperor in
                    1792 to force her to re-establish the royal authority, she broke out into a
                    passion of self-asserting defiance. The king was dethroned, and preparations
                    were made to try him for his life as an accomplice of the invaders. A republic
                    was proclaimed, and in its name innocent persons, whose only crime was to belong
                    to the noble class by birth and feeling, were massacred by hundreds. The grim
                    suspicion which clothed itself with cruelty in the capital became patriotic
                    resistance on the frontier. Before the end of the year the invasion was
                    repulsed, Savoy occupied, the Austrian Netherlands overrun, and the Dutch
                    republic threatened.</p>
                <p>λ ery few Governments in Europe were so rooted in the affections of their people
                    as to be able to look without tenor on the challenge thus thrown out to them.
                    The English Government was one of those very few. No mere despotism was here
                    exercised by the king. No broad impassable line here divided the aristocracy
                    from the people. The work of former generations of Englishmen had been too well
                    done to call for that breach of historical continuity which was a dire necessity
                    in France. There was much need of reform. There was no need of a revolution. The
                    whole of the upper and middle classes, with few exceptions, clung together in a
                    fierce spirit of resistance; and the mass of the lower classes, especially in
                    the country, were too well off to wish for change. The spirit of resistance to
                    revolution quickly developed into a spirit of resistance to reform, and those
                    who continued to advocate changes more or less after the French model were
                    treated as the"enemies of mankind. A fierce hatred of France and of all that
                    attached itself to France became the predominating spirit of the nation.</p>
                <p>Such a change in the national mind could not but affect the constitution of the
                    Whig party. The reasoning of Burke would, in itself, have done little to effect
                    its disruption. But the great landowners, who contributed so strong an element
                    in it, composed the very class which had most to fear from the principles of the
                    Revolution. The old questions which had divided them from the king and Pitt in
                    1783 had dwindled into nothing before the appalling question of the immediate
                    present. They made themselves the leaders of the war party, and they knew that
                    that party comprised almost the whole of the parliamentary classes.</p>
                <p>What could Pitt do but surrender? The whole of the intellectual basis of his
                    foreign policy was swept away when it became evident that the Continental war
                    would bring with it an accession of French territory. He did not abandon his
                    opinions. His opinions rather abandoned him. A wider intelligence might have
                    held that, let France gain what territorial aggrandizement it might upon the
                    Continent, it was impossible to resist such changes until the opponents of
                    France had so purified themselves as to obtain a hold upon the moral feelings of
                    mankind. Pitt could not take this view , perhaps no man in his day could be
                    fairly expected to take it. He did not indeed declare war against France; but he
                    sought to a set a limit to her conquests in the winter, though he had not sought
                    to set a limit to the conquests of the coalesced sovereigns in the preceding
                    summer. He treated with supercilious contempt the National Convention, which had
                    dethroned the king and proclaimed a republic. Above all, he took up a
                    declaration by the Convention, that they would give help to all peoples
                    struggling for liberty against their respective Governments, as a challenge to
                    England. The horror caused in England by the trial and execution of Lewis XVI.
                    completed the estrangement between the two countries, and though the declaration
                    of war came from France (1793), it had been in great part brought about by the
                    bearing of England and its Government.</p>
                <p>In appearance the great Whig landowners gave their support to Pitt, and in 1794
                    some of their leaders, the duke of Portland, Lord Fitzwilliam, and Mr Wyndham,
                    entered the cabiuet to serve under him. In reality it was Pitt who had
                    surrendered. The ministry and the party by which it was supported might call
                    themselves Tory still. But the great reforming policy of 1784 was entirely at an
                    end. Strong as it was, the Government did not know its own strength. It saw
                    sedition and revolution everywhere. It twisted loose talk into criminal intent.
                    It covered the country with its spies. The slightest attempts to concert
                    measures for obtaining reform were branded as revolutionary violence. Men who
                    would otherwise have been content with declaiming in favour of reform were
                    goaded into actual sedition. The Government sought and obtained additional
                    powers from parliament. Fine, imprisonment, and transportation were dealt out by
                    the law courts in lavish measure. The Reign of Terror in France was answered by
                    a reign of violence in England, modified by the political habits of a nation
                    trained to freedom, but resting on the same spirit of fear and intolerance. In
                    November 1794 an attempt was made actually to shed blood. Hardy, Horne Tooke,
                    and Thelwall were brought to trial, on a charge of high treason, for issuing
                    invitations to a national convention intended to promote changes of the greatest
                    magnitude in the government. Happily the jury refused to see in this certainly
                    dangerous proceeding a crime worthy of death, and its verdict of Not guilty
                    saved the nation from the disgrace of meting out the extreme penalty of high
                    treason to an attempt to hold a public meeting for the redress of
                    grievances.</p>
                <p>The public feeling, in fact, regained its composure sooner than the ministry. The
                    upper and middle classes became conscious of their own strength; and though
                    reform and reformers were as unpopular as ever, the instruments by which reform
                    might be gained hereafter were left <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n381/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0381-0362"/> untouched for the use of a future generation. The
                    Sedition and Treason Bills, passed in 1795, were limited in their duration, and
                    were never actually put in force.</p>
                <p>In the meanwhile, Pitt’s management of the Avar was leading, as far as the
                    Continent was concerned, to failure after failure. Nothing else was possible. He
                    had none of the abilities of a war minister, and his system of sending detached
                    expeditions to various points was not calculated to attain success. Nor is it
                    likely that, even if he had been more competent in this respect, he would have
                    accomplished anything worthy of the efforts which he put forth. It has been said
                    that if he had roused the passions of men, and had proclaimed a holy war upon
                    the Continent, he would have had a better chance of gaining his ends. But
                    passions cannot be artificially excited, and a holy war presupposes a cause
                    which, if it is not holy in itself, will at least be supposed by men to be so.
                    Except under special circumstances, however, it was impossible to rouse
                    enthusiasm against the French republic. Toulon might be succoured and abandoned
                    in 1793; La.Vendée might have fallacious hopes held out to it in 1794. Frenchmen
                    who were shocked at the habitual employment of the guillotine were yet not
                    inclined to rise at the bidding of a foreign invader against a Government which
                    at all events stood manfully up for the integrity of French territory, whilst
                    the long habit of submission to absolute rule had made the nation slow to take
                    the conduct of affairs into its own hands. The middle classes on the Continent
                    too were on the side of the peasants, and looked to Freuch principles if not to
                    French armies as offering an amelioration of their lot. The Austrian
                    Netherlands, regained from France in <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> 1793, were
                    reconquered by France in 1794; and a British force under the duke of York did
                    nothing to avert the misfortune. The land was annexed to the territory of the
                    French republic. Early in 1795 the Dutch Netherlands were revolutionized and
                    constituted into a republic in alliance with France. In the same year Prussia
                    made peace with France. Austria continued the contest alone, receiving large
                    sums of money from England, and doing very little in return.</p>
                <p>If England could do little for the Continent, she could <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> do enough to insure her own safety. Howe’s victory of the 1st of June
                    (1794) inflicted the first of a long series of defeats on the French navy. An
                    attempt in 1795 to support the French royalists by a landing in Quiberon Bay
                    ended in failure, but Ceylon and the Cape of Good Hope were taken from the
                    Dutch. The war, however, had become so expensive, and its results were evidently
                    so small, that there was a growing feeling in England in favour of peace,
                    especially as the Reign of Terror had come to an end in 1794, and a regular
                    Government, the Directory, had been appointed in 1795. Accordingly, in 1796 Lord
                    Malmesbury was sent to France to treat for peace; but the negotiation was at
                    once broken off by his demand that France should abandon the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>The French Government, buoyed up by the successes of General Bonaparte, who was
                    driving the Austrians out of Italy, resolved to attempt an invasion of Ireland.
                    In December a French fleet, with Hoche on board, sailed for Bantry Bay. Only
                    part of it arrived there, and retreated without effecting anything. A smaller
                    force, landing in Pembrokeshire, was reduced to surrender.</p>
                <p>i The French attempted to renew the enterprise in the following year. Spain was
                    now in alliance with France, and it was proposed that a Spanish fleet should
                    join the . French fleet and the Dutch fleet for a joint invasion.</p>
                <p>Jervis defeated the Spanish fleet at St Vincent, and Duncan defeated the Dutch
                    fleet at Camperdown (1797). During the same year a mutiny in the fleet at
                    Spithead and St Helens was quieted by concessions to the reasonable complaints
                    of the sailors; whilst an unreasonable mutiny at the Nore was suppressed by
                    firmness in resistance. A renewed attempt to negotiate peace at lalle had ended
                    in failure, because, though the English were this time ready to abandon the
                    Netherlands to France, they were not ready to give back the Cape of Good Hope to
                    the Dutch and Trinidad to Spain. Before the end of the year England had no ally
                    in Europe excepting Portugal. Bonaparte had dictated to Austria the treaty of
                    Campo Formio.</p>
                <p>Isolated as Great Britain was, there was less inclination to make peace in
                    England in 1798 than there had been in 1795. In proportion as France fell into
                    the hands of the less violent but more corrupt of the Revolutionists, the
                    enthusiasm which her proclamation of principles had once created amongst the
                    class excluded from political power died away; whilst the antagonism aroused by
                    mere mi <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> i-tary conquest under the conduct of the
                    rapacious Bonaparte was on the increase. The attempt at invasion had roused the
                    national spirit to stubborn resistance; whilst the Government itself, warned by
                    the failure of the proceedings against Hardy and his associates, and freed from
                    the blind terror which had made it violent during the first years of the war,
                    was able to devote its energies unreservedly to carrying on hostilities.</p>
                <p>If, however, a French invasion had ever been anything more than a dream, it was
                    because there was one quarter in which misgovernment had created a state of
                    circumstances by which it was absolutely invited. At the end of 1794 Lord
                    Fitzwilliam had been sent to Ireland as lordlieutenant, and had set his face
                    against the vile jobbery through which the leaders of the Protestant minority
                    governed Ireland, and had thrown himself warmly into the encouragement of
                    Grattan’s scheme for the admission of the Catholics to political power. The
                    aggrieved jobbers gained the ear of the king, and in 1795 Fitzwilliam was
                    recalled. Then ensued a scene which has no parallel even in the organized
                    massacres of the French Republic. The Catholics joined in a society called the
                    United Irishmen, to enforce their claims, if need be by an alliance with France,
                    aud the establishment of an independent republic. Deeds of violence preluded any
                    actual attempt at insurrection. The Protestants, under the name of Orangemen,
                    gathered to the support of the Government as yeomanry or militiamen. Before long
                    these guardians of the peace had spread terror over all Catholic Ireland. By the
                    lash, by torture, by the defilement of chaste and innocent women, they made
                    their predominance felt. It was in 1796, in the very midst of these abominable
                    horrors, that French ships had appeared but had been unable to land troops in
                    Bantry Bay. Nevertheless, though no assistance was to be had, the United
                    Irishmen rose in rebellion in 1798. The rebellion was suppressed, and again the
                    militiamen and volunteers were let loose to establish order by massacre and
                    violence. Fortunately, the English Government intervened, and a new
                    lord-lieutenant, the marquis of Cornwallis, was sent over to Dublin. The raging
                    Protestant aristocracy was held back from further deeds of cruelty and
                    vengeance, and law and order were established so far as it was possible to
                    establish them in a land so torn by hostile factions.</p>
                <p>Pitt rose to the occasion. He planned a great scheme of union between the two
                    nations (1799). There was to be one parliament for Great Britain and Ireland, as
                    there was one parliament for England and Scotland. The jobbers who filled the
                    seats in the Irish House of Commons, and who voted in the name of a people whom
                    they in no. sense represented, joined the few members who from a sense of
                    patriotism refused to vote away so easy a source of wealth and influence. Pitt
                    bought the votes which he could not command, and the Irish parliament<pb

                    itself (1800), It depended on the English Government whether this change, by
                    which Ireland lost the semblance of national independence, should be followed by
                    a step in advance for that country in a serious attempt to diminish the evils of
                    Protestant supremacy. That step Pitt had pledged himself to take, and in 1801 he
                    had prepared a measure for admitting the Catholics to political power. The king
                    stood in the way, and Pitt resigned office rather than forfeit his word.</p>
                <p>The year which witnessedPitt’s failure in domestic legislation also witnessed his
                    failure in military effort. In 1798 Bonaparte sailed for Egypt with the
                    intention of setting up a French dominion in the East. The fleet which conveyed
                    him was annihilated after his landing by Nelson at the battle of the Nile. Pitt
                    seized the opportunity of the great general’s absence from Europe to organize a
                    second coalition against France. In the campaign of 1799 Italy was regained from
                    France, and in the East Bonaparte was driven back from Acre by the Turks headed
                    by Sir Sidney Smith. The news of French disasters brought him hurriedly back to
                    Euι∩pe, but before he could take part in the war Massena had defeated the
                    coalition at Zurich. Λ <hi rend="italic">coup tl'etaf,</hi> however, placed
                    Bonaparte, under the name of first consul, in practical possession of absolute
                    power; and in the following year his great victory at Marengo (1801), followed
                    up by Moreau’s victory of Hohenlinden, enabled him to dictate as a conqueror the
                    tιeaty of Lunéville, by which France entered c·nce more into possession of the
                    frontier of the Rhine. By this treaty not only was England again isolated, but
                    she found herself exposed to new enemies. Her enforcement of the right of search
                    to enable her ships to take enemies’ goods out of neutral vessels exasperated
                    even friendly powers, and Russia was joined by Sweden and Denmark to enforce
                    resistance to the claim. It was under these circumstances that Pitt’s
                    resignation was announced.</p>
                <p>The successor of the great minister was Addington, whose mind was imbued with all
                    the Protestant prejudices of the king, which were, it must be owned, the
                    Protestant prejudices of the nation. He had neither force of character nor
                    strength of intellect. Nelson’s victory at Copenhagen, which crushed the naval
                    power of Denmark and broke up the Northern Alliance, and the landing of
                    Aber-croιnby in Aboukir Bay, followed by the victory of Alexandria and the
                    consequent evacuation of Egypt by the French, were events prepared by the former
                    administration. Addington’s real work was the peace of Amiens (1802), an
                    experimental peace, as the king called it, to see il' the first cousul could be
                    contented to restrain himself within the very wide limits by which his authority
                    in Europe was still circumscribed.</p>
                <p>Tn a few months England was made aware that the experiment would not succeed.
                    Interference and annexation became the standing policy of the new French
                    Government. England, discovering how little intention Bonaparte had of carrying
                    out the spirit of the treaty, refused to abandon Malta, as she had engaged to do
                    by the terms of peace.</p>
                <p>The war began again, no longer a war against certain principles, and the
                    extension of dominion resulting from the victory of those principles, but
                    against aggressive despotism, wielding military force, conducted by consummate
                    military genius, and setting at naught the rights of populations as well as the
                    claims of rulers. This time the English nation was all but unanimous in
                    resistance. This time its resistance would be sooner or later supported by all
                    that was healthy in Europe.</p>
                <p>The spirit of England was fully roused by the news that Bonaparte was preparing
                    invasion. Volunteers were enrolled in defence of the country, There was a
                    general belief that the [»rime minister was not equal to the crisis. Addington
                    retired, and Pitt again became prime minister (1804). He would gladly have
                    joined Fox in forming an administration on a broader basis than his former one.
                    But the king objected to Fox, and some of Pitt’s old friends refused to desert
                    the proscribed statesman. Pitt became the head of a ministry of which he was the
                    only efficient member.</p>
                <p>England was strong enough to hold her own against Bonaparte, who was now
                    Napoleon, emperor of the French (1805). Nelson crushed the combined French and
                    Spanish fleets at Trafalgar, paying with his owm life for a victory which put an
                    end to the French naval power for the remainder of the war. The iron of
                    Napoleon’s tyranny had not yet entered into the Continental nations sufficiently
                    to rouse them to a truly popular resistance. A third coalition ended in as
                    complete a disaster as that in which the first and second had ended. Austria
                    lost a large part of her force in the capitulation of Ulm, and the Austrian and
                    Russian armies were overpowered at Austerlitz. To effect these victories the
                    force which threatened the invasion of England would necessarily have been
                    withdrawn, even if the result of the battle of Trafalgar had not made the
                    enterprise hopeless. Pitt died shortly after receiving the news of the disasters
                    of his allies (1806).</p>
                <p>Pitt’s death forced the king to accept a ministry of which Fox was a member. This
                    ministry of All the Talents, as it was called, was not successful in the conduct
                    of the war. Its year of office was the year in which Prussia was crushed at
                    Jena, and it dissipated the strength of the English army in unimportant distant
                    expeditions, instead of throwing it upon one spot to aid Prussia or Russia. Its
                    great title to fame -is the abolition of the slave trade. Fox’s death deprived
                    the ministry of its strongest member, and in the following year an attempt on
                    its part to admit Roman Catholics to the naval and military service of the crown
                    drew from the king a demand for an engagement never to propose any concession to
                    the Catholics. They refused to make any such promise, and were summarily ejected
                    from office. The king’s firm stand was popular in England. The reaction against
                    the French Revolution no longer demanded the infliction of penalties upon those
                    who promulgated its doctrines; but a spirit had been produced which was
                    inexorable against all attempts to effect any change for the better. A spirit of
                    blind, unreasoning conservatism had taken the place of the enlightened Toryism
                    of Pitt’s earlier days.</p>
                <p>The new ministry (1807), under the nominal leadership of the duke of Portland,
                    had to face Napoleon alone. The battle of Friedland and the peace of Tilsit left
                    him master of the greater part of the Continent. Prussia and Austria were
                    already stripped of territory; and as protector of the Confederation of the
                    Rhine, Napoleon ruled in Germany. Italy was directly subjected to his power.
                    Unable to make war upon England by his fleets and armies, he attempted to subdue
                    her by ruining her commerce. By the Berlin decree (1807), he declared the whole
                    of the British islands to be in a state of blockade, though he had not a single
                    ship at sea to enforce his declaration. He declared all British manufactured
                    goods prohibited wherever his power reached, and excluded from his dominions
                    even neutral ships which had touched at a British port, The British Government,
                    instead of leaving Napoleon to bear the odium of this attack on neutral
                    commerce, retaliated by Orders in Council conceived in the spirit of his own
                    measure. They declared that all vessels trading with France were liable to
                    seizure, and that all such vessels clearing from a hostile port must touch at a
                    British port to pay customs duties. Napoleon answered by the Milan <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n383/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0383-0364"/> decree, forbidding neutrals to trade in any
                    article imported from any part of the British dominions. The Orders in Council
                    cost England a war with America. The Berlin and Milan decrees contributed
                    largely to the overthrow of Napoleon’s power. Every poor man who was debarred
                    from the means of providing sugar or cloth for his family felt the grievance.
                    The French Republic had declared war against the nobles and the higher classes;
                    Napoleon decreed an oppression which was bitterly felt in every cottage.</p>
                <p>In pursuit of his design of forcing the Continental system, as he termed it, on
                    Portugal, Napoleon sent Junot to occupy Lisbon, and dethroned the king in 1807.
                    In 1808 he seized on the royal family of Spain, and offered the crown to his
                    brother Joseph. When the Spaniards resisted, the English Government sent troops
                    to the Peninsula. Defeated at Vimeira, Junot was allowed to evacuate Portugal.
                    Napoleon came to the rescue of his lieutenants in Spain, and though he retired
                    without effecting the expulsion of the English, Sir John Moore was slain at
                    Corunna (1809) after inflicting a repulse on the French, and his army was
                    shipped for England. In the summer Wellesley lauded in Portugal. Thanks to a
                    fresh aggressive war of Napoleon against Austria, he was able to make his
                    footing sure, though the English ministry sent large forces to perish in the
                    marshes of Walcheren, which might have been better employed in supporting
                    Wellesley at the time when he was driven to retreat before superior numbers
                    after the fruitless victory of Talavera.</p>
                <p>In 1810 Wellesley, now known under the name of Wellington, beat back the masses
                    of the French forces under Massena from behind the lines of Torres Vedras.
                    Wellington’s resistance was great as a military exploit. But it was far more
                    than a military exploit. It would have been of little avail to linger, however
                    safely, in a corner of Portugal unless he were sure of better allies than the
                    wretched Spanish soldiers who had looked on whilst he fought for them at
                    Talavera. Wellington saw clearly that there is no ally so strong as the
                    arrogance and injustice of an enemy. His firm hope was that Napoleon would ruin
                    himself, and his hope did not deceive him. In 1812 Napoleon wrecked his finest
                    army on the snows of Russia. Wellington had breathing space to issue forth from
                    Portugal, to seize the frontier fortresses of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajos, and to
                    win the battle of Salamanca. In 1813 Germany rose against its oppressor. The
                    victory of Leipsic drove the despot over the Rhine, and the victory of Vittoria
                    drove his lieutenants over the Pyrenees. The peoples of Europe were against him.
                    In 1814 he was driven into exile at Elba. Wellington’s last victory in this war
                    was won at Toulouse after the abdication of the emperor. In 1815 the emperor
                    returned and seized the throne once more. England and Prussia were the first in
                    the field, and the crushing blow at Waterloo consigned him to a life long exile
                    at St Helena.</p>
                <p>The war with America, begun in 1812, had been caused by the pressure of the
                    English naval force on neutral commerce under the Orders in Council, which the
                    British Government refused to withdraw till it was too late, and by its claim to
                    impress British seamen when serving on board American ships. The war was brought
                    to an end by the treaty of Ghent (1814).</p>
                <p>After a long war the difficulties of the victors are often greater than those of
                    the conquered. The conquered have their attention directed to the reparation of
                    losses, and are inspired by a patriotic desire to submit to sacrifices for the
                    sake of their country. The victors are in the frame of mind which expects
                    everything to be easy, and they have been accustomed to direct their energies to
                    the business of overpowering foreign enemies, and to hide their eyes from the
                    constant watchfulness required by the needs of the population at home. The war
                    out of which England had come was more than ever calculated to foster this
                    tendency to domestic inaction. To the governing classes despotism, revolution,
                    and reform were almost synonymous. Ministries had succeeded one another:
                    Perceval followed Portland in</p>
                <p>1809, and Liverpool followed Perceval in 1812. They were all alike in abhorrence
                    of the very idea of change, in the entire abandonment of those principles of
                    active and intelligent government by which Pitt, whose followers they professed
                    to be, had been always inspired. The supremacy of the proprietors of land, and
                    absolute resistance to reform, were accepted as the rule of government. It made
                    no difference that the king had become permanently insane in</p>
                <p>1810, and that the base and sensual prince of Wales became regent in 1811, till
                    he ascended the throne in 1820 as George IV.</p>
                <p>The wrongs of the propertied classes could make themselves lieaid. In 1815 a corn
                    law had been passed prohibiting the import of corn till the price was above 80s.
                    a quarter In 1816 the ministry were compelled to submit to the repeal of the
                    property tax, and abandoned the malt tax without pressure. In the meanwhile the
                    agricultural and industrial poor were on the verge of starvation. It would be
                    absurd to draw too close a comparison between the position of the English upper
                    classes at this time and of the French upper classes before the Revolution. But
                    there was the same tendency to use political power as a support for their own
                    material interests, the same neglect of the wants and feelings of those who had
                    none to help them. Those in authority were naturally startled when, at a time
                    when mobs driven to desperation were breaking machines and burning ricks,
                    Cobbett in his <hi rend="italic">Weekly Political Register</hi> was advocating
                    universal suffrage and annual parliaments. The revolution struck down in France
                    appeared to be at the doors in England.</p>
                <p>In great part, no doubt, the misery was brought about by causes over which no
                    Government could have had any control,—by the breaking up of the irregular
                    channels through which commerce had flowed during the war. But it was in great
                    part, too, owing to the incidence of the protective system to which the
                    Government, widely departing from the track marked out by the early steps of
                    Pitt, was giving effect with the full support of the manufacturing as well as
                    the landowning class.</p>
                <p>A riot in London (1816), and a missile thrown at the carriage of the prince
                    regent, roused in parliament something like the repressive violence of 1794.
                    Even the brilliant Canning, the ablest of the disciples of Pitt, declaimed
                    against the parliamentary reform which was now asked for in so many quarters.
                    Acts, of which the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act was the most severe, were
                    passed to strengthen the hands of the ministry. Seditious meetings, mingled with
                    real or imaginary projects of insurrection, kept the alarm of the upper classes
                    on the stretch. But, as in 1794, juries were suspicious of evidence furnished by
                    spies, and refused to convict on insufficient proof.</p>
                <p>The strife between classes culminated in 1819. Large meetings in the open air
                    were held in the great towns, and inflammatory speeches were freely addressed „
                    to them. Some of the speakers were arrested. At Stockport the constable in
                    clnrge of one of the prisoners was attacked and shot. Birmingham, a great
                    unrepresented town, elected a “legislatorial attorney.” A large meeting was
                    summoned at Manchester, another great unrepresented town, to follow the example.
                    The meeting was declared by the magistrates to be illegal, and another meeting
                    was accordingly summoned for the undoubtedly legal purpose of petitioning for
                    parliamentary reform. On the appointed day thousands <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0384-0365"/> poured in from the surrounding districts. These
                    men had been previously drilled, for the purpose, as their own leaders asserted,
                    of enabling them to preserve order,—for the purpose, as the magistrates
                    suspected, of preparing them to take part in an armed insurrection. A fruitless
                    attempt by the magistrates to arrest a popular agitator named Hunt as he was
                    preparing to address the crowd was followed up by a charge of cavalry. Six
                    persons were killed, and a far larger number were wounded in the onslaught. The
                    Manchester massacre divided the kingdom into opposite camps. The use of military
                    violence roused a feeling which struck a chord of old English feeling inherited
                    from the days when Oliver’s dragoons had made themselves hated. Large meetings
                    were held to protest, and were addressed by men who had but little sympathy with
                    the previous agitation. Parliament replied by enacting new laws, known as the
                    Six Acts, in restraint of sedition, by sharpening the powers of the
                    administrators of justice. The Government took up the same antagonistic position
                    against the right of Englishmen to meet for political purposes which had been
                    taken up in the days of the Reign of Terror. But the very fact that there was no
                    reign of terror on the other side of the Channel weakened its hands. The
                    intelligence of the country was no longer on their side. Lord Sidmouth, the
                    Addington who had made so inefficient a prime minister, was not the man to gain
                    support as home secretary for a policy of severity which was only the disguise
                    of weakness; and Lord Castlereagh, to whom was intrusted the manage ment of
                    foreign affairs, had disgusted all generous minds by his sympathy with despotic
                    rule upon the Continent.</p>
                <p>Soon after George IV. became king, on the death of his father in 1829, the
                    alienation of the people from the Government was marked by the indignation
                    aroused by the attempts of ministers to pass a Bill of Pains and Penalties
                    depriving the new queen of her rights as the wife of the sovereign on the ground
                    of the alleged immorality of her conduct. Even those who suspected or believed
                    that her conduct had not been blameless, were shocked at an attempt made by a
                    king whose own life was one of notorious profligacy, and whose conduct towards
                    his wife had been cruel and unfeeling, to gain his own ends at the expense of
                    one whom he had expelled from his home and had exposed to every form of
                    temptation. The failure of the ministers to carry the Bill of Pains and
                    Penalties was a turning-point in the history of the country. The existing system
                    lost its hold on the moral feelings as well as on the intelligence of the
                    nation. For some time to come, sympathy with parliamentary reform would be
                    confined to the ranks of the Opposition. But in 1822 the death of Lord
                    Castlereagh, who had recently become Lord Londonderry, and the retirement of
                    Lord Sidmouth, placed Canning in the secretaryship for foreign affairs and Peel
                    at the home office.</p>
                <p>Canning carried the foreign policy of the country in a new direction. The desire
                    for peace had led the ministry to support the Holy Alliance, a league formed
                    between the absolute sovereigns of the Continent for the suppression in common
                    of all popular movements. Canning broke loose from these old traditions. He made
                    himself loved or hated by offering, without purpose of aggression or
                    aggrandizement, aid or countenance to nations threatened by the great despotic
                    monarchies; and he thus to some extent placed limits on the power of the
                    military despotisms of Europe. Far more cautious and conservative than Canning,
                    Peel took up the work which had been begun by Romilly, and put an end to the
                    barbarous infliction of the penalty of death for slight offences. After
                    Canning’s short ministry, followed by his death (1827), Peel, after consenting
                    to the abolition of the Test and Corporation Acts, passed a bill, in conjunction
                    with the new prime minister the duke of Wellington, to admit Catholics to a seat
                    in parliament, thus carrying out Pitt’s great plan, though sadly late. From 1823
                    to 1828 Huskisson, as president of the Board of Trade, had been at work
                    loosening the bonds of commercial restriction, and thus carrying out Pitt’s
                    policy in another direction.</p>
                <p>Such changes, however, were only an instalment of those which were demanded by
                    the now ripened public opinion of the country; and as the ministers had not been
                    the initiators of the late concessions to Catholics and dissenters, they failed
                    to obtain any enthusiastic support from reformers; whilst the fact that the
                    concessions had been made alienated the opponents of reform. On the death of
                    George IV. and the accession of William IV. (1830), a new ministry, a
                    combination of Whigs and Canningites, came into office under Lord Grey.</p>
                <p>After a struggle lasting over more than a year, parliamentary reform was carried
                    in the teeth of the opposition of the House of Lords. The franchise was so
                    arranged as to give a very large share of influence to the middle classes of the
                    towns. But though the landowning aristocracy was no longer supreme, it was by no
                    means thrown on the ground. Lords and gentlemen of large estate and ancient
                    lineage had taken the lead in the reforming cabinet, and the class which had the
                    advantages of leisure and position on its side would have no difficulty in
                    leading, as soon as it abandoned the attempt to stand alone. Fortunately, too,
                    at the time when the institutions of our country were refounded on a broader
                    basis, science had long taken a form which impressed the minds of the people
                    with a reverence for knowledge. Mechanical invention, which had accomplished
                    such wonders in the middle of the 18th century, entered upon a fresh period of
                    development when the first passenger railway train was dragged by a locomotive
                    in 1830. Mental power applied to the perfecting of manufacture is not in itself
                    higher than mental power applied in other directions, but it is more easily
                    understood and more readily respected. Experience taught large masses of men to
                    submit to the guidance of those who knew what they did not know. Amongst
                    statesmen, too, the shock to the old order produced an open mind for the
                    reception of new ideas, and the necessity of basing authority on a wider
                    foundation produced a desire for the spread of education, and gave rise to a
                    popular literature which aimed at interpreting to the multitude the thoughts by
                    which their con duct might be influenced.</p>
                <p>The first great act of the reformed parliament bore the impress of the higher
                    mind of the nation. The abolition of slavery (1833) in all British colonies did
                    credit to its heart; the new poor-law (1834) did credit to its understanding. An
                    attempt to strip the Irish established church of some of its revenues broke up
                    the ministry. There were differences amongst the members of the Government, and
                    those differences were echoed in the country. The king was frightened at the
                    number of changes demanded, dismissed his ministers, and intrusted the formation
                    of a new Government to Sir Robert Peel. The new Government abandoned the title
                    of Tory for the title of Conservative.</p>
                <p>It was the last time that the sovereign actively interfered in the change of a
                    ministry. The habits of parliament had been much changed since the days of the
                    Regency Bill of 1788, when it was acknowledged by all that a change of ministry
                    would follow the announcement of the accession of the Prince of Wales to power,
                    without any corresponding change in the political temper of parliament. Sinecure
                    appointments had recently been lopped away with an unsparing hand, and the power
                    of corrupting members of parliament had been taken away. The character of the
                    members themselves had risen. They were more deeply interested in political
                    causes themselves, and were too clearly brought under the full light of
                    publicity to make it possible forthem <pb break="no"

                    which their fathers had succumbed.</p>
                <p>The new minister dissolved parliament. The increase in the numbers of his
                    followers showed that the country had to some extent taken alarm. But he could
                    not command a majority, and he resigned office in favour of Lord . Melbourne
                    (1835). The Melbourne ministry signalized its accession to office by the reform
                    of the municipal corpora- • tions. Then came the lowering of the stamp duty on
                    newspapers and the Tithe Commutation Act (1836), benefiting the landholders and
                    the clergy alike. The foundation was laid of many a beneficial change.</p>
                <p>The accession of Queen Victoria (1837) did not cut short the tenure of power of
                    the ministry. But the condition of the manufacturing poor was deplorably, and it
                    gave rise to the Chartist agitation for admission to equal political rights with
                    the middle classes. A large body of Chartists threatened an appeal to physical
                    force, and the terror produced by these threats swelled the tide of Conservative
                    reaction. The ministry suffered, too, from a lack of financial ability. They
                    were bold enough where they saw their way. The introduction of the penny postage
                    (1840) was a daring: step in the face of embarrassed finances, though it might
                    be supported by the success of the lowering of the newspaper stamp duty in 1836.
                    In 1841 ministers produced f ree trade measures as the best remedy for existing
                    evils. But they were already discredited by past ill success in the management
                    of the exchequer, and the hostile majority in the new parliament which carried
                    Peel to power was the expression as much of want of confidence in their ability
                    as of dislike of their measures.</p>
                <p>The Conservative ministry followed in the steps of its predecessors. An income
                    tax was once more laid on (1842) to enable the prime minister to reduce the
                    duties on imports. With respect to corn, he imposed a sliding scale of duties,
                    which shut out foreign corn in seasons of low prices, and allowed it to come in
                    in seasons of high prices. Outside parliament a great association, the
                    Anti-Corn-Law League, with Richard Cobden as its principal spokesman, poured
                    forth unanswerable arguments on behalf of the entire freedom from duty of
                    imported food. It was a fortunate circumstance that the free trade doctrines won
                    their way by degrees. Victories aie not won by reason alone, and it is no wonder
                    that after a parliament in which the landowners were more than usually strong
                    had deprived the manufacturers of protection, the manufacturers discovered that
                    the arguments which had been found good in their case would also hold good in
                    the case of the land owners, especially after they had learnt from their own ex
                    perience that prosperity was likely to result from the change. At last Sir
                    Robert Peel, shaken by argument and moved by the difficulty of providing for an
                    Irish famine, proposed and carried the repeal of the corn duties (1846).</p>
                <p>Peel’s resolution broke up his party, and made bis retirement from office
                    inevitable. Lord John Russell, who succeeded him, completed the system which
                    Peel had established. The markets were thrown open to foreign as well as to
                    colonial sugar (1846), and the repeal of the navigation laws (1847) enabled the
                    merchant to employ foreign ships and seamen in the conveyance of his goods; and
                    after the. short ministry of Lord Derby (1852), another sweeping abolition of
                    duties was carried by Mr Gladstone as chancellor of the exchequer in the
                    ministry of Lord Aberdeen (1853).</p>
                <p>The changes in the direction of free trade were accompanied by a large number of
                    other changes which have left their mark on the statute-book and on the habits
                    of the people. There is no mistaking the tendency of this great era of
                    legislation under the influence of the reform by which the balance of power had
                    swayed over to the middle classes in 1832. The idea which was steadily making
                    its way was the idea of testing all questions by the interest of the nation as a
                    whole, and of disregarding in comparison the special interests of particular
                    classes. It was this idea which lay at the root of the scientific doctrine on
                    which the free traders founded their practice, and which com mended that
                    practice to imaginations as well as to the desires of the mass of the
                    population.</p>
                <p>This combination of thought with popular movement towards equality was but one of
                    the manifestations of that greater movement which had been 'passing over Europe
                    ever since the beginning of the French Revolution. It was assisted by the
                    character of the material progress of the time. When the soil of the country was
                    covered with a network of railways, when the electric telegraph began to come
                    into use, and all parts of the country were brought into closer connection with
                    one another, when the circulation of books and newspapers became more easy and
                    more rapid, the sense of unity grew' stronger with the growth of the means of
                    communication. Nor was it only the sense of the unity of the various parts of
                    the country which was growing. Class drew nearer to class, and the wants, the
                    desires, and the prejudices of each were better understood than they had
                    formerly been. Slowly but surely the influence of education spread. The duty of
                    legislating for the benefit of the weak and the poor was better understood,
                    tempered by an increasing understanding of the evils of interference with
                    liberty of action. In the midst of the tendency to equality, the old English
                    belief in the virtue of liberty was strengthened by the knowledge imparted by a
                    more scientific conception of human nature.</p>
                <p>It was impossible that this change should pass over the national mind without
                    giving rise to a desire to include the working class in that body of electors in
                    whose hands political power was ultimately placed. Before the end of Lord John
                    Russell’s ministry, a new Reform Bill had been introduced by the Government
                    (1852), but it did not pass into law Soon after Lord Aberdeen's accession to
                    office the mind of the nation was too completely taken up with foreign affairs
                    to attend to organic changes at home. The attack upon Turkey by the emperor of
                    Russia was resisted by the allied forces of England and France. England was
                    jealous of Russian advancement in the East; and in the hands of the emperor
                    Nicholas the government of Russia was a military despotism so brutal, and was so
                    heavily laid in the scale in opposition to all liberal progress on the
                    Continent, that England and France might well have been regarded as fighting the
                    battle of Europe as well as contending in their own cause. The invasion of the
                    Crimea and the victory of the Alma were followed by the siege of Sebastopol and
                    the successful defence of the heights above Inkerman (1854). Inexperience in war
                    left the English army especially exposed to hardships in the winter; and when
                    operations were resumed in the summer, it was far outnumbered by its French
                    allies, who consequently gained the greater part of the credit of the capture of
                    Sebastopol (1855). In the following winter mistakes had been corrected, and the
                    condition of the English army was worthy of the nation which sent it forth. The
                    peace which was signed at Paris (1856) deprived it of the opportunity of showing
                    its powers. The terms, so far as they imposed, restrictions upon Russia, have
                    not proved of any permanent value; and the idea which then prevailed that the
                    Turks were likely to advance in the course of political and social improvement
                    was without any corresponding basis in the region of facts It was quite right
                    that the settlement of the unhappy regions commonly known as Turkey in Europe
                    should be taken up as European rather than a Russian duty, but it is a duty the
                    distractions or jealousies of European powers left unfulfilled, till Russia at
                    last stepped <pb break="no"

                    results of the Crimean war are to be found in the removal of the pressure with
                    which Russia had weighed on the nations of the Continent; and it may perhaps be
                    fairly argued that the subsequent happy formation of a united Italy and a united
                    Germany were in part rendered possible by the success of England and France
                    under the walls of Sebastopol.</p>
                <p>For some time after the Crimean war the business of legislation proceeded without
                    any very great shocks. The suppression of a vast military rebellion in India
                    (1857) was followed by the assumption of the direct authority over India by the
                    crown. Though one or two attempts were made to effect an electoral reform, they
                    were wrecked on the apathy or hostility of the nation, and there was general
                    acquiescence in the course pursued by Lord Palmerston’s ministry (1859), which,
                    after one half-hearted attempt, refused to proceed further with the measure
                    which it had proposed; whilst a succession of financial improvements were
                    carried out by Mr Gladstone, his chancellor of the exchequer. On Lord
                    Palmerston’s death (1865), the new Government, with Earl Russell at its head and
                    Mr Gladstone as the leader of the House of Commons, proposed a measure of
                    reform, and resigned on failing to carry it (1866). Lord Derby succeeded, and Mr
                    Disraeli introduced an elaborate and complicated measure in the House of
                    Commons. By this time the feeling of the working class had risen, and the
                    necessary impulse was thus given to the House. The measure was modified and
                    amplified, and became the law of the land (1867). The working class took its
                    place by the side of the middle and upper class.</p>
                <p>As in 1832, a new spirit was breathed into legislation. The first parliament
                    elected under the new system (1868) gave a majority against the opinions of the
                    Conservative ministry. Mr Gladstone became prime minister. The Irish Episcopal
                    Church was disestablished, and the Irish land laws reformed. The ballot was
                    applied to parliamentary elections, a new and improved system of elementary
                    education was set on foot, and the practice of purchasing promotions in the army
                    abolished. But no amount of zeal for improvement will make Englishmen hasty to
                    forget the need of caution and moderation. The time came when the nation was no
                    longer in a reforming mood. Interests of classes and trades were able to make
                    themselves heard. Personal ill-feeling was roused by some members of the
                    ministry, and a new parliament showed a large majority in support of a
                    Conservative ministry (1874). It would not be in place here to discuss the
                    difficulties of the present or the prospects of the future. (s. <hi

                <p>[The substitution of two secretaries for one was the consequence of the increase
                    of business. There was no distinction of departments, each secretary taking
                    whatever work the king saw fit to entrust him with. During the reigns of the
                    first two Stuarts, however, there was a tendency to entrust one secretary with
                    the correspondence with Protestant states and their allies, and the other with
                    the correspondence with Catholic states. Probably in the reign of Charles II.,
                    and certainly as early as 1691, two departments, the Northern and the Southern,
                    were instituted. The secretary for the former took the Low Countries, Germany,
                    Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and Russia. The secretary for the latter took France,
                    Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Turkey. Home affairs were common to
                    both. Ireland and the Colonies fell to the former secretary. Even when the
