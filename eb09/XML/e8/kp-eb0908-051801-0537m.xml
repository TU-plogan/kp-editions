                    (1524-1583), was born at Baden in Switzerland on the 7th of September 1524. His
                    family name was Liebier or Lieber, <hi rend="italic">Erastus</hi> being the
                    Greek equivalent. In 1540 he went to Basel, and in 1542 he entered the
                    university there as student of philosophy and theology. An outbreak of the
                    plague in 1544 drove him to Bologna, where he studied philosophy and medicine,
                    taking his doctor’s degree in the latter faculty. His residence in Italy lasted
                    nine years, part of the time being spent at the university of Padua. Returning
                    northwards in 1553, he for some time held the post of physician to the counts of
                    Henneberg. In 1558 he was appointed physician to the Elector Palatine Otto
                    Heinrich, and at the same time he obtained the chair of medicine in the
                    university of Heidelberg. By Frederick III., who succeeded Otto Heinrich in
                    1559, he was made privy-councillor and member of the church-consistory. Eminent
                    both as a scientific and as a practical physician, he at the same time took a
                    profound interest in the theological controversies of his day, and soon became
                    deeply involved in them. While a student of theology at Basel he had heartily
                    adopted the doctrines of Zwingli, and ever afterwards was prompt to avail
                    himself of all the opportunities which his position afforded for advancing the
                    views of the Zurich divines. At the instance of the elector he took an active
                    part in the sacramentarian conferences held at Heidelberg in 1560 and at
                    Maulbronn in 1564. In connexion with these conferences he published a statement
                    and vindication of the Zwinglian doctrine of the Lord’s Supper, which, on its
                    being criticised on the Lutheran side by Dr John Marbach of Strasburg, he
                    followed up with a second defence (1565). Shortly after the settlement of
                    Erastus in Heidelberg, an effort was made to introduce into the church of the
                    Palatinate a strict presbyterian constitution after the Genevan model. Erastus
                    became the leader of an influential opposition to this attempt. He made it his
                    business to counteract what he called the “excommuni-catory fever” of the
                    advocates of rigid discipline. In 1568 he wrote and circulated in manuscript 100
                    theses on the subject of church censures, maintaining that exclusion from
                    participation in the sacraments is not a legitimate punishment for any offence
                    whatsoever <hi rend="italic">(Explicatio,</hi> ix., xxxi.). A copy of the theses
                    was sent to Zurich, and received with some favour there, but from Geneva they
                    elicited a vigorous rejoinder by Beza, which led to the preparation of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Con</hi><hi rend="italic">firmatio Thesium.</hi> The efforts of
                    Erastus and his friends at Heidelberg in this matter met with little success,
                    the presbyterian discipline being finally set up in 1570, with hardly any
                    modification of the Genevan strictness. Meanwhile Erastus had lost the favour of
                    the elector, and by a correspondence with some of the Socinians of Transylvania
                    had brought himself under suspicion of being favourable to their views. One of
                    the first acts of the newly constituted church court seems to have been a
                    high-handed excommunication of Erastus, on the ground of his supposed
                    Unitarianism. The sentence was reconsidered and removed in 1575, Erastus
                    formally declaring that no one could hold the doctrine of the Trinity more
                    firmly than he. The court physician, however, found his position at Heidelberg
                    to be one of increasing discomfort. He accordingly returned in 1580 to Basel,
                    where he received an appointment to the chair of ethics in 1583. He died on 31st
                    December of the same year.</p>
                <p>Erastus seems to have been much esteemed by his friends for his amiability,
                    candour, and probity. As an investigator of nature, he was honourably
                    distinguished by his adherence to a sound inductive method. Most of the works
                    that appeared during his life time were directed against the fantastic notions
                    of Paracelsus and his school <hi rend="italic">(Dissertationum</hi><hi

                    Basel, 1578, and other works). That he was not in advance of his age in regard
                    to witchcraft is shown by his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lamiis et strigibus</hi> (Basel, 1578), in which he urges upon
                    magistrates the duty of putting witches to death.</p>
                <p>The work by which he is best known, though originally written in 1568, and
                    afterwards revised by himself, was first published six years after his death
                    (1589), by Castelvetro, who had married his widow. Its full title is <hi
                    rend="italic">Explicatio</hi><hi rend="italic">quaestionis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gravissima; utrum excommunicatio, quatenus religionem</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    hominibus.</hi> In 75 theses he seeks to show that excommunication is not a
                    divine ordinance but a device of men, and that the sins of professing Christians
                    are to be punished by the civil magistrate with civil penalties, not by pastors
                    and elders denying access to the sacraments. The sacraments, being means of
                    grace, ought not to be withheld from any one wishing to receive them. The
                    punishment of all offences belongs to the civil magistrate exclusively. The
                    church has no power to make laws or decrees, still less to inflict pains and
                    penalties of any kind. Its function is simply to teach, exhort, convince,
                    persuade. In Deut. iv. 8 it is implied that the laws and statutes of the Jewish
                    people were the most perfect possible. That church therefore is most worthily
                    and wisely ordered which comes nearest to the constitution of the Jewish church.
                    But in the Jewish church we find no traces of two diverse judicatories
                    concerning manners, the one civil, -the other ecclesiastical. No reason can be
                    alleged why the Christian magistrate at the present day should not possess the
                    same power which God commanded the magistrate to exercise in the Jewish
                    commonwealth.</p>
                <p>These views of Erastus were speedily adopted by various eminent divines in
                    England. In the Westminster Assembly there was a distinct Erastian party, of
                    which the most prominent members were Selden, Lightfoot, Coleman, and
                    Whitelocke. After a controversy of many months, in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n538/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0538-0519"/> which Selden, Coleman, Gillespie, and Rutherford
                    were the most prominent disputants, the proposition that “the Lord Jesus, as
                    King and Head of His church, hath therein appointed a government, in the hand of
                    church-officers, distinct from the civil magistrate” was finally carried, the
                    sole dissentient voice being that of Lightfoot. This proposition, with the whole
                    chapter “Of Church Censures” in which it occurs, was intended and understood to
                    contain a complete rejection of Erastian principles, and in this light it was
                    regarded by the Erastians themselves. That chapter, however (the 30th of the
                    Confession), was never formally ratified by the parliament.</p>
                <p>The Anglican doctrine of “the royal supremacy in causes ecclesiastical,” it needs
                    hardly be said, is not in any sense derived from Erastus (see the 37th Article;
                    also Hooker’s <hi rend="italic">Eccl.</hi><hi rend="italic">Pol.,</hi> b. viii.
                    and Preface). In Scotland Erastianism is disowned by all Presbyterians. They
                    hold, as against Erastus, that there is “a <hi rend="italic">government</hi> in
                    the baud of church officers distinct from the civil magistrate.” It is well
                    known that serious differences have arisen as to some of the practical effects
                    of this anti-Erastian doctrine. The history of these differences will be related
                    elsewhere. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Scotland, Church of,</hi> and <hi

                <p>An English translation of the <hi rend="italic">Explicatio</hi> appeared
                    anonymously in 1659. A new translation, enriched with an interesting preface,
                    was published by the late Dr Robert Lee (Edin., 1844).</p>
