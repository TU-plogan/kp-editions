                    born in Edinburgh on the 10th of January 1750. From an early age he showed a
                    strong desire to enter one of the learned professions; but his father, whose
                    means had barely permitted him to afford the expense of a liberal education for
                    his two elder sons—one of whom, afterwards the well-known Harry Erskine, was
                    studying for the Scotch bar—was unable to do more than give him a good school
                    education at the High School of Edinburgh and the grammar school of St Andrews.
                    He attended the university of St Andrews for one session, after which it was
                    decided that he should join the navy; and in the spring of 1764 he left Scotland
                    to serve as a midshipman on board the “Tartar.” His buoyancy of spirit and the
                    opportunity for study which he had on board a man-of-war reconciled him to his
                    new mode of life; but on finding, when he returned to this country after four
                    years’ absence in North America and the West Indies, that there was little
                    immediate chance of his rank of acting lieutenant being confirmed, he resolved
                    to quit the service. He entered the army, purchasing a commission in the 1st
                    Royals with the meagre patrimony which had been left to him. But promotion here
                    was as slow as in the navy; while in 1770 he had added greatly to his
                    difficulties by marrying the daughter of Mr Daniel Moore, M P for Marlow, an
                    excellent wife, but as poor as himself. In these depressing circumstances he
                    happened to be quartered where the assizes were being held, and lounging into
                    court one day was invited to the bench by his father’s old friend Lord
                    Mansfield. He was told that the barristers who were pleading were at the top of
                    their profession, yet he felt that he could do as well, if not better, himself.
                    He confided his plan to Lord Mansfield, who did not discourage him, and to his
                    mother, a woman of remarkable determination of character, who strongly advised
                    him to quit the army for the law. Accordingly on the 26th April 1775 he was
                    admitted a student of Lincoln’s Inn. He also on the 13th of January following
                    entered himself as a gentleman commoner on the books of Trinity College,
                    Cambridge, but merely that by graduating he might be called two years earlier.
                    He placed himself as a pupil under Mr Buller, and when that eminent lawyer was
                    elevated to the bench, under Mr (afterwards Baron) Wood, and was called to the
                    bar on the 3d July 1778. His success was immediate and brilliant. An accident
                    was the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n549/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0549-0530"/> means of giving him his first case, Rex <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Baillie, in which he appeared for Captain Baillie, the
                    lieutenant-governor of Greenwich Hospital, who had published a pamphlet
                    animadverting in severe terms upon the abuses which Lord Sandwich, the first
                    lord of the Admiralty, had introduced into the management of the hospital, and
                    against whom a rule had been obtained from the Court of King’s Bench to show
                    cause why a criminal information for libel should not be filed. Erskine was the
                    junior of five counsel; and it was his good fortune that the prolixity of his
                    leaders consumed the whole of the first day, thereby giving the advantage of
                    starting afresh next morning. He made use of this opportunity to deliver a
                    speech of wonderful eloquence, skill, and courage, which captivated both the
                    audience and the court. The rule was discharged, and Erskine’s fortune was made.
                    He received, it is said, thirty retainers before he left the court. In 1781 he
                    delivered another remarkable speech, in defence of Lord George Gordon—a speech
                    which gave the death-blow to the doctrine of constructive treason. In 1783, when
                    the Coalition Ministry came into power, he was returned to parliament as member
                    for Portsmouth. His first speech in the House of Commons was a failure; and he
                    never in parliamentary debate possessed anything like the influence he had at
                    the bar. He lost his seat at the dissolution in the following year, and remained
                    out of parliament until 1790, when he was again returned for Portsmouth. But his
                    success at the bar continued unimpaired. In 1783 he received a patent of
                    precedence. His first special retainer was in defence of Dr Shipley, dean of St
                    Asaph, who was tried in 1784 before Mr Justice Buller at Shrewsbury for
                    seditious libel—a case memorable for Erskine’s bold yet dignified vindication of
                    the independence of the bar, and for the speech which he subsequently made
                    before the court at Westminster against a motion for a new trial. In 1789 he was
                    counsel for Stockdale, a bookseller, who was charged with seditious libel in
                    publishing a pamphlet in favour of Warren Hastings, whose trial was then
                    proceeding; and his speech on this occasion, probably his greatest effort, is a
                    consummate specimen of the art of addressing a jury. Three years afterwards he
                    brought down the opposition alike of friends and foes by defending Thomas Paine,
                    author of <hi rend="italic">The Hights of Man—</hi> holding that an advocate has
                    no right, by refusing a brief, to convert himself into a judge. As a consequence
                    he lost the office of attorney-general to the Prince of λVales, to which he had
                    been appointed in 1786; the prince, however, subsequently made amends by making
                    him his chancellor. Among Erskine’s later speeches may be mentioned those for
                    Horne Tooke and the other advocates of parliamentary reform, and that for
                    Hadfield, who was accused of shooting at the king. On the accession of the
                    Grenville ministry in 1806, he was made lord chancellor, an office for which his
                    training had in no way prepared him, but which he fortunately held only during
                    the short period his party was in power. Of the remainder of his life it would
                    be well if nothing could be said. Occasionally speaking in parliament, and
                    hoping that he might return to office should the prince become regent, he
                    gradually degenerated into a state of useless idleness. Never conspicuous for
                    prudence, he aggravated his increasing poverty by an unfortunate second
                    marriage. Once only—in his conduct in the case of Queen Caroline—does he recall
                    his former self. He died at Almondel, Linlithgowshire, 17th November 1823, of
                    inflammation in the chest, caught on the voyage to Scotland.</p>
                <p>Erskine no doubt owed much to the period in which he lived. In another age his
                    highest distinction would probably have been the barren and evanescent
                    reputation of a successful verdict-getter. The political trials in which he was
                    engaged not only handed him down to posterity as the vindicator of his country’s
                    liberties, but by inspiring him with the consciousness that he was defending his
                    country and its constitution as much as if he were speaking in parliament or
                    fighting in the field, developed, in a way that no ordinary trial could have
                    done, that impassioned eloquence and undaunted courage which so often carried
                    audience and jury and even court along with him. As a judge he did not succeed;
                    and it has been questioned whether under any circumstances he could have
                    succeeded. For the office of chancellor he was plainly unfit; but it is
                    difficult to believe that one who for so long was the ornament of the bar of the
                    King’s Bench could have presided over that court without adding fresh lustre to
                    his name. As a lawyer he was well read, but by no means profound. His strength
                    lay in the keenness of his reasoning faculty, in his dexterity and the ability
                    with which he disentangled complicated masses of evidence, and above all in his
                    unrivalled power of fixing and commanding the attention of juries. To no
                    department of knowledge but law had he applied himself systematically, with the
                    single exception of English literature, of which he acquired a thorough mastery
                    in early life, at intervals of leisure in college, on board ship, or in the
                    army. Vanity is said to have been his ruling personal characteristic; but those
                    who knew him, while they admit the fault, say that in him it never took an
                    offensive form, even in old age, while the singular grace and attractiveness of
                    his manner endeared him to all with whom he came in contact.</p>
