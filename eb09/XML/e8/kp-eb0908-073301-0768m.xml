                <p>In the Old Testament Eve is mentioned only in the so-called Jehovistic narrative
                    of Gen. ii.-iv. In this narrative, which it is unnecessary to repeat, the
                    original creation of woman is so set forth as to teach the ethical value and
                    dignity of the relation of marriage, which, according to God’s original
                    ordinance, is not founded on sensual instincts, but corresponds to a necessity
                    of that higher part of man’s nature which raises him above the brute creation
                    (Gen. ii. 18-20). The relation of the wife to her husband is one of dependence
                    (comp. 1 Tim. ii. 13, but especially 1 Cor. xi. 8, 9, which rightly interprets
                    the significance of the creation of Eve from Adam’s rib) but not of subjection.
                    The woman is not the servant of her husband, but a “help meet for him ”—more
                    literally a help corresponding to him— without which he would be himself
                    incomplete. And so marriage constitutes the closest human relationship, and
                    establishes between husband and wife a union, or rather a unity, stronger than
                    the ties of blood (Gen. ii. 24). On the other hand, the dominion of the husband
                    over the wife characteristic of antique society is represented as a fruit of the
                    fall (Gen. iii. 16), and connected with the predominance of sensual passion
                    (desire) over the ethical attachment of the sexes. These ideas reappear more or
                    less clearly in various parts of the Old Testament,—in the description of true
                    love in Canticles, and in what is said of marriage in the Proverbs, especially
                    in the doctrine, Prov. ii. 17, that marriage is a “divine covenant.” But there
                    is no direct reference to the narrative of Genesis in the other canonical books
                    of the Old Testament, though some interpreters seek an allusion to the creation
                    of Adam and Eve in the obscure passage Mal. ii. 15. In the apocryphal book of
                    Tobit (viii. 6, 7) the pure relation of true marriage is illustrated by
                    reference to Gen. ii.;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Another reference to the creation of woman appears in the Latin text of
                    Ecclesiasticus xvii. 5. but is lacking in the Greek.</p></note> but it is only
                    in the New Testament that the original ideal of married life is authoritatively
                    set forth by our Lord as the rule of a higher morality than that of Mosaism
                    (Mat. xix.; Mark x.) The abrogation of the one-sided law of divorce, and the
                    restoration of marriage to the ideal instituted before the fall, involve the
                    abolition in Christian society of the antique subjection of woman (comp. Hosea
                    ii. 16). The other parts of the history of Eve have less importance for biblical
                    theology and ethics, and receive little more than casual notice in the New
                    Testament (2 Cor. xi. 3; 1 Tim ii. 14, 15).</p>
                <p>To this notice of the biblical materials on the subject may be added a brief
                    indication of the legendary additions to the narrative of Genesis, and some
                    account of the way in which that narrative has been treated by theologians and
                    scholars in different ages.</p>

                    created from the thirteenth rib of Adam’s right side, thus taking the view,
                    still soberly maintained by Delitzsch, that Adam had a rib more than his
                    descendants. The Jewish Midrash and the Talmud contain many other stories,
                    always absurd and often disgusting, of which a sufficient account may be found
                    in Bartolocci’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Pabbinica,</hi> and Eisen menger’s

                <p>Legendary developments of the history of Adam and Eve were not confined to the
                    Jews, but were equally popular in the Christian church and among the heretical
                    sects. The apocryphal literature of the subject is noticed in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Adam;</hi> but a reference may here be added to the history of
                    Adam and Eve published by Ceriani, <hi rend="italic">Momιmenta sacra</hi><hi

                <p>Minds trained under the influence of the Jewish Haggada, in which the whole
                    biblical history is freely intermixed with legendary and parabolic matter, would
                    not naturally formulate the question how far the story of Gen. ii.-iv. is to be
                    regarded as literal history? But that question necessarily arose when Jewish
                    learning came into contact with Greek thought. Josephus, in the prologue to his

                    of the true meaning of the Mosaic narrative, but does not regard everything as
                    strictly literal. Philo, the great representative of Alexandrian allegory,
                    expressly argues that in the nature of things the trees of life and knowledge
                    cannot be taken otherwise than symbolically. His interpretation of the creation
                    of Eve is, as has been already observed, plainly suggested by a Platonic myth.
                    The longing for reunion which love implants in the divided halves of the
                    original dual man is the source of sensual pleasure (symbolized by the serpent),
                    which in turn is the beginning of all transgression. Eve represents the sensuous
                    or perceptive part of man’s nature, Adam the reason. The serpent therefore does
                    not venture to attack Adam directly. It is sense which yields to pleasure, and
                    in turn enslaves the reason and destroys its immortal virtue. This exposition,
                    in which the elements of the Bible narrative become mere symbols of the abstract
                    notions of Greek philosophy, and are adapted to Greek conceptions of the origin
                    of evil iu the material and sensuous part of man, was adopted into Christian
                    theology by Clement and Origen, notwithstanding its obvious inconsistency with
                    the Pauline anthropology, and the difficulty which its supporters felt in
                    reconciling it with the Christian doctrine of the excellence of the married
                    state (Clemens Alex., <hi rend="italic">Stromata,</hi> p. 174). These
                    difficulties had more weight with the Western church, which, less devoted to
                    speculative abstractions and more deeply influenced by the Pauline anthropology,
                    refused, especially since Augustine, to reduce Paradise and the fall to the
                    region of pure <hi rend="italic">intelligibilia;</hi> though a spiritual sense
                    was-admitted along with the literal (Aug,, <hi rend="italic">Civ. Dei,</hi>
                    xiii. 21).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus in
                    mediaeval theology Eve is a type of the church, and her formation from the rib
                    has a mystic reason, inasmuch as blood and water (the sacraments of the church)
                    flowed from the side of Christ on the cross (Thomas, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Summa,</hi> par. i. qu. xcii.)</p></note></p>
                <p>The history of Adam and Eve became the basis of anthropological discussions which
                    acquired more than speculative importance from their connexion with the doctrine
                    of original sin and the meaning of the sacrament of baptism. One or two points
                    in Augustinian teaching may be here mentioned as having to do particularly with
                    Eve. The question whether the soul of Eve was derived from Adam or directly
                    infused by the Creator is raised as an element in the great problem of
                    traducianism and creationism (De <hi rend="italic">Ceη. ad lit.,</hi> lib. x.).
                    And it is from Augustine that Milton derives the idea that Adam sinned, not from
                    desire for the forbidden fruit, but because love forbade him to dissociate his
                    fate from Eve’s <hi rend="italic">(fbid,,</hi> lib. xi. <hi rend="italic"
                    >sub</hi><hi rend="italic">fini).</hi> Mediaeval discussion moved mainly in the
                    lines laid down by Augustine. A sufficient sample of the way in which the
                    subject was treated by the schoolmen may be found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Summa</hi> of Thomas, pars i., qu. xcii., <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">productione mulieris.</hi></p>
                <p>The Reformers, always hostile to allegory, and in this matter especially
                    influenced by the Augustinian anthropology, adhered strictly to the literal
                    interpretation of the history of the Protoplasts, which has continued to be
                    generally identified with Protestant orthodoxy. The disintegration of the
                    confessional doctrine of sin in last century was naturally associated with new
                    theories of the meaning of the biblical narrative; but neither renewed forms of
                    the allegorical interpretation, in which everything is reduced to abstract ideas
                    about reason and sensuality, nor the attempts of Eichhorn and others to extract
                    a kernel of simple history by allowing largely for the influence of poetical
                    form in so early a narrative, have found lasting acceptance. On the other hand,
                    the strict historical interpretation is beset with difficulties which modern
                    interpreters have felt with increasing force, and which there is a growing
                    disposition to solve by adopting in one or other form what is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">“mythical”</hi> theory of the narrative. But interpretations pass
                    under this now popular title which have no real claim to be so designated. What
                    is common to the “mythical” interpretations is to find the real value of the
                    narrative, not in the form of the story, but in the thoughts which it embodies.
                    But the story cannot be called a myth in the strict sense of the word, unless we
                    are prepared to place it on one line with the myths of heathenism, produced by
                    the unconscious play of plastic fancy, giving shape to the impressions of
                    natural phenomena on primitive observers. Such a theory does no justice to a
                    narrative which embodies profound truths peculiar to the religion of revelation.
                    Other forms of the so-called mythical interpretation are little more than
                    abstract allegory in a new guise, ignoring the fact that the biblical story does
                    not teach general truths which repeat themselves in every individual, but gives
                    a view of the purpose of man’s creation, and of the origin of sin, in connexion
                    with the divine plan of redemption. Among his other services in refutation of
                    the unbistorical rationalism of last century, Kant has the merit of having
                    forcibly recalled attention to the fact that the narrative of Genesis, even if
                    we do not take it literally, must be regarded as presenting a view of the
                    beginnings of the history of the human race <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Muthmasslicher</hi><hi rend="italic">Anfang der Menschengeschichte,</hi>
                    1786). Those who recognize this fact ought not to call themselves or be called
                    by others adherents of the mythical theory, although they also recognize that in
                    the nature of things the divine truths brought out in the history of the
                    creation and fall could not have been expressed either in the form of literal
                    history or in the shape of abstract metaphysical doctrine; or even although they
                    may hold,—as is done by many who accept the narrative as a part of supernatural
                    revelation,—that the specific biblical truths which the narrative conveys are
                    presented through the vehicle of a story which, at least in some of its parts,
                    may possibly be shaped by the influence of legends common to the Hebrews with
                    their heathen neighbours. It must, however, be remembered that speculation as to
                    the affinities of Genesis with other and especially Babylonian legends has of
                    late far outrun the bounds of scientific method; and this caution has a special
                    application to the supposed Babylonian history of the fall. See Von Gutschmidt’s
