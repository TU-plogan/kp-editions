                <p>THE sense of vision is excited by the influence of light on the retina, the
                    special terminal organ connected with the optic nerve. By excitation of the
                    retina, a change is induced in the optic nerve fibres, aud is conveyed by these
                    to the brain, the result being a luminous perception, or what we call a
                    sensation of light or colour. If light were to act uniformly over the retina,
                    there would be no image of the source of the light formed on that structure, and
                    consequently there would be only a general consciousness of light, without
                    reference to any particular object. One of the first conditions, therefore, of
                    vision for useful purposes is the formation of an image on the retina. To effect
                    this, just as in a photographic camera, refractive structures must be placed in
                    front of the retina which will so bend luminous rays as to bring them to a focus
                    on the retina, and thus produce an image. Throughout the animal kingdom, various
                    arrangements are found for this purpose; but they may be all referred to three
                    types, namely—(1) eye-specks or eye-dots, met with in Medusae, Anneiidae,
                    &amp;c.; (2) the compound eye, as found in insects and crustaceans; and (3) the
                    simple eye, common to all vertebrates. The <hi rend="italic">eyespecks</hi> may
                    be regarded simply as expansions of optic nerve filaments, covered by a
                    transparent membrane, but having no refractive media, so that the creature would
                    have the consciousness of light only, or a simple luminous impression, by which
                    it might distinguish light from darkness. The <hi rend="italic">compound
                    eye</hi> (an account of which, as met with in the common lobster, will be found
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Crustacea,</hi> vol. vi. p. 637) consists essentially
                    of a series of transparent cone-like bodies, arranged in a radiate manner
                    against the inner surface of the cornea, with which their bases are united,
                    while their apices are connected with the ends of the optic filaments. As each
                    cone is separated from its neighbours, it admits only a ray of light parallel
                    with its axis, and its apex represents only a portion of the image, which must
                    be made up, like a mosaic-work, of as many parts as there are cones in the eye.
                    When the cones are of considerable length, it is evident, from their form and
                    direction, their apices being directed inwards, that the oblique rays emanating
                    from a luminous surface will be cut off, and that only those rays proceeding
                    along the axis of the cone will produce an effect. Thus distinctness or
                    sharpness of definition will be secured. The size of the visual field will
                    depend on the form of the eye, the outermost cones marking its limits.
                    Consequently the size of the visual field will depend on the size of the segment
                    of the sphere forming its surface. The eyes of many insects have a field of
                    about half a sphere, so that the creature will see objects before and behind it
                    as well as those at the side. On the other hand, in many the eyes have scarcely
                    any convexity, so that they must have a narrow field of vision.</p>
                <p>A description of the simple eye will be found in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Anatomy,</hi> vol. i. p. 885 <hi rend="italic">s&lt;p</hi> Optically, it
                    consists of a series of refractive media placed in front of the retina by which
                    rays emanating from an external object are brought to a focus on that structure.
                    In this article, we shall consider (1) the physical causes of vision; (2) the
                    optical arrangements of the eye; (3) the specific influence of light on the
                    retina; (4) sensations of colour; (5) the movements of the eyes in vision; and
                    (6) the psychical relations of luminous impressions.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Physical Causes of Vision.</hi></p>
                <p>A luminous sensation may be excited by various modes of irritation of the retina
                    or of the optic nerve. Pressure, cutting, or electrical shocks may act as
                    stimuli, but the normal excitation is the influence of light on the retina. From
                    a physical point of view, light is a mode of movement occurring in a medium,
                    termed the ether, which pervades all space; but the physiologist studies the
                    operation of these movements on the sentient organism as resulting in
                    consciousness of the particular kind which we term a luminous impression.
                    Outside of the body, such movements have been studied with great accuracy; but
                    the physiological effects depend upon such complex conditions as to make it
                    impossible to state them in the same precise way. Thus, when we look at the
                    spectrum, we are conscious of the sensations of red and violet, referable to its
                    two extremities: the physicist states that red is produced by 392 billions of
                    impulses on the retina per second, and that violet corresponds to 757 billions
                    per second; but he has arrived at this information by inductive reasoning from
                    many facts which have not at present any physiological explanation. We cannot at
                    present trace any connexion, as cause and effect, between 392 billions of
                    impulses on the retina per second and a sensation of red. Below the red and
                    above the violet ends of the spectrum there are vibrations which do not excite
                    luminous sensations. In the first case, below the red, the effect as a sensation
                    is heat; and above the violet the result is that of chemical activity. Thus the
                    method of dispersion of light, as is followed in passing a ray through a prism,
                    enables us to recognize these general facts:—(1) rays below the red excite
                    thermal impressions; (2) from the lower red up to the "middle of the violet, the
                    thermal rays become gradually weaker until they have no effect; (3) from the
                    lower red to the extreme violet, they cause luminous impressions, which reach
                    their greatest intensity in the yellow; and (4) from about the end of the yellow
                    to far beyond the extreme violet, the rays have gradually a less and less
                    luminous effect, but they have the power of exciting such chemical changes as
                    are <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n852/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0852-0817"/> produced in photography. In general terms,
                    therefore, the lower end of the spectrum may be called thermal, the middle
                    luminous, and the upper actinic or chemical; but the three merge into and
                    overlap one another. It may be observed that the number of vibrations in the
                    extreme violet is not double that of the low red, so that the sensibility of the
                    eye to vibrations of light does not range through an octave. The ultra-violet
                    rays may act on the retina in certain conditions, as when they are reflected by
                    a solution of sulphate of quinine, constituting the phenomenon of
                    fluorescence.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Optical Arrangements of the Eye.</hi></p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="italic">General.—</hi> When light traverses any homogeneous
                    transparent medium, such as the air, it passes on in a straight course with a
                    certain velocity; but if it meet with any other transparent body of a different
                    density, part of it is reflected or returned to the first medium, whilst the
                    remainder is propagated through the second medium in a different direction and
                    with a different velocity. Thus we may account for the phenomena of reflection
                    and of refraction, for which see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Light.</hi>
                    Let <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> in fig. 1, be a plane surface of some
                    transparent substance, say a sheet of glass; a ray, <hi rend="italic">c d,</hi>
                    perpendicular to the surface, will pass through without refraction; but an
                    oblique ray, <hi rend="italic">e f,</hi> will be sent in the direction <hi
                    rend="italic">e h.</hi> If the ray <hi rend="italic">e h</hi> had passed from a
                    dense into a rarer medium, then the direction would have been <hi rend="italic"
                    >e g.</hi> It might also be shown that the <hi rend="italic">sine</hi> of the
                    angle of incidence always bears a certain ratio to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sine</hi> of the angle of refraction; this ratio is termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">index of refraction.</hi> Thus, if a ray pass from air into water,
                    the sine of the angle of incidence will have to the sine of the angle of the
                    refraction the ratio of 4: 3, or ⅜.</p>
                <p>Before a ray of light can reach the retina, it must pass through a number of
                    transparent and refractive surfaces. The eye is a nearly spherical organ, formed
                    of transparent parts situated behind each other, and surrounded by various
                    membranous structures, the anterior part of which is also transparent. The
                    transparent parts are—(1) the <hi rend="italic">cornea;</hi> (2) the <hi
                    rend="italic">aqueous humour,</hi> found in the anterior chamber of the eye; (3)
                    the <hi rend="italic">crystalline lens,</hi> formed by a transparent convex
                    body, the anterior surface of which is less convex than the posterior; and (4)
                    the <hi rend="italic">vitreous humour,</hi> filling the posterior chamber of the
                    eye. The ray must therefore traverse the cornea, aqueous humour, lens, and
                    vitreous humour. As the two surfaces of the cornea are parallel, the rays
                    practically suffer no deviation in passing through that structure, but they are
                    bent or refracted during their transmission through the other media.</p>
                <p>From the optical point of view, the eye may be regarded as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >dioptric system</hi> consisting of various refractive media. In such a system,
                    as shown by Gauss, there are six cardinal points, which have a certain relation
                    to each other. These are—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Two focal points:</hi> every ray passing through theirs/ focal
                    point becomes, after its refraction, parallel to the axis, and every ray which
                    before refraction is parallel to the axis passes after its refraction to the <hi
                    rend="italic">seco nd</hi> focal point; (2) <hi rend="italic">Two principal
                    points:</hi> every ray which passes through the first point before refraction
                    passes after refraction through the second, and every ray which passes through
                    any point of a plane elevated on a perpendicular axis from the first principal
                    point (the <hi rend="italic">first principal plane)</hi> passes through the
                    corresponding point of an analogous plane raised upon the axis at the second
                    principal point (the <hi rend="italic">second principal plane)</hi>; and (3) <hi
                    rend="italic">Two</hi><hi rend="italic">nodal points,</hi> which correspond to
                    the optical centres of the two principal planes just alluded to. The distance of
                    the first principal point from the first focal point is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">anterior focal length,</hi> and the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >posterior focal length</hi> is applied to the distance of the posterior focal
                    point from the second principal point. Listing has given the following
                    measurements in millimetres from the centre of the cornea for the cardinal
                    points in an ideal eye :—</p>

                    camera. It may also be observed by bringing the eye-ball of a rabbit near a
                    candle flame. The action of a leDs in forming an inverted image is illustrated
                    by fig. 3, where the pencil of rays proceeding from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    brought to a focus at <hi rend="italic">α',</hi> and those from <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> at <hi rend="italic">b',</hi> consequently the image of <hi
                    rend="italic">a b</hi> is inverted as at <hi rend="italic">Ca'.</hi> The three
                    characteristic features of the retinal image <pb break="no"

                    defined if it be accurately focussed on the retina; and (3) its size depends on
                    the visual angle. If we look at a distant object, say a star, the rays reaching
                    the eye are parallel, and in passing through the refractive media, they are
                    focussed at the posterior focal point,—that is, on the retina. A line from the
                    luminous point on the retina passing through the nodal point is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">line of direction.</hi> If the luminous object be not nearer than,
                    say, 60 yards, the image is still brought to a focus on the retina without any
                    effort on the part of the eye. Within this distance, supposing the condition of
                    the eye to be the same as in looking at a star, the image would be formed
                    somewhat behind the posterior focal point, and the effect would be an indistinct
                    impression on the retina. To obviate this, for near distances, accommodation, so
                    as to adapt the eye, is effected by a mechanism to be afterwards described.</p>
                <p>When rays, reflected from an object or coming from a luminous point, are not
                    brought to an accurate focus on the retina, the image is not distinct iu
                    consequence of the formation of what are called <hi rend="italic">circles of
                    diffusion,</hi> the production of which will be rendered evident by fig. 4. From
                    the point A luminous rays enter the eye in the form of a cone, the kind of which
                    will depend on the pupil. Thus it may be circular, or oval, or even triangular.
                    If the pencil is focussed in front of the retina, as at <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or behind it as at <hi rend="italic"
                    >f,</hi> or, in other words, if the retina, in place of being at F, be in the
                    positions G or H, there will be a luminous circle or a luminous triangular
                    space, and many elements of the retina will be affected. The size of these
                    diffusion circles depends on the distance from the retina of the point where the
                    rays are focussed: the greater the distance, the more extended will be the
                    diffusion circle. Its size will also be affected by the greater or less diameter
                    of the pupil. Circles of diffusion may be readily studied by the following
                    experiment, usually called the experiment of Scheiner :—</p>
                <p>Let C be a lens, and D E F be screens placed behind it; hold in front of the lens
                    a card perforated by two holes A and B, and allow rays from a luminous point <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> to pass through these holes; the point <hi rend="italic"
                    >o</hi> on the screen E will be exact focus of the rays emanating from <hi
                    rend="italic">a; if a</hi> were removed farther from the lens, the focus would
                    be on t, and if it were brought near to C, the focus would then be on D. The
                    screens F and D show two images of the point α. If, then, we close the upper
                    opening in A B, the <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> image <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    on F, and the <hi rend="italic">lower</hi> image <hi rend="italic">η</hi> on D,
                    disappear. Suppose now that tlιe retina be substituted for the screens D and F,
                    the contrary will take place, in consequence of the reversal of the retinal
                    image.</p>
                <p>i th? <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> Y <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> ^* <hi
                    rend="superscript"> e</hi> p1 <hi rend="superscript"> ac</hi> θd <hi

                    seen; but if it be placed either in the plane of F or D, then two images will be
                    seen, as at <hi rend="italic">m m</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi><hi rend="italic">n</hi>; consequently in either of these
                    planes there ", be circles of diffusion and indistinctness, and only iu the
                    plane E will there be sharp definition of the image,</p>
                <p>To understand the formation of an image on the retina, suppose a line drawn from
                    each of its two extremities to the nodal point and continued onwards to the
                    retina, as in fig. 6, where the visual angle is <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> It is
                    evident that its size will depend on the size of the object and the distance of
                    the object from the eye. Thus, also, objects of different sizes, c, <hi
                    rend="italic">d, e,</hi> in fig. 6, may be included in the same visual angle, as
                    they are at different distances from the eye. The size of the retinal image may
                    obviously be calculated if we know the size of the object, its distance from the
                    nodal point o, and the distance of the nodal point from the posterior focus. Let
                    A be the size of the object, B its distance from the nodal point, and C the
                    distance of <hi rend="italic">o</hi> from the retina, or 15 mm.; then the size
                    of the retinal image <hi rend="italic">x</hi>= ——. The smallest visual angle in
                    which two distinct points may be observed is 60 seconds; below this, the two
                    sensations fuse into one; and the size of the retinal image corresponding to
                    this angle is.004 mm., nearly the diameter of a single retinal rod or cone. Two
                    objects, therefore, included in a visual angle of less than 60 seconds, appear
                    as one point. A small visual angle is in most eyes a condition of sharpness of
                    definition. With a large angle, objects appear less sharply marked. Acuteness is
                    determined by a few retinal elements, or even only one, being affected. A very
                    minute image, if thrown on a single retinal element, is apparently sufficient to
                    excite it. Thus it is possible to see a brilliant point in an angle even so
                    small as I of a second, and a sharp eye can see a body the -⅛th of a line in
                    diameter, that is, about the ^⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th part of an
                    inch.</p>
                <p>(3.) <hi rend="italic">The Optical Defects of the Eye.—</hi> As an optical
                    instrument, the eye is defective; but from habit, and want of attention, its
                    defects are not appreciated, and consequently they have little or no influence
                    on our sensations. These defects are chiefly of two kinds—(1) those due to the
                    curvature of the refractive surfaces, and (2) those due to the dispersion of
                    light by the refractive media.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(a) Aberration of Sj)hericity.—</hi> Suppose, as in fig. 7, M A
                    K to be a refractive surface on which parallel rays from L to S impinge, it will
                    be seen that those rays passing near the circumference are brought to a focus at
                    F <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>, and those passing near the centre at F <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>,—intermediate rays being focussed at N. Thus on the
                    portion of the axis between F <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> and F <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> there will be a series of focal points, and the
                    effect -will be a blurred and bent image. In the eye this defect is to a large
                    extent corrected by the following arrangements :—(1) the iris cuts off the outer
                    and more strongly refracted rays; (2) the curvature of the cornea is more
                    ellipsoidal than spherical, and consequently those farthest from the axis are
                    least deviated; (3) the anterior and posterior curvatures of the lens are such
                    that the one corrects, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n854/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0854-0819"/> to a certain extent, the action of the other; and
                    (4) the structure of the lens is such that its power of refraction diminishes
                    from the centre to the circumference, and consequently the rays farthest from
                    the axis are less refracted.</p>
                <p>(6) <hi rend="italic">Astigmatism.—</hi> Another defect of the eye is due to
                    different meridians having different degrees of curvature. This defect is known
                    as <hi rend="italic">astigmatism.</hi> It may be thus detected. Draw on a sheet
                    of white paper a vertical and a horizontal line with ink, crossing at a right
                    angle; at the point of distinct vision, it will be found impossible to see thé
                    lines with equal distinctness at the same time: to see the horizontal line
                    distinctly the paper must be brought near the eye, and removed from it to see
                    the vertical. In the cornea the vertical meridian has a shorter radius of
                    curvature, and is consequently more refractive than the horizontal. The
                    meridians of the lens may also vary; but, as a rule, the asymmetry of the cornea
                    is greater than that of the lens. The optical explanation of the defect will be
                    understood with the aid of fig. 8.</p>
                <p>Thus, suppose the vertical meridian C A D to be more strongly curved than the
                    horizontal F A E, the rays which fall on C A D will be brought to a focus G, and
                    those falling on F A E at B. If we divide the pencil of rays at successive
                    points, G, H, I, K, B, by a section perpendicular to A B, the various forms it
                    would present at these points are seen in the figures underneath, so that if the
                    eye were placed at G, it would see a horizontal line <hi rend="italic">a a
                    ∙,</hi> if at H, an ellipse with the long axis <hi rend="italic">a a</hi>
                    parallel to A B; if at I, a circle; if at K, an ellipse, with the long axis, <hi
                    rend="italic">b c,</hi> at right angles to A B; and if at B, a vertical line <hi
                    rend="italic">b c.</hi> The degree of astigmatism is ascertained by measuring
                    the difference of refraction in the two chief meridians; and the defect is
                    corrected by the use of cylindrical glasses, the curvature of which, added to
                    that of the minimum meridian, makes its focal length equal to that of the
                    maximum meridian.</p>
                <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Aberration of Refraηgibility.—</hi> When a ray of white
                    light traverses on a lens, the different rays composing it, being unequally
                    refrangible, are dispersed: the violet rays (see fig. 9), the most refrangible,
                    are brought to a focus at <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and the red rays, less
                    refrangible, at <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> If a screen were placed at e, a series
                    of concentric coloured circles would be formed, the central being of a violet,
                    and the circumference of a red colour. The reverse effect would be produced if
                    the screen were placed at <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Imagine the retina in place
                    of the screen in the two positions, the sensational effects would be those just
                    mentioned. Under ordinary circumstances, the error of refrangibility due to the
                    optical construction of the eye is not observed, as for vision at near distances
                    the interval between the focal point of the red and violet rays is very small.
                    If, however, we look at a candle flame through a bit of cobalt blue glass, which
                    transmits only the red and blue rays, the flame may appear violet surrounded by
                    blue, or blue surrounded by violet, according as we have accommodated the eye
                    for different distances. Red surfaces always appear nearer than violet surfaces
                    situated in the same plane, because the eye has to be accommodated more for the
                    red than for the violet, and consequently we imagine them to be nearer. Again,
                    if we contemplate red letters or designs on a violet ground the eye soon becomes
                    fatigued, and the designs may appear to move.</p>
                <p>(''Z) <hi rend="italic">Defects due to Opacities, &lt;L∙c., in the Transparent
                    Media.</hi> —When small opaque particles exist in the transparent media, they
                    may cast their shadow on the retina so as to give rise to images which are
                    projected outwards by the mind into space, and thus appear to exist outside of
                    the body. Such phenomena are termed entoptic. They may be of two kinds :—(1) <hi
                    rend="italic">extra-retinal,</hi> that is, due to opaque or semitransparent
                    bodies in any of the refractive structures anterior to the retina, and
                    presenting the appearance of drops, striae, lines, twisted bodies, forms of
                    grotesque shape, or minute black dots dancing before the eye; and (2) <hi
                    rend="italic">intra-retinal,</hi> due to opacities, &lt;fcc., in the layers of
                    the retina, in front of Jacob’s membrane. The intra-retinal may be produced in a
                    normal eye in various ways. (1 ) Throw a strong beam of light on the edge of the
                    sclerotic, and a curious branched figure will be seen, which is an image of the
                    retinal vessels. The construction of these images, usually called <hi
                    rend="italic">Purkivjds figures,</hi> will be understood from fig. 10. Thus, in
                    the figure to the left, the rays passing through the sclerotic at δ," in the
                    direction <hi rend="italic">b"c,</hi> will throw a shadow of a vessel at <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> on the retina at <hi rend="italic">b',</hi> and this will
                    appear as a dark line at B. If the light move from <hi rend="italic">b"</hi> to
                    <hi rend="italic">a",</hi> the retinal shadow will move from <hi rend="italic"
                    >b'</hi> to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and the line in the field of vision will
                    pass from B to A. It may be shown that the distance c <hi rend="italic">b'</hi>
                    corresponds to the distance of the retinal vessels from the layer of rods and
                    cones (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy,</hi> vol. i. p. 888), If the light
                    enter the cornea, as in the figure to the right, and if the light be moved, the
                    image will be displaced in the same direction as the light, if the movement does
                    not extend beyond the middle of the cornea, but in the opposite direction to the
                    light when the latter is moved up and down. Thus, if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be
                    moved to <hi rend="italic">a', d</hi> will be moved to cZ', the shadow on the
                    retina from <hi rend="italic">c</hi> to c', and the image <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> to <hi rend="italic">b'.</hi> If, on the other hand, <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">d</hi> will move below, consequently <hi rend="italic">c</hi> will
                    move above, and <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> will appear to sink. (2) The retinal
                    vessels may also be seen by looking at a strong light through a minute aperture,
                    in front of which a rapid to and fro movement is made. Such experiments prove
                    that the sensitive part of the retina is its deepest and most external layer
                    (Jacob’s membrane).</p>
                <p>(4.) <hi rend="italic">Accommodation, or the Mechanism of Adjustment for
                    Different Distances.—</hi> When a camera is placed in front of an object, it is
                    necessary to focus accurately in order to obtain a clear and distinct image on
                    the sensitive plate. This may be done by moving either the lens or the sensitive
                    plate backwards or forwards so as to have the posterior focal point of the lens
                    corresponding with the sensitive plate. For similar reasons, a mechanism of
                    adjustment, or accommodation for different distances, is necessary in the human
                    eye. In the normal eye, any number of parallel rays, coming from a great
                    distance, are focussed on the retina. Such an eye is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >emmetropic</hi> (fig. 11, A). Another form of eye (B) may be such that parallel
                    rays are brought to a focus <hi rend="italic">in front of</hi> the retina. This
                    form of eye is <hi rend="italic">myopic</hi> or short-sighted, inasmuch as, for
                    distinct vision, the object must be brought near the eye, so as to catch the
                    divergent rays, which are then focussed on the retina. A third form is seen in
                    C, where the focal point, for ordinary distances, is <hi rend="italic"
                    >behind</hi> the retina, and consequently the object must be held far off, so as
                    to allow only the less divergent or parallel rays to reach the eye. This kind of
                    eye is called <hi rend="italic">hypermetropic,</hi> or far-sighted. For ordinary
                    distances, at which objects must be seen distinctly in every-day life, the fault
                    of the myopic eye may be corrected by the use of concave and of the
                    hypermetropic by convex glasses. In the first case, the concave glass will
                    remove the posterior focal point a little farther back, and in the second the
                    convex glass will bring it farther forwards; in both cases, however, the glasses
                    may be so adjusted, both as regards refractive index and radius of curvature, as
                    to bring the rays to a focus on the retina, and consequently secure distinct
                    vision.</p>
                <p>From any point 65 metres distant, rays may be regarded as almost parallel, and
                    the point will be seen without any effort of accommodation. This point, either
                    at this distance or in infinity, is called the <hi rend="italic">punctum
                    remotum,</hi> or the most distant point seen without accommodation. In the
                    myopic eye it is much nearer, and for the hypermetropic there is really no such
                    point, and accommodation is always necessary, If an object were brought too
                    close to the eye for the refractive media to focus it on the retina, circles of
                    diffusion would be formed, with the result of causing indistinctness of vision,
                    unless the eye possessed some power of adapting itself to different distances.
                    That the eye has some such power of accommodation is proved by the fact that, if
                    we attempt to look through the meshes of a net at a distant object, we cannot
                    see both the meshes and the object with equal distinctness at the same time.
                    Again, if we look continuously at very near objects, the eye speedily becomes
                    fatigued. Beyond a distance of 65 metres, no accommodation is necessary; but
                    within it, the condition of the eye must be adapted to the diminished distance
                    until we reach a point near the eye which may be regarded as the limit of
                    visibility for near objects. This point, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >punctum</hi><hi rend="italic">proximum,</hi> is usually 12 centimetres (or
                    about 4 inches) from the eye. The range of accommodation is thus from the <hi
                    rend="italic">punctum remotum</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">punctum
                    proximum.</hi></p>
                <p>The mechanism of accommodation has been much disputed, but there can be no doubt
                    it is chiefly effected by a change in the curvature of the anterior surface of
                    the crystalline lens. If we hold a lighted candle in front and a little to the
                    side of an eye to be examined, three reflections may be seen in the eye, as
                    represented in fig. 12. The first, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> is erect, large,
                    and bright, from the anterior surface of the cornea; the second, <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> also erect, but dim, from the anterior surface of the
                    crystalline lens; and the third, <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> inverted, and very
                    dim, from the posterior surface of the lens, or perhaps the concave surface of
                    the vitreous humour to which the convex surface of the lens is adapted. Suppose
                    the three images to be in the position shown in the figure for distant vision,
                    it will be found that the middle image <hi rend="italic">b</hi> moves towards
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> on looking at a <hi rend="italic">near</hi> object.
                    The change is due to an alteration of the curvature of the lens, as shown in
                    fig. 13. The changes occurring during accommodation are:—(1) the curvature of
                    the anterior surface of the crystalline lens increases, and may pass from 10 to
                    6 mm.; (2) the pupil contracts; and (3) the intraocular pressure increases in
                    the posterior part of the eye. An explanation of the increased curvature of the
                    anterior surface of the lens during accommodation has been thus given by
                    Helmholtz. In the normal condition, that is, for the emmetropic eye, the
                    crystalline lens is flattened anteriorly by the pressure of the anterior layer
                    of the capsule; during accommodation, the radiating fibres of the ciliary muscle
                    pull the ciliary processes forward, thus relieving the tension of the anterior
                    layer of the capsule, and the lens at once bulges forward by its elasticity. The
                    exact mechanism of the ciliary muscle is still not clearly understood.</p>
                <p>Helmholtz has succeeded in measuring with great accuracy the sizes of these
                    reflected images by means of an instrument termed an ophthalmometer, the
                    construction of which is based on the following optical principles. When a
                    luminous ray traverses a plate of glass having parallel sides, if it fall
                    perpendicular to the plane of the plate, it will pass through without deviation;
                    but if it fall obliquely on the plate (as shown in the left hand diagram in fig.
                    14) it undergoes a lateral deviation, but in a direction parallel to that of the
                    incident ray, so that to an eye placed behind the glass plate, at the lower A,
                    the luminous point, upper A, would be in the direction of the prolonged emergent
                    ray, and thus there would be an apparent lateral displacement of the point, the
                    amount of which would increase with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n856/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0856-0821"/> obliquity of the incident ray. If, instead of one
                    plate, we take two plates of equal thickness, one placed above the other, two
                    images will be seen, and by turning the one plate with reference to the other,
                    each image may be displaced a little to one side. The instrument consists of a
                    small telescope (fig. 14) T, the axis of which coincides with the plane
                    separating the two glass plates C C and B B. When we look at an object X Y, and
                    turn the plates till we see two objects <hi rend="italic">xy,xy</hi> touching
                    each other, the size of the image X Y will be equal to the distance the one
                    object is displaced to the one side and the other object to the other side.
                    Having thus measured the size of the reflection, it is not difficult, if we know
                    the size of the object reflecting the light and its distance from the eye, to
                    calculate the radius of the curved surface. (See Woinow’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ophthalmometrie,</hi> St Petersburg, 1871, and an account given in Appendix to
                    M‘Kendrick’s <hi rend="italic">Outlines of Physiology,</hi> 1878.) The general
                    result is that, in accommodation for near objects, the middle reflected image
                    becomes smaller, and the radius of curvature of the anterior surface of the lens
                    becomes shorter.</p>
                <p>(5.) <hi rend="italic">Absorption and Refection of Luminous Rays from the
                    Eye.—</hi> When light enters the eye, it is partly absorbed by the black pigment
                    of the choroid and partly reflected. The reflected rays are returned through the
                    pupil, not only following the same direction as the rays entering the eye, but
                    uniting to form an image at the same point in space as the luminous object. The
                    pupil of an eye appears black to an observer, because the eye of the observer
                    does not receive any of those reflected rays. If, however, we strongly
                    illuminate the retina, and hold a lens in front of the eye, so as to bring the
                    reflected rays to a focus nearer the eye, then a virtual and erect, or a real
                    and reversed, image of the retina will be seen. Such is the principle of the
                    ophthalmoscope, invented by Helmholtz in 1851. Eyes deficient in pigment, as in
                    albinos, appear luminous, reflecting light of a red or pink colour; but if we
                    place in front of such an eye a card perforated by a round hole of the diameter
                    of the pupil, the hole will appear quite dark, like the pupil of an ordinary
                    eye. In many animals a portion of the fundus of the eyeball has no pigment, and
                    presents an iridescent appearance. This is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >tapetum.</hi> It probably renders the eye more sensitive to light of feeble
                    intensity.</p>
                <p>(6.) <hi rend="italic">Eunctionsof the Iris.—</hi> Theirisconstitutesa diaphragm
                    which regulates the amount of light entering the eyeball. The aperture in the
                    centre, the <hi rend="italic">pupil,</hi> may be dilated by contraction of a
                    system of radiating fibres of involuntary muscle, or contracted by the action of
                    another system of fibres, forming a sphincter, at the margin of the pupil. The
                    radiating fibres are controlled by the sympathetic, while those of the circular
                    set are excited by the third cranial nerve. The variations in diameter of the
                    pupil are determined by the greater or less intensity of the light acting on the
                    retina. A strong light causes contraction of the pupil; with light of less
                    intensity, the pupil will dilate. In the human being, a strong light acting on
                    one eye will often cause contraction of the pupil, not only in the eye affected,
                    but in the other eye. These facts indicate that the phenomenon is of the nature
                    of a reflex action, in which the fibres of the optic nerve act as sensory
                    conductors to a centre in the encephalon, whence influences emanate which affect
                    the pupil. It has been ascertained that if the fibres of the optic nerve be
                    affected in any way, contraction of the pupil follows. The centre is probably in
                    the anterior pair of the corpora quadrigemina, as destruction of these bodies
                    causes immobility of the pupil. On the other hand, the dilating fibres are
                    derived from the sympathetic; and it has been shown that they come from the
                    lower part of the cervical, and upper part of the dorsal, region of the cord.
                    But the iris seems to be directly susceptible to the action of light. Thus, as
                    was first pointed out by Browm-Séquard, the pupil of the eye of a dead animal
                    will contract if exposed to light for several hours, whereas, if the eye on the
                    opposite side be covered, its pupil will remain widely dilated, as at the moment
                    of death.</p>
                <p>The pupil <hi rend="italic">contracts</hi> under the influence—(1) of an
                    increased intensity of light; (2) of the effort of accommodation for near
                    objects; (3) of a strong convergence of the two eyes; and (4) of such active
                    substances as nicotine, morphia, and physostigmine; and it <hi rend="italic"
                    >dilates</hi> under the influence—(1) of a diminished intensity of light; (2) of
                    vision of distant objects; (3) of a strong excitation of any sensory nerve; (4)
                    of dyspnoea; and (5) of such substances as atropine and hyoscyamine. The chief
                    function of the iris is to so moderate the amount of light entering the eye as
                    to secure sharpness of definition of the retinal image. This it accomplishes by
                    (1) diminishing the amount of light reflected from near objects, by cutting off
                    the more divergent rays and admitting only those approaching a parallel
                    direction, which, in a normal eye, are focussed on the retina; and (2)
                    preventing the error of spherical aberration by cutting off divergent rays which
                    would otherwise impinge near the margins of the lens, and would thus be brought
                    to a focus in front of the retina.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Specific Influence of Light on the Retina.</hi></p>
                <p>The retina is the terminal organ of vision, and all the parts in front of it are
                    merely optical arrangements for securing that an image will be accurately
                    focussed upon it. The natural stimulus of the retina is light. It is often said
                    that it may be excited by mechanical and electrical stimuli; but such an
                    observation really applies to the stimulation of the fibres of the optic nerve.
                    It is well known that such stimuli applied to the optic nerve behind the eye
                    produce always a luminous impression; but there is no proof that the retina,
                    strictly speaking, is similarly affected. Pressure or electrical currents may
                    act on the eyeball, but in doing so they not only affect the retina, consisting
                    of its various layers and of Jacob’s membrane, but also the fibres of the optic
                    nerve. It is probable that the retina, by which is meant all the layers except
                    those on its surface formed by the fibres of the optic nerve, is affected only
                    by its <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> kind of stimulus, light. This stimulus so
                    ff aects the terminal apparatus as to set up actions which in turn stimulate the
                    optic fibres. The next question naturally is,—What is the specific action of
                    light on the retina? Professors Holmgren of Upsala individually, and Dewar and
                    M‘Kendrick conjointly, have shown that when light falls on the retina it excites
                    a variation of the natural electrical current obtained from the eye by placing
                    it on the cushions of a sensitive galvanometer. The general effect was that the
                    <hi rend="italic">impact</hi> of light caused an increase in the natural
                    electrical current,—during the <hi rend="italic">continuance</hi> of light, the
                    current diminished slowly, and fell in amount even below what it was before the
                    impact,—and that the <hi rend="italic">withdrawal</hi> of light was followed by
                    a rebound, or second increase, after which the current fell in strength, as if
                    the eye suffered from fatigue.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n857/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0857-0822"/>
                <p>It was also observed in this research that the amount of electrical variation
                    produced by light of various intensities corresponded pretty closely to the
                    results expressed by Fechner’s law, which regulates the relation between the
                    stimulus and the sensational effect in sensory impressions. This law is, that
                    the sensational effect does not increase proportionally to the stimulus, but as
                    the logarithm of the stimulus. Thus, supposing the stimulus to be 10, 100, or
                    1000 times increased, the sensational effect will not be 10, 100, or 1000 times,
                    but only 1, 2, and 3 times greater. This law, then, applies to the phenomena
                    happening in the terminal organ, and not, as generally supposed, exclusively to
                    those occurring in the brain.</p>
                <p>Such electrical phenomena probably result either from thermal or chemical changes
                    in the retina. Recent researches of Boll and Kühne have shown that light
                    produces chemical changes in the retina. If an animal be killed in the dark, and
                    if its retina be exposed only to <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> rays, the retina
                    has a peculiar purple colour, which is at once destroyed by exposure to ordinary
                    light. The purple matter apparently is decomposed by light. Kühne has also shown
                    that an image may actually be <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> on the retina by
                    plunging it into a solution of alum immediately after death. Thus it would
                    appear that light affects the purple-matter of the retina, and the result of
                    this chemical change is to stimulate the optic filaments; if the action be
                    arrested, we may have a picture on the retina, but if it be not arrested, the
                    picture is evanescent; the purple-matter is used up, and new matter of a similar
                    kind is formed to take its place. The retina might, therefore, be compared to a
                    sensitive plate having the sensitive matter quickly removed and replaced by
                    chemical changes; and it is probable that the electrical expression of these
                    changes is what has been above described.</p>
                <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Phosgenes.—</hi> Luminous impressions may also be produced
                    by pressure on the eyeball. Such impressions, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >p&gt;hosgenes,</hi> usually appear as a luminous centre surrounded by coloured
                    or dark rings. Sometimes they seem to be small bright scintillations of various
                    forms. Similar appearances may be observed at the moments of opening or of
                    closing a strong electrical current transmitted through the eyeball.</p>

                    the eyelids are closed in a dark room, is not absolutely dark. There is a

                    another. This is often termed the <hi rend="italic">proper light of the
                    retina,</hi> and it indicates a certain condition of molecular activity, even in

                    shown by Mariotte in 1668, there is no sensibility to light. Hence, this part of
                    the retina is called the <hi rend="italic">blind spot.</hi> If we shut the left
                    eye, fix the right eye on the cross seen in fig. 15, and move the book towards
                    and away from the eye, a position will be found when the round spot disappears,
                    that is when its image falls on the entrance of the optic nerve. There is also
                    complete insensibility to colours at that spot. The diameter of the optic
                    papilla is about 1 ’ 8 mm., giving an angle of 6 degrees; this angle determines
                    the apparent size of the blind spot in the visual field, and it is sufficiently
                    large to cause a human figure to disappear at a distance of two metres
                    (Beaunis).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">yellow spot</hi> in the centre of the retina is the most
                    sensitive to light, and it is chiefly employed in direct vision. Thus, if we fix
                    the eye on a word in the centre of this line, it is distinctly and sharply seen,
                    but the words towards each end of the line are vague. If we wish to see each
                    word distinctly, we “run the eye” along the line,— that is, we bring each
                    successive word on the yellow spot. This spot has a horizontal diameter of 2
                    mm., and a vertical diameter of <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8 mm.; and it
                    corresponds in the visual field to an angle of from 2 to 4 degrees. It is
                    believed that the fossa in the spot, where there are almost no retinal elements
                    except Jacob’s membrane, consisting here entirely of cones (2000 in number), is
                    the area of most acute sensibility. This fossa has a diameter of only <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 2 mm., which makes the angle ten times smaller. Thus
                    the field of distinct vision is extremely limited, and at the same moment we see
                    only a very small portion of the visual field. Images of external objects are
                    brought successively on this minute sensitive area, and the different sensations
                    seem to be fused together, so that we are conscious of the object as a
                    whole.</p>
                <p>Towards the anterior margin of the retina sensitiveness to light becomes
                    diminished; but the diminution is not uniform, and it varies in different
                    persons.</p>
                <p>(cZ) <hi rend="italic">Duration and Persistence of Retinal Impressions.—</hi> To
                    excite the retina, a feeble stimulus must act for a certain time; when the
                    retina is excited, the impression lasts after the cessation of the stimulus; but
                    if the stimulus be strong, it may be of very short duration. Thus the duration
                    of an electrical spark is extremely short, but the impression on the retina is
                    so powerful, and remains so long, as to make the spark visible. If we rotate a
                    disc having white and black sectors we see continuous dark bands. Even if we
                    paint on the face of the disc a single large round red <hi rend="italic"
                    >spot,</hi> and rotate rapidly, a continuous red <hi rend="italic">band</hi> may
                    be observed. Here the impressions of red on the same area of retina succeed each
                    other so rapidly that before one disappears another is superadded, the result
                    being a fusion of the successive impressions into one continuous sensation. This
                    phenomenon is called the <hi rend="italic">persistence of retinal
                    impressions.</hi> It has been ascertained that an im∙ pression lasts on the
                    retina from <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θ to <hi
                    rend="subscript"> b</hi> ⅛ of a second. If we look steadily at a bright light
                    for a few seconds and then quickly close the eyes or gaze into a dark room, a
                    luminous image of the light will be visible for a short time. Such an appearance
                    is called a <hi rend="italic">positive accidental image,</hi> or a consecutive
                    image. It may also be observed in this experiment that the intensity of the
                    retinal excitation is not uniform. It increases quickly at its commencement, and
                    after it has reached a maximum it slowly declines. Many familiar toys, such as
                    the thaumatrope, or wheel of life, stroboscopic discs, and the phenakistoscope,
                    produce curious effects due to persistence of retinal impressions.</p>
                <p>(e) <hi rend="italic">The Phenomena of Irradiation.·</hi> —If we look at fig. 16,
                    the white square in the black field appears to be larger than the black square
                    in the white field, although both are of precisely the same size. This is due to
                    <hi rend="italic">irradiation,</hi> a phenomenon explained by Helmholtz, by
                    stating that the borders of clear surfaces advance in the visual field and
                    encroach on obscure surfaces. Probably, even with the most exact accommodation,
                    diffusion images form round the image of a white surface on a black ground,
                    forming a kind of penumbra, thus causing it to appear larger than it really
                    is.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(∕) Intensity of Light required to excite the Retina.—</hi>
                    Light must have a certain intensity to produce a luminous impression. It is
                    impossible to fix the minimum intensity <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n858/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0858-0823"/> necessary, as the effect will depend, not only on
                    the intensity of the stimulus, but on the degree of retinal excitability at the
                    time. Thus, after the retina has been for some time in the dark, its
                    excitability is increased; on the other hand, it is much diminished by fatigue.
                    Aubert has stated that the minimum intensity is about 300 times less than that
                    of the full moon. The sensibility of the eye to light is measured by <hi
                    rend="italic">photometers,</hi> instruments which will be described under the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Light.</hi><hi rend="italic">lff) Consecutive
                    Retinal Images.—</hi> Images which persist on the retina are either positive or
                    negative. They are termed <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> when the bright and
                    obscure parts of the image are the same as the bright and obscure parts of the
                    .object; and <hi rend="italic">negative,</hi> when the bright parts of the
                    object are dark in the image, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Positive
                    images are strong and sharply marked when an intense light has acted for not
                    less than ⅜ of a second. If the excitation be continued much longer, a negative
                    and not a positive image will be seen. If, when the positive image is still
                    visible, we look on a very brilliantly illuminated surface, a negative image
                    appears. Negative images are seen with greatest intensity after a strong light
                    has acted for a considerable time. These phenomena may be best studied when the
                    retina is very excitable, as in the morning after a sound sleep. On awakening,
                    if we look steadily/or <hi rend="italic">an instant</hi> at the window and then
                    close the eyes, a <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> image of the window will
                    appear; if we then gaze fixedly at the window for one or two minutes, close the
                    eyes two or three times, and then look at a dark part of the room, a <hi
                    rend="italic">negative</hi> image will be seen floating before us. The positive
                    image is due to excitation of the retina, and the negative to fatigue. If we
                    fatigue a small area of the retina with white light, and then allow a less
                    intense light to fall on it, the fatigued area responds feebly, and consequently
                    the object, such as the window pane, appears to be dark. Many curious
                    experiments may be made to illustrate the laws of consecutive images. Thus, if
                    we look at a black figure on a white ground for, say, one minute, and then gaze
                    into a dark part of the room, a gigantic <hi rend="italic">white</hi> figure, of
                    corresponding shape, may make its appearance. A white figure on a black ground
                    will produce a black image, a green figure will produce a red, and a red a
                    green,—the reproduced colour being always complementary to that of the
                    figure.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="smallcaps">Sensations of Colour.</hi></p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="italic">General Statement.—</hi> Colour is a special sensation
                    excited by the action on the retina of rays of light of a definite wave length.
                    Thus we have a sensation of red when a certain number of waves of light impinge
                    on the retina in a unit of time, and with about twice the number of waves in the
                    same time the sensation will not be of red but of violet. When we examine a
                    spectrum, we see a series of colours merging by insensible gradations the one
                    into the other, thus :—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. These are
                    termed <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> colours. If two or more coloured rays of
                    the spectrum act simultaneously on the same spot of the retina, they may give
                    rise to sensations of <hi rend="italic">mixed colours.</hi> These mixed colours
                    are of two kinds :—(1) those which do not correspond to any colour in the
                    spectrum, such as purple and white, and (2) those which do exist in the
                    spectrum. White may be produced by a mixture of two simple colours, which are
                    then said to be <hi rend="italic">complementary.</hi> Thus, red and
                    greenish-blue, orange and cyanic-blue, yellow and indigo-blue, and
                    greenish-yellow and violet all produce white. Purple is produced by a mixture of
                    red and violet, or red and bluish-violet. When white light falls on a surface,
                    the surface may absorb all the rays except the red. If the red rays are alone
                    reflected, then the object will be red; <hi rend="italic">if</hi> the green rays
                    are reflected, then the object will appear to be green. Again, if we look
                    through red glass, all the rays are absorbed except red, and consequently the
                    world beyond appears to be red. So with regard to the other transparent coloured
                    media. The following table by Helmholtz shows the compound colours produced by
                    mixing other colours :—</p>

                <p>With sectors of such a size, <hi rend="italic">white</hi> will be produced on
                    rotating the disc rapidly. This method has been carried out with great
                    efficiency by the colour-top of Clerk Maxwell. It is simply a flat top, on the
                    surface of which discs of various colours may be placed. Dancer has added to it
                    a method by which, even while the top is rotating rapidly, and the sensation of
                    a mixed colour is strongly perceived, the eye may be able to see the <hi
                    rend="italic">simple</hi> colours of which it is composed. This is done by
                    placing on the handle of the top, a short distance above the coloured surface, a
                    thin black disc, perforated by holes of various size and pattern, and weighted a
                    little on one side. This disc vibrates to and fro rapidly, and breaks the
                    continuity of the colour-impression; and thus the constituent colours are
                    readily seen.</p>
                <p>(3.) <hi rend="italic">Physiological Characters of Colours.—</hi> All colours
                    have three special characters :—(1) <hi rend="italic">Tone,</hi> depending on

                    depending on the extent or amplitude of the vibrations, and passing from the
                    most sombre to the most brilliant shades; and (3) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saturation,</hi> which depends on the amount of <hi rend="italic">while</hi>
                    the colour contains; thus, it is saturated when there is no white, as in the
                    pure colours of the spectrum, and there may be an infinite number of degrees of
                    saturation from the pure colour to white.</p>
                <p>(4.) <hi rend="italic">The Geometric Representation of Colours.—</hi> Colours may
                    be arranged in a linear series, as in the solar spectrum. Each point of the line
                    corresponds to a determinate impression of colour; the line is not a straight
                    line, as regards luminous effect, but is better represented by a curve, passing
                    from the red to the violet. This curve might be represented as a circle in the
                    circumference of which the various colours might be placed, in which case the
                    complementary colours would be at the extremities of the same diameter. Newton
                    arranged the colours in the form of a triangle, as shown in fig. 21. If we place
                    three of the spectral colours at three angles, thus,—green, violet, and red,—the
                    sides of the triangle include the intermediate colours of the spectrum, except
                    purple.</p>
                <p>The point S corresponds to white, consequently, from the intersection of the
                    lines which join the complementary colours, the straight lines from green to S,
                    R S, and V S, represent the amount of 5 <hi rend="superscript"> ιe</hi> θ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> 3 <hi rend="superscript"> , reι</hi> ', and violet
                    necessary to form white; the same holds good lor the complementary colours; for
                    example, for blue and red, the line S B = the amount of blue, and the line S R =
                    the amountof red required to form white. Again, any point, say M, on the surface
                    of the triangle, will represent a mixed colour, the composition of vhιeh may be
                    obtained by mixing the three fundamental colours in the proportions represented
                    by the length of the lines M to green, Μ V, and M R. But the line V if passes on
                    to the yellow Y; we may then replace the red and green by the yellow, in the
                    proportion of the length of the line M Y, and mix it with violet in the
                    proportion of S V. The same colour would also be formed by mixing the amount M Y
                    of yellow with M S of white, or by the amount R M of red with the amount M D of
                    greenish blue.</p>
                <p>(5.) <hi rend="italic">The Theory of Colour-Perception.—</hi> The theory
                    generally accepted was first proposed by Thomas Young and afterwards revived by
                    Helmholtz. It is based on the assumption that three kinds of nerve fibres exist
                    in the retina, the excitation of which give respectively sensations of red,
                    green, and violet. These may be regarded as fundamental sensations. Homogeneous
                    light excites all three, but with different intensities according to the length
                    of the wave. Thus long waves will excite most strongly fibres sensitive to red,
                    medium waves those sensitive to green, and short waves those sensitive to
                    violet. Fig. 22 shows graphically the irritability of the three sets of fibres.
                    Helmholtz thus applies the theory :—</p>
                <p>“1. Red excites strongly the fibres sensitive to red and feebly the other
                    two—sensation: <hi rend="italic">Red.</hi><hi rend="italic">2.</hi> Yellow
                    excites moderately the fibres sensitive to red and green, feebly the
                    violet—sensation: <hi rend="italic">Yellow.</hi></p>
                <p>3. Green excites strongly the green, feebly the other two— sensa tion: <hi
                    rend="italic">Green.</hi></p>
                <p>4. Blue excites moderately the fibres sensitive to green and violet, and feebly
                    the red—sensation: <hi rend="italic">Blue.</hi><hi rend="italic">5.</hi> Violet
                    excites strongly the fibres sensitive to violet, and feebly the other
                    two—sensation: <hi rend="italic">Violet.</hi></p>
                <p>6. When the excitation is nearly equal for the three kinds of fibres, then the
                    sensation is <hi rend="italic">White.''</hi></p>
                <p>This theory explains some of the phenomena of what is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >colour blindness</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Daltonism.</hi> All individuals
                    appear to have some kind of colour-sensation; in some, however, there may be no
                    sensation for particular colours. The most common defect is insensibility to <hi
                    rend="italic">red</hi> (Daltonism properly so called). The spectrum to such an
                    eye is deficient in red, and the sensation corresponding to all compound colours
                    containing red is that of the complementary colour only. Thus, white is
                    bluish-green, and intense red appears green, so that red poppies in a green
                    cornfield do not appear of a different hue from the green by which they are
                    surrounded. If we suppose in such cases an absence or paralysis of the
                    red-fibres, the phenomena are accounted for. Blindness to green and violet is
                    rare.</p>
                <p>Young’s theory also explains the appearance of the consecutive coloured images
                    already referred to.</p>
                <p>Suppose, for example, that we look at a red object for a con siderable time; the
                    retinal elements sensitive to red become fatigued. Then (1) if the eye be kept
                    in <hi rend="italic">darkness,</hi> the fibres affected by red being fatigued do
                    not act so as to give a sensation of red; those of green and of violet have been
                    less excited, and this excitation is sufficient to give the sensation of pale
                    greenish blue; (2) if the eye be fixed on a <hi rend="italic">white</hi>
                    surface, the red fibres, being fatigued, are not excited by the red rays
                    contained in the white light; on the contrary, the green and violet fibres are
                    strongly excited, and the consequence is that we have an intense complementary
                    image; (3) if we look at a <hi rend="italic">bluish-green</hi> surface, the
                    complementary of red, the effect will be to excite still more strongly the green
                    and violet fibres, and consequently to have a still more intense complementary

                    >red</hi> surface, the primitive colour, the red fibres are little affected in
                    consequence of being fatigued, the green and violet fibres will be only feebly
                    excited, and therefore only a very feeble complementary image will be seen; and,
                    (5) if we look at a surface of a <hi rend="italic">different</hi> colour
                    altogether, this colour may combine with that of the consecutive image, and
                    produce a mixed colour; thus, on a yellow surface, we will see an image of an
                    orange colour.</p>
                <p>(6.) <hi rend="italic">The Contrast of Colours.—</hi> If we look at a small
                    white, grey, or black object on a coloured ground, the object appears to have
                    the colour complementary to the ground. Thus a circle of grey paper on a <hi
                    rend="italic">red</hi> ground appears to be of a greenish-blue colour, whilst on
                    a blue ground it will appear pink. This effect is heightened if we place over
                    the paper a thin sheet of tissue paper; but it disappears at once if we place a
                    black ring or border round the grey paper. Again, if we place two complementary
                    colours side by side, both appear to be increased in intensity. Various theories
                    have been advanced to explain these facts. Helmholtz is of opinion that the
                    phenomena consist more iu modifications in judgment than in modifications of
                    sensation; Plateau, on the other hand, attempts to explain them by the theory of
                    consecutive images.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Movements of the Eye.</hi></p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="italic">General Statement.—</hi> The globe of the eye has a <hi
                    rend="italic">centre of rotation,</hi> which is not exactly in the centre of the
                    optic axis, but a little behind it. On this centre it may move round <hi
                    rend="italic">axes of rotation,</hi> of which there are three,—an
                    anteroposterior, a vertical, and a transverse. In normal vision, the two eyes
                    are always placed in such a manner as to be fixed on one point, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">fixed point</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">point of regard.</hi> A
                    line passing from the centre of rotation to the point of regard is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">line of regard.</hi> The two lines of regard form an angle at
                    the point of regard, and the base is formed by a line passing from the one
                    centre of rotation to the other. A plane passing through both lines of regard is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">plane of regard.</hi> With these definitions, we
                    can now describe the movements of the eyeball, which are of three kinds, (1) <hi
                    rend="italic">First position.—</hi> The head is erect, and the line of regard is
                    directed towards the distant horizon. (2) <hi rend="italic">Second
                    position.—</hi> This indicates all the movements round the transverse and
                    horizontal axes. When the eye rotates round the first, the line of regard is
                    displaced above or below, and makes with a line indicating its former position
                    an angle termed by Helmholtz the angle of vertical displacement, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">ascensional angle;</hi> and when it rotates round the vertical
                    axis, the line of regard is displaced from side to side, forming with the median
                    plane of the eye an angle called the <hi rend="italic">angle of lateral
                    displacement.</hi> (3) <hi rend="italic">Third order of positions.—</hi> This
                    includes all those which the globe may assume in performing a rotatory movement
                    along with lateral or vertical displacements. This movement of rotation is
                    measured by the angle which the plane of regard makes with the transverse plane,
                    an angle termed the <hi rend="italic">angle of rotation</hi> or of <hi
                    rend="italic">torsion.</hi></p>
                <p>The two eyes move together as a system, so that we direct the two lines of regard
                    to the same point in space.</p>
                <p>The eyeball is moved by six muscles, which are described in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Anatomy,</hi> vol. i., p. 891. The relative attachments and the
                    axes of rotation are shown in fig. 23. The following table, given by Beaunis,

                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">visual field</hi> is given to the area intercepted by
                    the extreme visual lines which pass through the centre of the pupil, the amount
                    of dilatation of which determines its size. It follows the movements of the eye,
                    and is displaced with it. Each point in the visual field has a corresponding
                    point on the retina, but the portion, as already explained, which secures our
                    attention is that falling on the yellow spot.</p>
                <p>(2.) <hi rend="italic">Simple Vision with Two Eyes.</hi> —When we look at an
                    object with both eyes, having the optic axes parallel, its image falls upon the
                    two yellow spots, and it is seen as one object. If, however, we displace one
                    eyeball by pressing it with the finger, then the image in the displaced eye does
                    not fall on the yellow spot, and we see two objects, one of them being less
                    distinct than the other. It is not necessary, however, in order to see a single
                    object with two eyes that the two images fall on the two yellow spots; an object
                    is always single if its image fall on <hi rend="italic">corresponding
                    points</hi> in the tw o eyes.</p>
                <p>Thus, in the experiment above described, after having seen two images by
                    displacing one eyeball, we may be able again to see only one image by pressing
                    on the other eyeball. There are then corresponding points in the two retinae, so
                    that if they were supeηjosed the two yellow spots would coincide; the upper and
                    lower parts of the left retina would touch the upper and lower parts of the
                    right retina; the nasal side of the left retina would correspond to the temporal
                    side of the right retina, and the reverse would also hold good. The relation of
                    the two retinae to each other in the field of vision may be illustrated by the
                    diagram in fig. 24. When an image falls on non-corresponding points of the
                    retina, it is seen double.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n861/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0861-0826"/>
                <p>Thus, as in fig 25, suppose two eyes looking at a single object, placed at <hi
                    rend="italic">a. b.</hi> or <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> If the image of the point
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> fall in one eye on 6 and in the other on 7, the point 6
                    of the one retina being correspondent with the point 6 of the other retina, the
                    distance of the two images seen will be equal to the distance between 6 and 7.
                    Again, if images of α fall on 5 and 5, it will be seen single. Further, if the
                    image of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> fall on the left eye at 6 and on the right at
                    4, as these two points do not corresp ond, it will appear double. And so with
                    regard to the other retinal points indicated by the numbers.</p>
                <p>The phenomena may also be studied with the aid of fig. 26. Any object at a", or
                    at δ'', or at c' ’, will be seen simply by the two eyes A and B, as the images
                    fall on corresponding points in the retinae, namely, αα ’, <hi rend="italic"
                    >bb',</hi> and cc ’. It will be readily seen that, if the eye B were displaced,
                    the images would not fall on corresponding points, and consequently two would be
                    seen.</p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="italic">horopter</hi> has been given to a line connecting
                    those points in the visual field which form their image on corresponding points
                    of the retina The older physiologists first gave this name to “a straight line
                    or plane, passing through the point of convergence of the axes of the eyes or
                    the point to which the eyes are directed but Vieth and Miiller showed that it
                    cannot be a straight line or plane, but must have a circular form.</p>
                <p>Thus if the points α, <hi rend="italic">b, c</hi> in fig. 26 correspond to the
                    points <hi rend="italic">a’, b', c',</hi> the angles 4 and 1 in the one eye must
                    correspond to the angles 4 and 1 in the other.</p>
                <p>Then <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> being equal to α ’ <hi rend="italic">b'.</hi> the
                    angle 1 in eye A equal to angle 1 in eye B, the angles 1' and 1' will be equal.
                    Since the angles 2 and 2 are equal, the angles 3 and 3 must also be equal. In
                    the same way, the angle 5 is equal to angle 3, For <hi rend="italic">b
                    c≈b'd,</hi> and angle 4 = angle 4. Thus the angles 3, 3, and 5 are equal, and
                    <hi rend="italic">a" b" d'</hi> cannot lie in a straight line, for it is the
                    property of a circle only that angles erected on the same chord, and reach ing
                    the periphery have at the periphery equal angles. (Muller’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physiology,</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> υ&lt;A,</hi> ii. p. 1195.) A line
                    joining <hi rend="italic">a", b",</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c''</hi> is
                    therefore the simple horopter, and its form is illustrated by fig. 27. It is a
                    circle, of which the chord is formed by the distance between the points of
                    decussation of the rays of light in the eye (K A C K in fig 27). Its size is
                    determined by the position of the two eyes, and the point toward which their
                    axes converge. This is illustrated by fig. 28. Thus if <hi rend="italic">a
                    b</hi> be the distance of the eyes from each other, the circle c is the horopter
                    for the object marked 1, the circle <hi rend="italic">d</hi> fo: 2, and the
                    circle <hi rend="italic">e</hi> for 3.</p>
                <p>An object which is not found in the horopter, or, in other words, does not form
                    an .mage on corresponding points of the retinae, is seen double. When the
                    eyeballs are so acted upon by their muscles as to secure images on non
                    corresponding points, and consequently double vision, the condition is termed
                    <hi rend="italic">strabismus,</hi> or squinting, of which there are several
                    varieties treated of in works on ophthalmic surgery. It is important to observe
                    that in the fusion of double images we must assume, not only the correctness of
                    the theory of corresponding points of the retina, but also that there are
                    corresponding points in the brain, at the central ends of the optic fibres. Such
                    fusion of images may occur without consciousness,—at all events it is possible
                    to imagine that the cerebral effect (except as regards consciousness) would be
                    the same when a single object was placed before the two eyes, in the proper
                    position, whether the individual were conscious or not. On the other hand, as we
                    are habitually conscious of a single image, there is a psychical tendency to
                    fuse double images when they are not too dissimilar.</p>
                <p>(3.) <hi rend="italic">Binocular Perception of Colour.—</hi> This may be studied
                    as follows. Take two No. 3 eye-pieces of a Hartnack’s microscope, or two
                    eyepieces of the same optical value from any microscope, placee on in front of
                    each eye, direct them to a clear window in daylight, keep them parallel, and two
                    luminous fields will be seen, one corresponding to each eye. Then converge the
                    two eyepieces, until the two luminous circles cross, and the central part, like
                    a bi-convex’ lens, will appear clear and bright, while the outer segments will
                    be much less intense, and may appear even of a dim grey colour. Here, evidently,
                    the sensation is due to a fusion of impressions in the brain. With a similar
                    arrangement, blue light may be admitted by the one eye-piece and red by the
                    other, and on the convergence of the two, a resultant colour, purple, will be
                    observed. This may be termed the binocular vision of colours. It is remarkable
                    that by a mental effort this sensation of a compound colour may be decomposed
                    into its constituents, so that one eye will again see blue and the other
                    red.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Psychical Relations of Visual Perceptions.</hi></p>
                <p>(1'.) <hi rend="italic">General Characters of Visual Perceptions.—</hi> All
                    visual perceptions, if they last for a sufficient length of time, appear to be
                    external to ourselves, erect, localized in a position in space, and more or less
                    continuous.</p>
                <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Visual Sensations are referred to the Exterior.—</hi> This
                    appears to be due, to a large extent, to habit. Those who have been born blind,
                    on obtaining eye-sight by an operation, have imagined objects to be in close
                    proximity to the eye, and have not had the distinct sense of exteriority which
                    most individuals possess. Slowly, and by a process of education, in which the
                    sense of touch played an important part, they gained the knowledge of the
                    external relations of objects. Again, phosgenes, when first produced, appear to
                    be in the eye, but when conscious of them, by an effort of imagination, we may
                    transport them into space, although they never appear very far off.</p>
                <p>(ύ) <hi rend="italic">Visual Sensations are referred to Erect Objects.—</hi>
                    Although the images of objects are <hi rend="italic">inverted</hi> on the retina
                    we see them erect. The explanation of the effect is that we are conscious not of
                    the imago on the retina, but of the luminous object from which the rays proceed,
                    and we refer the sensation in the <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> of these
                    rays. Again, in running the eye over the object, say a tall pole, from base to
                    apex, we are not conscious of the different images on the retina, but of the
                    muscular movements necessary to bring the parts successively on the yellow
                    spot.</p>
                <p>(c) FιsωαZ <hi rend="italic">Sensations are referred to a Position in Space.</hi>
                    —The localization of a luminous point in space can only be <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0862-0827"/> determined by observing its relations to other
                    luminous points with a given position of the head and of the eye. For example,
                    in a perfectly dark room, if we look at a single luminous point, we cannot fix
                    its exact position in space, but we may get some information of a vague
                    character by moving the head or the eye. If, however, a second luminous point
                    appears in the darkness, we can tell whether it is nearer or farther distant,
                    above or below the first. So with regard to other luminous points we observe
                    their reciprocal relations, and thus we localize a number of visual impressions.
                    There are three principal directions in space—(1) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >transverse</hi> (breadth), the <hi rend="italic">vertical</hi> (height), and
                    the <hi rend="italic">sagittal</hi> (depth). Luminous points may be localized
                    either in the transverse or vertical directions. Here we have to do simply with
                    localization on a surface. A number of points may be observed simultaneously (as
                    when the eye is fixed) or successively (as when the eye moves). If the movement
                    of the eye be made rapidly, the series of impressions from different points may
                    be fused together, and we are conscious of a <hi rend="italic">line,</hi> the
                    direction of which is indicated chiefly by the muscular sensations felt in
                    following it. The case is different as regards points in the sagittal direction.
                    We see only a single point of this line at a time; it may be a transverse series
                    of retinal elements A, B, and each of these formed by a number of smaller
                    elements 1, 2, 3, 4 situated in the axis of each principal element; it may be,
                    on the other hand, the transverse line <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> situated in
                    space and formed by a series of points in juxtaposition. Each of these points
                    will impress a retinal element, and the result will be the perception of a
                    transverse line; but this will not be the same for the points c, <hi
                    rend="italic">d, e,f,g,</hi> situated in space in a linear series, in the
                    sagittal direc tion; only one of those points <hi rend="italic">c</hi> will
                    impress the corresponding retinal element, and we can see only <hi rend="italic"
                    >one</hi> point at a time in the line <hi rend="italic">eg.</hi> By
                    accommodating successively, however, for the various points at different and
                    considerable distances along the line <hi rend="italic">eg,</hi> we may excite
                    retinal elements in rapid succession. Thus, partly by the fusion of the
                    successive impressions on the retina, and partly from the muscular sensations
                    caused by repeated accommodations and possibly of ocular movements, we obtain a
                    notion of <hi rend="italic">depth</hi> in space, even with the use of only one
                    eye. It is, however, one of the chief effects of binocular vision to give
                    precision to the notion of space in the sagittal direction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(fh) Visual Sensations are continuous.—</hi> Suppose the image
                    of a luminous line falls on the retina, it will appear as a line although it is
                    placed on perhaps 200 cones or rods, each of which may be separately excited, so
                    as to cause a <hi rend="italic">distinct</hi> sensation. Again, on the same
                    principle, the impression of a superficial surface may be regarded as a kind of
                    <hi rend="italic">mosaic,</hi> made up of individual portions corresponding to
                    the rods or cones on which the image of the surface falls. But in both cases,
                    the sensation is continuous, so that we see a line or a surface. The individual
                    images are fused together.</p>
                <p>(2.) <hi rend="italic">Motions derived from Visual Perceptions.—</hi> When we
                    look at any object, we judge of its size, the direction of its surfaces (unless
                    it be a point), its distance from the eye, its apparent movement or fixedness,
                    and its appearance of solidity.</p>
                <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Apparent Size.—</hi> This, so far as regards a
                    comparatively small object, depends on the size of the retinal image, as
                    determined by the visual angle. With a very large object, there is an
                    appreciation of size from the muscular sensations derived from the movements of
                    the eyeball, as we “range” the eye over it. It is difficult to appreciate the
                    distance separating two points between which there are other points, as
                    contrasted with an apparently similar distance without intermediate points. For
                    example, the distance A to B appears to be greater than from B to C, in fig.
                    30.</p>
                <p>(δ) <hi rend="italic">Direction.—</hi> As the retina is a curved surface, a long
                    straight line, especially when seen from a distance, appears curved. In fig. 31
                    a curious illusion of direction, first shown by Zoell-ner, is depicted. If these
                    lines be looked at somewhat obliquely, say from one corner, they will appear to
                    converge or diverge, and the oblique lines, on each side of the vertical lines,
                    will appear not to be exactly opposite each other. But the vertical lines are
                    parallel, and the oblique lines are continuous across them. The effect is
                    evidently due to an error of judgment, as it may be controlled by an intense
                    effort, when the lines will be seen as they really are.</p>
                <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Apparent Distance.—</hi> We judge of distance, as regards
                    large objects at a great distance from the eye—(1) from their apparent size,
                    which depends on the dimensions of the visual angle, and (2) from the
                    interposition of other objects between the eye and the distant object. Thus, at
                    sea, we cannot form, without great experience, an accurate estimate of how many
                    miles we are off the coast, and all know how difficult it is to estimate
                    accurately the width of a river. But if objects be interposed between the eye
                    and the distant object, say a few vessels at different distances at sea, or a
                    boat in the river, then we have certain materials on which to form a judgment,
                    the accuracy of which, however, even with these aids, will depend on experience.
                    When we look at a near object, we judge of its distance chiefly by the sense of
                    effort put forth in bringing the two lines of regard to converge upon it.</p>

                    judge of movement by successive portions of the retina beiug affected, and
                    possibly also, by a feeling of an <hi rend="italic">absence</hi> of muscular
                    contractions necessary to move the eye-balls. When the eye moves, so as to
                    “follow” the object, there is a sense of muscular effort, which is increased
                    when, in additio) we require to move the head.</p>
