                <p><label type="entry">EUDOCIA</label>, the wife of Theodosius II., was the daughter
                    of the Athenian sophist Leontius, or Leon. It is impossible to fix the date of
                    her birth more precisely than in the last decade of the 4th century, though by
                    an inference from a statement of Nicephorus Callistus (xiv. 50) the year 393-4
                    has been fixed upon. She was called Athenais prior to her conversion to
                    Christianity. By her father she was carefully instructed in literature and the
                    sciences; and so high an estimate did the philosopher form of her beauty and
                    merit that, thinking any other endowment unnecessary, he divided his whole
                    patrimony between his two sons. Athenais, however, resented this as an
                    injustice, and carried her plea to Constantinople before the emperor. Here she
                    gained access to Pulcheria, the sister of Theodosius, and by her she was
                    secretly destined to be the wife of the emperor. The probable date of her
                    marriage is 421. Before her elevation to the throne, she renounced paganism and
                    was baptized. It was not, however, till the birth of a daughter that she
                    received the title of Augusta (423). Her brothers she not only forgave, but
                    raised to the dignity of consuls and praefects. About 438 Eudocia made an
                    ostentatious pilgrimage to the Holy Land, distributing alms and donations for
                    pious purposes with a munificence which exceeded that of the great Helena, and
                    she returned to Constantinople in the following year with precious relics of St
                    Stephen, St Peter, and the Virgin. Her peace, however, was soon after disturbed
                    by the jealousy of her husband, on account, it is said, of his observing a
                    beautiful apple which he had presented to her in the hands of Paulinus, his
                    master of the offices. The execution of the supposed favourite, and the
                    retirement of Eudocia in 449 to Jerusalem, did not appease the anger of the
                    emperor, who despatched a messenger for the purpose of putting to death two
                    ecclesiastics who had gained her confidence. The assassination of his envoy
                    provoked the emperor still further, and Eudocia was stripped of her royal
                    honours, and degraded in the eyes of the nation. In Jerusalem Eudocia became
                    infected with the Eutychian heresy, and through her influence it made
                    considerable progress in Syria, but the misfortunes of her daughter Licinia
                    Eudocia led her to obtain a reconciliation with Pulcheria, and through her
                    mediation and that of her brothers she afterwards returned to the communion of
                    the church. She died at Jerusalem about 4G0, and was buried in the church of St
                    Stephen. With her latest breath she protested that she had never transgressed
                    the bounds of innocence aud friendship. Eudocia continued through life to
                    cultivate her early literary tastes. She composed a paraphrase on the Octateuch
                    in heroic verse, a paraphrase of Daniel and Zechariah, and a poem on the
                    martyrdom of St Cyprian. To these are added a poem on her husband’s victory over
                    the Persians, and, according to Zonaras, a cento of the verses of Homer applied
                    to the life and miracles of Christ, but her authorship of the latter is
                    generally disputed by critics.</p>
