                    of anything, because embroidery was chiefly exercised upon the edge or border of
                    vestments.</p></note> is the art of working with the needle flowers, fruits,
                    human and animal forms upon wool, silk, linen, or other woven texture. That it
                    is of the greatest antiquity we have the testimony of Moses and Homer, and it
                    takes precedence of paiuting, as the earliest method of representing figures and
                    ornaments was by needle-work traced upon canvas. From the earliest times it
                    served to decorate the sacerdotal vestments and other objects applied to
                    ecclesiastical use, and queens deemed it an honour to occupy their leisure hours
                    in delineating with the needle the achievements of their heroes. The Jews are
                    supposed to have derived their skill in needle-work from the Egyptians, with
                    whom the art of embroidery w as general; they produced figured cloths by the
                    needle and the loom, and practised the art of introducing gold thread or wire
                    into their work. Amasis, king of Egypt, sent to the Minerva of Lindus a linen
                    corslet with figures interwoven and embroidered with gold and wool; and, to
                    judge from a passage in Ezekiel, they even embroidered the sails of their
                    galleys which they exported to Tyre: “Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt
                    was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail.” Embroidery and tapestry are
                    often confounded; the distinction should be clearly “understood. Embroidery is
                    worked upon a woven texture having both warp and woof, whereas tapestry is
                    wrought in a loom upon a warp stretched along its frame, but has no warp thrown
                    across by the shuttle; the weft is done with short threads variously coloured
                    and put in by a kind of needle.</p>

                <p>The book of Exodus describes how the curtains of the tabernacle were embroidered
                    by hand, and the garments of Aaron and his sons were wrought in needle-work.
                    Aholiab, the chief embroiderer, is specially appointed to assist in the work of
                    decoration. In celebrating the triumph of Sisera, his mother is made to say that
                    he has a “prey of divers colours of needle-work on both sides,” evideutly
                    meaning that the stuff was wrought on both sides alike, a style of embroidery
                    exhibiting a degree of patience and skill only practised by the nations of the
                    East.</p>
                <p>Homer makes constant allusion to embroidery. Penelope (to say nothing for her
                    immortal web) throws over Ulysses on his departure for Troy an embroidered
                    garment of gold on which she had depicted incidents of the chase. Helen is
                    described as sitting apart, engaged in working a gorgeous suit upon which she
                    had portrayed the wars of Troy; and Andromache was embroidering flowers of
                    various hues upon a purple cloth when the cries of the people without informed
                    her of the tragic end of Hector. In Greece the art was held in the greatest
                    honour, and its invention ascribed to Minerva, and prompt was her punishment of
                    the luckless Arachne for daring to doubt her supremacy in the art. The maidens
                    who took part in the procession of the Panathenaea embroidered the veil or
                    peplum, upon which the deeds of the goddess were worked in embroidery and
                    gold.</p>
                <p>Phrygia became celebrated for the beauty of its needlework. The “toga picta”
                    ornamented with Phrygian embroidery was worn by the Roman generals at their
                    triumphs, and by their consuls when they celebrated the games—hence embroidery
                    itself in Latin is styled “Phrygian,” and the Romans knew it under no other
                    name.</p>
                <p>Babylon was no lees renowned for its embroideries, and maintained its reputation
                    up to the first century of the Christian era. Josephus tells us that the veils
                    given by Herod for the temple were of Babylonian workmanship,— the women
                    excelling, says Apollonius, in executing designs of varied colours. The Sidonian
                    women brought by Paris to Troy embroidered veils of such rich embroidery that
                    Hecuba deemed them worthy of being presented as an offering to Minerva; and
                    Lucan speaks with enthusiasm of the magnificent Sidonian veil worn by Cleopatra
                    at the feast she gave Caesar after the death of Pompey. The embroidered robe of
                    Servius Tullius was ornamented all over with the imago of the goddess Fortune,
                    to whom he ascribed his success, and to whom he built several temples. Tarquin
                    the elder first appeared at Rome in a robe embroidered all over with gold, and
                    Cicero describes Damocles as reclining on his bed with a coverlet of magnificent
                    embroidery.</p>
                <p>Passing to the first ages of the Christian era, we find the pontifical ornaments,
                    the tissues that decorated the altars, and the curtains of the churches all
                    worked with the holy images; and in the 5th century the art of weaving stuffs
                    and enriching them with embroidery was carried to the highest degree of
                    perfection. The whole history of the church was embroidered on the toga of a
                    Christian senator; and Anastasius, who has left a description of ornaments of
                    this kind given by popes and emperors to the churches from the 4th to the 9th
                    century, has even recorded the subjects of these embroideries, which are
                    executed in gold and silver thread upon silk stuffs of the most brilliant
                    colours, producing a wonderful effect. “Opus plumarium” was then the general
                    term for embroidery, and so given because stitches were laid down lengthwise and
                    so put together that they seemed to overlap one another like the feathers in the
                    plumage of a bird. Not inaptly, therefore, was this style called feather-stitch,
                    in contradistinction to cross-stitch. Pope Paschal (5th century), a great
                    admirer of needle-work, made many splendid donations to the church. On one of
                    his vestments were portrayed the Wise</p>
                <p>Virgins, miraculously worked; on another a peacock, in all the gorgeous and
                    changing colours of its plumage, on an amber ground.</p>
                <p>In mediaeval times, spinning and embroidery were the occupation of women of all
                    ranks, from the palace to the cloister, and a sharp rivalry existed in the
                    production of sacerdotal vestments and ornaments. So early as the Gth century,
                    St Césaire, bishop of Arles, forbade the nuns under his rule from embroidering
                    robes adorned with paintings, flowers, and precious stones. This prohibition,
                    however, was not of a general character. Near Ely, an Anglo-Saxon lady brought
                    together a number of girls who produced admirable embroidery for the benefit of
                    the monastery; and in the 7th century, St Eustadiole, abbess of Bourges, made
                    sacred vestments and decorated the altar with works by herself and her
                    community. A century later, two sisters, abbesses of Valentina, in Belgium,
                    became famous for their excellence in all feminine pursuits, and imposed
                    embroidery work upon the inmates of their convent as a protection from idleness,
                    the most dangerous of all evils.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the 9th century, ladies of rank are to be found engaged in
                    embroidery. St Viborade, living at St Gall, adorned beautiful coverings for the
                    sacred books of that monastery, it being then the custom to wrap in silk and
                    carry on a linen cloth the Gospels used for the offices of the church; and the
                    same abbey received from Hadwiga, daughter of Henry duke of Swabia, chasubles
                    and ornaments embroidered by the hand of that princess. Judith of Bavaria,
                    mother of Charles the Bald, was also a skilful embroideress. When Harold, king
                    of Denmark, came to be baptized at Ingelheim with all his family, the empress
                    Judith, who stood sponsor for the queen, presented her with a robe enriched by
                    herself with gold and precious stones. In the 10th century, Queen Adhelaïs, wife
                    of Hugh Capet, presented to the church of St Martin at Tours, and another to the
                    abbey of St Denis, two chasubles of different designs but of wonderful
                    workmanship.</p>
                <p>Long before theConquestEuglish ladies were much skilled with the needle. The
                    beautiful “opus Anglicum” was produced under the Anglo-Saxons, and so highly was
                    it valued that we find (800) Deubart, bishop of Durham, granting the lease of a
                    farm of 200 acres for life to the embroideress Eanswitha for the charge of
                    scouring, repairing, and renewing the embroidered vestments of the priests. In
                    the 7th century, St Ethelreda, queen and first abbess of Ely, presented to St
                    Cuthbert a stole and maniple marvellously embroidered and embellished with gold
                    and precious stones. The four daughters of Edward the Elder are all praised for
                    their needles’ skill; andin the 10th century, Aelfleda, a high-born Saxon lady,
                    gave to the church at Ely a curtain on which she had wrought in needle-work the
                    deeds of daring of her husband Brithnoth, who was slain by the Danes. Later on,
                    Emma, wife of Canute, enriched the same minster with costly stuffs, of which one
                    at least had been embroidered all over with orfrays by the queen herself, and
                    embellished with gold and gems disposed with such art and profusion as could not
                    be matched at that time in all England.</p>
                <p>The excellence of the English work was maintained as time went on, a proof of
                    which is found in an anecdote related by Matthew of Paris:—“About this time”
                    (1246), he tells us, “the Lord Pope (Innocent IV.), having observed that the
                    ecclesiastical ornaments of some Englishmen, such as choristers’ copes and
                    mitres, were embroidered in gold thread after a very desirable fashion, asked
                    where these works were made, and received in answer, in England.</p>
                <p>Then,’ said the Pope, ‘England is surely a garden of delights for us. It is truly
                    a never-failing spring, and there, where many things abound, much may be
                    extorted.’</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n171/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0171-0162"/>
                <p>Accordingly, the same Lord Pope sent sacred and sealed briefs to nearly all the
                    abbots of the Cistercian order established in England, requesting them to have
                    forthwith forwarded to him those embroideries in gold, which he preferred to all
                    others, and with which he wished to adorn his chasuble and choral cope, as if
                    these objects cost them nothing.” But, it may be asked, what is the “opus
                    Anglicum ?” Happily in the Syon Monastery Cope, preserved in the South
                    Kensington Museum, there is an invaluable specimen of English needle-work of the
                    13th century. We find that the whole of the face is worked in chain-stitch
                    (modern tambour or crochet) in circular lines, the relief being given by hollows
                    sunk by means of hot irons. The general practice was to work the draperies in
                    feather-stitch (opus plumarium).</p>
                <p>The old English “opus consuetum” or cutwork, the “appliqué” or “en rapport” of
                    the French, and “lavori di commesso” of the Italians, consists of pieces cut and
                    shaped out of silk or other material and sewed upon the grounding.</p>
                <p>In the 11th or probably early in the 12th century was executed the valuable
                    specimen preserved to us, the so-called tapestry of Bayeux, ascribed by early
                    tradition to no less a lady than Queen Matilda, and representing the various
                    episodes of the conquest of England by William of Normandy. It is not tapestry,
                    but an embroidery work in crewels in “long-stitch” of various colours, on a
                    linen cloth 19 inches wide by 226 yards long. Probabilities forbid us from
                    believing that Matilda and her waiting maids ever did a stitch on this canvas,
                    which, crowded as it is with fighting men, some on foot some on horseback, must
                    have taken much time and busied many fingers to execute; nor is it likely that
                    Matilda would have chosen coarse linen and common worsted as the materials with
                    which to celebrate her husband’s achievements. More likely, this curious work
                    was done in London at the cost of those natives of Normandy on whom William had
                    bestowed lands in England, and was sent by them as an offering to the cathedral
                    of their native place. Whether it be due to the queen or not, the monument is no
                    less interesting to history, as furnishing a crowd of details in illustration of
                    arms and customs not to be met with elsewhere.</p>
                <p>The art of pictorial needle-work had become universally spread. The inventory of
                    the Holy See (1295) mentions the embroideries of Florence, Milan, Lucca, France,
                    England, Germany, and Spain. The Paris embroiderers had formed themselves into a
                    guild; and throughout the Middle Ages down to the 16th century embroidery was an
                    art, a serious branch of painting. The needle, like the brush of the painter,
                    moved over the tissue, leaving behind its coloured threads, and producing a
                    painting soft in tone and ingenious in execution. At Verona, an artist took
                    twenty-six years to execute in needle-work the life of St John, after the
                    designs of Pollaniolo, as an offering to that church at Florence. Catherine de’
                    Medici, herself a distinguished needle-woman, brought over in her train from
                    Florence the designer for embroidery, Frederick Vinciolo; and under her sons, so
                    overloaded was dress with ornament as to be described by contemporaries as to be
                    “stiff” with embroidery. These were indeed great days for needle-work in our own
                    land. Women as well as men pursued the art as a trade, and the public records
                    show to what an extent it was carried on; while great ladies wrought in their
                    castles surrounded by their maidens.· Embroidery was then their chief pleasure,
                    and their most serious occupation. Shut out from the business of life, they had
                    ample leisure to cultivate their taste, and ample means of gratifying it. The
                    church was very rich in precious stuff's and embroideries, velvet, cutwork
                    (appliqué), or cloth of gold; and for domestic decoration they were equally
                    prized. Many of our great showhouses are perfect storehouses of embroidery.</p>
                <p>The countess of Shrewsbury, for instance, better known as Bess of Hardwick, the
                    great needle-woman of the day, with all the business and cares of children,
                    hospitals, and charities, yet found time to embroider furniture for her palaces,
                    and her sampler patterns hang to this day on her walls; and there also are the
                    bedhangings of Scotland’s queen, who beguiled her weary hours by work at her
                    needle. Hatfield, Penshurst, Knole, are all filled with similar reminiscences of
                    royal and noble ladies. Charles I. used to send from his prison locks of his own
                    hair to the gentry favourable to his cause, that the ladies of their household,
                    when embroidering the royal portraiture in coloured silks, might be able to work
                    the head with the hair of the sovereign himself.</p>
                <p>In France this time was a glorious period for needlework. Not only was the
                    fashion continued, as in England, of producing figures and portraits, but a
                    fresh development was given to floral and arabesque ornament. Flowers in the
                    grandiose style, wrought with arabesques of gold and silver, among which sported
                    birds and insects, were the characteristic designs of the period; and Gaston
                    duke of Orleans established hothouses and botanical gardens, which he filled
                    with rare exotics, to supply the needle with new forms and richer tints. The
                    crown manufacturers adorned the rich brocades of Tours, watered silks, and
                    cloths of silver with patterns furnished by Charles Le Brun for the portières
                    and curtains to the rooms he had designed. Hangings, furniture, costumes,
                    equipages—embroidery invaded all. The throne of Louis XV., used for the
                    reception of the Knights of the Holy Ghost, alone cost 300,000 livres; nor was
                    the embroidery of the state coaches of Marie Antoinette less costly.</p>
                <p>The history of embroidery having been carried to the end of the 18th century, a
                    few observations remain on its state in the present day, when every country
                    furnishes its works of the needle, from the gorgeous productions in gold and
                    silver of the East to the humble porcupine quill and mohair embroidery of the

                <p>In an industrial point of view, the art may be ranged into two classes., First,
                    there is white embroidery, applied to dress and furniture, upon cloth, muslin,
                    or tulle, in which France and Switzerland hold the first place, and then
                    Scotland and Saxony. The second class comprises works in silk, gold, and silver,
                    the two last more especially dedicated to church ornaments and military costume.
                    From the East we derive the most elaborate specimens of embroidery as applied to
                    dress and furniture; for while in the West these are chiefly used for the church
                    and costume, in the East every article of domestic use is covered with
                    embroideries in silver and gold. The Chinese embroider the imperial dragon upon
                    their robes of crimson satin; nor are the Japanese works less gorgeous or in
                    less perfect taste. The Persians, in the 17th century, sent to Europe rich
                    embroidered coverlets for the state beds of the period. They work extensively in
                    chain-stitch. A supplementary division may be made of the so-called Berlin work,
                    executed in wool and silk upon canvas, in cross-stitch, or point de marque, as
                    it was formerly called, as being the stitch used for marking.</p>
