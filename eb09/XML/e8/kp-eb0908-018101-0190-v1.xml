                    governed by a person bearing the title of emperor (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Emperor),</hi> or, more generally, any extensive dominion. The historians
                    of a former age were accustomed to enumerate a succession of great empires, and
                    especially the Babylonian and Assyrian, the Medo-Persian, and the Macedonian,
                    which had embraced the greater part of the civilized world before the rise of
                    Roman power, but that system has now been abandoned. In its strict sense, “the
                    Empire” meant during the Middle Ages, and indeed almost till the present
                    century, the Romano-Germanic or so-called Holy Roman Empire, of which this is
                    therefore the proper place to give a short account. The old Roman empire,
                    founded by Julius Caesar and Augustus, was finally divided in 395 <hi

                    Theodosius the Great,—that is to say, one part of it, the Western, was ruled
                    from Rome or Ravenna by one sovereign, and the other or Eastern half from
                    Constantinople by another,—although the whole was still held to constitute, in
                    theory, a single Roman state which had been divided merely for administrative
                    purposes. In 476 the Western throne was overturned by Odoacer, the leader of an
                    army of barbarian mercenaries in the imperial service; and the provinces which
                    had obeyed it, so far as they were not then already occupied by invading German
                    tribes, reverted to the emperor reigning at Constantinople, who thereby became
                    again sole titular monarch of the Roman world. Justinian reconquered Italy in
                    the following century, and his successors retained Rome, though Constantinople
                    was their capital, for two centuries. This state of things lasted till 800, when
                    Charles king of the Franks (Charlemagne) was crowned Roman emperor in Rome by
                    Pope Leo III. All the Western provinces, except a part of Italy, had long since
                    ceased to obey the emperor, and that part of Italy had rebelled about seventy
                    years before. The object of the elevation of the Frankish king was to make Rome
                    again the capital of an undivided Roman empire, rather than to effect a
                    severance by creating a separate Western empire; but as the Eastern empire
                    continued to subsist, the effect of the step really was to establish two
                    mutually hostile lines of emperors, each claiming to be the one rightful
                    successor of Augustus and Constantine, but neither able to dispossess its rival.
                    The imperial title, which had fallen very low under the successors of Charles,
                    was again revived in the West by Otto the Great, king of the East Franks, in
                    962; and from his time on there was an unbroken suc cession of German kings who
                    took the name and enjoyed the titular rank and rights of Roman emperors, being
                    acknowledged in the Western countries and by the Latin Church as the heads of
                    the whole Christian community. Their power was, however, practically confined to
                    Germany and Northern Italy, and after the death of Frederick IJ. (1250), it
                    became comparatively weak even in those countries. In 1453 Constantinople was
                    taken by the Turks, and the Eastern Roman empire came to an end. The Western,
                    however, though now so feeble that it could only be kept on foot by choosing as
                    emperor some prince powerful by his hereditary dominions, lasted on till the
                    year 1806, when l·rancis II. of Hapsburg, archduke of Austria and king of
                    Hungary and Bohemia, resigned his imperial title, and withdrew to the government
                    of his hereditary kingdoms and principalities under the name (assumed the year
                    before) of emperor of Austria. With him the Holy Roman Empire ended.</p>
                <p>The territorial extent of the Romano-Germanic empire varied greatly at different
                    periods of its history. In the time of Charles the Great it included the
                    northern half of Italy (except the district about Venice), Gaul, Western and
                    Southern Germany, and Spain between the Pyrenees and the Ebro. Under Otto the
                    Great and his first successors it extended over the whole of Germany (including
                    Holland and Belgium), as it then stood (modern Germany stretches further towards
                    the north-east), and the south-east part of modern France, being what was then
                    called the kingdom of Burgundy, and had claims of superiority, more or less
                    definite in different cases, over the adjacent kingdoms of Hungary, Poland, and
                    Denmark. Its further pretensions over the greater kingdoms of France, England,
                    Spain, and Naples can hardly be said to have been admitted, though in a
                    speculative sense the Holy Empire was held to include these states and indeed
                    the whole Christian world. At the era of the Reformation all claims over
                    districts outside Germany had become obsolete, nor were they ever revived. From
                    the 15th century onwards it was practically conterminous with modern Germany,
                    except that it did not include East Prussia.</p>
                <p>The government of the Holy Roman Empire was never an absolute monarchy in the
                    sense in which that of the old pagan empire had been, or that of the Eastern
                    empire at Constantinople was while it lasted. Down till the end of the
                    Hohenstaufen time (1254) it -was a strong feudal monarchy, in which, as in the
                    other feudal kingdoms of Europe, the sovereign enjoyed powers which were
                    considerable but by no means unlimited, as he was obliged to respect the rights
                    of his vassals, and could obtain supplies and pass laws only with the consent of
                    the Diet, or supreme national assembly. From the time of Rudolf of Hapsburg (who
                    came to the throne in 1272), its strength, which had been broken in a long
                    struggle against the pope and the Italian republics, was much less; its revenues
                    had shrunk, and the greater nobles had become practically independent princes,
                    sovereign in their own territories, and sometimes stronger than the emperor. The
                    struggles which attended and followed the Reformation still further weakened the
                    authority of the crown, to which, as Roman Catholic, the Protestant princes and
                    cities became almost of necessity hostile; and after the Thirty Years’ War, when
                    the Peace of Westphalia (1648) had finally settled the constitution of the
                    empire, it was really no longer an empire at all, but a federation of’ very
                    numerous principalities, some large, many very small, united under the
                    presidency of a head who bore the title of emperor, but enjoyed scarcely any
                    actual power, and represented in a Diet which was now not so much a national
                    parliament as a standing congress of envoys and officials.</p>
                <p>The imperial crown was always in theory elective, but <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0908-0191-0182"/> in the earlier Middle Ages it was elective in
                    much the same sense as the crowns of other feudal kingdoms, that is to say, the
                    consent of the nobles and people, latterly of the chief nobles only, was
                    required to the elevation of a sovereign, while practically it was hereditary,
                    that is to say, the son or other near relative of the last sovereign was usually
                    chosen to succeed him. Partly, however, owing to the extinction of several
                    families in succession which had held it, partly to the influence of the pope
                    and the idea that the imperial office was of a more sacred nature than the
                    regal, the elective gradually came to prevail over the hereditary principle; and
                    from the 13th century onwards, the Romano-Germanic throne was in the gift of a
                    small electoral college consisting first of seven, then of eight, and ultimàtely
                    of nine princes (see Pfeffinger, Vitriamus illustratus; Moser, Römische Kayser;
                    Bryce, Holy Roman Empire). Nevertheless, from the election of Frederick III. in
                    1440 down to 1806, all the emperors except two— Charles VII. (1742) and Francis
                    I. (1745)—belonged to the house of Ha <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> psburg.</p>
                <p>The present German empire, which came into existence when the king of Prussia
                    accepted the title of emperor (December 31, 1870), is not legally a continuation
                    of the Romano-Germanic empire, though practically it occupies a somewhat similar
                    European position. Technically speaking, it is a new creation, which has not
                    succeeded to the rights of Rome any more than the Russian empire has to those of
                    the Eastern or Byzantine empire, which the czars have sometimes claimed to
                    represent. <hi rend="smallcaps">* (j. br.)</hi></p>
