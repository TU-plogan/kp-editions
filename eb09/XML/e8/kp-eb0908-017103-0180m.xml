                    (Struthio camelus)·, but no additional evidence in support of the assertion is
                    given by Dozy in 1869 (Glossaire des mots espagnols et portugais dérivés fe
                    l'arabe. Ed. 2, p. 260). According to Gesner in 1555 (lib. iii. p. 709), it was
                    the Portuguese name of the Crane (Gms communis),, and had been transferred with
                    the qualifying addition of <hi rend="superscript"> ,t</hi> di Gci (i.e.,
                    Ground-Crane) to the Ostrich. This statement is confirmed by Aldrovandus (lib.
                    ix. cap. 2). Subsequently, but in what order can scarcely now be determined, the
                    name was naturally enough used for the Ostrich-like birds inhabiting the lands
                    discovered by the Portuguese, both in the Old and in the New’ World. The last of
                    these are now known as Rheas, and the preceding as Cassowaries.</p></note> a
                    name which has in turn been applied to each of the earlier-known forms of Ratite
                    Birds, but has in all likelihood finally settled upon that which inhabits
                    Australia, though, until less than a century ago, it was given by most authors
                    to the bird now commonly called Cassowary—this last word being a corrupted form
                    of the Malayan Suwari (see Crawfurd, Gramm, and Diet. Malay Language, ii. pp.
                    178 and 25), apparently first printed as Casoaris by Bontius in 1658 (Hist. nat.

                <p>The Cassowaries (Casuariidce) and Emeus (Drοmceidce) —as the latter name is now
                    used—have much structural resemblance, and form the Order Megistanes,<note

                    Professor Huxley has shewn (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1867, pp. 422, 423) that they agree
                    in differing from the other Patitοe in many important characters, into the
                    details of which it is now impossible to enter; but one of the most obvious of
                    them is that each contour-feather appears to be double, its hyporrhachis, or
                    aftershaft, being as long as the main shaft—a feature noticed in the case of
                    either form so soon as examples were brought to Europe. The external
                    distinctions of the two families are, however, equally plain. The Cassowaries,
                    when adult, bear a horny helmet on their head, they have some part of the neck
                    bare, generally more or less ornamented with caruncles, and the claw of the
                    inner toe is remarkably elongated. The Emeus have no helmet, their head is
                    feathered, their neck has no caruncles, and their inner toes bear a claw of no
                    singular character.</p>
                <p>The type of the Casuariidce is the species named by Linnaeus Struthio cαsuarius
                    and by Latham Casuamus emeu. Vieillot subsequently called it C. galeatus, and

                    exclusion of the older specific appellation. It seems to be peculiar to the
                    island of Ceram, and was made known to naturalists, as we learn from Clusius, in
                    1597, by the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies, when an example was
                    brought from Banda, whither it had doubtless been conveyed from its native
                    island. It was said to have been called by the inhabitants “Emeu,” or “Ema,” but
                    this name they must have had from the earlier Portuguese navigators.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is known that the
                    Portuguese preceded the Dutch in their voyages to the East, and it is almost
                    certain that the latter were assisted by pilots of the former nation, whose
                    names for places and various natural objects would be imparted to their
                    employers (see Doυo, vol. vii. p. 322).</p></note> Since that time examples have
                    been continually imported into Europe, so that it has become one of the
                    best-known members of the subclass Ratitoe, and a description of it seems hardly
                    necessary. For a long time its glossy, but coarse and hair-like, black plumage,
                    its lofty helmet, the gaudily-coloured caruncles of its neck, and the four or
                    five barbless quills which represent its wing-feathers, made it appear unique
                    among birds. But in 1857 Dr George Bennett certified the existence of a second
                    and perfectly distinct species of Cassowary, an inhabitant of New Britain, where
                    it was known to the natives as the Moorulc, and in

                    his honour it was named by Mr Gould C. bennetti. Several examples were soon
                    after received in this country, and these confirmed the view of it already
                    taken. Of late years a considerable number of other species of the genus have
                    been described (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 740, note)
                    from various localities in the same Subregion.<note anchored="true"

                    New Guinea and its adjacent islands has recently been so great that the list
                    given in the passage above referred to is already out of date, and it seems at
                    present hardly possible to place the exact state of our knowledge of the species
                    of Casuarius before the reader. Several of them have been described from
                    immature examples living in menageries, which have not always lived to assume
                    the characteristics of the adult, and a comparison of such examples has not in
                    every case been practicable. Moreover, the precise localities whence some of
                    them have been brought have perhaps been wrongly assigned. The promise*d work of
                    Prof. Salvadori on the ornithology of New Guinea will very likely clear up many
                    points that are now open to doubt; and though it is probable that in some
                    instances the same species has been designated by more than one name, it cannot
                    be maintained that every existing species has been brought to our
                    knowledge.</p></note> Conspicuous among them from its large size and lofty
                    helmet is the C. australis, from the northern parts of Australia. Its existence
                    indeed had been ascertained, by the late Mr T. S. Wall, in 1854, but the
                    specimen obtained by that unfortunate explorer was lost, and it was not until
                    1867 that an example was submitted to competent naturalists.</p>
                <p>Not much seems to be known of the habits of any of the Cassowaries in a state of
                    nature. Though the old species occurs rather plentifully over the whole of the
                    interior of Ceram, Mr Wallace was unable to obtain or even to see an example.
                    They all appear to bear captivity well, and the hens in confinement frequently
                    lay their dark green and rough-shelled eggs, which, according to the custom of
                    the Ratitae, are incubated by the cocks. The nestling plumage is mottled (Proc.
                    Zool. Soc. 1863, pl. xlii.), and when about half-grown they are clothed in
                    dishevelled feathers of a deep tawny colour.</p>
                <p>Of the Emeus (as the word is now restricted) the best-known is the Casuarius
                    novoe-liollandioe of Latham, made by Vieillot the type of his genus
                    Dromoeus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The obvious
                    misprint of Dromeιcus in this author’s work (Analyse, &amp;c., p. 54) has been

                    pages further on (p. 70) to Drοmaius—the properly latinized form of which is
                    Dromaeus.</p></note> whence the name of the family (Dromoeidoe) is taken. This
                    bird immediately after the colonization of New South Wales (in 1788) was found
                    to inhabit the south-eastern portion of Australia, where, according to Hunter
                    (Hist. Journ., &amp;c., pp. 409, 413), the natives call it Maracry, Marr yang,
                    or Maroang; but it has now been so hunted down that not an <pb break="no"

                    have been fully settled. . It is said to have existed also on the islands of
                    Bass’s Straits and in Tasmania, but it has been exterminated in both, without,
                    so far as is known, any ornithologist having had the opportunity of determining
                    whether the race inhabiting those localities was specifically identical with
                    that of the mainland or distinct. Next to the Ostrich the largest of existing
                    birds, the common Emeu is an inhabitant of the more open country, feeding on
                    fruits, roots, and herbage, and generally keeping in small companies. The nest
                    is a shallow pit scraped in the ground, and from nine to thirteen eggs, in
                    colour varying from a bluish-green to a dark bottle-green, are laid therein.
                    These are hatched by the cock-bird, the period of incubation lasting from 70 to
                    80 days. The young at birth are striped longitudinally with dark markings on a
                    light ground. A remarkable structure in Dromoeus is a singular opening in the
                    front of the windpipe, communicating with a tracheal pouch. This has attracted
                    the attention of several anatomists, and has been well described by Dr Murie
                    (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1867, pp. 405—415). Various conjectures have been made as to
                    its function, the most probable of which seems to be that it is an organ of
                    sound in the breeding-season, at which time the hen-bird has long been known to
                    utter a remarkably loud booming note. Due convenience being afforded to it, the
                    Emeu thrives well, and readily propagates its kind in Europe. It is the only
                    form of Ratite bird which naturally takes to the water, and examples have been
                    seen voluntarily swimming a wide river.</p>
                <p>The existence in Australia of a second species of Dromoeus had long been
                    suspected, and Broderip in 1842 stated {Penny Cyclop, xxiii. p. 145) that Mr
                    Gould had even supplied a name {D. parvulus) for it; but there can be little
                    doubt that this suggestion was founded on a mistake. However, in 1859 Mr
                    Bartlett described, under the name of D. irroratus, what has since been
                    generally admitted to be a good species, and it now seems certain that this
                    fills in the western part of Australia the place occupied by the older-known
                    form in the Eastern. It is a more slender bird, and when adult has the feathers
                    barred with white and dark-grey ending in a black spot which has a rufous
                    margin, while those of D. novoe-hollandiae are of a uniform blackish-grey from
                    the base to near the tip, which is black with a broad subterminal rufous band.
                    Both species have been figured by Mr Sclater from admirable drawings by Mr Wolf
                    {Trams. Zool. Soc. iv. pls. 75, 76), and interesting particulars as to their
                    domestication in England are given by Mr Harting {Ostriches and Ostrich Farming,
                    pp. 131-174). <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
