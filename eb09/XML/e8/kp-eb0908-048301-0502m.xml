                    East, where, as its Greek name indicates, the festival had its origin, it was
                    associated with our Lord’s baptism as the “manifestation” of Christ as Son of
                    God by the voice from heaven and the descent of the Holy Spirit. From this
                    connection the Epiphany became one of the chief days for the baptizing of
                    catechumens. The water in the font was consecrated on this day, and bottles of
                    the sacred fluid were carried home by the faithful and preserved till the day
                    came round again. Baptism being regarded as the illumination of the soul
                    (φωτισμός), this day gained the title of “the lights,” or the “day of lights”
                    (τα φώτα, <hi rend="italic">ήμερα των φώτων).</hi> The Epiphany was never a day
                    of baptism in the Western Church. This commemoration of Christ’s baptism arose
                    in the East before that of His Nativity. From a forced interpretation of Luke
                    iii. 23, our Lord was supposed to have been baptized on the thirtieth
                    anniversary of His birth, and tho two events were commemorated on the same day,
                    January 6. Other manifestations were also associated with these two, especially
                    the displays of our Lord’s miraculous power at the marriage feast at Cana of
                    Galilee, and the feeding of the five thousand. It wa3 not till the latter half
                    of the 4th century that the Nativity had a distinct celebration in the East on
                    the 25th of December. In the Western Church the two commemorations have always
                    been separated; and the Epiphany has been associated with the visit of the Magi,
                    or Wise Men of the East, to the infant Saviour, almost to the exclusion of any
                    other reference. These mysterious strangers, who in process of time developed
                    into three kings, named Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar, descended respectively
                    from Ham, Shem, and Japheth, being regarded as the first-fruits of the heathen
                    world to Christ, the festival obtained the designation it bears in tho English
                    Common Prayer Book, “the Epiphany, or manifestation of Christ to the Gentiles.”
                    In the Latin Church it is known as “festum trium regum.” Ί he popular name in
                    Rome is <hi rend="italic">la Beffanα,</hi> a corruption of the mediaeval
                    “Bethphania,” derived from the manifesta tion in the house (Hebrew, <hi
                    rend="italic">beth)</hi> at Cana of Galilee. The earliest mention of the
                    festival in the West is in the account gi ven by Ammianus Marcellinus of a visit
                    paid by Julian to a church at Vienne on this day (lib. xxi. c. 2). It eventually
                    took rank as a leading church festival. Abstinence from servile work, which had
                    been enjoined by the Apostolical Constitutions (lib. v. c. 13, lib. viii. c.
                    33), was enacted by the emperors Theodosius II. and Justinian, together with the
                    suspension of public games and legal business. Another custom of the early
                    church was for the metropolitans at the Epiphany to announce to their suffragan
                    bishops the date of Easter and the other movable feasts <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Indictio Paschalis)</hi> by letters known as “Festal Epistles.” To describe
                    the curious and picturesque customs connected with this festival would carry us
                    far beyond our limits. They may be found in Hone’s <hi rend="italic">EveryDay
                    Book</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Year Book,</hi> Chambers’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Book of Days,</hi> and Brand’s <hi rend="italic">Popular Antiquities.</hi> One
                    custom deserves to be particularized. The sovereigns of England on this day make
                    an oblation of gold, frankincense, and myrrh at the altar of the Chapel Royal.
                    This is now performed by deputy, but till comparatively recent times the
                    offering was made in person.</p>
