                    no place on sepulchral monuments. Sometimes the intention of the writer to have
                    his production placed upon the grave of the person he has commemorated may have
                    been frustrated, sometimes it may never have existed; what he has written is
                    still entitled to be called an epitaph if it be suitable for the purpose,
                    whether the purpose has been carried out or not. The most obvious external
                    condition that suitability for mural inscription imposes is one of rigid
                    limitation as to length. An epitaph <pb break="no"

                    proportions that may be required in an elegy.</p>
                <p>The desire to perpetuate the memory of the dead being natural to man, the
                    practice of placing epitaphs upon their graves has been common among all nations
                    and in all ages. And the similarity, amounting sometimes almost to identity, of
                    thought and expression that often exists between epitaphs written more than two
                    thousand years ago and epitaphs written only yesterday is as striking an
                    evidence as literature affords of the close kinship of human nature under the
                    most varying conditions where the same primary elemental feelings are stirred.
                    The grief and 'hope of the Roman mother as expressed in the touching lines—</p>
                <p>Lagge fili bene quiescas Mater tua rogat te, Ut me ad te recipias: Vale!</p>
                <p>find their echo in similar inscriptions in many a modern cemetery.</p>
                <p>Probably the earliest epitaphial inscriptions that have come down to us are those
                    of the ancient Egyptians, written, as their mode of sepulture necessitated, upon
                    the sarcophagi and coffins. Those that have been deciphered are all very much in
                    the same form, commencing with a prayer to a deity, generally Osiris or Anubis,
                    on behalf of the deceased, whose name, descent, and office are usually
                    specified. There is, however, no attempt to delineate individual character, and
                    the feelings of the survivors are not expressed otherwise than in the fact of a
                    prayer being offered. Ancient Greek epitaphs, unlike the Egyptian, are of great
                    literary interest, deep and often tender in feeling, rich and varied in
                    expression, and generally epigrammatic in form. They are written usually in
                    elegiac verse, though many of the later epitaphs are in prose. Among the gems of
                    the Greek anthology familiar to English readers through translations are the
                    epitaphs upon those who had fallen in battle. There are several ascribed to
                    Simonides on the heroes of Thermopylae, of which the most celebrated is the
                    epigram— “Go tell the Spartans, thou that passest by, That here, obedient to
                    their laws, we lie.”</p>
                <p>A hymn of Simonides on the same subject contains some lines of great beauty,
                    which may be regarded as a literary epitaph :—</p>
                <p>“In dark Thermopylae they lie; Oh death of glory, there to die! Their tomb an
                    altar is, their name A mighty heritage of fame; Their dirge is
                    triumph.—Cankering rust, And time that turneth all to dust That tomb shall never
                    waste nor hide,— The tomb of warriors true and tried. The full-voic'd praise of
                    Greece around Lies buried in that sacred mound; Where Sparta’s king, Leonidas,
                    In death eternal glory has. ’</p>
                <p>In Lacedaernonia epitaphs were inscribed only upon the graves of those who had
                    been especially distinguished in war; in Athens they were applied more
                    indiscriminately. They generally contained the name, the descent, the demise,
                    a,nd some account of the life of the person commemorated. It must* be
                    remembered, however, that many of the so-called Greek epitaphs are merely
                    literary memorials not intended for monumental inscription, and that in these
                    freer scope is naturally given to general reflections, while less attention is
                    paid to biographical details. Many of them, even some of the monumental, do not
                    contain any personal name, as in the one ascribed to Plato :—</p>
                <p>“I am a shipwrecked sailor’s tomb; a peasant’s there doth stand:</p>
                <p>Thus the same world of Hades lies beneath both sea and land.” Others again are so
                    entirely of the nature of general reflections upon death that they contain no
                    indication of the particular case that called them forth. It may be questioned,
                    indeed, whether several of this character quoted in ordinary collections are
                    epitaphs at all, in the sense of being intended for a particular occasion. .</p>
                <p>Roman epitaphs, in contrast to those of the Greeks, contained, as a rule, nothing
                    beyond a record of facts. The inscriptions on the urns, of which numerous
                    specimens are to be found in the British Museum, present but little variation.
                    The letters D.M. or D.M.S. <hi rend="italic">(Diis Manibiis</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Diis Manibus</hi><hi rend="italic">Sacrum)</hi> are followed by
                    the name of the person whose ashes are inclosed, his age at death, and sometimes
                    one or two other particulars. The inscription closes with the name of the person
                    who caused the urn to be made, and his relationship to the deceased. It is a
                    curious illustration of the survival of traces of an old faith after it has been
                    formally discarded to find that the letters D.M. are not uncommon on the
                    Christian inscriptions in the catacombs. It has been suggested that in this case
                    they mean <hi rend="italic">Deo Maximo</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">Diis
                    Manibus,</hi> but the explanation would be quite untenable, even if there were
                    not many other undeniable instances of the survival of pagan superstitions in
                    the thought and life of the early Christians. In these very catacomb
                    inscriptions there are many illustrations to be found, apart from the use of the
                    letters D. Μ., of the union of heathen with Christian sentiment (see Maitland’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Church in the Catacombs).</hi> The private burial places for
                    the ashes of the dead were usually by the side of the various roads leading into
                    Rome, the Via Appia, the Via Flaminia, &amp;c. The traveller to or from the city
                    thus passed for miles an almost uninterrupted succession of tombstones, whose
                    inscriptions usually began with the appropriate words <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siste</hi><hi rend="italic">Viator</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Äspice</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Viator,</hi> the origin doubtless of the “Stop Passenger,” which
                    still meets the eye in many parish churchyards of Britain. Another phrase of
                    very common occurrence on ancient Roman tombstones, <hi rend="italic">Sit tibi
                    terra leυis,—</hi> Light lie the earth upon thee,—has continued in frequent use,
                    as conveying au appropriate sentiment, down to modern times. A remarkable
                    feature of many of the Roman epitaphs was the terrible denunciation they often
                    pronounced upon those who violated the sepulchre. Two impressive examples may be
                    quoted:—· “Male pereat, Insepultus jaceat,</p>
                <p>Non resurgat, Cum Juda partem habeat, Si quis sepulcrum hunc violaverit.”</p>
                <p>The second is more refined but not less terrible in its malediction :—</p>
                <p>“Quisquis Hoc Sustulerit aut laeserit Ultimus Suorum moriatur.”</p>
                <p>Such denunciations were not uncommon in later times. A well known instance is
                    furnished in the lines on Shakespeare’s tomb at Stratford-on-Avon, said to have
                    been written by the poet himself :—</p>
                <p>“Good frend for Jesus sake forbeare, To digg the dust enclosed heare; Bleste be y
                    <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> man y <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> spares thes
                    stones And curst be he y <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> moves my bones.”</p>
                <p>The earliest existing British epitaphs belonged to the Roman period, and are
                    written in Latin after the Roman form. Specimens are to be seen in various
                    antiquarian museums throughout the country; some of the inscriptions are given
                    in Bruce’s <hi rend="italic">Roman Wall,</hi> and the seventh volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus</hi><hi rend="italic">Inscriptionum Latinarum</hi> edited
                    by Hübner, containing the British inscriptions, is the most valuable repertory
                    for the earlier Roman epitaphs in Britain. The earliest, of course, are
                    commemorative of soldiers belonging to the legions of occupation, but the Roman
                    form was afterwards adopted for native Britons. Long after the Roman form was
                    discarded, the Latin language continued to be used, especially for inscriptions
                    of a more public <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n514/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0514-0495"/> character, as being from its supposed permanence
                    the most suitable medium of communication to distant ages. It is only, in fact,
                    within recent years that Latin has become unusual, and the more natural practice
                    has been adopted of writing the epitaphs of distinguished men in the language of
                    the country in which they lived. While Latin was the chief if not the sole
                    literary language, it was, as a matter of course, almost exclusively used for
                    epitaphial inscriptions. The comparatively few English epitaphs that remain of
                    the 11th and 12th centuries are all in Latin. They are generally confined to a
                    mere statement of the name and rank of the deceased following the words “Hie
                    jacet.” Two noteworthy exceptions to this general brevity are, however, to be
                    found in most of the collections. One is the epitaph to Gundrada, daughter of
                    the Conqueror (d. 1085), which still exists at Lewes, though in an imperfect
                    state, two of the lines having been lost; another is that to William de Warren,
                    earl of Surrey (d. 1089), believed to have been inscribed in the Abbey of St
                    Paneras, near Lewes, founded by him. Both are encomiastic, and describe the
                    character and work of the deceased with considerable fullness and beauty of
                    expression. They are written in leonine verse. In the 13th century French began
                    to be used in writing epitaphs, and most of the inscriptions to celebrated
                    historical personages between 1200 and 1400 are in that language. Mention may be
                    made of those to Robert, the third earl of Oxford (d. 1221), as given in Weever,
                    to Henry III (d. 1272) at Westminster Abbey, and to Edward the Black Prince (d.
                    1376) at Canterbury. In most of the inscriptions of this period the deceased
                    addresses the reader in the first person, describes his rank and position while
                    alive, and, as in the case of the Black Prince, contrasts it with his wasted and
                    loathsome state in the grave, and warns the reader to prepare for the same
                    inevitable change. The epitaph almost invariably closes with a request,
                    sometimes very urgently worded, for the prayers of the reader that the soul of
                    the deceased may pass to glory, and an invocation of blessing, general or
                    specific, upon all who comply. Epitaphs preserved much of the same character
                    after English began to be used towards the close of the 14th century. The
                    following to a member of the Savile family at Thornhill is probably even
                    earlier, though its precise date cannot be fixed :—</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ Bonys emongg stonys lys ful steyl gwylste the sawle wan-deris were that God
                    wylethe—’ that is, Bones among stoneβ lie full still, whilst the soul wanders
                    whither God willeth It may be noted here that the majority of the inscriptions,
                    Latin and English, from 1300 to the period of the Reformation, that have been
                    preserved, are upon brasses. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Brasses,
                    Monumental.)</hi></p>
                <p>It was in the reign of Elizabeth that epitaphs in English began to assume a
                    distinct literary character and value, entitling them to rank with those that
                    had hitherto been composed in Latin. There is one on the dowager countess of
                    Pembroke (d. 1621), remarkable for its successful use of a somewhat daring
                    hyperbole. It is usually attributed to Ben Jonson, but there seems reason to
                    believe that it was written by William Browne, author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannia's Pastorals :—</hi></p>
                <p>“Underneath this marble hearse Lies the subject of all verse; Sydney’s sister,
                    Pembroke's mother; Death, ere thou hast slain another Fair and leam’d and good
                    as she, Time will throw his dart at thee. Marble piles let no man raise To her
                    name for after days; Some kind woman, born as she, Reading this, like Niobe,
                    Shall turn marble, and become Both her mourner and her tomb.”</p>
                <p>If there be something of the exaggeration of a conceit in the second stanza, it
                    needs scarcely to be pointed out that epitaphs, like every other form of
                    composition, necessarily reflect the literary characteristics of the age in
                    which they were written. The deprecation of marble as unnecessary suggests one
                    of the finest literary epitaphs in the English language, that by Milton upon
                    Shakespeare :—</p>
                <p>“What needs my Shakespeare, for his honoured bones,</p>
                <p>The labour of an age in piled stones?</p>
                <p>Or that his hallowed reliques should be hid</p>
                <p>Under a star-ypointing pyramid?</p>
                <p>Dear Son of Memory, great heir of fame, What need’st thou such weak witness of
                    thy name? Thou in our wonder and astonishment Hast built thyself a live-long
                    monument.</p>
                <p>For whilst, to the shame of slow-endeavouring art, Thy easy numbers flow; and
                    that each heart Hath, from the leaves of thy unvalued book, Those Delphic lines
                    with deep impression took; Then thou our fancy of itself bereaving, Dost make us
                    marble with too much conceiving; And so sepulchred, in such pomp dost lie, That
                    kings for such a tomb would wish to die.”</p>
                <p>The epitaphs of Pope are generally considered to possess very great literary
                    merit, though they were rated higher by Johnson and critics of his period than
                    they are now. Two are quoted in most collections as, each in its own way, a
                    typical specimen. The first is on Mrs Corbet :—</p>
                <p>“Here rests a woman, good without pretence, Blest with plain reason and with
                    sober sense; No conquests she, but o’er herself, desired, No arts essayed, but
                    not to be admiτed. Passion and pride were to her soul unknown, Convinced that
                    virtue only is our own. So unaffected, so composed a mind; So firm, yet soft; so
                    strong, yet so refined; Heaven, as its purest gold, by tortures tried; The saint
                    sustained it, but the woman died.’’</p>
                <p>The other, to Sir Isaac Newton, is not inscribed upon any monument:—</p>
                <p>“Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night;</p>
                <p>God said, Let Newton be! and all was light.”</p>
                <p>Objection has been taken to it as “savouring of profanity,”—a criticism which
                    will be differently estimated by different minds.</p>
                <p>Dr Johnson, who thought so much of Pope’s epitaphs, was himself a great authority
                    in both the theory and practice of this species of composition. His essay on
                    epitaphs is one of the few existing monographs on the subject, and his opinion
                    as to the use of Latin had great influence. The manner in which he met the
                    delicately insinuated request of a number of eminent men that English should be
                    employed in the case of Oliver Goldsmith was characteristic, and showed the
                    strength of his conviction on the subject (see Boswell’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life,</hi> vol. vi. c. 7). The arguments in favour of Latin were chiefly drawn
                    from its inherent fitness for epitaphial inscriptions and its classical
                    stability. The first of these has a very considerable force, it being admitted
                    on all hands that few languages are in themselves so suitable for the purpose;
                    the second is outweighed by considerations that had considerable force in Dr
                    Johnson’s time, and have acquired more since. Even to the learned Latin is no
                    longer the language of daily thought and life as it was at the period of the
                    Reformation, and the great body of those who may fairly claim to be called the
                    well-educated classes can only read it with difficulty, if at all. It seems,
                    therefore, little less than absurd, for the sake of a stability which is itself
                    in great part delusive, to write epitaphs in a language unintelligible to the
                    vast majority of those for whose information presmnably they are intended.
                    Though a stickler for Latin, Dr Johnson wrote some very beautiful English
                    epitaphs, as, for example, the following on Philips, a musician :—</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n515/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0515-0496"/>
                <p>“Philips, whose touch harmonious could remove The pangs of guilty power or
                    hapless love; Best here, distressed by poverty no more, Here find that calm thou
                    gav’st so oft before; Sleep undisturbed within this peaceful shrine Till angels
                    wake thee with a note like thine!”</p>
                <p>In classifying epitaphs various principles of division may be adopted. Arranged
                    according to nationality they indicate distinctions of race less clearly perhaps
                    than any other form of literature does,—and this obviously because when under
                    the influence of the deepest feeling men think and speak very much in the same
                    way whatever be their country. At the same time the influence of nationality may
                    to some extent be traced in epitaphs. The characteristics of the French style,
                    its grace, clearness, wit, and epigrammatic point, are all recognizable in
                    French epitaphs. Instances such as “<hi rend="italic">La première au</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rendezvous,”</hi> inscribed on the grave of a mother, Piron’s
                    epitaph written for himself after his rejection by the French Academy—</p>
                <p>“Ci-git Piron, qui ne fut jamais rien, Pas même Académicien— '</p>
                <p>and one by a relieved husband, to be seen at Père la Chaise—</p>
                <p>“Ci-git ma femme. Ah! qu'elle est bieιι Pour son repos et pour le mien—” might be
                    multiplied indefinitely. One can hardly look through a collection of English
                    epitaphs without being struck with the fact that these represent a greater
                    variety of intellectual and emotional states than those of any other nation,
                    ranging through every style of 'thought from the sublime to the commonplace,
                    every mood of feeling from the most delicate and touching to the coarse and even
                    brutal. Few subordinate illustrations of the wonderfully complex nature of the
                    English nationality are more striking than this.</p>
                <p>Epitaphs are sometimes classified according to their authorship and sometimes
                    according to their subject, but neither division is so interesting as that which
                    arranges them according to their characteristic features. What has just been
                    said of English epitaphs is, of course, more true of epitaphs generally. They
                    exemplify every variety of sentiment and taste, from lofty pathos and dignified
                    eulogy to coarse buffoonery and the vilest scurrility. The extent to which the
                    humorous and even the low comic element prevails among them is a noteworthy
                    circumstance. It is curious that the most solemn of all subjects should have
                    been frequently treated, intentionally or unintentionally, in a style so
                    ludicrous that a collection of epitaphs is generally one of the most amusing
                    books that can be picked up. Tn this as in other cases too it is to be observed
                    that the unintended humour is generally of a much more entertain ing kind than
                    that which has been deliberately perpetrated. It would be out of place to give
                    here any specimens of a class of epitaphs which—just because they are the most
                    amusing—are the most abundantly represented in all the ordinary collections.</p>
