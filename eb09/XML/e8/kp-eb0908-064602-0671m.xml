                    from his earliest years a talent for drawing, and used to make sketches whenever
                    he could find opportunity. After some scanty instruction of the most elementary
                    kind, the future painter, at the age of eleven and a half, left the paternal
                    roof, and was bound apprentice in the printing office of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hull Packet.</hi> Amid many trials and discouragements he completed his term of
                    seven years’ servitude, and having in that period come by practice, at first
                    surreptitions, though afterwards allowed by his master “in lawful hours,” to
                    know his own powers, he removed at the close of it to London. The kindness of an
                    elder brother and a wealthy uncle, William Etty, himself an artist, stood him in
                    good stead during his long and noble struggle against the trials and
                    difficulties that beset the career of nearly every person who adopts the
                    profession of art for its own sake. He commenced his training by copying without
                    instruction from nature, models, prints, &amp;c.,—his first academy, as he
                    himself says, being a plaster-cast shop in Cock Lane, Smithfield. Here he made a
                    copy from an ancient cast of Cupid and Psyche, which was shown to Opie, and led
                    to his being enrolled in 1807 as student of the Academy, whose schools were at
                    that time conducted in Somerset House. Among his fellow scholars at this period
                    of his career were some who in after years rose to eminence in their art, such
                    as Wilkie, Haydon, Collins, Constable. His uncle generously paid the necessary
                    fee of one hundred guineas, and in the summer of 1807 he was admitted to be a
                    private pupil of Sir Thomas Lawrence, who was now at the very acme of his fame.
                    Etty himself always looked on this privilege as one of incalculable value, and
                    till his latest day regarded Lawrence as one of the chief ornaments of British
                    art. For some years after he quitted Sir Thomas’s studio, even as late as 1816,
                    the influence of his preceptor was traceable in the mannerism of his works; but
                    his later pictures prove that he had completely outlived it. Though he had by
                    this time made great progress in his art, his career was still one of almost
                    continual failure, hardly cheered by even a passing ray of success. In 1811,
                    after repeated rejections, he had the satisfaction of seeing his Telemachus
                    rescuing Antiope on the walls of the Academy’s exhibition-room. It was badly
                    hung, however, and attracted little notice. For the next five years he
                    persevered with quiet and constant energy in overcoming the disad vantages of
                    his early training with yearly growing success, and he was even beginning to
                    establish something like a name when in 1816 he resolved to improve his
                    knowledge of art by a journey to Italy. After an absence of three months,
                    however, he was compelled to return home without having penetrated farther south
                    than Florence. Struggles and vexations still continued to harass him, but he
                    bore up against them with a patient endurance and force of will which ultimately
                    enabled him to rise superior to them all. In 1820 his Coral-finders, exhibited
                    at the Royal Academy, attracted much attention, and its success was more than
                    equalled by that of Cleopatra’s arrival in Cilicia, shown in the following year.
                    In 1822 he again set out on a tour to Italy, taking Paris on his way, and
                    astonishing his fellow-students at the Louvre by the rapidity and fidelity with
                    which he copied from the old masters in that gallery. On arriving at Rome he
                    immediately resumed his studies of the old masters, and elicited many
                    expressions of wonder from his Italian fellow-artists for the same qualities
                    which had gained the admiration of the French. Though Etty was duly impressed by
                    the grand <hi rend="italic">chefs</hi><hi rend="italic">cl'oeuvres</hi> of
                    Raphael and Michelangelo at Rome, he was not sorry to exchange that city for
                    Venice, which he always regarded as the true home of art in Italy. His own style
                    as that of the most distinguished English colourist of any period held much more
                    of the Venetian than of any other Italian school, and he admired his prototypes
                    with a zeal and exclusiveness that sometimes bordered on extravagance. Early in
                    1824 he returned home to find that honours long unjustly withheld were awaiting
                    him. In that year he was made an associate of the Royal Academy, and in 1828 he
                    was promoted to the full dignity of an Academician. In the interval beteen these
                    dates he had produced the Combat (Woman interceding for the Vanquished), and the
                    first of the series of three pictures on the subject of Judith, both of which
                    ultimately came into the possession of the Scottish Academy, which body, to
                    their credit be it told, were the first to discern and publicly appreciate the
                    genius of Etty, and the value of his contributions to art. Etty’s career was
                    from this time one of slow but uninterrupted success. His works were not now as
                    formerly allowed to remain upon h*is hands unsold; and though the prices which
                    they fetched w ere almo§t incredibly small in comparison with the value now
                    attached to them, yet they satisfied the artist’s requirements, and even tempted
                    him to persevere in the dangerous career of high art. In 1830 Etty again crossed
                    the Channel with the view to another art tour through the Continent; but he was
                    overtaken in Paris by the insurrection of the Three Days, and was so much
                    shocked by the sights he was compelled to witness in that time that he <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0672-0647"/> returned home with all convenient speed. During
                    the next ten years of his life the zeal and unabated assiduity of his studies
                    were not at all diminished, and he continued with marvellous regularity his
                    various routine duties in connexion with the academy, though his health was far
                    from robust, and his circumstances were now such as to put it in his power to
                    dispense with the multifarious drudgery which the fulfilment of these duties
                    demanded. He was a constant attendant at the Life School, where he used to work
                    regularly along with the students, notwithstanding the remonstrances of some of
                    his fellow Academicians, who thought the practice undignified. The course of his
                    studies was only interrupted by occasional visits to his native city, and to
                    Scotland, where he was welcomed with the utmost enthusiasm, and <hi
                    rend="italic">feted</hi> with the most gratifying heartiness-by his
                    brother-artists at Edinburgh. On the occasion of one of these visits he gave the
                    finishing touches to the trio of Judiths, which form not the least interesting
                    or valuable feature in the collection of the Scottish Academy. In 1840, and
                    again in 1841, Etty undertook a pilgrimage to the Low Countries, to seek and
                    examine for himself the masterpieces of Rubens which exist in many of the
                    churches and public galleries there. Two years later he once more visited France
                    with a view to collecting materials for what he called “his last epic,” his
                    famous picture of Joan of Arc. This subject, which would have tasked to the full
                    even his great powers in the prime and vigour of manhood, proved almost too
                    serious an undertaking for him in his old age. It exhibits, at least, amid great
                    excellences, undeniable proofs of decay on the part of the painter; yet it
                    brought a higher price than any of his earlier and more perfect works, viz.,
                    £2500. In 1848, after completing this work, he retired to York, having realized
                    a comfortable independence. Even his advanced years and increasing infirmities
                    were as yet unable wholly to quench his artistic enthusiasm, for when his health
                    allowed, he worked as assiduously as in his younger days. One wish alone
                    remained for him now to gratify; he desired to see a “gathering” of his
                    pictures. With much difficulty and exertion he was enabled to assemble the great
                    majority of them from various parts of the British islands; and so numerous were
                    they that the walls of the large hall he engaged in London for their exhibition
                    were nearly covered. This took place in the summer of 1849; on the 13th November
                    of that same year Etty died. He received the honours of a public funeral in his
                    native city, where he was highly respected.</p>
                <p>Etty holds a secure place among English artists, though it is neither the place
                    assigned to him during the early part of his career nor that to which he
                    attained during the last thirty years of his life. Unjust neglect was followed
                    in his case, as in that of some others, by undue and indiscriminate eulogy. His
                    unflinching perseverance in the face of unusual difficulties and discouragements
                    is beyond all praise. His drawing was frequently incorrect, but in feeling and
                    skill as a colourist he has scarcely been equalled by any other English artist.
                    His most conspicuous defects as a painter were the result of insufficient
                    general culture and narrowness of sympathy.</p>
