                    exception is that of the Quakers (or “Society of Friends”), who, from an exalted
                    idea of the spiritual nature of Christianity, have discarded the Eucharist,
                    together with all other religious symbolical acts. All other Christians have at
                    all times agreed in regarding the Eucharist as their highest act of worship, and
                    the most solemn ordinance of religion.</p>
                <p>To understand the Eucharist aright we must go back to the history of its
                    institution. This is given by the three first evangelists in their gospels, and
                    by St Paul in his first epistle to the Corinthians (Mat. xxvi. 26-27; Mark xiv.
                    22-24; Luke xxii. 19-20; 1 Cor. xi. 23-25). These narratives inform us that the
                    Eucharist was ordained by Christ at the close of the paschal supper which He had
                    eaten with His disciples the night preceding the day of His cruciβχion; that</p>
                <p>“As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and having given thanks, blessed and
                    brake it, and give it to His disciples, and said ‘ Take, eat; this is My Body
                    which is being given for you. Do this for a memorial of Me.’ In the same manner
                    also He took the cup after they had supped, and having given thanks, gave it to
                    them, saying, ‘Drink ye all of this: for this is My Blood of the new covenant'
                    —or ‘ the new covenant in My Blood ’—‘ which is being shed for you and for many,
                    for the remission of sins. Do this as often as you drink, for a memorial of
                    Me.’”</p>
                <p>The first subject for remark is the connexion of the Eucharist with the Paschal
                    celebration. In the Paschal Supper the flesh of a lamb was solemnly eaten in
                    remembrance of the preservation of the Israelites, by means of the blood of a
                    lamb, from the destruction brought upon tho Egyptians, and of the consequent
                    emancipation of the nation from slavery to Pharaoh. In the Eucharist the same
                    act, that of eating, assumes a similar commemorative force. The broken bread,
                    declared by Christ to be a symbol of His crucified Body, taken and eaten,
                    together with the drinking of the wine, declared to be a symbol of His shed
                    Blood, becomes, in virtue of His institution, a memorial of His sacrifice as the
                    Lamb of God who, by His death, has taken away the sin of the world, delivering
                    man from the wrath of God, and setting him free from the slavery of evil. In
                    this, however, the Eucharist transcends the passover which was its type, that
                    the one was a bare commemoration, the other unites with it an actual
                    participation jn the spiritual blessings thus commemorated. However much various
                    sections of the church have differed as to the mode and the degree in which
                    these blessings are conveyed, and the exact relation borne by the bread and wine
                    to the Body and Blood of our Lord, there has been a substantial agreement as to
                    the fact that the fruits of the sacrifice of Christ are in the Eucharist in a
                    special manner imparted to the souls of worthy recipients. &lt;</p>
                <p>So much we may learn as to the nature of the rite from the occasion of its first
                    institution. An examination of the mode of its institution by Christ will show
                    what ceremonial actions may be regarded as essential to the truth of its
                    symbolical character. These are—(1) the benediction and consecration, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the setting apart from profane uses, by solemn prayer
                    and thanksgiving, of bread and wine; (2) the fraction or breaking of the bread
                    and the pouring out of the wine into the cup; (3) the delivery and distribution
                    of the “elements”—as the bread and wine are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n676/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0676-0651"/> termed—to the communicants; (4) the declaration
                    accompanying this distribution, that these elements both symbolize the sacrifice
                    of Christ’s death, and also convey to the faithful partaker the benefits of that
                    sacrifice; and (5) the actual partaking of these elements by the acts of eating
                    and drinking. These several actions are all included in Christ’s command, “Do
                    this in remembrance of Me.”</p>
                <p>The various names by which this holy rite has been designated, each expressing
                    one view of its manifold nature, will help us towards a comprehension of its
                    meaning and purpose.</p>
                <p>1. The term <hi rend="italic">Eucharist,</hi> though not found in this sense in
                    Holy Scripture, came into use in the earliest times, and found such acceptance
                    that it became the most frequent designation of the Lord’s Supper both in the
                    Western and the Eastern Church. It first appears in the letters ascribed to
                    Ignatius, 107 A.τ&gt;. <hi rend="italic">(Epist. ad Philad.,</hi> c. iv.; <hi
                    rend="italic">ad Smym.,</hi> c. vi.), and is used by Irenaeus, who says that
                    after consecration “it is no longer common bread, but eucharist” (lib. iv. c.
                    18, § 5). Justin Martyr, 140 A.υ., after describing the sacred meal, says, “This
                    partaking is called by us the Eucharist” <hi rend="italic">(Apolog.,</hi> i. c.
                    66). Origen also speaks of “the bread called Eucharist” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Contr. Cels.,</hi> lib. viii. § 57). The term is also continually found in
                    this sense in Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus, and Cyprian. Eucharist,
                    ∈υχαpι&lt;rriα, signifies “thanksgiving,” and its use for the sacramental feast
                    is derived from the thanksgiving of our Lord at the institution of the rite
                    (εΰχαρισττ/σας ∈κλασev). The elements over which thanks had been offered readily
                    assumed the name of the act of thanksgiving, and so the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >eucharistia</hi> came to be simply equivalent to the sacramental bread and
                    wine, and was sometimes restricted to the bread alone. “In the earliest
                    liturgies thanksgiving was, next to the reception, the chief part of the
                    celebration, a circumstance which without doubt served greatly to promote the
                    general adoption of the name” (Scudamore, <hi rend="italic">Notitia
                    Eucharistica,</hi> p. 8). It is thus St Chrysostom explains the term: “The awful
                    mysteries, laden with mighty salvation, which are celebrated at every communion,
                    .... are called Eucharist, because they are the commemoration of many benefits,
                    and by all means they work upon us to be thankful” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Homil.</hi> xxv. <hi rend="italic">in Matt.,</hi> §3).</p>
                <p>2. Another familiar name is the <hi rend="italic">Communion,</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">Holy Communion.</hi> This is derived from the words of St Paul, 1
                    Cor. X. 16, 17. “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion
                    (κοινωνία) of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the
                    communion of the body of Christ? For we, the many, are one bread and one body;
                    for we all partake of that one bread.” The general use of this term is not so
                    early as of the word “eucharist,” but it is found in Irenaeus, 167 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> who speaks of slaves who have heard from their
                    masters that “the divine communion is the body and blood of Christ” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Eragm.,</hi> xiii.), and it is used by Hilary, Basil, and
                    Chrysostom. St Paul’s words show that the leading idea contained in this name
                    is, that by means of this sacrament all faithful recipients become partakers of
                    the body ’and blood of Christ, and receive a communication of the blessings of
                    His sacrifice. But they also express another fundamental truth, expressed in the
                    Apostles’ Creed as “the communion of saints,” viz., the communion or fellowship
                    which all Christians have with one another, as members of one body, sharers in
                    one life, of which the joint participation of this sacrament is an outward
                    symbol and pledge. “By this sacrament is signified and sealed that union which
                    is among our Saviour’s true disciples communicating therein; their being
                    together united in consent of mind and unity of faith, in mutual good will and
                    affection, in hope and tendency to the same blessed end, in spiritual
                    brotherhood and society; especially on account of this communion with Christ,
                    which most closely ties them one to another; they, partaking of this one
                    individual food, become translated, as it were, into one body and substance”
                    (Barrow, <hi rend="italic">Doctrine of the Sacraments,</hi> vol. v. p. 602, ed.
                    1818). To establish this union is declared by Christ to be one great purpose of
                    His incarnation and death and high priestly intercession (John xvii, 22-23). And
                    the Eucharist by its symbolism sets forth the truth that the only way of thus
                    uniting men to each other is by first uniting them to Christ. They must be one
                    <hi rend="italic">with</hi> Him before they can be one with each other <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi> Him. “The union of mankind, but a union begun and
                    subsisting only in Christ, is what the Lord⅛ Supper sacramentally expresses” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ecce Homo,</hi> p. 175). Participation in the Eucharist being
                    thus the chief outward sign and pledge of communion and fellowship with the
                    church, admission to this sacrament was practically identified with a
                    recognition of a claim to membership in the church, while to be repelled from it
                    amounted to exclusion from the Christian body, such exclusion receiving the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">excommunication.</hi></p>
                <p>3. Another designation of this sacrament, derived from Holy Scripture, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lord’s Supper.</hi> It is so called by St Paul himself, who when
                    speaking of its unworthy reception, says, “When ye come together into one place,
                    this is not to eat the Lord’s supper,” 1 Cor. xi. 20. The special
                    appropriateness of this name, taking us back to the time and place of its first
                    institution by Christ, “the same night that He was betrayed,” secured for it an
                    early and wide reception, and we find Chrysostom and Augustine employing it as a
                    familiar term. “He gave the supper consecrated by His own hands to the
                    disciples. We have not sat down at that feast, and yet by faith we daily eat the
                    same supper” (August., <hi rend="italic">Serm.</hi> cxii., c. 4). The name
                    “supper” indicates also the original idea of the sacred rite as a common meal,
                    “the most natural and universal way of expressing, maintaining, and, as it were,
                    ratifying” corporate union. “The meal consists of bread and wine, the simplest
                    and most universal elements of food; and when men of different nations or
                    degrees sit and kneel together, and receive, as from the hand of God, this
                    simple repast, they are reminded in the most forcible manner of their common
                    human wants, and their common character as pensioners on the bounty of the
                    universal Father” <hi rend="italic">(Ecce Homo,</hi> pp. 173, 174). And thus
                    this designation guards against a common but dangerous misconception of the
                    sacrament. A “supper” is something tobe partaken of, not to be worshipped. Bread
                    and wine are viands to be eaten and drunk, not to be adored. That on which they
                    are placed is a table, round which the guests gather as for a common meal, not,
                    except in a secondary and derived sense, an altar.</p>
                <p>4. The term “oblation” or “offering” <hi rend="italic">(προσφορά)</hi> was
                    originally applied to each of the various offerings made by the faithful at the
                    celebration of the Eucharist, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the oblation of alms
                    in kind or money for the poor, gifts for the support of the clergy, and the
                    maintenance of the fabric of the church and its services; the special oblation
                    of bread and wine for the purpose of the celebration; and the spiritual oblation
                    of the Body and Blood of Christ in the eucharistie commemoration. Gradually its
                    reference became narrowed. We notice the process of restriction in the writings
                    of Cyprian, 250 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.t&gt;.,</hi> and find it established by
                    the time of Cyril of Jerusalem, 350 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Henceforward,
                    “the oblation” signifies the commemoration of the self-oblation of Christ on the
                    cross. “To attain to the oblation” or to “partake of the holy oblation” meant to
                    receive, and to impart “the oblation” was to administer the blessed sacrament.”
                    In the liturgy of the Church of England the word “oblation” is only used of the
                    “alms” and other offerings of the congregation (with a special reference to the
                    presentation of the elements of bread and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n677/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0677-0652"/> wine), and of the actual death of Christ as “a
                    full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, <hi rend="italic">oblation,</hi> and
                    satisfaction for the sins of the whole world,” while the idea is also extended
                    to the spiritual oblation of themselves by the faithful communicants in the
                    words—“Here we offer and present ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a
                    reasonable sacrifice.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">5.</hi> From “oblation” we are naturally led to the
                    consideration of the term <hi rend="italic">Sacrifice,</hi> which from primitive
                    times has been applied to the Eucharist. The original reference of this term, as
                    of the term “oblation,” was to the bread and wine and other thank-offerings
                    presented at the celebration. But its application was gradually extended so as
                    to embrace the whole rite, and especially the central act, the presentation of
                    the elements to God as a memorial of the sacrifice of the death of Christ. In
                    this sense the Eucharist is spoken of from the time of Tertullian downwards, as
                    “a commemorative sacrifice,” ∕.e., a rite, instituted by Christ himself, in
                    which the church commemorates and pleads before the Father the one
                    all-sufficient sacrifice made by His Son on the cross. This is no fresh
                    immolation of the body of Christ, but a representation of that sacrifice which
                    was once for all accomplished on Calvary, by which, according to St Paul’s words
                    (1 Cor. xi. 26), we “do show” or “proclaim” (καταγγeλλeτe) “the Lord’s death
                    till He come.” The true sense in which the Eucharist may be called a sacrifice
                    is clearly set forth in the following passage from the learned and pious Bishop
                    Beveridge :—</p>
                <p>“The sacrifice that is most proper and peculiar to the gospel is the sacrament of
                    our Lord’s Supper, instituted by our Lord himself, to succeed all the bloody
                    sacrifices of the Mosaic law. For though we cannot say, as some absurdly do,
                    that this is such a sacrifice whereby Christ is again offered up to God both for
                    the living and the dead, yet it may as properly be called a sacrifice as any
                    that was ever offered, except that which was offered by Christ himself,—for His,
                    indeed, was the only true expiatory sacrifice that ever was offered. Those under
                    the law were only types of His, and were called sacrifices only upon that
                    account, because they typified and represented that which He was to offer for
                    the sins of the world. And therefore the sacrament of Christ’s body and blood
                    may as well be called by that name, as they were. They were typical, and this is
                    a commemorative sacrifice. They foreshowed the death of Christ to come; this
                    shows His death already past This is pro perly our Christian sacrifice, which
                    neither Jew nor Gentile can have any share in (Heb. xiii. 10). We have an altar
                    where we partake of the great sacrifice which the eternal Son of God offered up
                    for the sins of the whole world, and ours among the rest.”— <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Sermon</hi> viii. vol. i. p. 50; <hi rend="italic">Libr. Aηgl. Cαlh.
                    Theol.)</hi></p>
                <p>6. Finally, we have the names, <hi rend="italic">the Sacrament of the Body and
                    Blood of Christ, the Sacrament of the Eucharist, the Sacrament of the
                    Altar.</hi> This is not the place to speak of the origin and meaning of the word
                    <hi rend="italic">sacrament</hi> as an ecclesiastical term. Suffice it to say
                    that the word “sacrament,” when applied to the Eucharist, is used in its derived
                    sense as an outward and visible symbol of some inward and spiritual truth, or
                    work of grace,—in the same sense in which Augustine says of the bread and cup
                    that they are “therefore called sacraments, because in them one thing is seen,
                    another understood” <hi rend="italic">{Serm.</hi> cclxxi.).</p>
                <p>M'e must not altogether pass over the word wms·i, “missa, by which the Eucharist
                    is commonly known in the Roman church. Unlike the other designations of which we
                    have been speaking, this has no essential connexion with the eucharistie
                    rite,—“missa,” originally meaning nothing more than the dismissal of a
                    congregation. “Ite, missa est, is the formula with which the Roman eucharistie
                    service concludes. “By degrees,” writes Waterland, “it came to be used for an
                    assembly and for church service. From signifying a church service in general, it

                <p>We now proceed to speak of the mode and time of the celebration of the Eucharist.
                    It is evident from St Paul’s words and practice (1 Cor. xi. 17-34; Acts xx. 7)
                    that in the apostolic church the administration took place, after our Lord’s
                    pattern, in the evening, and in close connexion with an ordinary meal. The
                    disorders referred to by the apostle, which indicated the danger of this
                    connexion, before long caused a separation of the religious from the ordinary
                    meal, and invested the Eucharist with a character of special sacredness. The
                    time of celebration, we learn from the notices in the earlier fathers, was
                    either after nightfall or before daybreak, these times being selected so as to
                    avoid attracting the attention of their heathen neighbours. Pliny, in his
                    well-known letter to Trajan, 104 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> speaks of the
                    Christians in Bithynia coming together on a set day before it was light, “to
                    sing to Christ as God, and bind themselves by a sacrament <hi rend="italic"
                    >{sacramento)</hi> to commit no crime.” Tertullian also speaks of the reception
                    of “the sacrament of the Eucharist in assemblies even before dawn.” <hi
                    rend="italic">{De Cor. Mil.,</hi> c. iii.) The evening celebration lingered on
                    for a while, but it was gradually given up, and entirely ceased by the 4th
                    century, except on some special days, such as the eves of Christmas, Easter, and
                    Pentecost. The earliest account of the celebration of the Eucharist, that of
                    Justin Martyr, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 140 <hi rend="smallcaps">-A.d.,</hi>
                    shows the extreme simplicity of the rite at that time. The day of administration
                    was Sunday. It took place at the conclusion of the common prayer, and was
                    preceded by the kiss of peace. The celebrant was “the president of the brethren”
                    (ό προεστών των αδελφών). The materials of the sacrament were “bread and a cup
                    of wine mixed with water.” After prayer and praise offered by the president, to
                    which the congregation responded “amen,” the “deacons” gave to each one present,
                    “to partake of the bread, and wine mixed with water, over which the thanksgiving
                    had been pronounced” (∈υ^αpισ0evτos, “consecrated as an eucharist”), and carried
                    away a portion to those who were absent from the rite. This food, he concludes,
                    is “called by us the Eucharist” <hi rend="italic">{Apoloy.,</hi> i. c. 65-67).
                    St Cyril of Jerusalem furnishes us with a detailed description of the
                    eucharistie celebration in the middle of the 4th century <hi rend="italic"
                    >{c.</hi> 347 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> By this time the ritual had
                    become fixed, and of a somewhat elaborate character. The ceremonial commenced
                    with the celebrant and presbyters washing their hands. This was followed by the
                    kiss of peace, the “<hi rend="italic">Sursum</hi><hi rend="italic">Cordaf</hi>

                    rend="italic">Commemoration of the departed.</hi> These were succeeded —forming
                    the point of transition to the more distinctly sacramental portion of the
                    service—by the <hi rend="italic">Lord’s Prayer,</hi> the <hi rend="italic

                    >Communion.</hi> The minute directions Cyril gives as to the manual actions in
                    communicating, and the application of the consecrated elements to the eyes and
                    other organs of sense, indicate a wide departure from primitive simplicity, and
                    a growing tendency to regard the eucharist as a religious charm <hi
                    rend="italic">{Catech.,</hi> xxiii.; <hi rend="italic">My-stagog.,</hi> v.). The
                    account of the ritual presented by St Chrysostom (2 <hi rend="italic">Cor.,
                    Homil.</hi> χviii.) corresponds in all essential points with that given by
                    Cyril, and we gather from the writings of St Augustine that the canon of the
                    North African churches differed little from it. We may conclude, therefore, that
                    by the middle of the 4th century <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n678/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0678-0653"/> the eucharistie ritual was established with an
                    essential uniformity in all parts of the Catholic Church, and in a form
                    corresponding in its chief outlines with the canon of the extant primitive
                    liturgies. Of these liturgies the most important, as having the best grounded
                    claim to a primitive character (though overlaid with later additions from which
                    it is not easy to disentangle the primitive elements), are those which bear the
                    titles of the liturgy of St James, St Mark, Nestorius, the Ambrosian and
                    Gregorian, and the Gallican liturgies.</p>
                <p>With regard to the frequency of Holy Communion, although it has been concluded
                    with much probability from Acts ii. 46 that the earliest Christians, in the
                    first fervour of their faith, partook of the Eucharist daily, appearances are
                    rather in favour of a weekly celebration on the Lord’s day being the rule in the
                    apostolic and primitive church. It was on “the first day of the week” that the
                    Christians met for breaking bread at Troas (Acts xx. <hi rend="italic">7);</hi>
                    and St Paul’s direction to the Corinthian Christians to lay by for the poor on
                    that day may be reasonably associated with the oblations at the time of
                    celebration. Pliny tells us that it was on a “fixed day,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >stato</hi><hi rend="italic">die,</hi> the Christians in Bithynia came together
                    for prayer and communion, and, as we have seen, Justin Martyr speaks of Sunday
                    by name <hi rend="italic">{η λeγομdvη</hi><hi rend="italic">-ήλιου ήμερα}</hi>
                    as the day of celebration. When Christianity became the established religion of
                    the Roman world, the daily celebration of the Eucharist became the general rule,
                    though the words of Augustine —“in some places no day passes without an
                    offering; in others, offering is made on the Sabbath only, and the Lord’s day;
                    in others on the Lord’s day only” <hi rend="italic">(ffyisc</hi> 118, <hi

                    prove that the rule was not universal.</p>
                <p>The liturgy of the Church of England, by providing a collect epistle and gospel,
                    evidently contemplates the celebration of the Eucharist every Sunday and holy
                    day of the year. No strict rule, however, on the subject is laid down in any of
                    her formularies. The frequency of the administration is left to the discretion
                    of the parish priest, with this proviso, that it be frequent enough to enable
                    every parishioner to comply with the rubric which enjoins that “he shall
                    communicate at the least three times in the year, of which Easter to be one.” In
                    the Roman Church, the mass being the chief religious service, absorbing into
                    itself nearly all public acts of worship, the Eucharist is celebrated daily in
                    all churches, and in churches where there are many altars many times a day.</p>
                <p>This article may be suitably concluded with a brief statement of the doctrinal
                    views respecting the Eucharist of some of the chief churches of Christendom,
                    drawn from their authoritative documents.</p>
                <p>To commence with the Roman Church. With regard to the doctrine known as <hi
                    rend="italic">transubstantiation,</hi> it must here suffice to say that the
                    Church of Rome teaches that the whole substance of the bread and wine in the
                    Eucharist is converted by consecration into the Body and Blood of Christ, in
                    such a manner that Christ in His entirety, including His human soul and His
                    divine nature, are contained in the elements; and that with such a thorough
                    transmutation that not only is the whole Christ contained in the wine as well as
                    in the bread, but with the same completeness in each particle of the bread, and
                    in each drop of the wine. The denial of the cup to the laity, therefore, does
                    not deprive them of any blessing, inasmuch as whosoever receives even a crumb of
                    the consecrated bread receives Christ in His completeness, and that not only by
                    spiritual, but by actual and real manducation. The Church of Rome also teaches
                    that the Eucharist is a propitiatory sacrifice offered to God the Father on
                    every occasion when this sacrament is celebrated, and that not only for the sins
                    of those who partake of it, but for those of all mankind, as well dead as
                    living.</p>

                    and published in 1643. This document shows that the Greek Church is at one with
                    that of Rome with regard to transubstantiation and the sacrifice of the mass. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Quoestio</hi> 107 it is laid down that the intention of the
                    celebrant is essential for the validity of the rite, and that immediately on the
                    pronunciation of the <hi rend="italic">Epiclesis,</hi> transubstantiation takes
                    place, and the bread is changed into the very Body of Christ and the wine into
                    His very Blood, the species of bread and wine alone remaining. The same article
                    declares the benefits of the sacrament to be—(1) the commemoration of the
                    sinless passion and death of Christ; (2) a propitiation and reconciliation
                    before God for the sins as well of the dead as of the living; (3) the presence
                    of Christ in the communicant furnishing a safeguard against the temptations and
                    perils of the devil (Kimmel, <hi rend="italic">Monumenta Fidei</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Eccl. Orient.,</hi> pp. 180- 184). It was also definitely declared
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Confession of Dositheιιs,</hi> at the synod of
                    Jerusalem, 1672, that unbelievers as well as believers are partakers of Christ
                    in the Eucharist, the one receiving Him to eternal life and the other to eternal
                    damnation; and that it is one and the same Christ, not many, that is partaken of
                    in all the Eucharists throughout the world; and that He cannot be divided, but
                    is present in His entirety in the smallest portion of the bread and wine <hi
                    rend="italic">{Ibid.,</hi> p. 458-60).</p>
                <p>While the Continental Reformers were of one mind in repudiating the Roman
                    doctrine of transubstantiation and the sacrifice of the mass, very wide
                    differences existed between them in their estimate of the grace imparted by the
                    Eucharist, and the mode of the presence of Christ in that sacrament.</p>
                <p>The symbolical books of the Lutheran Church, following the teaching of Luther
                    himself, declare the doctrine of the real presence of Christ’s body and blood in
                    the eucharist, <hi rend="italic">together with</hi> the bread and wine <hi
                    rend="italic">(consubstantation},</hi> as well as the ubiquity of His body, as
                    the orthodox doctrine of the church. One consequence of this view was that the
                    unbelieving recipients are held to be as really partakers of the body of Christ
                    in, with, and under the bread as the faithful, though they receive it to their
                    own hurt. (Hagenbach, <hi rend="italic">Hist, of Doctr.,</hi> ii., 300).</p>
                <p>Of all the Reformers, the teaching of Zwingli was the furthest removed from that
                    of Luther. At an early period he asserted that the Eucharist was nothing more
                    than food for the soul, and had been instituted by Christ only as an act of
                    commemoration and as a visible sign of His body and blood <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Chηstenliche Ynleituηg,</hi> 1523, quoted by Hagenbach, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist, of Doctr.,</hi> ii. 296, Clark’s translation). But that Zwingli did not
                    reject the higher religious significance of the Eucharist, and was far from
                    degrading the bread and wine into “nuda et inania symbola,” as he was accused of
                    doing, we see from his <hi rend="italic">Fidei</hi><hi rend="italic">Ratio ad
                    Carol</hi><hi rend="italic">um</hi><hi rend="italic">Imperatorem</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Ib.,</hi> p. 297).</p>
                <p>The views of Calvin were intermediate between those of his two great
                    contemporaries. “Though he pointed out the sacramental character, and together
                    with it the more profound mystical significance of the Lord’s Supper more
                    distinctly than Zwingli, according to his own interpretation it is the believer
                    only who partakes in a spiritual manner of Christ’s body existing in heaven”
                    (Hagenbach, ii. 293, § 258). While Zwingli lays principal stress upon the
                    historical fact, and the idea of an act of commemoration; Calvin attaches
                    greater importance to the intimate union of the believers with Christ. Thus in
                    his opinion <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n679/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0679-0654"/> the Eucharist is not only a commemoration of a
                    past event, but also the pledge and seal of something then actually present. As
                    bread and wine sustain our earthly body, so the body and blood of Christ nourish
                    and refresh our spiritual nature (Hagenbach, <hi rend="italic">u.s.,</hi> p.
                    302). With regard to the participation of unbelievers, the Helvetic Confession
                    lays down definitely that they who approach the Lord’s Table without faith
                    partake of the sacrament alone, but have no share in the “res sacramenti” which
                    is the source of life and salvation <hi rend="italic">(Corpus Confession.,</hi>
                    p. 73).</p>
                <p>The doctrine of the Church of England, as set forth in her 28th Article, is that
                    “the supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians ought to
                    have among themselves one to another, but rather is a sacrament of our
                    redemption by Christ’s death, insomuch that, to such as rightly, worthily, and
                    with faith receive the same, the bread which we break is a partaking of the body
                    of Christ, and likewise the cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of
                    Christ The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the supper only after an
                    heavenly and spiritual manner, and the means whereby the body of Christ is
                    received and eaten in the supper is faith.” The teaching of the Catechism is to
                    the same effect, viz , that the sacrament of the Lord’s supper was ordained “for
                    the continual remembrance of the sacrifice of the death of Christ, and of the
                    benefits which we receive thereby.” It teaches also that “the body and blood of
                    Christ are verily and indeed taken and received by the faithful,” to “the
                    strengthening and refreshing of our souls by the body and blood of Christ as our
                    bodies are by the bread and wine.”</p>
                <p>The doctrine of the Presbyterian Churches of Scotland, as declared in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Confession of Faith,</hi> agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines
                    at Westminster, and approved by the General Assembly in 1647, and established by
                    Acts of Parliament in 1649 and 1690, as “the publick and avowed confession of
                    the Church of Scotland,” is that the Lord’s supper was instituted by Christ, to
                    be observed to the end of the world “for the perpetual remembrance of the
                    sacrifice of Himself in His death; the sealing all benefits thereof to true
                    believers; their spiritual nourishment and growth in Him; their further
                    engagement in and to all duties which they owe to Him; and to be a bond and
                    pledge of their communion with Him, and with each other as members of His
                    mystical body. In the sacrament Christ is not offered up to His Father, nor any
                    real sacrifice made at all for remission of sins of the quick or dead, but only
                    a commemoration of that one offering up of Himself, by Himself upon the cross,
                    once for all, and a spiritual oblation of all possible praise unto God for the
                    same The outward elements in this sacrament, duly set apart to the uses ordained
                    by Christ, have such relation to Him crucified as that truly, yet sacramentally
                    only, they are sometimes called by the name of the things they represent,—to
                    wit, the body and blood of Christ,—although in substance and nature they still
                    remain truly and only bread and wine. Worthy receivers outwardly partaking of
                    the visible elements in this sacrament do then also inwardly by faith, really
                    and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually, receive and feed
                    upon Christ crucified and all benefits of His death, the body and blood of
                    Christ being then not corporally or carnally in, with, or under the bread and
                    wine, yet as really, though spiritually, present to the faith of believers in
                    that ordinance as the elements themselves are to their outward senses” (chapters
                    xxix. §§1,2, 5, 7).</p>
