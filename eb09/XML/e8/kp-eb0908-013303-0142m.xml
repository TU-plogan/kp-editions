                    have supposed him to have been an Italian by birth. There can be no doubt,
                    however, that he was a German, as he asserts the fact in the preface to one of
                    his works, and his pupil Münster states expressly that he was born at Neustadt
                    of Jewish parents. His father, Rabbi Ascher Levita, assumed the surname of
                    Aschkenasi (the German), which was also used by the son. Banished as a Jew from
                    his native couutry, Elias went to Italy in the beginning of the 16th century. He
                    resided at first in Venice, where he earned a high reputation as a teacher of
                    Hebrew. In 1504 he removed to Padua, where he continued his career as a teacher,
                    aud wrote a commentary on the Hebrew grammar of Rabbi Kimchi. When Padua was
                    sacked in 1509 he lost all his property, aud removed to λ enice. About 1512 he
                    took up his residence in Rome, where he enjoyed for a number of <pb break="no"

                    several other dignitaries of the church. So intimate were his relations with the
                    Christians that he was accused of having apostatized from Judaism. His opinions
                    were undoubtedly more liberal than those of the majority of the Jews of his
                    time, but there is no reason to question his own assertion that he remained true
                    to the faith in which he was born. When Rome was attacked by Charles V. in 1527,
                    Elias Levita lost all his means for the second time, and again found an asylum
                    in Venice. In 1540 he went to Isny in Swabia, having been, invited by Paul
                    Fagius to join him in the superintendence of a printing-press for Hebrew books.
                    The last two years of his life were spent in Venice, where he died in 1549. The
                    most valuable of the numerous works of Elias Levita were those bearing on Hebrew
                    grammar and lexicography. His Massoreth Hammassoreth (Venice, 1538) is a
                    critical commentary on the text of the Hebrew Scriptures, and contains a very
                    able discussion of the question of the origin of the vowel points, which he
                    assigns to the Massoretic doctors of the school of Tiberias in the 5th century
                    after Christ. He also wrote a treatise on Hebrew grammar, a dictionary, chiefly
                    to the Targums and the Talmud, and several smaller works in Hebrew philology. In
                    the preface to his Massoreth, and other portions of his works, there are various
                    autobiographical details. A German translation of the Massoreth Hammassoreth by
                    Semler appeared in 1772, and an edition of the work with notes and an English
                    translation was published in London in 1867.</p>
