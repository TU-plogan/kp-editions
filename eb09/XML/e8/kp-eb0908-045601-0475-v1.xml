                <p><label type="entry">EPAMINONDAS</label>, the most celebrated general of Thebes,
                    born towards the close of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was
                    the son of Polymnis, and belonged to a noble family. Brought up in poverty, he
                    was diligent in acquiring the culture of the age, and became skilful in
                    gymnastic exercises and in playing the flute. For his intellectual education he
                    was chiefly indebted to lysis of Tarentum, a Pythagorean exile. According to the
                    account given by Plutarch, he served on the Spartan side at the battle of
                    Mantinea in 385 B.c. along with Pelopidas, who having fallen apparently mortally
                    wounded during the engagement, was protected by Epaminondas at the risk of his
                    life. Some have supposed this incident to have been the origin of a friendship
                    which is one of the most honourable and enduring in ancient Greek history.
                    Epaminondas was almost past his prime before he took any prominent part in
                    public affairs. He refused at first to co-operate in the revolution of 379 B.c.,
                    of which his friend Pelopidas was one of the leaders, owing to Pythagorean
                    scruples as to the possible shedding of innocent blood. But his desire to be
                    freed from the Spartan yoke was as keen as that of any of his fellow citizens,
                    and after the blow was struck he did his utmost to stir up the Theban youth to
                    maintain their independence. In 371 B.c. Epaminondas was one of the chief
                    representatives of Thebes at the conference at Sparta where the Athenians sought
                    to arrange a peace. He claimed the right to sign the treaty for Boeotia, thus
                    asserting the supremacy -of Thebes over the Boeotian cities. The claim was not
                    recognized by the representatives of the other states, and as Epaminondas
                    insisted on it, Thebes was excluded from the treaty altogether. A Spartan
                    invasion of Boeotia under Cleombrotus immediately followed the rupture of
                    negotiations. With an army not one-half the strength of that opposed to it,
                    Epaminondas inflicted a crushing defeat upon the invaders in the celebrated
                    battle of Leuctra (371). He immediately set himself to consolidate the position
                    of Thebes by forming alliances and by weakening Sparta. With the latter object
                    in view, he supported the founding of Megalopolis and the organization of
                    Arcadia as an independent government. In 369 he entered the Peloponnesus, and
                    took another important step towards the weakening of Sparta by establishing the
                    Messenians in their own country, and founding the city of Messene on Mount
                    Ithome. On their return home Epaminondas and Pelopidas were accused of having
                    retained their command beyond the legal period. Though there was no doubt that
                    they had broken the letter of the law, Epaminondas made a spirited defence,
                    which secured the acquittal of both. In the spring of 368 Epaminondas was again
                    in the Peloponnesus, and detached Sicyon and Pellene from the Lacedaemonian
                    alliance. On his return, however, he was repulsed by Chabrias in an attack which
                    he made upon Corinth. Later in the same year he took part in the unsuccessful
                    expedition sent to Thessaly to deliver Pelopidas from Alexander of Pherae,
                    though he did not hold a command, having been degraded owing to an impression
                    that he had not been sufficiently active against Sparta in the previous
                    campaign. In the next year (367) he was sent at the head of an army into
                    Thessaly, and succeeded in freeing Pelopidas without requiring to give battle.
                    Meanwhile the relation of the Arcadians with Thebes had been growing unfriendly,
                    and all the efforts of Epaminondas could not prevent them from forming an
                    alliance with Athens. Matters were. brought to a crisis in 363, when the Theban
                    governor of Tegea arrested the representatives of Arcadia, who had met there to
                    conclude a peace with Elis. Though the prisoners were released in a short time,
                    and an apology made for their arrest, the Arcadians demanded the punishment of
                    the governor. Epaminondas replied that the mistake lay not in the arrest but in
                    the release, and that he would come shortly and reduce the Arcadians to reason.
                    Accordingly in 362 he invaded the Peloponnesus for the fourth time. A. pitched
                    battle was fought at Mantinea, in which the Thebans were victorious, but
                    Epaminondas was mortally wounded. He was carried out of the throng, and being
                    told that he would die as soon as the javelin was withdrawn from his wound, he
                    did not allow this, to be done until he had heard that his army was victorious
                    and that his shield was safe. A column was erected over his grave, which was
                    made on the spot where he fell.</p>
