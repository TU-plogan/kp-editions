                    and embalmed not only human beings, but cats, crocodiles, ichneumons, and other
                    sacred animals. It has been suggested that the origin of embalming in Egypt is
                    to be traced to a want of fuel for the purpose of cremation, to the
                    inadvisability or at some times impossibility of burial in a soil annually
                    disturbed by the inundation of the Nile, aud to the necessity, for sanitary
                    reasons, of preventing the decomposition of the bodies of the dead when placed
                    iu open sepulchres. As, however, the corpses of the embalmed must have
                    constituted but a small proportion of the aggregate mass of animal matter daily
                    to be disposed of, the above explanation is far from satisfactory; and it may be
                    questioned whether embalming, together with the greater number of the Egyptian
                    doctrines concerning a future life, may not have entirely originated in
                    superstition or sentiment concerning the dead. According to Prescott, it was a
                    belief in a resurrection of the body that led the ancient Peruvians to preserve
                    the air-dried corpses of their dead with so much solicitude (see Conquest of
                    Peru, bk. i. chap, iii.). Prichard {Egyptian Mythology, p. 200) holds it as
                    probable that the views with which the Egyptians embalmed bodies were “akin to
                    those which rendered the Greeks and Romans so anxious to perform the usual rites
                    of sepulture to their departed warriors, namely, . . . that these solemnities
                    expedited the journey of the soul to the appointed region, where it was to
                    receive judgment for its former deeds, and to have its future doom fixed
                    accordingly.” It has been supposed by some that the discovery of the
                    preservation of bodies interred in saline soils may have been the immediate
                    origin of embalming in Egypt. In that country certain classes of the community
                    were specially appointed for the practice of the art. Joseph, we are told in
                    Gen. 1. 2, “commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father.”
                    Herodotus (ii. 86) gives an account of three of the methods of embalming
                    followed by the Egyptians. The most expensive of these, which cost a talent of
                    silver (£243, 153), w as as follows. The brains were in part removed through the
                    nostrils by means of a bent iron implement, and in part by the injection of
                    drugs. The intestines having been drawn out through an incision in the left
                    side, the abdomen was cleansed with palm-wine, and filled with myrrh, cassia,
                    and other materials, and the opening was sewed up. This done, the body was
                    steeped seventy days in a solution of litron or natron.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Neutral carbonate of sodium, NaCO, found at
                    the natron lakes in the Libyan desert, and at El Hegs, in Upper
                    Egypt.</p></note> Diodorus (i. 91) relates that the cutter {παpaerχlστ∙tγi)
                    appointed to make the incision in the flank for the removal of the intestines,
                    as soon as he had performed his office, w as pursued with stones and curses by
                    those about him, it being held by the Egyptians a detestable thing to commit any
                    violence or inflict a wound on the body. After the steeping, the body was
                    washed, and handed over to the swathers, a peculiar class of the lowest order of
                    priests, called by Plutarch cholchytoe, by whom it was bandaged in gummed cloth;
                    it was then ready for the coffin. Mummies thus prepared were considered to
                    represent Osiris. In another method of embalming, costing twenty-two minae
                    (about £90), the abdomen was injected with</p>
                <p>“cedar-tree pitch <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> (κeδpια), which, as it would
                    seem from Pliny (A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> αi. Hist., xvi. 21), was the
                    liquid distillate of the pitch-pine. This is stated by Herodotus to have had a
                    corrosive and solvent action on the viscera. After injection the body was
                    steeped a certain number of days in natron; the contents of the abdomen were
                    allowed to escape; and the process was then complete. The preparation of the
                    bodies of the poorest consisted simply in placing them in natron for seventy
                    days, after a previous rinsing of the abdomen with “syrmaea.” The material
                    principally used in the costlier modes of embalming appears to have been
                    asphalt; wax was more rarely employed. In some cases embalming seems to have
                    been effected by immersing the body in a bath of molten bitumen. Tanning also
                    was resorted to. Occasionally the viscera, after treatment, were in part or
                    wholly replaced in the body, together with wax figures of the four genii of
                    Amenti. More commonly they were embalmed in a mixture of sand and asphalt, and
                    buried in vases, or canοpi, placed near the mummy, the abdomen being filled with
                    chips and sawdust of cedar and a small quantity of natron. In one jar were
                    placed the stomach and large intestine; in another, the small intestines; in a
                    third, the lungs and heart; in a fourth, the gall-bladder and liver. Porphyry
                    {De Abstinentia, iv. 10) mentions a custom of inclosing the intestines in a box,
                    and consigning them to the Nile, after a prayer uttered by one of the embalmers,
                    but his statement is regarded by Sir J. G. Wilkinson as unworthy of belief. The
                    body of Nero’s wife Poppaea, contrary to the usage of the Romans, was not burnt,
                    but, as customary among other nations with the bodies of potentates, was
                    honoured with embalmment (see Tacitus, Annal., xvi. 6). The body of Alexander
                    the Great is said to have been embalmed with honey (Statius, Sylv., iii. 2,
                    117), and the same material was used to preserve the corpse of Agesipolis I.
                    during its conveyance to Sparta for burial. Herodotus states (iii. 24) that the
                    Ethiopians, in embalming, dried the body, rubbed it with gypsum (or chalk), and,
                    having painted it, placed it in a block of some transparent substance. The
                    Guanches, the aborigines of the Canaries, employed a mode of embalming similar
                    to that of the Egyptians, filling the hollow caused by the removal of the
                    viscera with salt and an absorbent vegetable powder (see Bory de Saint Vincent,
                    Essais sur les Iles Fortunées, 1803, p. 495). Embalming was still in vogue among
                    the Egyptians in the time of St Augustine, who says that they termed mummies
                    gabbaroe {Serm. 120, cap. 12). In modern times numerous methods of embalming
                    have been practised. By William Hunter essential oils, alcohol, cinnabar,
                    camphor, saltpetre, aud pitch or rosin were employed, and the final desiccation
                    of the body was effected by means of roasted gypsum placed in its coffin. Boudet
                    embalmed with tan, salt, asphalt, and Peruvian bark, camphor, cinnamon, and
                    other aromatics, and corrosive sublimate. The la3t-mentioned drug, the chloride
                    and sulphate of zinc, the acetate and sulphate of aluminium, and creasote and
                    carbolic, acid have all been recommended by various modern embalmers.</p>
