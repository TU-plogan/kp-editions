                    greatest and sternest of the Hebrew prophets, makes his appearance in the
                    narrative of the Old Testament with an abruptness that is strikingly in keeping
                    with his character and work. The words in which he is first introduced—“Elijah
                    the Tishbite, of the inhabitants of Gilead ’’ (1 Kings xvii. 1)—contain all that
                    is told of his origin, and, few as the words are, their meaning is not without
                    ambiguity. By varying the pointing of the Hebrew word translated “of the
                    inhabitants” in the authorized version, the passage is understood by a number of
                    critics to indicate a Tishbeh in Gilead, not named elsewhere, as the birthplace
                    of the prophet; but it is not certain that anything more definite is meant than
                    that the prophet came from Gilead, the mountainous region beyond Jordan. Whether
                    the place of his birth is definitely indicated or not, there is nothing said of
                    his genealogy; and thus his unique position among the prophets of Israel, whose
                    descent is almost iιιvariably given, is signalized from the first. Some have
                    supposed that he was by birth a heathen and not a Jew, but this is an unfounded
                    conjecture, so inherently improbable that it does not deserve consideration. His
                    appearance in the sacred narrative, like Melchisedek, “without father, without
                    mother,” gave rise to various rabbinical traditions, such as that he was

                    grandson of Aaron, returned to earth, or that he was an angel in human form.</p>
                <p>The first and most important part of Elijah’s career as a prophet lay in the
                    reign of Ahab, which, according to the usual chronology, commenced about 918 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> He is introduced in the passage already quoted (1
                    Kings xvii. 1) as predicting the drought God was to send upon Israel as a
                    punishment for the apostasy into which Ahab had been led by his heathen wife
                    Jezebel. The duration of the drought is vaguely stated in Kings; from Luke iv.
                    25 and James v. 17, we learn that it lasted three years and a half. During the
                    first portion of this period Elijah, under the divine direction, found a refuge
                    by the brook Cherith, “before the Jordan.” This description leaves it uncertain
                    whether the brook was to the east of Jordan in Elijah’s native Gilead, or to the
                    west in Samaria, as Robinson supposes. Here he drank of the brook and was fed by
                    ravens, who night and morning brought him bread and flesh. The word translated
                    “ravens” has also been rendered “merchants,” “Arabians,” or “inhabitants of the
                    rock Oreb.” There is a general concurrence of opinion, however, that the
                    authorized version represents the true sense of the original. When the growing
                    severity of the drought had dried up the brook, the prophet, under the same
                    divine direction as before, betook himself to another refuge in Zarephath, a
                    Phoenician town near Zidon. At the gate of the town he met the widow to whom he
                    had been sent gathering sticks for the preparation of what she believed was to
                    be her last meal. Though <pb break="no"

                    the prophet with hospitality, sharing with him her all but exhausted store, in
                    faith of his promise in the name of the God of Israel that the supply would not
                    fail so long as the drought lasted. Her faith was rewarded by the fulfilment of
                    the promise, the cruise of oil and the barrel of meal affording sustenance for
                    both herself and her guest until the close of the three and a half years’famine.
                    During this period her son died, and was miraculously restored to life in answer
                    to the prayers of the prophet.</p>
                <p>Elijah emerged from his retirement in the third year, when, the famine having
                    reached its worst, λh ιb and his minister Obadiah had themselves to search the
                    land for provender for the royal stables. To the latter Elijah appeared with his
                    characteristic suddenness, and announced his intention of showing himself to
                    Ahab. The king, who in spite of the calamity that had befallen him was still
                    hardened in his apostasy, met Elijah with the reproach that he was the troubler
                    of Israel, which the prophet with the boldness that befitted his mission at once
                    flung back upon him who had forsaken the commandments of the Lord and followed
                    the Baalim. The retort was accompanied by a challenge—or rather a command—to the
                    king to assemble on Mount Carmel “all Israel” and the four hundred and fifty
                    prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah. The latter are
                    described as “eating at Jezebel’s table,” by which it is indicated that they
                    were under the special favour and protection of the queen. From the allusion to
                    an “altar of Jehovah that was broken down” (1 Kings xviii. 30) it has been
                    inferred that Carmel was an ancient sacred place, though this is the first
                    mention of it in the Scripture narrative. (On Mount Carmel and Elijah’s
                    connection with it in history and tradition see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Carmel,</hi> vol. v. p. 116.)</p>
                <p>The scene on Carmel is perhaps the grandest in the life of Elijah, or indeed in
                    the whole of the Old Testament. As a typical embodiment for all time of the
                    conflict between superstition and true religion, it is lifted out of the range
                    of mere individual biography into that of spiritual symbolism, and it has
                    accordingly furnished at once a fruitful theme for the religious teacher and a
                    lofty inspiration for the artist. The incident is indeed a true type, showing
                    the characteristic features of combatants that are always meeting, and of a
                    conflict that is always being waged. The false prophets were allowed to invoke
                    their god in whatever manner they pleased from the early morning until the time
                    of evening sacrifice. The only interruption came at noon, in the mocking
                    encouragement of Elijah (1 Kings xviii. 27), which is remarkable as an almost
                    solitary instance of grim· sarcastic humour occurring in the Bible. Its effect
                    upon the false prophets was to increase their frenzy; they “cried aloud and cut
                    themselves with knives and lancets,” as the authorized version has it, The
                    translation should rather be “swords and lances.” The evening came, and the god
                    had made no sign; “there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that
                    regarded.” Elijah now stepped forward with the quiet confidence and dignity that
                    became the prophet and representative of the true God. Two things are noteworthy
                    in his preparations: all Israel is represented symbolically in the twelve stones
                    with which he built the altar; and the water poured upon the sacrifice and into
                    the surrounding trench was evidently designed to prevent the suspicion of fraud.
                    In striking contrast to the unreasoning frenzy and the “vain repetitions” of the
                    false prophets are the few and simple words with which Elijah makes his prayer
                    to Jehovah. Once only, with the calm assurance of one who knew that his prayer
                    would be answered, he invokes the God of his fathers to vindicate himself in the
                    presence of an apostate people. The answer comes at once: “The fire of the Lord
                    fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the
                    dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.” So convincing a sign was
                    irresistible; the people who had stood by in wondering silence now fell on their
                    faces and acknowledged Jehovah as the true God. In harmony with the method in
                    which Jehovah often vindicated himself in the Old Testament economy, the
                    acknowledgment of the true prophet and his God was immediately followed by the
                    destruction of the false prophets. The first heat of conviction made the people
                    quick to obey the command to seize the prophets of Baal, who were immediately
                    afterwards slain by Elijah beside the brook Kishon. The deed, though not without
                    parallel in the Old Testament history, stamps the peculiarly vindictive
                    character of Elijah’s prophetic mission.</p>
                <p>The people having returned to their rightful allegiance to the true God, the
                    drought sent as a punishment for their defection at once ceased. The narrative
                    proceeds without a break. On the evening of the day that had witnessed the
                    decisive contest, Elijah, after having invited Ahab to eat and drink, and
                    foretold abundance of rain, proceeded once more to the top of Carmel, and there,
                    with “his face between his knees” (possibly engaged in the prayer referred to in
                    James v. 17-18), waited for the long-looked-for blessing. His servant, sent
                    repeatedly to search the sky for signs, returned the seventh time reporting a
                    little cloud arising out of the sea “like a man’s hand.” The portent was
                    scarcely seen ere it was fulfilled. The sky was full of clouds and a great rain
                    was falling when Ahab, obeying the command of Elijah, set out in his chariot for
                    Jezreel. Elijah, with what object does not appear, ran before the chariot to the
                    entrance of Jezreel, a distance of at least sixteen miles, thus showing the
                    power of endurance natural to a prophet of the wilderness. If he went with any
                    hope that the events that had just occurred would change the heart of Jezebel,
                    as they seem to have changed the heart of the king, he was at once undeceived.
                    On being told what had taken place, Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah with a
                    vow in the most solemn terms that ere another day had passed his life would be
                    even as the lives of the prophets of Baal, and the threat was enough to cause
                    him to take to instant flight.</p>
                <p>The first stage of his journey was to Beersheba, on the confines of the kingdom
                    of Judah. Here he left his servant, who, according to an old Jewish tradition,
                    was the widow’s son of Zarephath, afterwards the prophet Jonah,<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jerome, Pro&lt;xm. in
                            Jonam.</p></note> and proceeded a day’s journey into the wilderness.
                    Laying himself down under a solitary juniper (broom), he gavo vent to his bitter
                    disappointment at the apparent failure of his efforts for the reformation of
                    Israel in a prayer for death. By another of those miraculous interpositions
                    which occur at nearly every turn of his history he was twice supplied with food
                    and drink, in the strength of which he journeyed forty days and forty nights
                    until he came to Horeb, where he lodged in a cave. A hole “just large enough for
                    a man’s body” (Stanley), immediately below the summit of Jebel Mûsa, is still
                    pointed out by tradition as the cave of Elijah.</p>
                <p>If the scene on Carmel was the grandest, that on Horeb was spiritually the most
                    profound in the life of Elijah. There for the first time he learned that the
                    normal channel of divine revelation is spiritual and not material, and that its
                    object is mercy and not judgment. Not in the strong wind that brake the rocks in
                    pieces, not in the earthquake, not in the fire, but in the still small voice
                    that followed, the Lord made himself known. There, too, he learned, also for the
                    first time, the true nature and limits of his own nroυhetic mission. He was the
                    herald, not of a sudden <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0908-0145-0136"/> vengeance and a sudden reformation of which
                    his own eyes might hope to see the fulfilment, but of the slow steady progress
                    of that kingdom of God that cometh not with observation. He was taught this
                    practically in the threefold commission laid upon him, which implied in each
                    part of it that the work of vengeance and of reformation alike were to be
                    fulfilled by other hands and in a succeeding age. He was to return to Damascus
                    and anoint Hazael king of Syria; he was to anoint Jehu the son of Niιnshi as
                    king of Israel in place of Ahab; and as his own successor in the prophetic
                    office he was to anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat. The revelation at Horeb
                    closed with an announcement that must have been at once a comfort and a rebuke
                    to the prophet. In his allegiance to Jehovah he was not alone, as in sadness of
                    spirit he had supposed; there were no less than seven thousand in Israel who had
                    not bowed to Baal.</p>
                <p>Leaving Hυreb and proceeding northwards, Elijah found the opportunity of
                    fulfilling the last of the three commands that had been laid upon him. He met
                    Elisha engaged at the plough probably near his native place, Abel-meholah, in
                    the valley of the Jordan, and, by the symbolical act of casting his mantle upon
                    him, consecrated him to the prophetic office. As it happened, this was the only
                    command of the three which he fulfilled in person; the course of events left the
                    other two to be carried out by his successor. After the call of Elisha the
                    narrative contains no notice of Elijah for several years. It was not until Ahab,
                    at the prompting of Jezebel, had committed his crowning iniquity in the matter
                    of Naboth’s vineyard that he again appeared, as usual with startling abruptness.
                    Without any indication of whence or how he came, he is represented in the
                    narrative as standing in the vineyard when Ahab entered to take possession of
                    it, and as pronouncing upon the king and his house that awful doom (1 Kings xxi.
                    17—24) which, though deferred for a time, was ultimately fulfilled to the
                    letter.</p>
                <p>With one more denunciation of the house of Ahab, Elijah’s function as a messenger
                    of wrath was fully discharged. When Ahaziah, the son and successor of Ahab,
                    having injured himself by falling through a lattice, sent to inquire at
                    Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether he should recover, the prophet was
                    commanded by God to appear to the messengers and tell them that, for this resort
                    to a false god, the king should die. The effect of his appearance was such that
                    they turned back without attempting to fulfil their errand. Their description of
                    the prophet left the king in no doubt as to his identity: “It is Elijah the
                    Tishbite.” With the true Jezebel spirit he resolved to destroy the enemy of his
                    house, and despatched a captain with a band of fifty to arrest him. They came
                    upon Elijah seated on “the mount,”—probably Carmel. The imperious terms in which
                    he was summoned to come down—perhaps also a tone of mockery in the appellation
                    “Thou man of God ”—were punished by fire from heaven, which descended at the
                    bidding of Elijah and consumed the whole band. A second captain and fifty were
                    despatched, behaved in a similar way, and met the same fate. The leader of a
                    third troop took a humbler tone, sued for mercy, and obtained it. Elijah then
                    went with them to the king, but only to repeat before his face the doom he had
                    already made known to his messengers, which was almost immediately afterwards
                    fulfilled.</p>
                <p>The only mention of Elijah’s name in the book of Chronicles (2 Chron. xxi.
                    12-15), where he is represented as sending a letter of rebuke and denunciation
                    to Jehoram, king of Judah, furnishes a chronological difficulty, owing to the
                    fact that Elijah’s translation seems to have taken place before the death of
                    Jehoshaphat, the father of Jehoram. <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> 1here is
                    reason, however, to suppose that Jehoram reigned for some years before the death
                    of his father; and on the other hand, though the account of Elijah’s translation
                    (2 Kings ii.) immediately follows that of his last public act in denouncing the
                    doom of Ahaziah (2 Kings i.), a considerable interval may have elapsed between
                    the two events. Whatever its duration, the time was spent in close and
                    continuous fellowship with Elisha, his disciple and successor, who, though
                    thrice entreated to leave him, showed the true disciple spirit in the solemn
                    vow, “As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.” The
                    approaching translation seems to have been known, not only to Elijah and Elisha,
                    but also to the schools of the prophets at Bethel and Jericho, both of which
                    they visited in their last eastward journey. At the Jordan their progress was
                    stopped only until Elijah, wrapping his prophet’s mantle together, smote the
                    water with it, and so by a last miracle passed over on dry ground. When they had
                    crossed, the master desired the disciple to ask some parting blessing. The
                    request for a double portion (z.e., probably a first-born’s portion) of the
                    prophet’s spirit Elijah characterized as a hard thing; but he promised to grant
                    it if Elisha should remain with him to the last, so as to see him when he was
                    taken away. The end is told in words of simple sublimity: “And it came to pass,
                    as they still went on and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of
                    fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a
                    whirlwind into heaven” (2 Kings ii. 11). There is in this, as Stanley has truly
                    remarked, an “inextricable interweaving of fact and figure.” It is scarcely
                    necessary to point out, however, that through the figure the narrative evidently
                    means to convey as fact that Elijah passed from earth, not by the gates of
                    death, but by miraculous translation. Such a supernatural close is in perfect
                    harmony with a career into every stage of which the supernatural enters as an
                    essential feature. For whatever explanation may be offered of the miraculous
                    element in Elijah’s life, it must obviously be one that accounts not for a few
                    miraculous incidents only, which might be mere excrescences, but for a seriee of
                    miraculous events so closely connected and so continuous as to form the main
                    thread of the history,</p>
                <p>Elijah occupied an altogether peculiar place in later Jewish history and
                    tradition. Of the general belief among the Jewish people that he should return
                    for the restoration of Israel the Scriptures contain several indications, such
                    as the prophecy of Malachi (iv. 5-6). Even if this be applied to John the
                    Baptist, between whom and Elijah there are many striking points of resemblance,
                    there are several allusions in the gospels which show the currency of a belief
                    in the return of Elias, which was not satisfied by the mission of John (Matt.
                    xi. 14, xvi. 14; Luke ix. 8; John i. 21).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Elijah is canonized both in the Greek and in the Latin Churches, his festival
                    being kept in both on the 20th July, —the date of his ascension in the
                    nineteenth year of Jehoshaphat, according to Cornelius a Lapide, (w. B. s.)</p>
