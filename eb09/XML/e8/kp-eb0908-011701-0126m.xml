                <p><label type="entry">ELECTROMETER</label>. An electrometer, according to Sir Win.
                    Thomson, who is the greatest living authority on this subject, and has done more
                    than any one else to perfect this kind of physical apparatus, is “an instrument
                    for measuring differences of electric potential between two conductors through
                    the eflect3 of electrostatic force.” A galvanometer, on the other band, which
                    might also be defined as an instrument for measuring differences of electric
                    potential, utilizes the electromagnetic forces due to the currents produced by
                    differences of electric potential. An instrument designed merely to indicate,
                    without measuring, differences of electric potential is called an electroscope
                    It is obvious that every electrometer may be used as an electroscope, and it is
                    also true that all electroscopes are electrometers more or less; but the name
                    electrometer is reserved for such instruments as have a scale enabling us,
                    either directly or by appropriate reduction, to refer differences of potential

                <p>The modern electrician is far more concerned with measurements of electric
                    potential than with measurements of electric quantity; and consequently all
                    modern electrometric instruments are suited for direct measurements of the
                    former kind. It is only indirectly that such instruments measure electric
                    quantity. With the older electricians it was otherwise; and some of the earliest
                    electrometers were designed for the direct measurement of quantity.</p>
                <p>Such was the measuring jar of Lane,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trαηs., 1769.</p></note> represented in fig. 1 (after
                    Lane’s Riess). D is a Leyden jar, fastened to a stand in such a way that jar.
                    its outer armature can be insulated or connected to earth at will. The inner
                    armature is in good metallic connection with the knob C. A horizontal metal
                    piece A is mounted on a glass pillar, and carries another knob, which can be set
                    at any required distance from C by means of a screw and graduation. The piece A
                    is connected with the outer armature of the jar by a thin wire B contained in a
                    glass tube. This last piece was added by Riess,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The object of the fine wire is to absorb the
                    energy of the discharges, and prevent the disintegration of the metal of the
                    balls which renders the action of the apparatus irregular (seo Riess, Reibung
                    selectricitit, § 386).</p></note> whose arrangement of the apparatus we have
                    been describing. One way of using the instrument is as follows. The balls are
                    set at a convenient distance apart, the stand is carefully insulated, and the
                    outer armature of the jar conneoted with the battery of jars or other system to
                    be charged, and the inner armature with the source of electricity, say the prime
                    conductor of an electric machine. The electricity accumulates on the inner
                    armature till a certain difference of potential between C and A is reached, and
                    then a certain quantity q of elec tricity passes from C to A in the form of a
                    spark, after which a quantity q remains distributed between the outer armature
                    and the accumulator which is being charged. This process is continued, and as
                    each spark passes, a quantity q is added to the charge on the outer armature and
                    accumulator. Hence if the capacity of the outer armature be negligible compared
                    with that of the accumulator, the charge of the latter will be proportional to
                    the number of sparks between the balls. The measuring jar may also be used to
                    measure the overflow of electricity from one armature of an accumulator when the
                    other is connected with an electric machine. In this case the outer coating of
                    the jar is connected with the earth, and C is connected with the armature of the
                    accumulator. There is no occasion to discuss minutely here the corrections
                    necessary in the latter method of using the apparatus; on these and kindred

                <p>The discharging electroscope of Gaugain belongs to the present class of
                    instruments. It consists (fig. 2) of an ordinary (old- . fashioned) gold-leaf
                    electroscope, with the addition of a small knob B <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>
                    connected with the metal sole of the instrument, and standing a little to one
                    side of one of the leaves. The charge on any conductor is measured by connecting
                    it with the knob A through a sufficient length of wet cotton to retard
                    the’discharge properly. When a certain amount of electricity has reached the
                    gold leaf, it is attracted to the knob B and is discharged; it then falls back,
                    is rechatged, then discharged by contact with B a second time, and so on. It is
                    found that the same quantity of electricity is discharged at each contact if the
                    process be properly regulated; so that the whole charge on the conductor is
                    measured by the number of oscillations of the gold leaf required to discharge it

                    two fine silver wires loaded with small pieces of cork or pith, and suspended
                    inside a small glass cylinder. Through the cap which closes the cylinder passes
                    the stout wire from which the pendulums are suspended. This wire ends in a
                    thimble-shaped dome A, which comes down very nearly to the cap; the outside of
                    the cap and part of the wire are covered with sealing wax, and the object of the
                    dome is to keep moisture from the stem, so that the electroscope could be used
                    in the open air even in rainy weather. To add to the sensitiveness of the
                    instrument two strips of tinfoil are pasted on the glass at B and C opposite the
                    pith balls. An electroscope similar to this was used by Saussure.<note

                <p>By far the most perfect form of electroscope on the double pendulum principle is
                    the gold-leaf electroscope of Bennet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans., 1787.</p></note> Fig. 4 represents a modern
                    form of this instrument. The gold leaves are gummed on the two sides of a flat
                    piece of metal carried by a stout stem, which passes through the top of a glass
                    shade and ends in a flat disc. By means of this disc we may convert the
                    instrument into Volta’s condensing electroscope (already described, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Electricity,</hi> p. 34). Inside the glass shade, and rising
                    well over the leaves, stands a cylinder of wire gauze, which ought to be in
                    metallic connection with the earth, or with some conductor whose potential is
                    taken as the standard of reference. The introduction of the wire cylinder is due
                    to Faraday, and is an essential improvement; it is absolutely necessary, in
                    fact, to convert the instrument into a trustworthy indicator of differences of
                    potential. It serves the double purpose of protecting the leaves from external
                    disturbing influences, and of ensuring that the instrument always indicates the
                    difference between the potential of the body connected with the leaves and
                    another definite potential. Thus, if we insulate the sole of the electroscope,
                    and connect A with the leaves, and B with the gauze, the divergence of the
                    leaves corresponds to the difference between the potentials of A and B, and will
                    always be same for the same potential difference.<note anchored="true"

                    certain in the old instruments, owing to the electrification of the

                    of a properly constructed scale, the instrument might be used as a rough
                    electrometer. The value of the graduation would of course have to be determined
                    by experiment. Peclet did, as a matter of fact, use the gold-leaf electroscope
                    in this way.</p>
                <p>The electrometer of Henley,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Phil. Trans., 1772.</p></note> sometimes called Henley’s quadrant
                    electrometer (fig. 5), may be taken as the type of single pendulum ∣
                    electroscopes. It consists essentially of a pendulum A hinged to: a vertical
                    support C, which carries a vertical graduated semicircle B, by means of which
                    the deviation of A from the vertical can be read off. This form of electroscope
                    is, or was, much used foi indicating the state of electrification of the prime
                    conductors of electric machines. The stem is screwed into the conductor, and the
                    divergence of the pendulum indicates roughly the charge.</p>
                <p>The sine electrometer of August, represented in fig. 6, is a modification of the
                    single pendulum electroscope, analogous in principle to Pouillet's sine compass.
                    A is a pendulum suspended by two threads to secure motion in one plane; B is a
                    ball fixed to the case, and connected with a suitable electrode. Any charge is
                    given to A; B is charged with q units of electricity; the case is turned through
                    an angle &lt;t&gt; in a vertical plane until the distance between A and B is the
                    same as it was when both were neutral; then, if the charge on A be always the
                    same, q oc sin &lt;f&gt; .</p>
                <p>This instrument is interesting on account of the principle employed in its
                    construction; but we are not aware that it has ever been used in practice.</p>
                <p>Another class of instruments, in which the movable part is a horizontal arm
                    turning about a vertical axis, may be looked upon as the descendants of
                    Gilbert’s electroscopic needle. The electrometer of Peltier and its modification
                    into a sine electrometer (by Riess) are instruments of this class. Descriptions
                    of both will be found in Mascart, §§ 291 aad 292.</p>
                <p>Dellmann’s electrometer (fig. 7) is constructed on a principle similar to that
                    applied in the two instruments last named. D is a needle, formed of light silver
                    wire, suspended by a fine glass fibre from a torsion head A. Below the needle is
                    a piece of sheet metal NE, divided half through by a notch in the middle, and
                    then bent in opposite directions on both sides of the notch, so that, when
                    looked at end on, it appears like a Y. Underneath NE is a <pb break="no"

                    passes a glass tube F supporting NE, so that it can be raised or depressed by a
                    lever G. Inside F is a spring by means of which the lever H, which serves as
                    electrode, can be connected or disconnected at will with the metal piece NE. The
                    whole contained in a metal case B, the lid of which is of glass, so that the
                    position of the needle D on the graduation PL can be read off by means of the
                    lens Μ. To rise the instrument, the case is connected with the earth, the needle
                    is brought neaτly at right angles to NE, and NE is raised by means of G till the
                    needle is in contact with it; then the electrode K is brought into communication
                    with NE, and the body whose charge or potential is to be measured is connected
                    with K. The connection with K is then suppressed, and NE lowered; and the
                    needle, now free, is repelled by NE. If, by means of the torsion head, we bring
                    the needle along to a fixed position relative to NE, the electrical couple will
                    be proportional to the square of the chai «e communicated to NE and D, i.e., to
                    the square of the potential of the body connected with K, provided the capacity
                    of the electrometer be negligible compared with that of the body. Hence the
                    potential is measured by the square root of the torsion on the fibre when the
                    needle is in a given position.</p>
                <p>The form of Dellmann’s electrometer we have just described was that used by
                    Kohlrausch.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pοgg. Ann.,
                    1842 and 1852.</p></note> It has been simplified by its inventor, and applied in

                <p>Coulomb’s balance might be used as an electrometer on the repulsion principle.'
                    Special care would, however, be necessary to avoid or to allow for
                    disturbancesarising from the case of the instrument, which ought under any
                    circumstances to be coated wholly or partially with tinfoil on the inside,
                    according to Faraday’s plan. Sir Wm. Thomson did, in fact, design an
                    electrometer of this description, and has given tables (Reprint of Papers, §
                    142) for reducing its indications. This type of electrometer has not come into
                    general use.</p>
                <p>II. Attracted Disc Electrometers. —The first idea of this kind of instrument is
                    due to Sir Wm. Snow Harris. One of the instruments in which he carried out the
                    principle and the mode of using it will be understood from fig. 8, C is an
                    insulated disc, over which is suspended another disc, hung from the arm of a
                    balance and connected with the earth. A weight w is put in a scale attached to
                    the other arm of the balance. The insulated disc is connected with the internal
                    armature B of a Leyden jar, whose outer armature is in connection with the
                    suspended disc' Electricity is conveyed to B, and the quantity q measured by a
                    small Lane s jar A, until the electric attraction at C is just sufficient to
                    turn the balance. Snow Harris found that wχ q <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>.
                    This and other laws established by him agree with the mathematical theory as
                    developed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Electricity.</hi><note

                    Thomson’s Papers, § 158.</p></note></p>
                <p>Great improvements have been effected in this kind of electrometer by Sir V m.
                    Thomson—(1) by his invention of the “guard ring or guard plate; ’ (2) by using
                    the torsion of a platinum wire for the standard force; (3) by devising proper
                    means for attaining a definite standard potential, and by protecting the vital
                    parts of the electrometer from extraneous disturbance; and (4) by introducing
                    sound kinematical principles into the construction of the movable parts.</p>
                <p>In order to .illustrate these points it will be well to describe the portable
                    electrometer (fig. 9), one of his simpler instruments, in detail. ’</p>
                <p>The principal electrical parts of this electrometer are sketched in tig 10. HH is
                    a plane disc of metal (called the “guard plate") kept, at a constant potential
                    by being fixed to the inner coating of a small Leyden jar MM (fig. 9), which
                    forms the case of the instrument. At F a square hole is cut out of HH, and into
                    this fits, as nearly as it can without danger of touching, a square piece of
                    alumi∙ nium foil as light as is consistent with proper stiffness. One side of
                    this disc is bent down, and then runs out horizontally into a narrow stem
                    endingin a stirrup L—the whole being not unlike a spade. The sole of the stirrup
                    consists of a fine hair, which moves up and down before a vertical enamelled
                    piece bestridden by the fork of the stirrup. On the enamel are two small dots
                    very near each other. When the hair seen through a small convex lens appears
                    straight, and bisects the distance, between the dots, the stirrup is said to be
                    in the sighted position. The aluminium spade is suspended on a horizontal
                    platinum wire stretched by platinum springs at its two ends, and is carefully
                    balanced with its centre of gravity in the line of suspension, so that the only
                    force other than electric that can affect it is the torsion of the wiιe, which
                    acts like the string in the toy called the “jumping frog," or like the hair rope
                    in the catapultaof theancients. The spade is so arranged that F is as nearly as
                    possible in the same plane with the guard plate when the hair is in the sighted
                    position. It is the torsional couple exerted by the wire in this position that
                    forms the standard force. The remaining important electrical part is the plane
                    horizontal disc G.</p>
                <p>It is essential to the action of the instrument that we should l&gt;e able to
                    move the disc G parallel to itself and to HH through measured distances. The
                    mechanism by which this is accomplished is a remarkable instance of the
                    application of geometrical principles to mechanism, and the reader will do well
                    to read Thomson’s “Lesson to the instrument makers’’ on this subject in the
                    Reprint of his papers, § 369. The glass stem which carries G is fixed into the
                    lower end of a hollow brass cylinder; in the upper end of the cylinder is fixed
                    a nut AC, through which works a carefully cut screw ending in a rounded point B
                    of polished steel. The point B rests on a horizontal agate plate let into a foot

                    lid of the jar MAI (fig. 9), and passes through a slit in the hollow cylinder.
                    This vertical piece is fitted on one side with two V notches, into .which the
                    hollow cylinder is pressed by a spring fastened to the lid and bearing half way
                    between the Vs, and on the other side with a rectangular groove in which slides
                    the vertical part of a knee-piece D, in rigid connection with the hollow
                    cylinder. D prevents the cylinder from turning round, but allows it to move
                    vertically; it also carries a fiducial mark running opposite a graduation on one
                    edge of the groove, by means of which whole turns of the screw are read off,
                    fractions being estimated by means of a drum head. The nut AC is arranged in two
                    parts, with a spring between them, to prevent “lost time” and secure steadiness
                    (for details, see paper cited above.)</p>
                <p>The disc G is connected by a spiral of line platinum wire with the main electrode
                    S, which is insulated from the lid of the box by a glass stem. The arrangement
                    of this electrode is worthy of notice, and will be understoodfromfig.il. The
                    dome T is called the umbrella; its use is obvious. A Similar, only less perfect,
                    device was noticed in Cavallo's electroscope. The vital parts of the instrument
                    are all inside the coated jar, and therefore removed from disturbing influences;
                    only it is necessary to remove some of the tinfoil opposite the hair in order to
                    see it. The effect of this is counteracted by means of a screen of fine
                    wire.</p>
                <p>The use and the theory of the instrument are very simple. The body whose
                    potential is to be measured is connected with the umbrella, which is raised in
                    order to insulate the main electrode from the case, the last being supposed to
                    be in connection with the earth. Let v be the potential of the inner coating of
                    the jar, the disc, and guard plate, V that of the body and G, and d the distance
                    between G and 11 when the hair is in the sighted position. Then, since F may be

                <p>Thomson's absolute electrometer (fig. 12) is an adaptation of the attracted disc

                    different parts, referring to Thomson s paper (l.c.) for details. B is an
                    attracting disc, which can be moved parallel to itself by a screw of known step
                    (<hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> ⅛ in. or thereby). A is a guard plate, in the
                    centre of which is a circular balance-disc of aluminium suspended on three
                    springs, and connected by a spiral of light platinum wire with A. The disc can
                    be raised or depressed into definite positions by means of a screw (the
                    kinematical arrangements in connection with these screws are similar to that in
                    the portable electrometer). A hair on the disc, an object lens h, a fiducial
                    mark, and an eye lens l enable the observer to tell when this disc is in such a
                    position that its lower surface is plane with lower surface of A. y y are the
                    halves of a box which screens the disc from electric disturbances. An idiostatic
                    guage (consisting of an aluminium lever with guard plate, hair, and lens, as in
                    the portable electrometer), placed over a plate F in connection with the guard
                    plate, enables the observer to tell when the guard plate and the inside coating
                    of the instrument (which forms a Leyden jar as in the portable instrument) are
                    at a certain definite potential. And finally, a small instrument called the
                    “replenisher” enables him to raise or lower the potential of A till this
                    definite potential is reached. . <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi></p>
                <p>A short description of the replenisher will be in place here. It is represented
                    pretty clearly at E (fig. 12). Two metal shields, in the form of cylindrical
                    segments, are insulated from each other by a piece of ebonite; the left hand one
                    is in connection with the guard plate, the right hand one with the case of the
                    instrument (and therefore with the outer coating of the jar). A vertical shaft,
                    which can be spun round by means of a milled head, carries two metal flies on
                    the ends of a horizontal arm of vulcanite. Two small platinum springs (the front
                    one is seen at e) are arranged so as to touch the flies simultaneously in a
                    certain position just clear of the shields. Let us suppose the left shield along
                    with A to be positively electrified, and the flies to be in contact with the
                    springs; e being close to the left shield, the front fly will be electrified -
                    and the back fly +. Suppose the shaft to revolve against the hands of a watch
                    lying face up on the cover of the electrometer. The front fly carries off its -
                    charge, and, when near the middle of the right shield, comes in contact with a
                    spring connected with the shield. Being thus practically inside a hollow
                    conductor, it gives up its - charge to the shield. At the same time the back fly
                    gives up its + charge to the left shield. The result of one revolution therefore
                    is to increase the + and - charges on the respective shields, or, in other
                    words, to increase the difference of potential between them By giving the
                    machine a sufficient number of turns, the potential of A may be raised as much
                    as we please; and, by spinning in the opposite direction, the potential can be
                    lowered; so that, once Λ is charged, it is easy to adjust its potential till the
                    hair of the gangs is in the sighted position.</p>

                    sighted position, and the upper screw reading taken; then a weight of w grammes
                    is distributed symmetrically on the disc, the balance brought up again by
                    working the screw, and the reading again taken. We of perfect symmetry still

                    can be made to touch the two metal caps of the dry pile simultaneously, and then
                    be removed, leaving the pile symmetrically electrified. This form of the
                    electroscope, with the various improvements, is represented in thus ascertain
                    how far the weight of w grammes depresses the balance. The weight is now
                    removed, and the balance left at a distance above A equal to that just found. A
                    is now charged, and its potential adjusted till the hair of the gauge indicates
                    that the standard potential υ is reached. Let it now be required to measure the
                    difference between the potentials V and V' of two conductors. Connect first one
                    and then the other with n, and work the lower screw till the hair of the balance
                    is sighted in each case, and let the screw readings reduced to centimetres be d
                    and α. Then, since the force on the disc in each case is gw, where g is the
                    acceleration produced by gravity in a falling body in centimetres per second, we
                    have by (1)</p>

                    the disc and the hole in which it works. We thus get the value of VV' in
                    absolute electrostatic C. G. S. units.</p>
                <p>III. Symmetrical Electrometers.—Two instruments fall to be described under this
                    head,—the dry pile electroscope, and Thomson’s quadrant electrometer. The idea
                    common to these instruments is to measure differences of potential by means of
                    the motions of an electrified body in a symmetrical field of force. In the dry
                    pile electroscope, a single gold leaf is hung up in the field of force, between
                    the opposite poles of two dry piles, or, in later forms of the instrument, of
                    the same dry pile. The original inventor of this apparatus was Behrens, but it
                    often bears the name of Bohnenberger, who slightly modified its form. Fechner
                    introduced the important improvement of using only one pile, which he removed
                    from the immediate neighbourhood of the suspended leaf. The poles of the pile
                    are connected with two discs of metal, between which the leaf hangs. This
                    aιτangement makes it easier to secure perfect symmetry in the electric field,
                    and allows us to vary the sensitiveness of the instrument by placing the metal
                    plates at different distances from the leaf. In order to make the attainment</p>
                <p>Hankel<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mascart, § 272, or
                    Pogg. Ann., 1858.</p></note> still further improved the dry pile electroscope by
                    giving a micrometric movement to the plates, by substituting a galvanic battery
                    with a large number of cells for the uncertain and varying dry pile, and by
                    using a microscope with a divided scale to measure the motions of the gold leaf.
                    With these improvements it became an Electrometer of great delicacy and
                    considerable range. Some of the <pb break="no"

                    to in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Electricity.</hi></p>
                <p>In the quadrant electrometer of Sir Wm. Thomson, which is the most delicate
                    electrometric instrument hitherto invented, the moving body is a horizontal fiat
                    needle of aluminium foil, surrounded by a fixed flat cylindrical box (fig. 14),
                    which is divided into four insulated quadrants A, B, C, D. The opposite pairs A,
                    D and B, C are connected by thin platinum wires. The two bodies whose potentials
                    are to be compared are connected with the two pairs of quadrants. If A and B be
                    their potentials, and C the potential of the needle, it may be shown (see
                    Maxwell, Electricity and Magnetism, § 219) that the couple tending to turn the
                    needle from A to B is <hi rend="subscript"> α</hi> (A-B){C-⅜(A + B)} (6), where
                    a is a constant depending on the dimensions of the instrument. If C be very
                    great compared with ⅜(A + B), as it usually is, then the couple is</p>
                <p>αC(A-B) (7)</p>
                <p>simply; in other words, the couple varies as the difference between the
                    potentials of the quadrants. Some idea of the general distribution of the parts
                    of the actual instrument may be gathered from tig. 15, which gives an elevation
                    and a section of the instrument. The case forms a Leyden jar as usual in
                    Thomson’s electrometers; the internal coating in this instance is formed by a
                    quantity of concentrated sulphuric acid, which also keeps the inside of the
                    instrument dry. The quadrants are suspended by glass pillars from the lid of the
                    jar, and one of these pillars is supported on a sliding piece, arranged on
                    strict kinematical principles, so as to be movable in a horizontal direction by
                    means of a micrometer screw Y. This motion is used to adjust the position of the
                    needle, when charged, so that its axis may fall exactly between the quadrants A,
                    C, and B, D. A glass stem C, rising from the lid of the jar into a
                    superstructure called the “lantern,” supports a metal piece Z, to which is
                    fastened a metal framework fitted with supports and adjustments for the bifilar
                    suspension of the nee⅛le. A fine platinum wire drops from the needle into the
                    sulphuric acid, thus connecting the needle with the inside coating of the jar.
                    This tail wire is also furnished with a vane, which works in the acid and damps
                    the oscillations of the needle. A stout aluminium wire rises from the needle,
                    carries a light concave mirror T, and ends in a cross piece to -which are
                    attached the suspension fibres. The aluminium stem and the platinum tail wire
                    are defended from electrical disturbances by a guard tube, which is in metallic
                    connection with tho piece Z, and also, by means of a platinum wire, with the
                    acid; it is through this, by means of the “temporary electrode” P, that the
                    inside of the jar is charged. The two principal electrodes are P and Μ.
                    Connected with Z is a metal disc S, attracting the aluminium balance of a gauge
                    like that of the absolute electrometer. This gauge is well seen in the
                    bird’s-eye view given in fig. 16. A</p>
                <p>replenisher, like that in the absolute electrometer, is fitted to the lid of the
                    jar, and by means of it the potential of the needle can be adjusted till the
                    hair of the guage is in the sighted position.</p>
                <p>The deflections of the instrument are read off by means of an image formed by the
                    mirror T on a scale at the distance of a metre or so, the object being a wire
                    which is stretched below the scale in a slit illuminated by a lamp. Within
                    certain limits the deflections are proportional to the deflecting couple, i.e.,
                    to the difference between the potentials of the quadrants A, D and B, C; but
                    where this is not so, the instrument can easily be graduated experimentally.</p>
                <p>For many purposes, especially in the lecture room, an instrument so complicated
                    as the above is unnecessary and undesirable. A simpler form (fig. 17) of
                    quadrant electrometer is now manufactured by Elliot Brothers, and answers most
                    ordinary purposes very well.</p>
                <p>Capillary Electrometers. —Electrometers have recently been constructed by taking
                    advantage of the fact that the surface tension of mercury is greatly affected by
                    the hydrogen deposited on it when it is the negative electrode in contact with
                    dilute sulphuric acid (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Electrolysis,</hi> p. 109). A
                    quantity of mercury is placed in the bottom of a test tube, and communicates
                    with a platinum electrode let in through the bottom of the tube; on the mereuιy
                    is poured dilute sulphuric acid, and into this dips a tube drawn out into a
                    capillary ending. This tube contains mercury down to a certain mark on the
                    capillary part, the remainder being occupied with acid which is continuous with
                    that in the test tube. So long as the mercury in the test tube is simply in
                    metallic connection with that in the upper tube, the position of the mercury in
                    the capillary part is stationary; but if an electromotive force be introduced
                    into the external circuit, acting towards the test tube, then hydrogen is
                    deposited on the small mercury surface, its surface tension increases, and the
                    pressure in the tube must be considerably increased to maintain the mercury at
                    the mark. This increase of pressure is proportional to the electromotive force
                    within certain limits, hence we can use this arrangement as an electrometer.</p>
                <p>Electrometric Measurement.—Several examples of electrometric measurement will be
                    found in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Electricity</hi> (pp. 18, 37, 38, 42,
                    46, &amp;c.). We recommend in this connection the study of the sections on
                    atmospheric electricity in Sir Win. Thomson’s Reprint of Papers on Electricity
                    and Magnetism, and sections 220 and 229 in Clerk Maxwell’s Electricity and
                    Magnetism. We have been drawing throughout on Thomson’s Repart on Electrometers
                    and Electrometric Measurements, but it will not be amiss to draw attention to it
                    once more. (G. CH.)</p>
