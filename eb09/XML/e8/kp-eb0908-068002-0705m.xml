                <p><label type="entry">EUROPE</label> is the smallest of those divisions of the
                    landsurface of the globe which are usually distinguished by the conventional
                    name of continents; but favoured as it is at once by its position, its
                    configuration, and its climate, it has played the most important part in the
                    modern history of the world, more especially since the 16th century. The
                    ultimate civilization of mankind must in great measure be wha,t Europe makes it;
                    and though, as centuries roll on, the auxiliary energies of other regions and
                    races, receiving new impulse and development, will undoubtedly lend potent
                    contributions to the common historic movement, the period must still be distant
                    when Europe shall have fallen from its position of controller and pioneer. It
                    has justly become a commonplace of geography to describe it as a mere peninsula.
                    of Asia, but, except in a purely geographical aspect, it is a peninsula as the
                    head is a peninsula of the body. Its individuality and its solidarity with the
                    neighbouring continents, its originality and its indebtedness, must be equally
                    emphasized if a just conception is to be formed of its characteristics. All its
                    dominant and, perhaps, nearly all its distinguishable peoples, its languages,
                    its religions, its philosophies, its social organizations, have had their origin
                    outside of its boundaries, and have been forced by modern science to recognize
                    their kindred elsewhere. But under its modifying influences everything has been
                    deeply and permanently differentiated: its people are more thoroughly conscious
                    of their dissimilarities from, than of their consanguinity with, the peoples of
                    the East and the South; its dominant religion at least has in large measure
                    forgotten or belied its original character and scope; its philosophies have
                    taken colouring and shape from the practical and political life of the people;
                    and its <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n710/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0710-0681"/> social organizations have been disintegrated and
                    re-formed under the pressure of new necessities and desires. And in a way in
                    which they have never been realized before, it has within the present century
                    realized two master principles of progress—the regularity of nature and its
                    amanability to multiplex investigation and control, and the necessity of
                    impartial recognition at once of the moral individuality of the individual and
                    the social and political solidarity of the several members of the community.</p>
                <p>Though Europe is naturally the best known of all the regions of the globe, yet
                    even of its physical features an absolutely correct registration has not been
                    attained. It is the only continent of which we possess an approximately complete
                    cartography; but in spite of the geodetic labours which have been carried on
                    since about the middle of last century with ever growing activity, much has
                    still to be laid down on very unsatisfactory data. While in some districts, for
                    instance, of England or France, we can find on our maps the exact locality of
                    every hamlet or homestead, every streamlet or clump of trees, there are portions
                    of several other countries where the main physical features are but vaguely
                    indicated. A considerable part of Finland is practically unexplored; and it was
                    not until 1875 that the labours of Kanitz furnished a fair representation of the
                    Balkan range. Nor is it only about such outlying regions as Turkey and Finland
                    that our information is either scanty or of the most recent acquisition; the
                    topographical survey of Switzerland, which first provided the Alpine traveller
                    with an authentic guide, was completed by Dufour only in 1865, and the
                    corresponding surveys of England, Italy, Spain, Russia, &lt;fcc., are still in
                    progress. Till the last country in Europe has been thus triangulated, we must be
                    content with more or less approximate estimates of areas and distances: in two
                    recent statements of the area of Portugal there is a difference of no less than
                    104 English square miles (4 ’ 89 German geog. sq. m.,or 269 05 sq. kil.),— so
                    that the possible error for the whole of the continent must be something
                    considerable. Even the astronomical distance between Paris and Berlin cannot be
                    given with absolute accuracy.</p>
                <p>Owing to its peninsular conformation the present boundaries of Europe are on
                    three sides easily stated: its western shores form the irregular rim of the
                    great basin of the North Atlantic, and bear witness in their dilapidated
                    headlands and sandy dunes to the power and fury of its tides and storms; on the
                    N. it lies along the Arctic Ocean; aud on the S. it is separated from Africa and
                    Asia by the Mediterranean, the Sea of Marmora, the Black Sea, and their
                    connecting straits. Towards the east, on the other hand, the boundary is almost
                    purely conventional: the Ural Mountains, indeed, may be regarded as furnishing a
                    sort of natural barrier, but they leave a considerable gap both towards the N.
                    and the S. In the S. the river Ural is usually accepted as the line of
                    demarcation, though the plain through which it flows is perfectly similar on
                    both sides, and it forms neither a geological, faunal, botanical, political, nor
                    historical limit. In the administrative divisions of the Russian empire, which
                    has no desire to make a severe distinction between its Asiatic and European
                    territory, even the line of the Ural Mountains is disregarded: 39,545 square
                    miles (1860 02 German geog. sq. miles, 102,4181 sq. kil.) of the government of
                    Orenburg, 49,333 square miles (2320 ’ 425 German geog. sq. m., 127,769 ’ 3 sq.
                    kil.) of the government of Perm, and 297 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 sq.
                    miles (14 Germ, geog. sq. m., 812’9 sq. kil.) of the government of Ufa lie to
                    the E. of the range. Across the peninsula between the Black Sea and the Caspian,
                    the line of the Caucasus is now accepted as the boundary. The British islands
                    have been separated from the Continent in a comparatively recent geological
                    period, and really form the prominences of a submerged plateau which at one time
                    must have presented a long and regular coast to the Atlantic. Iceland, though
                    distant more than 600 miles, and geologically, it may be, of indej&gt;endent
                    origin, is usually reckoned as an outlying portion of Europe. Nova Zemlya and
                    Waigatch may also be included; but Spitzbergen is more accurately assigned to
                    the Arctic archipelago. In the Mediterranean the Balearic islands are
                    conventionally attached to Spain, Corsica to France, and Sardinia, Sicily, and
                    the Pantellarian grouplet to Italy. Malta is also regarded as European. Among
                    the central islands of the great archipelago between the Balkan peninsula and
                    Asia Minor it is hard to find a line of demarcation; but the Cyclades, as part
                    of the kingdom of Greece, may be considered to belong to the western, and the
                    rest of the islands to the eastern continent. Properly speaking, they are both
                    Asiatic and European, and for that very reason neither European nor Asiatic.
                    '</p>
                <p>The four corners of Europe are marked by the mouth of the Kara ou the Arctic
                    Ocean in the N.E., 69° N. lat. and 65° E. long.; by the North Cape on the Arctic
                    Ocean in the N. W., 71° 1Γ N. lat. and 25° 50' E. long.; by Cape Tarifa on the
                    Atlantic in the S.W., 36° N. lat. and 5° 36' W. long.; and by Cape Apsheron on
                    the Caspian Sea in the S.E., 40° 12' N. lat. and 50° 20' E. long. Its most
                    northern point as a continent is Cape Nordkun in Norway, 71° 7' N. lat.; its
                    most southern, Cape Matapan in Greece, 36° 24' N. lat.; its most western, Cape
                    da Roca in Portugal, 9° 31' W. long.; and its most eastern, a spot at the
                    junction of the Ural range with the Grossland’s Ridge in 66° E. long. A line
                    drawn from Cape St Vincent in Portugal to the Ural Mountains near Ekaterinburg
                    has a length of 3293 miles, and finds it centre in the W. of Russian Poland.
                    From the mouth of the Kara to the mouth of the Ural river the direct distance is
                    1600 miles, but the boundary line has a length of 2400 miles. The total area of
                    the continent, according to Behm and Wagner’s calculation, is 179,833’37 German
                    sq. miles, 9,902,149 sq. kilometres, or 3,823,383*32 English sq. miles; so that
                    it forms rather more than a thirteenth part of the whole land surface of the
                    globe. Asia is about 4⅜ times, and America about 4∣ times as large. The total
                    population in round numbers is 309,178,300, which gives an average of 1719 for
                    the German mile, 3U2 for the square kilometre, and 80 8 for the English sq.
                    mile—considerably more than the average of any other of the continents.</p>
                <p>Two of the most striking features in the general conformation of Europe are the
                    great number of its primary and secondary peninsulas, and the consequent
                    exceptional development of its coast-line,—an irregularity and development which
                    have been the most potent of the physical factors of its history. The peninsulas
                    which are of most historic interest are those which trend southward into the
                    Mediterranean:—the Balkan peninsula terminating in the wonderful cluster of
                    peninsulas aud islands which bears the name of Greece, the long Italian
                    peninsula with Sicily at its foot, and the massive Pyrenean peninsula, so
                    thoroughly shut off by its mountain isthmus that in ordinary language it is
                    distinguished as the Peninsula par excellence. The northern peninsulas are much
                    less symmetrical in their arrangement, and have exercised less influence on the
                    history of Europe. The total coast-line is estimated at 19,820 miles, of which
                    about 3600 belong to the Arctic Ocean, 8390 to the Atlantic, and 7830 to the
                    Black Sea and Mediterranean. This gives 1 mile of coast to 192 miles of area,
                    which is a higher rate than that of any of the other continents. Much of this
                    coast-line, more especially in Norway and Spain, is of course practically
                    useless as far as commerce is concerned, owing to the absence of natural
                    harbours; but even when such portions are withdrawn, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n711/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0711-0682"/> facilities for maritime activity are
                    exceptionally great. That so small a part of the total belongs to the Arctic
                    Ocean, which lies ice-bound during many months of the year, and so large a part
                    to the Mediterranean, with its comparative freedom from winter and storm, has
                    been of no small importance to the progress of the European peoples.</p>
                <p>The coast-line of Europe is in its general features very much the same as it was
                    at the commencement of the true historic period; but when it is examined in
                    detail it is found to have undergone a number of important local changes, some
                    at least of which are due to causes that are at work over very extensive areas.
                    These changes may be conveniently classified under four heads :—the formation of
                    deltas by the alluvium of rivers; the increase of the land-surface due to
                    upheaval; the advance of the sea by reason of its own erosive activity; and the
                    advance of the sea through the subsidence of the land. The actual form of the
                    coast, however, is frequently due to the simultaneous or successive action of
                    several of the causes—sea and river and subterranean forces helping or resisting
                    each other. Our information is naturally most complete in regard to the
                    Mediterranean coasts, as these were the best known to our first bookwriting
                    nations, There w e find that all the great rivers have been successfully at
                    work—more especially the Rhone, the Ebro, and the Pυ. The activity of the Rhone,
                    indeed, as a maker of new land, is really astonishing. The tower of St Louis,
                    erected on the coast in 1737, is now upwards of four miles inland; the city of
                    Arles is said to be nearly twice as far from the sea as it was in the Roman
                    period. The present St Gilles was probably a harbour when the Greeks founded
                    Marseilles, and Aigues Mortes, which took its place in the Middle Ages, was no
                    longer on the coast in the time of St Louis. According to a calculation quoted
                    by M. Reclus, the total alluvium of the river in the space of a year is
                    17,000,000 cubic metres, or 590,000,000 cubic feet; and this estimate is
                    supported by M. Reybert, who found that the new land formed between 1841 and
                    1859 implied an annual deposit of nearly 19,000,000 cubic metres, or 671,000,000
                    cubic feet. The increase of the land is observable, not only in the immediate
                    neighbourhood of the mouth, but round almost the whole of the gulf of Lyons, and
                    is, of course, partly due to the alluvium of minor rivers. At the mouth of the
                    Hérault, according to Fischer,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“<hi rend="superscript"> κιi</hi> stenyerandenιιψen im

                    metres or about seven feet annually; and it requires great labour to keep the
                    harbour of Cette from being silted up. The Po is even more efficient than the
                    Rhone, if the size of its basin be taken into account. Were it not counteracted
                    in some measure, it would soon, with the assistance of the Isonzo, the Adige,
                    and the neighbouring streams, turn the northern part of the Adriatic into a
                    plain. Ravenna, which was at one time an insular city like Venice, has now a
                    wide stretch of downs partly covered with pine forest between it and the sea.
                    Aquileia, one of the greatest seaports of the Mediterranean in the early
                    centuries of the Christain era, is now 7 miles from the coast, and Adria, which
                    gives its name to the sea, is 13. And this increase of the land has gone on in
                    spite of the fact that both cities are on the northern part of an area of
                    subsidence which apparently extends southwards along the whole Dalmatian coast.
                    The islands on which Venice is built have sunk about three feet since the 16th
                    century: the pavement of the square of St Mark’s has frequently required to be
                    raised, and the boring of a well has shown that a layer of vegetable remains,
                    indicating a flora identical with that observed at present on the neighbouring
                    mainland, exists at a depth of 400 feet below the alluvial deposits. At Zara
                    ancient pavements and mosaics are found below the sea-level, and the district at
                    the mouth of the Narenta has been changed into a swamp by the advance of the
                    sea. A process of elevation, on the other hand, is indicated along nearly all
                    the coasts of Sicily, round the bay of Naples and the bay of Gaieta, at the
                    southern end of Sardinia, the east of Corsica, and perhaps in the neighbourhood
                    of Nice. The borings of pholads are found at a height of 600 feet on Monte
                    Pellegrino; the ancient harbour which gave its name to Palermo (Panormus) is now
                    nearly covered by the modern town; and the Grotto of San Ciro, which now lies
                    6000 feet inland, and at a height of more than 220 feet, must have had a direct
                    communication with the sea during the period of human occupation. That the rise
                    thus rendered evident is taking place over a wide area is shown by similar facts
                    observed on the African coast. The Tunisian harbour of Porto Farina, which had a
                    depth of 30 or 40 feet in last century, can hardly be trusted for 2; and this
                    change can only be very partially due to the action of the Medjenda river, as it
                    brings down but little alluvium. If the movement be maintained the Mediterranean
                    will again be divided into two basins by the old ridge between Sicily and Africa
                    whose existence has been posited to explain the present distribution of
                    zoological fossils. Passing eastward to the Balkan peninsula, we find
                    considerable changes on the coast-line of Greece; but as they are only
                    repetitions on a smaller scale of the phenomena already described, it is
                    sufficient to indicate the Gulf of Arta and the mouth of the Spercheius as two
                    of the more important localities. The latter especially is interesting to the
                    historian as well a3 to the geologist, as the river has greatly altered the
                    physical features of one of the world’s most famous scenes—the battle-field of
                    Thermopylae.</p>
                <p>If we proceed to the Atlantic seaboard we observe, as we might expect, great
                    modifications in the embouchures of the Garonne and the Loire, but by far the
                    most remarkable oscillations of sea and land have taken place in what are
                    emphatically the Low Countries of Europe. It is one of the familiar facts of
                    geography that a large par,t of the soil of Holland with its villages and cities
                    is many feet below the level of the sea; but it is not so generally known that
                    about a fifth of the area of the country is thus situated. The story of the
                    contest carried on along the coast between man and nature has often been told,
                    and is well worth the telling. If success is to be measured by the amount of
                    territory acquired, nature has hitherto had the best of the battle, and no
                    wonder, if it be true that the very ground on which man has built his ramparts
                    against the sea is slowly sinking under his feet. Such, at least, is the opinion
                    of Elie de Beaumont and other geologists of note: in fact the whole maritime
                    region from the Scheldt to the Weser is an area of subsidence. The Dutchman,
                    however, does not intend to give up the contest. It was only in 1395 that he
                    finally lost possession of the 500,000 hectares or 1,236,570 English acres of
                    good land which are now covered by the Zuyder Zee; aud he hopes to get the best
                    part of it back again. A scheme has been proposed by which the whole southern
                    portion, with an area of 195,000 hectares (481,872 acres) will be inclosed by a
                    dyke extending from Enkhuizen to Kämpen; and the feasibility of the enterprise
                    is sufficiently attested by the brilliant success of the Haarlem engineers who,
                    at a cost of less than <hi rend="italic">£7</hi> 65,000, have recovered the area
                    of the Haarlem Lake which had been lost in the 16th century. Further east along
                    the coast, between the Elbe and the Eider, it is hard to say whether land or sea
                    is gaining: on the one hand it is stated that the ruins of the castle of chlei
                    are now covered by the sea, and that a forest of historic identity is totally
                    destroyed; while on the other it is equally certain that the parish of Busum in
                    the north part of Ditmarsh was made laud-fast only in the 16th century, that the
                    Friedrick Koog, an area of new alluvial land five <pb break="no"

                    1853, and that islands are being formed further out towards the sea.</p>
                <p>The Baltic shores of Germany display the same phenomena of local gain and loss;
                    and there is more than a suspicion that the whole line lies along an area of
                    subsidence. In the western section the inroads of the sea have been very
                    extensive: the islaud of Rügen would no louger serve for the disembarkation of
                    an army like that of Gustavus Adolphus; Wolliu and Usedom are growing gradually
                    less; large stretches of the mainland are fringed with submerged forests; and at
                    intervals the site of well-known villages is occupied by the sea. Towards the
                    east the great rivers are successfully working in the opposite direction. In the
                    gulf of Dantzic the alluvial deposits of the Vistula cover an area of 1G00
                    square kilometres or 615 square miles; in the 13th century the knights of
                    Marienburg inclosed with dykes 900 sq. kil., or 346 sq. m., and 180 sq. kil., or
                    69 sq. m., were added in the course of the 14th. The Memel is silting up the
                    Kurische Haff, which, like the Frische Haff, is separated from the open sea by a
                    line of dunes comparable with those of the Landes in France.</p>
                <p>A large amount of evidence has gradually accumulated in favour of the hypothesis
                    that the Scandinavian peninsula is in process of elevation. Within the last two
                    centuries fiords have been left dry or broken into lakes, reefs have been turned
                    into islands, bays into pasture grounds. Μ. Reclus has pointed out that the
                    presence of certain beds of oysters goes to show that the lakes Malar, Hjelmar,
                    and Wener are remains of a channel which at no distant date communicated between
                    the Baltic and the North Sea; but the facts of marine distribution, as stated by
                    Forbes, are rather against the opinion of Celsius, that there was also a
                    connexion with the Arctic Ocean as late as the time of the first Roman
                    exploration. At Pitea, in the Gulf of Bothnia, the land is said to have gained a
                    mile in 45 years, and at Lulea a mile in 28 years.<note anchored="true"

                <p>It is only right, however, to mention that the statements made in.the preceding
                    paragraphs in regard to areas of subsidence and elevation are by several
                    geologists considered to be of very dubious validity. The data, they believe,
                    are much too slight and fragmentary for the conclusions, and some of the most
                    important are open to quite different interpretations. The so-called strand or
                    coast-lines of the Scandinavian peninsula, for example, are still the subject of
                    keen controversy among northern investigators, and a large polemical literature
                    is the result. Till the question as to the origin of these remarkable
                    appearances is finally settled, the recent elevation of the peninsula must be
                    regarded as little more than a provisional hypothesis.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The changes briefly indicated above take place so gradually for the most part
                    that it requires careful observation and comparison of data to establish their
                    reality. The Dutchman does not feel the subsidence of his well-defended flats,
                    and the Norwegian is quite unconscious that he is being raised along with his
                    pine-clad hills. It is very different with those changes which we usually
                    ascribe to volcanic agency: they force themselves on the attention, and find a
                    permanent place in the memory of the people. And yet it is only the scientific
                    registration of the phenomena which gives any accurate idea of their frequency
                    and extent. To the popular apprehension Europe is a fairly stable portion of <hi
                    rend="italic">terra</hi><hi rend="italic">firma,</hi> and we are accustomed to
                    contrast the uncomfortable tendency to oscillation exhibited by such a region as
                    Colombia or Peru in South America. But it is not so stable as it appears.
                    Besides the great outlying “hearth” of Iceland, there are four centres of
                    volcanic activity in Europe—all of them, however, situated in the Mediterranean.
                    Vesuvius on the western coast of Italy, Etna in the island of Sicily, and
                    Stromboli in the Lipariau group, have been familiarly known from the earliest
                    historic times; but the fourth has only attracted particular attention since
                    last century. It lies in the Archipelago, on the southern edge of the Cyclades,
                    near the little group of islets called Santorin. The region was evidently highly
                    volcanic at an earlier period, for NIilo, one of the nearest of the islands, is
                    simply a ruined crater still presenting smoking solfataras and other traces of
                    former activity. The present crater of Santorin is subaqueous, but it has
                    already raised a considerable mass of material above the surface. The
                    devastations produced by the eruptions of the European volcanoes are usually
                    confined within very narrow limits; and it is only at long intervals that any
                    part of the continent is visited by a really formidable earthquake. There is
                    little danger when the tremor has to be verified by glass cylinders on a sanded
                    floor. Minor shocks, however, are exceedingly numerous. Dr Volger found that
                    during the first fifty years of the 19th century the average number per annum
                    was, in Switzerland, no less than fifty; and he indicates the following
                    localities as <hi rend="italic">habituellen Stossgebiete</hi> or areas of
                    frequent disturbance:—(1) in the region of the Jura, the valley of the Birs to
                    the S. of B^sel, the valley of the Orbe, the Val de Travers, the valley of St
                    Imier, the district at the confluence of the Aar and the Limmat, Ac.; and (2) in
                    the Alpine region, the valley of the Durance and the Drac, of the Arc and the
                    Isère, nearly the whole line of the Arve, the upper valley of the Rhone almost
                    without interruption to the Lake of Geneva, part of the valley of Adige to the
                    S. of Trent, and the valleys of the Drave and the Gail to the W. of their
                    confluence. A table drawn up by Dr Suess registers about 116 earthquakes in
                    Lower Austria from 1021 down to 1870, and of these 53 belong to the present
                    century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    such disasters in popular literature, and by the latter 100,000 people are said
                    to have lost their lives. Calabria again suffered severely in 1865 and 1870.</p>

                <p>The whole continent is formed on a small scale of relief, though this scale is
                    not so small as has usually been stated on the authority of Humboldt. The mean
                    elevation of Asia, according to his calculations, was 351 metres (1151 E. ft.);
                    of South America, 344 metres (1128 E. ft.); of North America, 227 metres (744 E.
                    ft.); and of Europe only 201 metres (669 E. ft.) In 1874 Dr Gustav Leipoldt
                    published the results of a new calculation, which, being carefully conducted and
                    based on a much more extensive collection of data, must replace the estimates of

                <p>It is noticeable that Russia stands first on the list on account of its immense
                    area, in spite of the fact that its mean elevation is less than that of nearly
                    every other country.</p>
                <p>The central ridge of Europe is formed by a complex of from thirty to fifty
                    distinct wzcns(∕⅛, which from time immemorial have borne the name of the Alps,
                    or, if the usual etymology be correct, the White Mountains.’ They are closely
                    grouped together over an area of about 74,000 or 75,000 square miles, extending
                    from 5° to 16° E. long., and curving round from the Gulf of Lyons to the
                    neighbourhood of Vienna. According to Dr Leipoldt, if the material of which they
                    are composed were equally distributed over the surface of the continent it would
                    raise the level 27 ’ 23 metres, or 89 English feet. Mount St Gotthard, situated
                    in 8° 36' E. long., is usually considered as the central massif; but instead of
                    being, as was long supposed, the highest part of the system, and consequently of
                    the European continent, it is really overtopped by a large number of the other
                    groups. The honour of being the loftiest summit is now, as already stated,
                    assigned to Mont Blanc, which, in its terminal peak, named Dufour Spitz, in
                    memory of the great surveyor of Switzerland, reaches a height of 15,781 feet. In
                    general the mountains of the western parts of the range are loftier and more
                    closely ranked, while those towards the east not only diminish in height but
                    spread out over a wider area; and on the whole the southern sides are steeper
                    than the northern. Full details of the intricate divisions of the Alps are given
                    in a separate article. As the birth-place of its mightiest rivers, the natural
                    barrier between its mightiest peoples, a prime factor in the distribution of its
                    climates, and in modern times the noblest of all international “playgrounds,”
                    the Alps act a part of multiform munificence in the economy of the
                    continent.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the Pyrenees and its dependencies, all the mountains of
                    southern and central Europe may be regarded as secondary portions of the general
                    Alpine system. If it were possible with more than human reach of sight to take
                    an outlook northwards from some commanding peak on the northern skirts of the
                    great chain, the whole country for two hundred miles and more would appear
                    occupied by irregular lines and groupings of mountains and hills rising from a
                    kind of table-land, and intersected by the deepcut valleys of the larger rivers.
                    Towards the north-west the most conspicuous heights are those of the Jura
                    proper, which runs parallel with the Alps, and is only separated from them by
                    the valleys of the Rhone and the Aar, the latter a main tributary of the Rhine.
                    The German Jura trends north-east, the Black Forest north from the eastern
                    extremity of the Jura proper, and fronting the Black Forest on the other side of
                    the Rhine lie the Vosges. Further north the Rhine valley is defined on the west
                    by the Hardt, the Hochwald, the Eifel, and the Ardennes; and on the east by the
                    Odenwald, the Westerwald, and the Taunus. North of the German Jura lie the
                    Franconian heights, which are separated by the valley of the Main from the
                    Spessart, the Rhön, and the Thüringerwald. From the Thüringerwald south-east run
                    the successive clusters of the Frankenwald and the Fichtelgebirge; and from this
                    last massif eastward extends the Erzgebirge as far as the valley of the Elbe,
                    and south-eastwards the Böhmerwald, along the valley of the Danube. Beyond the
                    Elbe, and forming the eastern rim of the upper basin, are the Riesengebirge and
                    the so-called Sudetic chain, which, by its southern extremity, approaches the
                    Carpathian mountains; and these again, in company with the Transylvanian
                    mountains, curve south and enclose the great Hungarian plain. The Balkan to the
                    south of the Danube is practically on the one hand a continuation of the
                    Transylvanian range, and on the other it is connected by the mountains of
                    Carinthia, Dalmatia, Bosnia, and Servia with the eastern extremity of the Alps.
                    The Apennines are still more closely connected with the western extremity, and
                    the mountains of Auvergne and the Cevennes in France may also be regarded as
                    outliers of the system.</p>
                <p>Several of the ranges, however, are sufficiently distinct in position and general
                    characteristics to be treated apart. The Apennines form an uninterrupted chain
                    extending south to the Straits of Messina. Their mean height varies from 2600
                    feet in one part to 6400 in another; and among the loftiest peaks are Monte
                    Cimone, 7060; Alpe di Cam-poraghena, 6537; Monte Sibilla, 7188; Gransasso, 9493;
                    La Majella, 9314; Monte Pollino, 7441; and Aspromonte, 6375. The Carpathians are
                    about 520 miles long, and attain their greatest elevation in Butschetie, which
                    has an altitude of 9528 feet. The declivities of the range are steepest on the
                    southern side. The Balkans, or Haemus, run 400 miles east and west to the south
                    of the Danube valley, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n714/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0714-0685"/> Their mean elevation is about 5000-5600 feet; but
                    it is only from the southern side that they present a really mountainous
                    appearance; on the northern they gradually descend by a succession of terraces,
                    and, with few exceptions, the summits have gently rounded contours. The
                    culminating point is Tchar Dagh, which rises to a height of about 9700 feet.
                    Connected with the Balkans by its western extremity is the range of the Despυto
                    Dagh, or Rhodope, which stretches eastward along the north of the Aegean, and in
                    some points reaches a height of 8000 feet. Nearly the whole country to the south
                    in Thessaly and Greece is occupied by irregular groups and lines of mountains
                    and hills, among which the most important are the Pindus aud Olympus. Besides
                    the Alpine system and the secondary systems which are grouped along with it,
                    there are several others rendered quite distinct by their position and
                    structure.</p>
                <p>The Pyrenees are next to the Alps in elevation. They extend across the isthmus
                    between France and Spain for a distance of 240 miles, and are practically
                    continued by the Cantabrian Mountains for 260 miles more. The loftiest summit,
                    Mont Perdu, has an altitude of 11,270 feet. The south side of the Pyrenees
                    proper is the more rugged and precipitous; but the Cantabrian Mountains present
                    their steepest face to the north. All the minor mountain ranges of Spain are
                    connected with eaeh other and with the Pyrenees. The highest is the Sierra
                    Nevada in the south. The chain of the Dovre-Fjeld, Dofrines, or Scandinavian
                    Alps is about 1000 miles in length, and has a general elevation of from 3000 to
                    6000 feet. Properly speaking, it is not so much a range of mountains as a
                    plateau, broken up by deep-cut ravines and fiords. The western side is
                    precipitous, and the eastern descends gradually to the Gulf of Bothnia. The
                    Urals extend from north to south through 20° of latitude, with a breadth of
                    about 40 miles. They rise slowly from the plain on both sides, and at the place
                    where they are crossed by the road from Moscow to Siberia the ascent and descent
                    is hardly noticeable. A considerable proportion of the range lies between 3000
                    and 4000 feet above the sea; a few peaks attain an altitude of 5000; and one,
                    Toll-pors, is not much under 5500.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>If the European mountains are arranged according to their greatest elevations,
                    they rank as follows :—(1) the Swiss Alps, with their highest peaks 15,000 feet
                    or upwards; (2) the Sierra Nevada, the Pyrenees, and Etna, about 11,000 feet;
                    (3) the Apennines, the Corsican Mountains, the Carpathians, the Balkans, and the
                    Despoto Dagh, from 8000 to 9000; (4) the Guadarrama, the Scandinavian ïïlps, the
                    Dinaric Alps, the Greek Mountains, and the Cevennes, between 6000 and 8000; (5)
                    the mountains of Auvergne, the Jura, the Riesengebirge, the mountains of
                    Sardinia, Majorca, Minorca, and the Crimea, the Black Forest, the Vosges, and
                    the Scottish Highlands, from 4000 to 6000.</p>
                <p>The table given on page 686 furnishes a comparative view of the principal
                    European streams taken in the order of their length.</p>
                <p>In various parts of Europe, more particularly in calcareous regions, there are
                    subterranean or partially subterranean rivers. Of these the most remarkable are
                    the Sorgue of Vaucluse, the Touvre of Angoulême, the Timavo of Istria, and the
                    Poik or Γlanina. The first has been traced for 10 or 15 miles below ground; and
                    the Timavo when it issues from the mountain is already navigable. Along the
                    French coast several subterranean affluents of the Mediterranean have been
                    discovered, and some of them are evidently of considerable size. The Garonne
                    itself, which rises in the glaciers of Mount Maladetta, passes under Mont Poumar
                    for a distance of 4 kilometres. The subterranean course of the streams is
                    frequently indicated by peculiar vents or pits caused by the subsidence of the
                    soil; they are popularly known in Greece as <hi rend="italic">catavothra,</hi>
                    in Carinthia as <hi rend="italic">dolinas,</hi> aud in France by a great number

                <p>Europe has no Niagara, and, indeed, few of its larger rivers present anything
                    approaching to a real cataract. The Rhine takes a plunge of about 50 feet at
                    Schaffhausen; and there are a series of rapids in the lower course of the
                    Dnieper and the Dniester. In Sweden the Gotha-Elf falls 100 feet at Trollhata;
                    the Hjommel Sayka or Hare’s leap of the Lulea is 250 feet high; and the Riukan
                    Fos or “Smoking Force” at Mjösvand is no less than 800. The famous Staubbach in
                    the neighbourhood of Lauterbrunnen has a descent of 980 feet, but it is a mere
                    brook, and in summer almost dries up; it takes its name, as is well known, from
                    the dust-like appearance of the spray into which the water is changed by the
                    tremendous descent.</p>
                <p>Several of the more important rivers are of very irregular flow, and some are
                    subject to really formidable floods. In 1877 there were disastrous inundations
                    of the Danube: 12,000 people were rendered homeless in one of the suburbs of
                    Buda Pesth, hundreds of houses were undermined, while villages were submerged,
                    and large quantities of property were swept away. The floods iu the Netherlands
                    the same year were severe enough to necessitate Government help for the
                    sufferers. Large area3 in Saxony and Silesia were under water; the Elbe, the
                    Vistula, the Nogat, and the Oder, all overflowed their banks or burst their
                    dikes, it was feared that the whole line of railway between Thorn and Posen
                    would be carried away, and in some districts there was considerable loss of
                    life. If all the damage produced in this way since the beginning of the century
                    could be calculated, it would be found to represent an enormous sum. The floods
                    of the Loire alone, in 1856, carried off about .£8,000,000 worth of property;
                    and those in the south of France in 1875 caused a loss of about .£3,000,000. In
                    most Continental countries there have beeu consequently undertaken extensive
                    engineering works, partly to prevent inundations, and partly to render the
                    rivers more serviceable for navigation and irrigation. France has been
                    especially active in this matter, several of her most important streams being
                    very difficult to regulate. The Loire, for example, varies at Orleans from 25
                    cubic metres or 780 feet per second to 10,000 metres or 315,000 feet in the same
                    time; the Saône, in 1855, varied from 3,825,450 cubic feet per minute to
                    174,086; and the Rhone at Geneva, in 1858, which was a minimum year, from
                    740,000 cubic feet to 195,000.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Beardniore’s <hi rend="italic">Manual of
                    Hydrography,</hi> 1862.</p></note> The engineering works have been especially
                    successful on the Seine and Yonne, where several new methods have been tested
                    for storing the surplus water of one season, and utilizing it during the period
                    of deficient supply.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Blerzy, “Études sur les travaux publics,” in <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux
                    Mondes,</hi> 1875.</p></note> In Italy the Po, the Arno, and the Tiber are
                    notorious for their floods; but the first two are now among the most striking
                    examples of a satisfactory system of embankment. At Cremona, on the Po, which is
                    171 miles inland and 104 feet above sea-level, the flood of 1840 rose 18 feet,
                    that of 1855 rose 19 feet, and that of 1857 20 feet, above summer low-water. On
                    the last occasion the banks above Cremona were burst, and a vast area of country
                    was submerged; but such a disaster is now comparatively rare. For the irrigation
                    of the Lombard plain no less than 762,838 cubic feet per minute are drawn off by
                    the canals.</p>

                <p>Since the city of Rome has again become the capital of Italy the attention of the
                    Italians has been specially turned to the Tiber, and several schemes of
                    Herculean magnitude have been discussed. Garibaldi’s project was adopted by both
                    housee of the Parliament and sanctioned by the Government in 1875. During the
                    present century the Danube, which is the most international of European rivers,
                    has been greatly improved as a water-way, by the rectification of its course in
                    the neighbourhood of Vienna, by the clearing of the passage of the Iron Gates,
                    and by the maintenance of a proper channel at the delta. It is almost needless
                    to mention the works that have been carried on for the deepening of the seaward
                    section of all the greater rivers, and the removal of the bars at their mouths;
                    perhaps in this department the most remarkable results are exhibited by the
                    Clyde.</p>
                <p>In the accompanying table, for which we are indebted to Glogau, the principal
                    lakes of Europe are arranged according to their size. If we examine their
                    distribution we find they can easily be classified into groups. The</p>

                <p>Alpine lakes break up into a southern and northern subdivision—the former
                    consisting of Lago Maggiore, Lago di Como, Lago d’Iseo, and Lago di Garda, all
                    connected by affluents with the system of the Po; and the latter the lake of
                    Geneva threaded by the Rhone, Lakes Constance, Zurich, Neufchatel, Biel, and
                    other Swiss lakes belonging to the basin of the Rhine, and a few of minor
                    importance belonging to the Danube. As factore in the historical development of
                    the Alpine countries the first rank must be assigned to Geneva, Constance, and
                    Como. Next in interest to the Alpine group comes the Swedish—Wener, Wetter,
                    Malar, and Hjelmar, lying between the Baltic Sea and the Skagerrack, and nearly
                    as famous as their Scotch and English rivals for the beauty of their scenery.
                    The North Russian lakes, Ladoga, Onega, &amp;c., are mainly noticeable as the
                    largest members of what in some respects is the most remarkable system of lakee
                    in the continent—the Finno-Russian, which consists of an almost countless number
                    of comparatively small irregular basins formed in the surface of a granitic
                    plateau. In Finland proper they occupy no less than a twelfth of the total area.
                    It is impossible to take individual account of the multitudinous small lakes
                    that diversify the surface of every country in Europe, with the partial
                    exception of Spain; but their influence on the climate and hydrography of the
                    continent must not be overlooked. All of them help to increase the area of
                    evaporation, and many even of those which are almost nameless act as reservoirs
                    for rivers. Nearly all the rivers of Sweden, for example, have their origin in a
                    lake or tarn; and the same is the case with many of the streams of the northern
                    Pyrenees. The total area of the lakes given in the table is no less than 28,450
                    square miles, or about the united area of the Netherlands and Switzerland.</p>
                <p>A few of the number are very shallow. The Neusiedler See, for example (the Peiso
                    Lacus of the Latins and Fertotava of the Hungarians), completely dried up in
                    1864, and left its bed covered for the most part with a deposit of salt.<note

                    have been partially or completely drained by human labour. The Copais in Bce∩tia
                    was attacked by Greek engineers as early as the time of Alexander the Great; but
                    the tunnels which they constructed to carry off its waters have been choked up,
                    aud the lake is again in a state of nature. Lake Fucino or Lago Celano, in the
                    Abruzzo in Italy, was doomed to destruction by the emperor Claudius; but the
                    works which he constructed proved ineffectual, and it was not till 1862 that a
                    large part of the basin was turned into dry land. The progress of agriculture
                    has greatly diminished the quantity of marsh land in Europe, and there are only
                    one or two really extensive regions which deserve the name. Most important of
                    all are the Minsk marshes in Russia, and on these large encroachments are
                    gradually being made. The draining of the Pomptine marshes in Italy made Pope
                    Pius VII. famous in the 18th century; and at the present moment those of Ferrara
                    are sharing the same fate.</p>
                <p>Geologists have as yet come to no agreement regarding the origin of the principal
                    mountain ranges, and still less do they furnish a consistent and connected
                    history of the shaping of the continent. It will consequently be sufficient to
                    indicate the general distribution of the various formations, and the more
                    important basins of deposition for the sedimentary rocks.<note anchored="true"

                    >Miltheilungen,</hi> 1878.</p></note> The typical basin is that which takes its
                    name from Paris: in it the successive stratifications are arranged in an
                    exceptionally symmetrical manner. To the south-east lies the basin of Bordeaux,
                    separated by a plateau of granite and gneiss; to the north, on the other side of
                    the Channel, the London basin; and to the northeast the basin of the lower
                    Rhine. Further east conies the basin of the lower Weser, divided into two almost
                    independent portions by the Harz mountains; and to the south-east is the Prague
                    basin, which presents only fragmentary remains of its sedimentary deposits.
                    Nearly the half of European Russia belongs to the Moscow basin, which, in the
                    south-east, is conterminous with the probably more modern basin of the Caspian.
                    The whole of the south of the continent, from the Pyrenees to the Caucasus,
                    belongs to the Mediterranean basin, which is one of the greatest in the world,
                    and has its northern limit marked by the Cevenncs, the Jura, the Thüringerwald,
                    the Böhmerwald, and the Λrratyne plateau. The total surface area occupied by the
                    plutonic and metamorphic rocks is far from inconsiderable; but, with the
                    exception of the great mass of the Scandinavian peninsula, Finland, and Lapland,
                    and the long line of the Urals, the individual portions are of comparatively
                    small extent. Tn the Spanish peninsula they stretch from Corunna south to the
                    Tagus, appear again in the neighbourhood of Evora, form the western part of the
                    Sierra Guadarrama, and rise in islets above the Silurian<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0717-0688"/> formations to the south. In France they
                    constitute, not only the great plateau already mentioned between the Paris and
                    the Bordeaux basin, but also the massive peninsula of Brittany; and in eastern
                    Germany they are the predominant rocks of the Erzgebirge, the Sudetic chain, the
                    Böhmerwald, and the inclosed area. They again appear in isolated masses of
                    considerable extent along the inner side of the Carpathians; and in Turkey they
                    reach from Novi-Bazar to the Black Sea, and from the south of the Balkans to the
                    Aegean. It need hardly be added that they constitute the main mass of the Alps.
                    The only country where the Silurian rocks have a large surface area is the
                    Spanish peninsula, and there they are mainly confined to the western half. .
                    They show a long line in the Ural range, stretch from Lake Ladoga along the
                    south of the Gulf of Finland, rise above the Baltic in the islands of Dago,
                    Ösel, Gottland, and Öland, and appear sporadically throughout Scandinavia. Their
                    very name comes from the fact that they are present in England. The other
                    Palaeozoic formations—Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian—are widely developed.
                    In Russia they stretch from the Baltic to the Oka, and from the White Sea to
                    Voronezh; they occupy a considerable area to the west of the lower Don, and are
                    laid bare in the valley of the Dniester. In Western Europe they are best
                    represented in the countries on each side of the lower Rhine, in the British
                    Islands, and in northern Spain; but they occur here and there hi several other
                    quarters. The Secondary formations are still more extensively distributed,—the
                    Triassic and Jurassic forming a large proportion of central Germany, a good part
                    of France, much of England, and nearly the whole of the eastern portion of
                    European Russia. To the Cretaceous rocks alone belong a large part of the Paris
                    basin, part of the lower Rhine basin, all the Danish or Cimbric peninsula, the
                    great range of the Carpathians, the Balkan range, nearly the whole of Greece,
                    Albania, Montenegro, Dalmatia, Servia, and a wide tract in the centre of
                    southern Russia. The Secondary are in their turn exceeded by the Tertiary
                    formations, which furnish the continent with some of its most valuable
                    agricultural areas. The Miocene alone occupies a considerable part of the Paris
                    basin, part of the basins of the lower Rhine and the lower Weser, the Lombardy
                    plain, the Hungarian plain, Galicia, and Bessarabia, not to mention the valley
                    of the Ebro and other extensive tracts in Spain. The Pliocene is best
                    represented in the Caspian basin and the Ponto-Caspian depression, and along the
                    Russian coast from the Danube to the Don.</p>
                <p>Europe is richly furnished with mineral wealth, and the distribution is not so
                    irregular as might appear from the actual state of the mining industry in the
                    different countries. For the precious metals it is mainly indebted to other
                    quarters of the globe, but it possesses abundant stores of iron ores, lead,
                    copper, coal, and salt. Britain, Germany, and the countries of the
                    Austrian-Hungarian monarchy are especially distinguished by the value and
                    variety of their deposits; and Belgium and Sweden are largely indebted for their
                    national prosperity, the one to its coal and the other to its iron. Spain
                    naturally ranks high in this department, but the working of its mines is in a
                    backward condition. In the lands of the Turkish empire matters are still worse,
                    and Greece has comparatively little to show except the silver mines of Laurion.
                    Roumania exports salt and petroleum, and Servia, since it became independent,
                    has begun again to work its iron and copper mines. In the Russian empire there
                    are valuable coal-beds in the European territory, but the richest mineral area
                    lies on the Asiatic side of the Urals.</p>
                <p>Platinum has hitherto been obtained nowhere in Europe except in the auriferous
                    sands in the Russian government of Perm, which yield from 900 to 1000
                    kilogrammes a year. Gold, on the other hand, is widely diffused, but it occurs
                    for the most part in such insignificant quantity as not to repay the expense of
                    collecting. The total production is about 6900 kilogrammes per annum, and by far
                    the greater part is furnished by Russia. The gold mines of Spain were at one
                    time famous, and there was a considerable population supported by gold-washing
                    in Transylvania and Roumania. Silver is much more abundant than gold, but it is
                    less extensively distributed. There are productive mines in the Erzgebirge, the
                    Carpathians, the Urals, the Norwegian Dovre-Fjeld, and the Sierra Morena, as
                    well as in Sardinia and England. The total yield is about 300,000 kilogrammes
                    per annum. A considerable proportion is obtained during the working of the lead
                    mines, which are of great importance in several countries, more especially in
                    Spain, Germany, and Belgium, where the supply of lead exceeds the local demand.
                    In Spain, which has a large export, the lead mines are mainly situated in
                    Murcia, Almeria, and Jaen; in France the most important are in the Puy-de-Dôme;
                    in Britain in Durham and Northumberland; in Austria in Carinthia, Bohemia,
                    Tyrol, and Galicia; and in Hungary at Neusohl and NagybAnya. In the German
                    empire, Prussia, Saxony, Brunswick, and Anhalt are most productive; and in
                    Italy, Sardinia, Tuscany, and Lombardy. In Portugal there are 15 mines; and in
                    Turkey lead ore exists at Gallipoli, and at Olovo in Bosnia. The total amount of
                    copper obtained throughout the continent is estimated at about 589,000 cwt.
                    yearly. The only countries that can afford to export are Spain, Sweden, and
                    Norway; but Germany, Britain, Russia, Belgium, and Hungary are all great
                    producers. In Britain the mines are mainly situated in Cornwall, Devon, and
                    Chester; in Germany they are widely distributed, but the most productive are in
                    the districts of Merseburg and Arnsberg in Prussia; in Hungary they chiefly
                    occur in the Carpathian mountains. Of all the Spanish mines the best known are
                    those of Rio Tinto and Tharsis in the province</p>

                    pyrites annually). More than a third of all the zinc obtained in Europe is
                    contributed by Belgium, and nearly as much is furnished by Germany. The
                    principal Belgian mines are in the province of Liège, and the principal German
                    mines at Oppeln in Upper Silesia. Tin is found only in a few localities. The
                    richest mines are those of Cornwall in England, which have been worked from the
                    earliest historic period; and next in importance are the Austrian mines in the
                    Erzgebirge. Mercury is practically peculiar to Spain and Hungary, though it is
                    obtained in small quantities at Vallalta in the Italian province of Belluno, at
                    Santa Fiora in the province of Grosseto, and in Germany at Deuxponts in the
                    Palatinate, and is also known to exist in Bosnia and Roumania. The principal
                    Austrian mines are at Idria in Carniola, and the principal Spanish mines at
                    Almaden and Almadalejo in Ciudad Real.</p>
                <p>The salt production of Europe amounts to about 95,000,000 or 100,000,000 cwt. per
                    annum. To this total no contribution is made by Finland, Sweden, Denmark,
                    Luxembourg, Belgium, Servia, or Montenegro. It is partly procured from mines,
                    partly from springs, and partly from salt lakes and the ocean. The most
                    productive mines are in the Carpathians (at Wieliczka and Bochnia in East
                    Galicia), and at Salzburg on the north side of the Alps; there are also
                    extensive deposits in Chester and Worcester in England, in the departments of
                    Upper Saône and Ariége in France, at Wilhelmsglück and Friedrichshall iu
                    Würtemberg, at Berchtesgaden in Bavaria, at Leopoldshall in Anhalt, at Stassfurt
                    and Erfurt in Prussian Saxony, at Stettin in Hohenzollern, and at Sprunberg in
                    Brandenburg, at Cardona, Pinoso, Gerry y Villanueva, in Spain, and in the
                    districts of Prahova, Valbea, and Bacau in Roumania. Salt springs are still more
                    widely distributed. Bay salt is largely manufactured in France, both on the
                    Mediterranean and Atlantic seaboards; in Russia, along the coasts of the Black
                    Sea; in Spain, at Cadiz and Torrevieja, etc.; in Italy, in Sardinia, Sicily, and
                    Elba; in Turkey, at the mouth of the Danube, and in the island of Crete; and in
                    Greece, in the island of Santa Maria. The salt lakes of Bessarabia alone yielded
                    on an average 13,924,000 cwt. yearly from 1819 to 1850, and carriers come for
                    supplies from Poland, Volhynia, Kieff, and Tchernigoff. About 230 waggons are
                    loaded daily in the season.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    mining is one of the greatest industries of Italy and Sicily, forming, indeed,
                    almost the exclusive means of support for Girgenti and some other towns;
                    graphite is obtained in Bohemia and Moravia, Bavaria, England, Russia, Sweden,

                <p>The four great determining facts in regard to the climate of Europe are these:
                    its northern borders are within the Arctic circle; in the south its most
                    southern points are 9 degrees of latitude from the tropic of Cancer; to the east
                    extends for 5000 miles the continuous land surface of Asia; to the west lie the
                    waters of the Atlantic. Of minor but by no means small importance are the
                    presence of the Mediterranean along the south, and the peculiar character of the
                    African continent. To the ameliorating influence of the ocean must be ascribed
                    the main features that distinguish the climate from that of the corresponding
                    portions of Asia, and assimilate it so largely to the insular type. Like other
                    great masses of water, the Atlantic is less exposed to rapid thermometric
                    oscillations than the surface of the land, and its contiguity tends to produce a
                    similar stability. Slowly but continually it is surrendering the heat which it
                    has gathered in the regions of the sun. Though no problem of physical geography
                    is more keenly debated than the method by which the heat is conveyed and
                    distributed, the fact is admitted on all hands that such conveyance and
                    distribution does take place. Part of the work is done directly by means of
                    currents, part indirectly by means of winds. The questions in dispute are
                    mainly—what are the currents, how are they produced, and what is the area of
                    their individual influence <hi rend="italic">i</hi> While one physicist ascribes
                    all the credit to the Gulf Stream, another argues that the Gulf Stream has spent
                    both its impetus and its heat long before it approaches the European seas, and
                    that its contributions, if there be any at all, are altogether infinitesimal. Be
                    that as it may, the influence of the ocean as a whole is easily verified; a
                    glance at a map with isothermal lines at once indicates its extent. The line,
                    for instance, of 36° of mean annual temperature, which in the east of the
                    continent passes near Orenburg, reaches as far north as 73° in the sea between
                    Iceland and Norway. As the complement to this stands the fact that the
                    temperature of the East Spitzbergen Sea is still so high that no true polar ice
                    finds its way further south than 75° N. lat., while on the Americau coast it is
                    carried down to 36° N. lat. In other words, if the European conditions were the
                    same as the American, instead of the polar ice never being seen at the North
                    Cape, it would come sailing down past the straits of Gibraltar.<note

                <p>As regards its rainfall Europe belongs iu the main to the zone which is
                    characterized by irregularity of seasonal distribution; its southern portions to
                    the sub tropical zone distinguished by the dryness of its summers. The line of
                    demarcation runs at a little distance to the north of the Spanish coast of the
                    Bay of Biscay, continues along the northern slope of the Pyrenees, turns
                    north-eastλvards to the neighbourhood of Valence on the Rhone, curves southward
                    to Genoa, follows the line of the Northern Apennines, strikes across the
                    Adriatic from Rimini to the neighbourhood of Zara, and proceeds by way of
                    Seraievo, Novi-Bazar, and Sofia to the coast of the Black Sea, south of
                    Zozopoli. Within the sub-tropical zone the maximum rainfall occurs during winter
                    in the south of Spain and Italy; during autumn and spring in central and
                    northern Spain, the south of France, and northern and central Italy. In the zone
                    of irregular distribution Scotland, Ireland, and western England have their
                    maximum iu winter; western France, eastern England, the coast regions of the Low
                    Countries and Denmark, and the greater proportion of Norway have theirs in the
                    autumn; while iu eastern France, the German Empire, Austria, Hungary, Russia,
                    and Sweden it falls in summer. The general conditions that determine the
                    quantity of rain in a given district are well known,—the height and direction of
                    the mountains, proximity to the coast, and so on. As most of our rain is brought
                    by southwest and west winds, the western parts of the continent have on the
                    whole a heavier rainfall than the eastern; though to the south of the Alps and
                    the Pyrenees the relief of the peninsulas, and the presence of such a large
                    secondary reservoir of evaporation as the Mediterranean, produce great
                    irregularities. The following statistics show the influence of a western
                    position: —</p>

                <p>The greatest maxima of rainfall are registered at Stye-Pass in the west of
                    England, 189*49 inches or 48Γ ’ 2 centimetres, and at Seathwaite, 152*14 inches
                    or 386'7 centimetres. Next comes Glencroe in Argyllshire, with 128'60 inches or
                    326 ’ 4 centimetres. The Venetian and Lombard Alps furnish such maxima as

                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 centimetres, and Sta Maria 97*7 inches or 248 ’ 3
                    centimetres; and in general it may be said that the rainfall exceeds 40 inches
                    or 100 centimetres along the whole line of the Alps from Chambery to the
                    neighbourhood of Vienna in the east, and to the sea-coast in the south, down the
                    central ridge of the Apennines to the latitude of Gaeta, along the line of the
                    Balkans, in the Dalmatian, Monténégrine, and Albanian highlands, all round the
                    north and west of Spain and Portugal from Cape Roca to the eastern end of the
                    Pyrenees, in a large proportion of Ireland, Scotland, and Western England, and
                    throughout nearly the whole of Norway. The plateaus are usually well watered,
                    though their maxima are much below the maxima of the mountains; but the great
                    Iberian plateaus are an exception to the rule. The rainfall of Salamanca is only
                    9 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4 inches or 24Ό centimetres, and that of
                    Albacete 10 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3 inches or 26 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> 3 centimetres—a fact which is to be ascribed partly to the exhaustion
                    of the rain-clouds by the mountains of. Galicia and Portugal, and partly to the
                    treeless condition of the table-land itself. The average throughout Sweden and
                    the greater part of Russia, in the Hungarian plain, the northern half of
                    Bohemia, and the district of Germany from Halle to Dantzic, ranges from 40 to 55
                    centimetres or 15 ’ 7 to 21 ∙6 inches. The lower part of the basin of the
                    Dnieper, the whole of the basin of the Don, and the country watered by the
                    middle division of the Volga receive no more than from 25 to 40 centimetres or 9

                <p>In western Europe by far the most prevalent wind is the S.W. or W.S.W. It
                    represents 25 per cent, of the annual total; while the N. is only 6 per cent.,
                    the N.E. 8, the E. 9, the S. 13, the W. 17, and the N.W. 11. Of the summer total
                    it represents 22 per cent., while the N. is 9, N.E. 8, E. 7, S.E. 7, W. 21, and
                    N.W. 17. In southeastern Europe, on the other hand, the prevailing winds are
                    from the N. and E.--the E. having the preponderance in winter and autumn,<note

                    Circulation.</hi></p></note> Of local winds the most remarkable are the Föhn, in
                    the Alps, distinguished for its warmth and dryness; the Rothenthurm wind of
                    Transylvania, which has similar characteristics; the boro of the Upper Adriatic,
                    so noticeable for its violence; the mistral of southern France; the Etesian
                    winds of the Mediterranean; and the sirocco, which proves so destructive to the
                    southern vegetation. Though it js only at comparatively rare intervals that the
                    winds attain the development of a hurricane, the destruction of life and
                    property which they occasion, both by sea and land, is in the aggregate of no
                    small moment. About six or seven storms from the west pass over the continent
                    every winter, usually appearing later in the southern districts, such as
                    Switzerland or the Adriatic, than in the northern districts, as Scotland and
                    Denmark. As instances of the exceptional strength which is sometimes displayed,
                    it may be mentioned that in April 1800 men and cattle were actually lifted from
                    the ground by the force of the storm, and in November of the same year about
                    200,000 trees were blown down in the Harz mountains alone.</p>
                <p>The snow-line is subject, as is well known, to great local variations. In the
                    western and central Alps it lies about 8860 feet above the sea, and in the
                    eastern Alps on an average about 330 feet higher. In exceptional instances, of
                    course, the snow disappears at a much greater altitude, and even such summits as
                    the Jungfrau (13,671 feet), the Strahlhorn (13,750), and the Chaberton are
                    occasionally stripped completely bare. The whole range of the Pyrenees, where
                    the line usually lies about 8950 feet on the north side and about 10,000 on the
                    south, is sometimes in the same condition. In Norway, towards the North Cape,
                    the snow-line is 2360 feet, in the island of Seiland about 3200, on Sulitjelma
                    about 3970, on Dovre 5540, on Jotune 4910, on Sululand 5300, and at Folgefonden
                    4800,—a difference of from 400 to 1000 feet being observable between the eastern
                    and western side of the peninsula, mainly due to the more abundant precipitation
                    on the latter. On the western side of the Caucasus the mean elevation is 11,700
                    feet, on the eastern 14,100. There are no nevados in the Urals, though some of
                    the summits exceed 5000 feet in altitude. The Alps and the Scandinavian
                    mountains are the only ranges that possess a fully developed glacier system, but
                    both the Pyrenees and the Caucasus have individual specimens of considerable
                    extent. The most important of the Pyrenean group are the Maladetta, the
                    Cabrioules, the Mont Perdu, the Brèche de Roland, the Vignemale, and the
                    Néouville glaciers.</p>
                <p>The principal botanical regions of Europe have already been indicated in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Distribution.</hi> According to Schouw’s
                    nomenclature, the Mediterranean countries belong to the region of Labiatae and
                    Caryophyllaceae; the countries of northern Europe, about as far as the
                    neighbourhood of the Arctic circle, to the region of Umbelliferae and
                    Cruciferae; and the small remaining portion to the region of the Saxifrages and
                    Mosses. The varying relief of the continent, and the consequent variety of
                    climatic conditions, give rise to many infractions of this general rule,—the
                    most remarkable being furnished by the Alps, which are high enough to have a
                    large arctic area, and by the steppes of Russia, which, as is well known, also
                    afford a peculiar environment.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    elsewhere,, is distinguished by the shortness of its period of vegetation and
                    the small number of its annual plants; the north-European region has a long
                    period of vegetation and a regular winter rest; the Mediterranean region has a
                    long period of vernal growth, a protracted summer siesta, a short period of
                    autumnal growth, and a winter rest varying greatly according to locality; and
                    the steppe region has a short period of exuberant vernal growth, limited on the
                    one hand by a severe winter, and on the other by a parching summer. The nearest
                    approach to tropical conditions is made by the south of Spain. In the Vega of
                    Murcia there is no set time to sow and time to reap; every month brings its
                    fruit, and spring and autumn keep pleasant fellowship throughout the year. The
                    ground is no sooner cleared of its crop than it is again under the plough, and
                    within a few weeks it is green with another blade.<note anchored="true"

                    floras. Several districts have only been partially explored by the botanist; he
                    not unfrequently finds it difficult to decide whether a given plant has a right
                    to be admitted into his lists; and he is naturally more interested in estimating
                    the comparative richness of his scientific regions than of such conventional
                    areas as the continents. Hinds, reckoning all known species of plants at
                    134,000, allows 11,200 to Europe; while Friedrich Nyman, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Sylloge</hi><hi rend="italic">Floroe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Europäer,</hi> 1854-1S55, gives 1115 genera and 9738 species according to
                    Fries’s classification, and assigns 883 genera and 8104 species to the
                    dicotyledons, 206 genera and 1544 species to the monocotyledons, and 26 genera
                    and 90 species to the acotyledons. In all probability the numbers, especially of
                    the species, are below the truth. The total number of so-called useful plants
                    cultivated in European gardens is stated by Professor Göppert at from 2400 to
                    2500; but a large proportion of these are mere exotics. The extent, indeed, to
                    which this is the case, even with many species of wide distribution, is one of
                    the most striking facts in botanical geography. The vine, the olive, the fig
                    tree, and the mulberry were not improbably brought from Syria or Asia Minor by
                    the Greeks; the Arabians introduced the cotton plant; the walnut and the peach
                    are originally from Persia, the apricot from Armenia, and the sugar-cane and the
                    orange from China. The leek and the onion, the mustard plant and the cumin, the
                    laurel and the myrtle, are all Asiatic. For the pomegranate we are probably
                    indebted to the Phoenicians, and the quince still bears the name which it
                    received from the town of Cydonia in Crete. The cypress is a native of the
                    neighbourhood of Herat, the plane tree of the Taurus, the chestnut possibly of
                    Armenia. Lucullus, the conqueror of Mithradates, brought the first cherry-tree
                    to Europe; and some less famous Roman of the first century after Christ was the
                    introducer of the pistachio. Maize, tobacco, and the potato are well known to be
                    of American origin, and the same is the case with the agave and the opuntia, two
                    of the most characteristic plants of the Mediterranean region. The scarlet oak
                    was brought from North America to England in 1691; the cedar of Lebanon was
                    first planted in British soil in 1683; and among recent additions are the
                    Douglas pine from the Rocky Mountains, the deodara from the Himalayas, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Wellingtons,</hi><hi rend="italic">gigantea</hi> from California,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus Globulus</hi> from Australia. The last is
                    being planted in thousands in southern Europe, and has produced a greater
                    sensation than perhaps any other botanical stranger. It would be easy to
                    continue the list to an indefinite extent, and it would require to be
                    supplemented by a list of floral additions that have taken place within historic
                    time without the intentional intervention of man. This second cla33 is also a
                    numerous and continually increasing one.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    that if the introduction of new species into the continent is of frequent
                    occurrence, the migration of indigenous species from district to district must
                    be more frequent still. The plants of the higher regions are often carried down
                    by the rivers, and effect a permanent settlement in the plains; and from time to

                <p>The most important economical position is held by the cereals. Wheat is most
                    extensively cultivated in Russia, Austria, the Danubian principalities, France,
                    England, and Germany. The parallel of 57° or 58° may be taken as its northern
                    limit, though it is grown as far north as 65‘, and is found to ripen in the
                    island of Dyro in 69° 5'. Spelt <hi rend="italic">{Triticum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Speltα)</hi> is mainly cultivated in south western Germany,
                    Switzerland, and Belgium. Barley is cultivated in West Finmark as far as 70°,
                    and is part of the usual crop in all countries of the continent. Oats are more
                    frequent in the central and northern regions; their practical polar limit is 69°
                    28', though they have been known to ripen at Hammerfest in 70° 37'. Rye is an
                    important crop in nearly all the great grain-growing countries, but it is
                    especially in favour in the east and north; its northern limit is between 69°
                    and 70°. Maize has been grown in 63° 15', reaches its practical limit in 59°
                    55', and is exten sively cultivated only in the southern parts of the continent.
                    Sorgho <hi rend="italic">{Sorghum saccharatum)</hi> from China and a few other
                    foreign cereals have been successfully introduced, but are hardly anything more
                    than agricultural curiosities. The next place belongs to the potato, which has
                    spread over an enormous area in central and northern Europe. It has been grown
                    as far north as the island of Magero in 71° 7' N. lat., or about four miles S.E.
                    of the North Cape. The greatest producers are Germany, Belgium, Sweden, the
                    Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. A considerable variety of leguminous
                    plants are grown in Europe either for their fruit or forage—beans, pease,
                    lupines, clover, lucerne, sainfoin, &lt;fcc. The common pea <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Pisurn arvense)</hi> and the common bean <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Vicia</hi><hi rend="italic">Faba)</hi> have their northern limits
                    respectively at 64’ 41' and 67° 17'. A species of lupine <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Lupiηus liηifolius)</hi> furnishes a substitute for coffee both in Norway and
                    Tyrol. The vine can be grown without protection in southern Scandinavia, and has
                    been known to ripen its grapes in the open air at Christiansund in 63° 7'; but
                    its cultivation is of no importance north of 47⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>
                    on the Atlantic coast, 50^° on the Rhine, and from 50° to 52° in Russia. The
                    following is the average wine-production of the several countries:—France,
                    42,000,000 hectolitres (or 924,000,000 gallons); Italy, 30,300,000;
                    Austria-Hungary 23,000,000; Spain, 20,000,000; Germany, 4,440,500; Switzerland,
                    1,155,000; Greece, 1,150,000; Roumania, 1,000,000; Russia, 614,000. A speeial
                    Greek variety of vine is the source of the currants of commerce; it is
                    cultivated in the Peloponnesus, Cephalonia, Zante, Ithaca, and Santa Maura, and
                    yields an anuual average export of 128,000,000 tt&gt;. The olive, with its
                    double crop, is one of the principal objects of cultivation in Italy, Spain, and
                    Greece, and is not without its importance in Portugal, Turkey, and southern
                    Austria. The average total of the oil harvest in these countries amounts to
                    about 140,000,000 gallons; and of this Italy alone produces about
                    66,000,000.</p>
                <p>Besides the turnips and other roots which furnish so much of the winter-fodder
                    required by the northern farmer, the beet holds an important economic position
                    in central Europe as a producer of sugar. Tobacco is extensively grown from
                    Sicily to Sweden, but its cultivation is forbidden in England, Spain, and San
                    Marino, and inΛustιia it is a state monopoly. Its northern limit is about 63°
                    26'. It <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n721/mode/1up"

                    Russia, Germany, France, and Switzerland. Hemp and flax have a very wide
                    distribution, the former furnishing a valuable export to Archangel in the north
                    and to Italy in the south. Among all European countries Russia is the greatest
                    producer: during their church fasts her vast population make an enormous
                    consumption of hemp oil. Hopgrowing is hardly known in the south, but forms an
                    important industry in England, Austria, Germany, and Belgium. The plant grows
                    wild in Norway as far north as 64° 12'. Among the exotics exclusively cultivated
                    in the south are the sugar-cane, the cotton-plant, and rice. The first, which is
                    found in Spain and Sicily, is of little practical moment <hi rend="italic"
                    >j</hi> the second holds a secondary position in Turkey and Greece; and the
                    third is pretty extensively grown in special districts of Italy, more
                    particularly in the valley of the Po. Of the vast number of fruit trees which
                    flourish in different parts of the continent only a few can be mentioned. Their
                    produce furnishes articles of export to Austria-Hungary, Germany, France,
                    Belgium, Italy, and Spain. In Sardinia the acorn of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quercus</hi><hi rend="italic">Ballota</hi> is still used as food, and in Italy,
                    France, and Austria the chestnut is of very common consumption. In the
                    Mediterranean region the prevailing forms—which the Germans conveniently sum
                    together in the expression Südfrüchte, or southern fruits—are the orange, the
                    citron, the almond, the pomegranate, the fig, and the carob-tree. The importance
                    of these fruits to Italy and Spain is too well known to require more than
                    passing mention. Sicily, which was one of the great granaries of the Roman
                    empire, is now almost a continuous orchard. In recent years a new kind of
                    pistachio—the cacahuètes, or mani—has been cultivated in Spain, and its fruit
                    extensively exported. The palm trees have a very limited range: the date palm
                    <hi rend="italic">{Ph-cenix dactylifera)</hi> ripens only in southern Spain with
                    careful culture; the dwarf palm <hi rend="italic">(Chamoerops</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">humilis)</hi> forms thickets along the Spanish coast and in
                    Sicily, and appears less frequently in southern Italy and Greece.</p>
                <p>Such are the main economic plants of Europe; but the list might be indefinitely
                    extended if we were to include all the plants which enter into the <hi

                <p>When the Aryan peoples began their immigration into Europe a large part of the
                    surface must have been covered with primeval forest; for even after long
                    centuries of human occupation the Roman conquerors found vast regions where the
                    axe had made no lasting impression. The account given by Julius Caesar of the
                    Sylva Hercynia is well known: it extended, he tells us, for sixty days’journey
                    from Helvetia eastward, and it probably included what are now called the
                    Schwarzwald, the Odenwald, the Spessart, the Rhön, the Thüringerwald, the Harz,
                    the Fichtelgebirge, the Erzgebirge, and the Riesengebirge. Since then the
                    progress of population has subjected many thousands of square miles to the
                    plough, and in some parts of the continent it is only where the ground is too
                    sterile or too steep that the trees have been allowed to retain possession. The
                    consumption of timber has of necessity been enormous, more especially on account
                    of the climatic condition of the continent and the maritime activity of a large
                    part of its inhabitants. To the dweller in the warmer regions of the earth the
                    chief value of a tree is not unfrequently its shade; by the European its worth
                    is as often estimated by the quantity of heat it will yield on his hearth.
                    Several countries, where the destruction has been most reckless, have been
                    obliged to take systematic measures to control the exploitation and secure the
                    replantation of exhausted areas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    constrained not only by lack of timber and fuel, but also by the prejudicial
                    effects exerted on the climate and the irrigation of the country by the
                    denudation of the high grounds. But even now, on the whole, Europe is well
                    wooded, and two or three countries find an extensive source of wealth in the
                    export of timber and other forest productions, such as turpentine, tar,
                    charcoal, bark, bast, and potash.</p>

                <p>In Sweden and Norway the most usual trees are couiferous; but in the former a
                    certain number of birches, alders, and ash-trees are intermingled, and towards
                    the south the oak and the beech occur. This last is the characteristic tree of
                    Denmark; though some other species, which were common <pb break="no"

                    importance, and coniferous trees have beeu again introduced. The Russian forest
                    area is mainly in the northern part of the country, but it is separated from the
                    Arctic coast by a wide treeless belt. Towards the south there are no great
                    stretches of woodland, and for the most part the only trees are found along the
                    banks of the rivers. The Mennonites on the Sea of Azυff have formed plantations,
                    and there are others in the land of the Don Cossacks. The fir-tree is found as
                    far south as 48° N. between Novomovskovsk and Pavlograd in the government of
                    Kharkoff.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Wojβikυf,

                    pine; and of the deciduous trees the most frequent are the birch, the aspen, and
                    the oak. In the north of Russia alone the annual production of tar amounts to
                    297,000,000 tt&gt;. In Austria-Hungary there is still abundance of wood,
                    especially in the Alps and the Carpathians; but in some quarters, more
                    particularly in Transylvania, the most reckless destruction is allowed to take
                    place. The principal trees are the pine, the fir, the beech, the oak, the larch,
                    and the hornbeam; next come the ash, the elm, the maple, aud the birch; and in
                    the third place, the acacia, the poplar, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Götterbaum.</hi> According to the Bulletin of the Geographical Society of
                    Belgium, the value of the timber obtained on the lands of the Hungarian crown
                    amounts annually to about £1,042,000. In Germany, the pine and fir are most
                    frequent in the south, and the oak and birch in the west and south-west; while
                    in the central district coniferous and deciduous trees are about equally common.
                    In no part of Europe are the forests under more judicious management. France is
                    most indebted to the oak, the birch, the chestnut, the fir, and the pine; but
                    they fail to satisfy the home consumption. The poplar gives a peculiar character
                    to its southern landscapes, and the chestnut furnishes a valuable addition to
                    its alimentary resources. Italy has a rich variety of types—the silver fir <hi
                    rend="italic">(Abies</hi><hi rend="italic">pectinata)</hi> and other conifers,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Quercus</hi><hi rend="italic">sessiliflora,</hi> the
                    cork-tree, and other oaks, the chestnut, the sycamore, the mountain ash, the
                    evergreen oak. It exports manna, which is obtained from the ash tree, galls, and
                    turpentine. Switzerland not only supplies a great internal demand for timber,
                    but is able to contribute to foreign markets. The common trees are for the most
                    part the same as in Austria-Hungary. In Spain and Portugal the first rank as an
                    economic factor belongs to the cork tree, which yields in the former country
                    about £3,820,000 worth of bark for export, and gives employment to thousands of
                    the population. The oak, the red birch, the chestnut, the cypress, the plane,
                    and several conifers are also of importance. In Portugal the largest individual
                    forest—the royal domain of Leiria— consists mainly of the Bordeaux pine.</p>
                <p>According to the system proposed by Dr Sclater, and adopted by Mr Wallace, the
                    most recent English writer ou the distribution of animals, Europe belongs to the
                    great l’alaearctic Region, which also includes the most part of the continent of
                    Asia and a broad belt along the north of Africa. The northern and central
                    portions of Europe constitute a special sub-region, distinguished as the
                    “European” <hi rend="italic">par excellence;</hi> and the southern portions in
                    conjunction with the African belt constitute the Mediterranean sub-region. The
                    line of demarcation between these two is almost the same as that which separates
                    the zone of subtropical rains from the zone of rain at all seasons of the year,
                    the only important difference being that, while the Italian Alps and the Lombard
                    plain belong meteorologically to the north, they are zoologically assigned to
                    the south. According to Air Wallace, the “European” subregion contains two
                    distinctive genera of mammals, the <hi rend="italic">Mygale</hi> or musk rat and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tlupicαpra</hi> or chamois, and its characteristic forms
                    are the mole, the hedgehog, the shrew, the badger, the bear, the wolf and the
                    fox, the weasel, the otter, the hare and the rabbit, and the dormouse. In the
                    Mediterranean sub-region a similar position is held by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dama</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi> fallow deer, the civet, the hyena, and the
                    porcupine. In former geological periods not only were the Quadrumana represented
                    in Europe by several species, but one of those, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dryopithecus,</hi> discovered in the Miocene formations, probably approached
                    nearer to man than any of the existing anthropoids. At present the only species
                    of the order in the continent is the <hi rend="italic">Macacus iηuus,</hi> a
                    little monkey about a foot and a half long, which disports itself about the rock
                    of Gibraltar, but strangely enough has Asiatic rather than African affinities.
                    The cosmopolitan Cheiroptera or bats are well represented,—no fewer than thirty
                    species of the family <hi rend="italic">Vespertilionidae</hi> alone being
                    described. Perhaps the most common species throughout central Europe is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vespertilio</hi><hi rend="italic">pipistrellus</hi> or ordinary
                    British bat, but several others, as the <hi rend="italic">Vespertilio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">discolor</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Vespertilio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">limnophilus,</hi> have a wide range. Of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Sorex</hi> among the Insectivora there are at least ten species,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sοrex tetragonurus</hi> or common shrew inhabiting nearly
                    every country in the continent. An Italian species. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sorex</hi><hi rend="italic">etruscus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Crocidura
                    etrusca,</hi> is remarkable as the smallest of all known quadrupeds. Besides the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mygale</hi><hi rend="italic">muscovitica,</hi> already
                    mentioned as peculiar to the European sub-region, there is another species, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mygale</hi><hi rend="italic">pyreηaica.</hi> The common
                    hedgehog <hi rend="italic">(Erinaceus</hi><hi rend="italic">europoeus)</hi> is
                    universally distributed; and a smaller species, <hi rend="italic">E.
                    auritus,</hi> is found in the province of Astrakhan. The ordinary English mole,
                    <hi rend="italic">Talpa europcpa,</hi> is unkuown in Ireland, and in southern
                    Italy gives place to the <hi rend="italic">Talpa ca</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ι</hi><hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> There are comparatively few of
                    the larger members of the Carnivora, and their domain is continually being
                    diminished. The brown bear, or <hi rend="italic">Ursus arctus,</hi> is still
                    found in the Pyrenees, here aud there in the Alps, in the Carpathians, and the
                    Scandinavian mountains; and his polar cousin, the <hi rend="italic">Ursus
                    maritimus,</hi> is met with along the arctic coasts. To the general distribution
                    of the badger there appears to be no exception. The glutton is for the most part
                    confined to the forest regions of the countries that border the Arctic Ocean.
                    The genus <hi rend="italic">Mustela</hi> is represented, not only by the polecat
                    and the weasel, but by the martin, the pine-martin, and the ermine, all of which
                    are pretty familiar in most of the sub-region, though it is only in the colder
                    countries that their value as fur-bearers is developed. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mustela</hi><hi rend="italic">boccamela</hi> or honey-weasel appears to be
                    confined to Sardinia; and it is questionable if the ferret, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mustela furo,</hi> introduced by man from Africa, exists in the wild condition.
                    An important place in the fauna of Europe is still held by the wolf and the fox,
                    the former being from its numbers the most formidable of man’s feral
                    antagonists. It will be a long time ere the more mountainous countries of the
                    Continent can boast, like Britain and Ireland, that their last wolf is killed,
                    and the “tabunchiks” or horse-herds of Russia will probably for many generations
                    have to renew their annual battles with the famished packs. It is indeed
                    asserted that since the abolition of serfdom the number of wolves has
                    considerably increased, since the peasants are no longer obliged, as they
                    formerly were by their landlords, to organize regular hunting expeditions.
                    Besides the common or grey wolf, <hi rend="italic">Carns lupus,</hi> of
                    universal distribution, there is a black species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canis</hi><hi rend="italic">lycaon,</hi> of less frequent occurrence. The
                    jackal, <hi rend="italic">Canis</hi><hi rend="italic">aureus,</hi> is found in
                    southern Russia, Greece, and Turkey. There are at least four species of fox
                    :—the <hi rend="italic">Canis vulpes,</hi> well-known in western, central, and
                    northern Europe; the <hi rend="italic">Canis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >melanogaster,</hi> orblack-bellied fox,familiar in Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia;
                    the <hi rend="italic">Canis</hi><hi rend="italic">lagopus,</hi> arctic or blue

                    rend="italic">corsac,</hi> whose large packs make incursions from Tartary as far
                    west as the Volga. The civet is found in France and Spain. Of the five or six
                    species which represent the cat tribe, or genus <hi rend="italic">Felis,</hi>
                    even the most widely diffused, the <hi rend="italic">Felis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lynx</hi> or common lynx, is growing scarce in all except the more mountainous
                    regions; and the <hi rend="italic">Felis</hi><hi rend="italic">borealis</hi> or
                    northern lynx is familiar only in Norway and Sweden. In spite of the keen
                    pursuit to which they are subjected the seals may still be seen, though in much
                    diminished numbers, on the shores of all European seas, including the Baltic and
                    the Caspian. The Caspian species belongs to the same genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(fjallocephalus</hi> of Dr Gray) with those of the Arctic Ocean, which probably
                    indicates that the connexion between these two habitats was more recent than the
                    connexion between the Caspian and the Mediterranean, It is doubtful whether we
                    should include the walrus in the list of European fauna, though it is common
                    about Spitzbergen, and occasionally appears pretty far south. The next animal
                    which presents itself in the ordinary system of classification is one of the
                    most interesting, on account of its rapid disappearance before the march of
                    civilization. The natural limits of the beaver were between 33° and 67° N. lat.,
                    and within that area it was formerly present in great numbers. On the coasts of
                    the Black Sea, where it was abundant in the beginning of the Christian era, it
                    is no longer to be found, and it is about 500 years since it disappeared from
                    England. Its present habitats are mainly in Poland, Russia, Sweden, Finland, and
                    Lapland; though it still built its dams in the Moldau, the Neubach, the Landsee,
                    the Danube, and the Salzach in Austria, at least as late as 1866.<note

                    our geographical nomenclature in such names as Biberach, Bibersburg, and
                    Beverley. The genus Λmcofα, or water-vole, is represented by about ten or eleven
                    species, some of which are very widely distributed, while others are limited to
                    very small areas— <hi rend="italic                     smallcaps"> ∖</hi><hi

                    notoriety belongs to the members of the genus <hi rend="italic">Lemmus</hi> on
                    account of their strange migrations and the destructive effects of their visits.
                    There are three or four species, the best known of which is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lemmus norwegicus,</hi> or Norwegian lemming. Equally notorious
                    for their destructive capabilities, and much more general in their distribution,
                    are the rats and mice, which constitute the next natural order. The most
                    prevalent species, the <hi rend="italic">Mus decumanus,</hi> or common brown
                    rat, was first observed in Europe in 1727, but since then has taken possession
                    of country after country and expelled several weaker congeners. Nine species are
                    described, including the well-known house mouse, or <hi rend="italic">Mus
                    musculus,</hi> and a special Iceland variety. The common hamsters, distinguished
                    by their provident preparation for the winter, are found in Poland, Silesia,
                    Belgium, and Alsace; and two cognate species occur in southern Russia. The same
                    region presents three species of <hi rend="italic">Dipus,</hi> or jerboas. The
                    next genus is almost peculiar to the “European” sub-region: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spalax typhlus,</hi> perhaps the only species, being confined to southern
                    Russia, Hungary, Moldavia, Greece, and western Asia. The bobak <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Arctomys bobak)</hi> inhabits Bukovina and the southern parts of Poland and
                    Russia; the marmot, <hi rend="italic">A rctomys</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >marmotta,</hi> is restricted to the snowy regions of the Alps; and the <hi

                    South Russia. One species of squirrel, the <hi rend="italic">Sciurus</hi><hi

                    and another, <hi rend="italic">Sciurus</hi><hi rend="italic">alpinus,</hi>
                    belongs to the Alps and the Pyrenees. The flying squirrel, <hi rend="italic"

                    Spain. Hares and rabbits, which form the genus <hi rend="italic">Lepus,</hi>
                    have a very wide range, and present but little variety. The distribution of
                    species, however, is peculiar,—the common rabbit, for example, being abundant in
                    England, France, and Spain, but absent from Silesia, Galicia, and Russia, and a
                    large part of Italy. The Ruminantia have suffered even more than the larger

                    <hi rend="italic">Dos</hi><hi rend="italic">scoticus</hi> exists in a half-tame
                    condition in a few parks in England and Scotland; the ibex or steinbock is
                    growing scarce in the Alps and Carpathians; and the musmon or wild sheep is only
                    to be met with in Sardinia and Corsica, part of Spain, and some of the Greek
                    islands. The chamois, however, is still fairly common in the Alps of
                    Switzerland, France, and Germany, in the Apennines and the Carpathians, and also
                    in Greece. The only proper antelope, <hi rend="italic">Antilope</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">saiga,</hi> occurs but rarely in the country to the north of the
                    Black Sea. Fallow deer are found wild in Spain and Sardinia, but elsewhere are
                    protected by man. The elk is still to be met with in Lithuania, Russia, and
                    Scandinavia; the red deer in Scotland, Scandinavia, Germany, and Spain; and the
                    roebuck <hi rend="italic">(Cervus capreolus')</hi> in the Scottish Highlands,
                    the Apennines, the Carpathians, and the Sierra de Sogura. Of the great
                    Pachydermatous order, which has left such abundant remains of its hippopotami,
                    elephants, and woolly rhinoceroses in our Pleistocene formations, the only
                    representative in a feral condition is the wild bear, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sus</hi><hi rend="italic">scrofa,</hi> which is found in various regions from
                    Spain to the Caucasus, but does not venture north of the Baltic. The larger
                    Cetacea are growing scarce in the European seas; but the common whale, <hi
                    rend="italic">Baloena</hi><hi rend="italic">rnysticetus,</hi> still comes as far
                    south as the Mediterranean; and the spermaceti and the rorqual are captured in
                    the northern regions. The dolphins, grampuses, and porpoises are pretty commonly
                    represented throughout the various seas, now by one species now by another.</p>
                <p>How rich the avifauna of the European continent really is may be judged by
                    consulting such noble monographs as those of Gould, Sharpe and Dresser, or Bree;
                    but it must be borne in mind that it is a variable quantity, and that no
                    monographs can long represent the exact state of the case. The extinction or
                    introduction of mammalian species is easily observed; but the continual
                    movements of the feathered tribes are less easily ascertained. This has been
                    clearly shown by C. A. Westerland in his account of the geographical
                    distribution of the birds in Sweden and Norway. He gives a great many data which
                    prove that southern species not unfrequently move northwards, and that there is
                    a regular tendency of Asiatic and European birds to migrate to the west; while
                    on the other hand it is well known that western winds bring American strangers
                    to our shores. The <hi rend="italic">Muscicapa albicollis</hi> has been
                    denizened in Gothland for no more than thirty years; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alauda cristata,</hi> first observed in 1833, now regularly breeds in Scania.

                    summers in Lapland. Similar facts might be quoted for country after country and
                    district after district. The jackdaw began to build in Murcia in Spain about
                    1850, and it is now one of the commonest species; in Thuringia the magpie, once
                    abundant, is growing rapidly scarce. Altogether, according to Degland and
                    Gerbe’s classification, there are 247 genera and 531 species more or less
                    belonging to the continent; but of these hardly one or two are peculiarly its
                    own. As characteristic of <pb break="no"

                    is the largest of European birds; it is found in gradually diminishing numbers
                    in the French and Swiss Alps, the Ligurian mountains, the Caucasus, and perhaps
                    the Pyrenees. <hi rend="italic">Vultιιr</hi><hi rend="italic">monachus</hi><hi

                    of the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the Grampians, and on the treeless steppes of
                    Russia. Next in size comeβ the imperial eagle, which belongs to the south of the
                    continent; and then follows a list of lesser eagles, hawks, buzzards, kites,
                    &amp;c., to the number of forty species more or less, the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Falco</hi> alone being represented by eleven. The owl family,
                    Strigidae, counts ten species, noblest of which is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bubo</hi><hi rend="italic">maximus,</hi> the eagle-owl, or grand due of the
                    French, almost rivalling the golden eagle in size; it is found not only in the
                    French mountains, but in Switzerland, Italy, Sicily, Bessarabia, and the Crimea.
                    The passerine order is represented by a great variety of genera and speeies,
                    many of which have a wide range, and are known by the most familiar names in all
                    the countries of the continent. In direct economic importance the first place is
                    held by the gallinaceous order, the Grallatores, and the Palmipedes, which
                    furnish all the species that are distinguished as game, and a great many others
                    that are largely used as food. A few of the smaller birds are thus appropriated
                    in special districts: the lark, for example, is caught in great numbers in the
                    neighbourhood of Halle and Leipsic, and the blackbird shares a similar fate in
                    Corsica.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See also

                <p>From its mountain-lakes to the surrounding ocean the waters of Europe are for the
                    most part well stocked with fish. No complete summation has been made of the
                    number of genera and species represented; but it is suggestive of no small
                    variety to learn that thirty-five species have been found in the lakes of Tyrol
                    alone, lying between 2000 and 8000 feet above the level of the sea. A
                    considerable proportion of the genera are cosmopolitan, and a still greater
                    number range over wide areas outside of Europe. As peculiar to his “European”
                    sub-region, Mr Wallace mentions two genera of the perch family—the Λs∕)ro, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Percarina</hi> of the Dniester. Among characteristic forms
                    are the stickleback <hi rend="italic">(G asterosteus),</hi> found as far south
                    as Italy; the pike <hi rend="italic">(Esox),</hi> which ranges from Lapland to
                    Turkey; the <hi rend="italic">Silurus</hi><hi rend="italic">οi</hi> the Swiss
                    lakes and German rivers; and several members of the carp family or Cyprinidae,
                    including the carp proper <hi rend="italic">(Cyprinus),</hi> the roach, tench,
                    bream, bleak, &lt;kc. Of much more practical importance are the Salmonidae,
                    among which the salmon holds the first place. This noble fish is found in all
                    the rivers of the Atlantic versant as far south as the Loire, and especially in
                    Scotland, Norway, and Iceland it proves an abundant source of wealth. In
                    southern Russia, where the riverfisheries attain a development unknown in any
                    other part of Europe, its place is supplied by the sturgeon, the sterlet, and
                    the sevruga, and economically at least by several species belonging to the perch
                    family, which hold an important position in virtue of their abundance. The
                    greatest sea fisheries of Europe are those of the German Ocean, from which
                    England, Scotland, Norway, Holland, and France have long reaped magnificent
                    harvests, and in which Germany has more recently begun to share. The value of
                    the sea fish exported from Britain, Norway, and Holland is about £4,000,000 per
                    annum. It is needless to mention the names of the principal species—herring,
                    cod, &lt;fcc.; and the conger-eels of the Channel islands, the pilchards of the
                    Cornish coast, and the sardines of France are almost as familiarly known. In the
                    Baltic there is great abundance of various smaller kinds of fish—more
                    particularly the sprat, the sardine, and several members of the perch family;
                    and some of the Salmonidae are of considerable economic importance. No less than
                    300,000 tons of sardines have been caught in a single year at the mouth of the
                    Dwina, and the Esthonians may almost be said to subsist on a fish which they
                    name the “kilka.” In the Mediterranean the tunny, the sardine, and the anchovy
                    give existence to the most extensive fisheries,—the first passing in enormous
                    shoals from the straits of Gibraltar eastward to the Black Sea, and skirting in
                    its passage the coasts of Sardinia, Naples, and Sicily. The people of Comacchio
                    on the Adriatic, to the number of 5000, are supported by the capture of the
                    mullet, the eel, and the “acquadella,” which enter their lagoons from the sea by
                    a canal, and are prevented from returning by an ingenious system of sluices and
                    water-gates. Among the minor animals of the European seas there are none except
                    the oyster that have the commercial importance of the trepang of the Eastern
                    archipelago; but several species of shellfish, urchins, and crustaceans are
                    extensively consumed. Oyster-beds are found on most of the Atlantic coasts, and
                    the artificial culture of the species has recently received a great development,
                    especially in France and England: the produce of Cancale and Granville in the
                    bay of St Michel, of Essex and Kent, of Ostend in Belgium, and Bohuslän in
                    Sweden are in high repute. The sponge and the coral fisheries of the
                    Mediterranean are both vigorously pursued, the former with most success in the
                    Aegean, and the latter on the coasts of Sardinia, Corsica, and Andalusia.<note

                <p>Insects do not play so conspicuous and ostentatious a part in Europe as in some
                    of the warmer regions of the globe; it is only in special localities or
                    exceptional seasons that their destructive or irritating influence becomes
                    formidable to man. There are not many towns like Fasano, where the· inhabitants
                    have in summer to leave their usual residences to the occupancy of flies; and if
                    the European horticulturist has a hard battle to fight with caterpillars,
                    earwigs, and wasps, he generally succeeds in gaining a fair crop after all. The
                    mosquito and the tarantula are the most venomous of those which attack the human
                    species. The locust, which spreads such alarm in Africa and Asia, appears in
                    western Europe only at intervals and in demoralized detachments; though in the
                    south of France it is found worth while to offer a reward for the collection of
                    the insects and their eggs. In Turkey, the Danubian principalities, and southern
                    Russia it sometimes commits tremendous ravages; and all efforts of the
                    agricultural population are futile to check the. advance of the countless
                    swarms. The year 1860 was unhappily distinguished by the severity of the attack.
                    But if insects play an inconspicuous, they by no means play a small part in the
                    European regions. In the northern sub-region, among the characteristic
                    Lepidoptera, are <hi rend="italic">Parnassius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Apoma,

                    >Curcidionidae</hi> are especially abundant. The Mediterranean sub-region has
                    two peculiar genera of butterflies— <hi rend="italic">Thais</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Doritis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Anthocharis</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Zegis</hi> are characteristic; of the Coleoptera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Carabidae, Copridae, Buprestidae, Canthamdae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Curculionidae</hi> are abundant. The three insects of greatest
                    economic importance are the silk-moth, the bee, and the cantharis. The
                    silk-worm, since its introduction in the 6th century, has become an important
                    object of cultivation in Italy, Turkey, Greece, Francs, Spain, and Portugal, and
                    has even proved remunerative in Prussia, Bavaria, aud central Russia; and
                    recently a new species from Japan, which feeds on the oak and not on the
                    mulberry, has been successfully reared in the Baltic provinces. Bee-keeping is
                    an extensive industry in Italy, France, Switzerland, Russia, and Sweden; and in
                    Greece the tax on bees furnishes &lt;£1600 to the revenue. The cantharis is a
                    native, not only of Spain, as its popular name of Spanish fly imports, but also
                    of France, Germany, Italy, Hungary, and South Russia, and even occurs in the
                    south of England. After the declaration of Mexican independence in 1820 the
                    cultivation of the cochineal insect was introduced into the Spanish province of
                    Granada with such success that no less than 801,915 tt&gt; of raw cochineal was
                    exported to England in 1850. The present generation has seen two very unwelcome
                    additions to the number of European insects the <hi rend="italic">1

                    >Doryphorus</hi><hi rend="italic">decemlineata</hi> or Colorado beetle, of which
                    the former has com pletely ruined a large proportion of the French vineyards and
                    the latter has threatened to play similar havoc with the potato crop.</p>
                <p>The horse holds the first place among the domestic animals of Europe, and in no
                    other region has it developed a greater variety of type. Whether the present
                    species is of European origin has not been quite decided; but remains of a
                    similar form occur in the Pliocene and Pleistocene strata, and it is evident
                    that the prehistoric peoples set the example of that hippophagy which scarcity
                    of animal food has again introduced into Europe. Now at least there are no wild
                    horses on the continent, though they are mentioned as late as the 8th century in
                    a letter of Pope Gregory to Boniface.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Horse-breeding is a highly important industry in almost all countries, and in
                    several, as Russia, France, Hungary, and Spain, the state gives it exceptional
                    support. Those which have the greatest export trade are Russia, Denmark,
                    Austria-Hungary, Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The Hungarians are a
                    specially horse-loving people, counting in 1871 no fewer than 141 horses to the
                    thousand inhabitants, instead of 67 as in Austria. Almost every district of the
                    continent has a breed of its own: Russia reckons those of the Bashkirs, the
                    Calmucks, the Don-Cossacks, the Esthonians, and the Finlanders as among its
                    best; France sets store by those of Flanders, Picardy, Normandy, Limousin, and
                    Auvergne; Germany by those of Hanover, Oldenburg, and Mecklenburg, which indeed
                    rank among the most powerful in the world; and Great Britain by those of Suffolk
                    and Clydesdale. The English racers are famous throughout the world, and Iceland
                    and the Shetland Islands are well known for their hardy breed of diminutive
                    ponies. The ass and the mule are most abundant in the southern parts of the
                    continent, more especially in Spain and Italy. In the one country they number
                    about 2,320,000, and in the other about 1,000,000. The camel is not popularly
                    considered a European animal; but it is reared in Russia in the provinces of
                    Orenburg, Astrakhan, and Taurid, in Turkey on the Lower Danube, and in Spain at
                    Madrid and Cadiz; and it has even been introduced into Tuscany. One of the
                    strangest sights of southern Russia to a traveller from the west is the huge
                    ungainly creature yoked to what is practically a toy cart. A much more important
                    beast of burden in eastern and southern Europe is the ox: the long lines of
                    slow-moving wains in Roumania, for example, are not unlike what one would expect
                    in Cape Colony. In western Europe it is mainly used for the plough or fattened
                    for its flesh. The Netherlands, Denmark, Servia, Roumania, Turkey, Russia,
                    Italy, Sweden, Spain, and Germany are all exporters of cattle; and all the other
                    countries are more or less engaged in cattle-breeding for their own demands. It
                    is estimated that there are about 100 distinct local varieties or breeds in
                    Europe, and within the last hundred years an enormous advance has been made in
                    the development and specialization of the finer types. The cows of Switzerland
                    and of Guernsey may be taken as the two extremes in point of size, and the
                    “Durhams” and “Devonsliires” of England as examples of the results of human
                    supervision and control. The Dutch breed ranks very high in the production of
                    milk <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi>. The buffalo is frequent in the south of
                    Europe, more especially in Transylvania and Italy; in the former country the
                    number is about 58,000, and in the latter about 40,000. Great attention is given
                    to dairy-farming in Great Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark,
                    Austria, and part of Italy. Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark,
                    Ireland, and Finland are exporters of cheese or <pb break="no"

                    so-called Parmesan cheese, requires a large import, and the abundance of olive
                    oil discourages the manufacture of butter. Sheep are of immense economic value
                    to most European countries, and form an important article of export for the
                    Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Russia, Italy, Portugal, Denmark,
                    Servia, Roumania, and Sweden. The local varieties are eveu more numerous than in
                    the case of the horned cattle, and the development of remarkable breeds quite as
                    wonderful. In all the more mountainous countries the goat is abundant,
                    especially in Spain, Italy, and Germany. The swine is distributed throughout the
                    whole continent, but in no district does it take so high a placeas in Servia,
                    where there are no fewer than 1062 to 1000 inhabitants, a proportion which more
                    than doubles the next highest, which is afforded by Luxembourg. Spain ranks
                    third in the list, and has a large export of hams and sausages. In the rearing
                    and management of poultry France is the first country in Europe, and has
                    consequently a large surplus of both fowls and eggs. The latter produce is also
                    exported by Austria and Spain. In Pυm-merania, Brandenburg, West Prussia,
                    Mecklenburg, and Würtemberg, the breeding of geese has become a great source of
                    wealth, and the town of Strasburg is famous all the world over for its <hi

                <p>Ethnology is still in its infancy, painfully learning its first principles, and
                    gradually discovering true methods of verifying its data and generalizing their
                    teachings. There is such a thing as race; but we cannot be said to have attained
                    to any single test or any combination of tests which does not leave our
                    classifications more or less uncertain. We can ascertain whether the majority of
                    a given people have dark hair or light, whether they are dolichocephalic,
                    mesocephalic, or brachycephalic, or exhibit several varieties of skull; but it
                    has still to be proved how far such characteristics are permanent, and as
                    permanent available for our purpose. Europe in .every square mile of its surface
                    gives the lie to the supposition that consanguinity is implied by community of
                    speech: Celts are equally eloquent in English and French; Slavonians equally
                    enthusiastic for the dignity of Deutschland or the glory of Greece.<note

                    only two peoples in Europe of whom we can be said to have anything like
                    ethnological statistics, the Jews and the Gipsies; and in both cases it is due
                    to the fact that they have so long been treated as social or religious pariahs.
                    It is easy to ascertain how many men in Europe use French as their
                    mother-tongue; but we have no meaus, apart from historic evidence, which applies
                    only to individual instances, of knowing whether three generations back any
                    man’s progenitor was a Corsican, a German, or a Breton. And if there is one fact
                    to which every new investigation gives additional emphasis it is this, that
                    there is no nationality, and no individual component of a nationality, which can
                    establish the purity of its blood. What to the superficial observer are the most
                    homogeneous peoples turn out on closer examination to be only conglomerates in
                    which the elements are better assimilated. In Wurtemberg, for example, as is
                    shown by H. v. Holder, the so-called German population is composed of Romans,
                    Vindelicians, Rhaetians, Avars, Hungarians, Slaves, Swiss, Swedes and others
                    introduced during the Thirty A ears’ War, Waldensians, Tyrolese, and Jews.<note

                    are more or less obviously conglomerates, the materials have probably been
                    derived for the most part from strata of the same formation. If the Frenchman is
                    partly German, partly Celtic, German and Celt do not differ from each other more
                    than limestone, marble, and chalk.</p>
                <p>From recent researches it is now familiarly known that Europe had its human

                    Palaeolithic or Old Stone people, in contrast to a later population still in the
                    same stage of civilization. Their remains have been discovered in England,
                    Belgium, France, Germany, and Switzerland; and some investigators are disposed
                    to recognize two varieties, distinguished as the men of the caves and the men of

                    glacial period, they were certainly there at the final transition to the present
                    conditions of climate. They lived by hunting and fishing, and in general
                    characteristics appear to have been similar to the Eskimo, with whom some are
                    disposed to identify them. If this identification be a mistake (and at best it
                    is very problematical), they have left no distinct representatives behind them.
                    What progress they had made in the arts, necessitated by their mode of life, may
                    be in some measure estimated by the remarkable relics of their implements and
                    weapons still recognizable; but there are no sufficient data to decide whether
                    they were in astate of advance or decline; the difference of finish in different
                    specimens of the same handiwork may be due to different degrees of care or skill
                    possessed by contemporaneous workmen. As far as can be judged, the continent of
                    Europe again ceased for a time to be a human habitation; and when light breaks
                    in once more it is found in possession apparently of two races both in the Stone
                    stage of civilization, and known by the common name of the Neolithic or New
                    Stone peoples. In the meantime the fauna of Europe had changed and become in the
                    main what it still is. The chief point of interest attaching to these
                    Neolithians is how far the brachycephalic, and presumably the older, variety is
                    still traceable in our modern population.</p>
                <p>There are several peoples, most of them of small numerical importance, which are
                    undoubtedly aliens from the commonwealth of the Aryan race now dominant
                    throughout the greater part of the continent,—the Turks, the Magyars, the Finns,
                    Esthonians, and Lapps, the Votiaks, and the Basques; and we know that in the
                    Roman period of the historic epoch the Iberians, the Ligurians, and possibly the
                    Etruscans and the Rhaetians, occupied a similar position. The Turks and the
                    Magyars are at once put out of the question by the fact that there is
                    documentary evidence of their arrival in Europe long after the Christian era;
                    and the dubiety which attaches to the affinity of the Etruscans and the
                    Rhaetians renders their classification impracticable. The Votiaks may be left
                    out of account, from their almost Asiatic localization; so that there only
                    remain four actual and two historical peoples to be considered. Three of the
                    four—the Finns, Esthonians, and the Lapps —may be bracketed together as Ugrians
                    or Uralians^ or under any other convenient name (though the Lapps may possibly
                    be more distinct than this would make them), so that practically we have two
                    actual and two historical. Arranged geographically, the Ugrians constitute a
                    northeastern or Baltic group; and the Basques, the Iberians, and the Ligurians a
                    southern or Mediterranean group. Of the Ligurians little further is certainly
                    known than that in historic times they occupied the north-western slopes of the
                    Apennines, or the modern Piedmont, and extended west to the mouth of the Rhone;
                    but probable traces of their presence have been collected as far south as the
                    mouth of the Tiber and as far north as the Loire or Liger. Of their language we
                    are absolutely ignorant, and their classification is almost purely hypothetical.
                    They evidently lost ground at a very early period from the encroachments of
                    various peoples, and among others from the inroads of the Iberians, whom we have
                    now to consider. This people is specially connected with the Spanish peninsula,
                    which derived from them the popular name of Iberia; but they appear also to have
                    occupied Sardinia, Corsica, and Sicily, may possibly, as some maintain, have
                    been one of the primitive elements of the population of Italy, and, according to
                    a hint of Tacitus, probably extended as far north as Brittany. At the time of
                    the Roman conquest of Spain they were already largely mingled with Celtic blood,
                    a fact which was indicated by the name of Celtiberians. There is no reason to
                    suppose that they have died out or been exterminated, and consequently it is
                    presumably possible to discover them more or less distinctly among the mingled
                    population of modern Spain. Here the Basques at once present themselves, a
                    peculiar people speaking a peculiar language, and occupying the very part of the
                    country where from analogy we might expect to find the remains of an ancient
                    race. In what respect do the Basques agree with our knowledge about the
                    Iberians? The Iberians, as has just been stated, were no longer homogeneous at
                    the time of the Roman conquest; and the Basques, according to cranial data,
                    exhibit an interfusion of blood: “they possess a moderate brachycephalism and a
                    strongly marked dolichocephaliam.” The Iberians, however, were clearly
                    distinguishable from the Celts; and the same is true of the Basques. The
                    Iberians are described as of short stature, slight build, and dark complexion;
                    and a similar account may be given of the Basques. The identification of the two
                    peoples is consequently accepted by a large number of anthropologists; but the
                    unanimity is hardly so great in regard to their further identification with the
                    Ugrians of the north-east. In favour of the generalization, there is a certain
                    similarity of physical type, and the probability, as it appears to a large
                    school of investigators, that the Finns and Esthonians are, like the Basques,
                    the remains of a population which formerly extended to the south and west over a
                    much wider area; against the generalization is the fact that no closer connexion
                    lies between the Basque language and the Finnish than that they both belong to
                    the agglutinative family, and it is quite as probable that the Ugrians have come
                    in from the north and east at a com paratively modern period. If we adopt the
                    bolder hypothesis in its full extent, and it is adopted by many investigators,
                    the continent of Europe was originally inhabited by a small, swarthy,
                    brachycephalic race, who were formerly represented in historic times by
                    Iberians, Ligurians, and other less known peoples, and in modern times are still
                    partially represented by the Basques, the Esthonians, and the Finns, who have
                    retained their nonAryan speech, and by smaller groups in England, Brittany,
                    Prussia, and Spain, who have adopted the alien languages spoken in their
                    vicinity. By some a still further identification is ventured with the Berbers of
                    North Africa; and a few, as Hyde Clarke and Homalius d’Hulloy, maintain that the
                    so-called Aryan immigration was only in a comparatively small degree an
                    introduction of a new race, and ought rather to be viewed as the diffusion of a
                    civilization. Whatever dispute, however, such ethnological innovators may raise,
                    there can be no question as to the almost universal predominance of the Aryan
                    influences in the historic times; and though anything like chronology is for the
                    most part out of the question, the general features of the great movement to
                    which these influences are due can be stated with <pb break="no"

                    detachments are easily distinguished, and may for convenience be designated by
                    the very imperfect and somewhat misleading names of the Graeco-Latin or
                    Southern, the Celtic or Central, the Teutonic or Northern, and the Slavonic or
                    North-Eastern. Whether the Southern or the Celtic was the first of the two to
                    enter Europe is altogether unknown: one offshoot from a common stock may easily
                    maintain a nomadic or semi-nomadic state for a longer time than another and a
                    later offshoot. The southern detachment was probably a succession of
                    detachments,—the first represented, it may be, by the old progenitors of the
                    Albanians and the so-called Pelasgic tribes, the second by the various tribes
                    who settled in Italy, and the third by the Hellenic or Greek tribes. The Greeks
                    at least appear to have entered Europe by way of Asia Minor and the Archipelago,
                    and the Italian tribes may have followed a similar route. A more northern line
                    of march, or nomadic progress, was chosen by the Celts, of whose passage up the
                    valley of the Danube we have a trace in the Bυii, the Celtic people who have
                    given their name to the now Germanized kingdom of Bavaria. If the opinion of

                    the empire. The Slavonians have never advanced much beyond the Elbe in the
                    north, but towards the south they extended in the course of the 9th and 1 Oth
                    centuries into Austria on the one hand and Greece on the other. Of the Semitic
                    peoples, the Jews, which are now the most important, have entered in successive
                    detach ments, more in the fashion of ordinary immigrants; the Arabs, who
                    contributed largely to the progress of European civilization, but have left
                    little trace of their blood except in southern Spain, crossed into that country
                    in 710. The settlement of the Hungarians dates from the 10th century, and that
                    of the Ottoman Turks, the last great addition to the ethnological conglomerate
                    of Europe, dates no further back than the 14th.</p>

                    classification will probably be always impossible, and certainly cannot be

                <p>From this conspectus it appears that there are still about 60 distinct languages
                    spoken in Europe, without including Latin, Greek, Old Slavonic, and Hebrew,
                    which are still used in literature or ecclesiastical liturgies. <hi
                    rend="subscript"> β</hi> Besides, as we shall presently see, all those which are
                    spoken over extensive territories, and some even which are confined within very
                    narrow limits, are broken up into several distinct dialects. Most of the number,
                    however, are destined to disappear within a comparatively short period, before
                    the encroachments of the few which are especially favoured by political
                    circumstances and literary culture. The process is rapidly going on, and
                    everything tends to its acceleration. Some, indeed, whose doom appeared almost
                    sealed in the end of last century, have gathered fresh life and repulsed the
                    intrusive language by which their existence was threatened; and on others a
                    temporary and melancholy restoration has been inflicted by the mistaken
                    enthusiasm of a patriotic minority. English, French, German, Russian, Italian,
                    and Spanish will probably for a long time share the real dominion of Europe;
                    Dutch and the Scandinavian tongues will maintain their ground, but they hardly
                    give promise of expansion: Bohemian, Hungarian, and the South-Slavonic have made
                    good their position; and Neo Hellenic, under favouring circumstances, may get
                    possession of the territory of its nobler ancestor.</p>
                <p>Greek and Latin may fairly claim the first place in a historic sketch, on account
                    of the immense and varied influence they have exerted, directly or indirectly,
                    on the popular and literary language t&gt;f all the prominent peoples of Europe.
                    The former, which is preserved in what is at once the most perfect and the most
                    multiform of the older literatures of the world, was spoken wherever a Greek
                    city wβs established in Asia, Europe, or Africa. It had several well-marked
                    phonetic dialects:—the Aeolic, represented in Europe by the Boeotian variety;
                    the Doric, employed in Sparta and most of the other Peloponnesian states, as
                    well as in other colonies of Sicily and Southern Italy; and the Ionic, which in
                    the Attic dialect attained its noblest development, and became the principal
                    literary form. A nιde dialect of the Aeolian type was spoken in Thessaly; and in
                    several districts of northern Greece other varieties must have had their home,
                    some of them probably so divergent from the more cultured dialects as to be
                    unrecognizable by the rough and ready philology of the ancient Greeks. After the
                    extension of the political power of the Hellenic race by the Hellenized
                    Macedonians the Attic dialect became in a necessarily modified guise the
                    language of at least the educated classes over a wide foreign area. Tins <hi
                    rend="italic">κaιrη διaKeκτos,</hi> or common dialect as it was called, was that
                    in which all the Christian Scriptures were, if not originally penned, at least
                    most potently disseminated; and some time after the establishment of the seat of
                    the empire at Constantinople it was adopted as the official language of Eastern
                    Europe, and developed or degenerated into what is distinguished as Byzantine
                    Greek. Amid all the linguistic confusion of mediaeval and modern times in the
                    Balkan peninsula th · old Hellenic speech maintained a precarious and degraded
                    life in the so-called Romaic of the Greek people, still recognizable to the
                    philologist, but to the vulgar ear and eye very successfully disguised. It is
                    still spoken, not only in the modern kingdom of Greece, but in Thessaly and
                    other part’s of Turkey along the coasts of the Aegean and the Sea of Marmora,
                    and in the Greek settlements of southern Russia. Since the declaration of
                    national independence an attempt has been made to go back to something liker the
                    language of Xenophon; but as yet the Neo-Hellenic is almost purely a literary
                    form, unintelligible to the great bulk of the people in the country. At best it
                    is only a compromise between ancient Greek and Romaic, neither conforming to the
                    classical standard of the one nor systematically accepting the grammatical
                    changes developed in the other. As education advances,—and it is advancing
                    rapidly under the control of the central administration,—it will probably take
                    root among the people, and under the vivifying influences of national life grow
                    up into a national speech. The ancient common dialect is still used in the
                    liturgical services of the Oriental Church. The alphabet has been employed by
                    several communities in the Turkish empire for their Turkish dialects,—among
                    others by the people of Mariupol.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Latin was only one of a number of closely related languages domiciled in the
                    peninsula of the Apennines, and by several of these it was affected much in the
                    same way in which English is affected by German or French. Most of the number
                    have left neither literature nor history behind them, but they must still be
                    differentiating factors in the dialects of modern Italy. Oscan, which was spoken
                    in a large part of the country south of Rome, and Umbrian, which takes its name
                    from a district to the north, are both known to us from inscriptions,—the latter
                    by the remarkable liturgical series called the Eugubine Tables. The Latin
                    language kept pace with the extension of the Roman empire till it came into
                    contact with the higher culture of Greece and the East; as an aggressive
                    language it has no historic parallel, forthough the area of English has advanced
                    as rapidly in modern times, this advance has mainly found place where
                    English-speaking people have outnumbered the foreign elements in the population.
                    It continued to be the language of nearly all European literature for centuries
                    after it had ceased to be a spoken speech; and it was the language of all
                    learned literature well on in the 17th century. It is still used in the
                    liturgy-of the Roman Catholic Church, and still forms the most potent lin
                    guistic element in all European education. Its alphabet is more widely employed
                    than any other in Europe, and is at the present moment gaining ground against
                    the “Gothic” characters of modern Germany, as it &lt;lid in early ages against
                    the Saxon characters in England.</p>
                <p>Gf the languages which have sprung from Latin, French resembles it most in its
                    fortunes, though not in its forms. It is the official, literary, and educational
                    language of the country whose name it bears, and is daily becoming more and more
                    the popular language as well. Based as it is on the old <hi rend="italic">langue
                    d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">oil</hi> of the north, it has gained the superiority
                    over the dialects of Burgundy, Picardy, and Normandy, and the more cultured
                    Provençal of the south, has already reduced them to the rank of mere patois, and
                    is gradually diminishing even their local importance. On the north-west it is
                    more slowly displacing the Breton, and in the south making inroads on the
                    Basque. It was nearly naturalized among a large part of the inhabitants of
                    Alsace-Lorraine, and is still spoken by upwards of 200,000 of the new citizens
                    of the German empire. In Switzerland it is the mother tongue of about 600,000
                    people, being dominant in Neufchatel, Geneva, and Vaud, and sharing the ground
                    with German in Freiburg, Valais, and Bern. In Belgium it is the principal speech
                    of the educated classes. No European language has had such an extensive foreign
                    history within the continent. Not only was the closely related Norman French
                    introduced into England in the 11th century, with such striking effect on the
                    English vocabulary, but at several subsequent periods literary French has been
                    potently at work. In the decadent period of German literature it largely
                    supplemented the German language among the upper classes, and for a time
                    furnished a large proportion of his vocabulary to the nominal writer of German.
                    In Russia there was a similar French period about the beginning of the 18th
                    century, which has left its influence to this day on the official publications
                    of the Government. And in spite of the growing claims of German and English,
                    French is still acquired by a greater number of foreigners t⅛an any other modern
                    tongue.</p>
                <p>The language usually known as Italian is not so much the national language of
                    Italy as the language of a special district. The other dialects have not sunk to
                    the level of patois; and at the present moment it is a matter of keen debate
                    what is to be considered the true standard for the people at large. From Venice
                    to Palermo there is a rich variety of forms which lιave received more or less of
                    literary culture; and the pretensions of Florence to be the sole and final
                    arbitress are far from being, unanimously admitted. Whatever position be
                    assigned to Tuscan as the language of education, it will be a long time before
                    it attain the predominance in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n730/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0730-0701"/> Italy which French possesses in France. The
                    dialects are usually divided into three main groups :—those of Upper Italy,
                    including Genoese, Piedmontese, Venetian, Aemilian, and Lombard; those of
                    Central Italy, including Tuscan, Roman, and Corsican; those of Southern Italy,
                    including Neapolitan, Calabrian, Sicilian, and Sardinian. From Italian the other
                    peoples of Europe have borrowed many terms for artistic technicalities, but
                    comparatively little which belongs to everyday life.</p>
                <p>Literary Spanish or Castilian is in much the same position as literary Italian,
                    with this difference, that its literary precedence is more definitely
                    established. A large area is still occupied by Catalonian or Catalan, both in
                    Catalonia proper, in Valencia, and in Majorca; and the speech of the Galicians
                    is much more akin to Portuguese. In Catalouia rich and poor, citizens and
                    peasants, speak the provincial language; in Valencia and Majorca only the
                    cultivated classes employ Castilian. On the whole, however, the Castilian
                    territory is on the increase, and it is making its most rapid acquisitions from
                    the Galician and Basque.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    name, but is used by a considerable population in Servia, Hungary, Transylvania,
                    Bukovina, Bessarabia, Roumelia, Thessaly, and Albania. In Roumania it is the
                    object of increasing literary culture; and in spite of the foreign influences to
                    which it has been so long exposed, it d <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> es not
                    present much variety of dialect in the other districts.</p>
                <p>Of the Teutonic languages the Gothic furnishes the oldest literary monument—the
                    translation of the Scriptures by Ulphilas or Wulfila, who flourished in the
                    latter part of the 4th century; but it is totally extinct, and among the living
                    representatives of the branch the first place is due to what is popularly known
                    as German <hi rend="italic">par excellence,—</hi> that is, the modern literary
                    or cultured form of High German. This is usually dated from Luther’s translation
                    of the Bible, which marks the transition from the “Middle” to the “New” period.
                    It is not only the recognized speech of the various states of t⅛e German empire,
                    but cither in its cultured shape or in tributary dialects it is spoken by about
                    9,000, OOOfpeople in Austria-Hungary, and by nearly 2,000,000 in Switzerland. It
                    has lost ground through the revival of Bohemian and Hungarian, but has gained on
                    all the minor linguistic enclaves. Along the frontier regions of Russia and
                    Poland it is partially retreating, partially advancing: Russia naturally
                    discourages the German element in the Baltic provinces, and Germany as naturally
                    the Polish element in Prussia. In both districts, German is the language of
                    higher education. Whatever repressive measures Russia may adopt, it can plead,
                    not only the example of Germany, but the fact that it is only attempting to
                    recover ground that has been lost by the Slavonic tongues. Slavonic names of
                    places occur as far west as Hanover, though the Germans frequently disguise or
                    destroy them. Where it meets the Italian frontier the Teutonic language is
                    retrogressive. Botzen in the end of last century was a border town of the German
                    area; it is now thoroughly Italianized; and even Meran, several miles up the
                    valley of the Adige, and 60 miles from the political frontier, is rapidly losing
                    its Teutonic character. That the movement has been in this direction for
                    centuries is clear; but it is doubtful whether the present German enclaves of
                    the Sette Communi and Tredici Communi were always insular, or arc to be taken as
                    proof that the Teutonic frontier formerly extended as far south as the
                    neighbourhood of Verona and Vicenza.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The territorial relations of the Scandinavian languages arc sufficiently
                    indicated by their names. They are nowhere aggressive, except where they come
                    into contact with Finnish and Lapp. All of them, even the Faroes«, have a
                    certain amount of literature; but three only, Danish, Swedish, and Icelandic,
                    are vigorously cultivated. Norway is mainly in&lt;lebted for its books to Sweden
                    and Denmark, and its language is slowly passing into a patois. Danish has
                    undergone the greatest changes from the old Norse type, and naturally from its
                    position has been most affected by foreign influences.</p>
                <p>Of the Low German group the Old Saxon, formerly spoken between the Rhine and the
                    Elbe, has left several remarkable literary monuments; and two or three of its
                    dialects, now bracketed together as Anglo-Saxon, furnished the basis of the
                    present English language, which, however, by its mere vocabulary has nearly as
                    much right t&lt;&gt; be considered a member of the Latin or Italic branch. The
                    only-modern representative of the group besides English which ranks as a
                    literary language is Dutch, which is spoken in Holland, and, under a slightly
                    modified form known as Flemish, in a large part of Belgium. Along the coast and
                    islands of the North Sea the current dialects, varying from district to district
                    in an almost exceptional manner, are remnants of the old Frisian tongue, whose
                    oldest written documents date from the 13th century; and the popular language of
                    the countries between the Rhine and Weser and the Weser and Elbe, where it is
                    not Dutch or Frisian, is Platt-Deutsch, which, while overshadowed by the High
                    German, has recently attained a certain literary position through the writings
                    of Fritz Reuter.</p>
                <p>The Celtic languages are all without exception decadent,—the most tenacious of
                    life being the Welsh and the Breton. The people who still retain them as their
                    mother tongues are becoming more and more accustomed to the simultaneous use of
                    the dominant languages around. The Welshman and the Scottish Highlander learn
                    English, the Breton French. Cornish died out last century, and left only a few
                    fragmentary texts; Irish is rapidly following it, but will be preserved in a
                    considerable literature; Welsh alone has a fairly vigorous literature at the
                    present time.</p>
                <p>According to Professor Zerfli, there are no less than seventeen Slavonic
                    dialects. The most important is Russian, or Great Russian, the national speech
                    of the empire whose name it bears. At present it is spoken by about 34,390,000
                    of the 65,705,000 of the total population; and its area is rapidly being
                    extended by the direct agency of the Government. In 1871 it was made the
                    official language of Poland, and rendered obligatory in all the law courts of
                    the country; and in 1876 it became practically the only permissible form in
                    Little Russia, where all popular literature and public notices in the local
                    language were prohibited. While it retains a rich inflexional system, Russian
                    has enriched its vocabulary by a large foreign element, from French, English,
                    and German; and its scientific terms are for'the most part those of Western
                    Europe. As a written language it is deeply indebted to the Church Slavonie.
                    Closely cognate is the Little Russian, or Ruthenian, already mentioned, which
                    ’Τι spoken by about 14,201,280 people in Russia and upwards of 3,000,000 in
                    Austria. Its Russian area includes Volhynia, Podolia, Kieff, Kherson,
                    Ekaterinoslaff, Kbarkoff, Poltava, Tchernigoff, Minsk, Grodno, and Lublin, as
                    well as portions of Astrakhan, the Don Cossack Country, Saratoff, and Voronezh;
                    in Austria it is mainly confined to Galicia. Possessing as it does a rich store
                    of popular tales and songs, and employed by several writers of great ability
                    during the present century <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, it ranks much higher
                    than the third Russian dialect—the White Russian—which is the current speech of
                    about 3,592,000 people, for the most part in Gro&lt;lno, Minsk, Mohileff, Vilna,
                    and Vitebsk, and is mainly distinguished by Lithuanian and Polish elements. 'Γhe
                    second place in the Slavonic group may be assigned to Polish, which in spite of
                    political disastersis still spoken by a large but scattered population. It is
                    estimated that there are 3,905,871 Poles in Russian Poland, 2,450,000 in
                    Prussia, 2,465,000 in Austria-Hungary, and 861,000 in European Russia. An
                    extensive and vigorous literature will preserve the language even if it pass, as
                    seems not improbable, altogether from the lips of men. Czech, or Tsekh, is the
                    national language of Bohemia, and is also largely spoken in Moravia and
                    north-western Hungary, where it is usually known by the names of Moravian and
                    Slovak. The differences between the dialects of the several countries are on the
                    whole comparatively slight; but as between Bohemian proper and Slovak, they are
                    sufficiently marked to lead some philologists to recognize the Slovak as a
                    separate language. There is a rich Bohemian literature which, dating from the
                    10th century, has after a long period of depression and threatened extinction
                    received a new development in modern times. Bulgarian is distributed throughout
                    European Turkey far beyond the district that bears the name of Bulgaria, and it
                    also appears in eastern Roumania an∣l south-western Russia. A very small
                    proportion of the people by whom it is used are of Slavonic blood; and it has
                    departed more than any other Slavonic language from the common type. Its
                    literature is almost exclusively modem, and would be of little moment were it
                    not for its possible value to a possible nation. A much higher Îiosition has
                    been attained by the Servo-Croatian, which is spoken &gt;y about 5,500,000
                    people, inServia, Bosnia, Montenegro, southern Hungary, Slavonia, Croatia,
                    Istria, and Dalmatia. Its dialects though numerous are so slightly
                    differentiated that with any one of them a traveller can make himself understood
                    by those accustomed to any other. It is usual to diride them into three groups—a
                    western or Istrian, a southern or Dalmatian, and an eastern or Servian. Even if
                    the political unification of the South Slavonians should never be realized, the
                    future of the Servo-Croatian is secured by the vigorous literary development
                    which is encouraged both at Agram and Belgrade. Unfortunately it is written and
                    printed in two alphabets —the Cyrillian being employed by the Servians and the
                    Latin by the Croatians. The remaining Slavonic tongues are of little practical
                    importance except to the philologist. The Wends are being rapidly Germanized,

                <p>The Lettie branch though decadent is interesting as linguistically the oldest of
                    the Aryan languages in Europe. The Lithuanians were in the Middle Ages one of
                    the most powerful peoples ot the Baltic re&lt;rion, but fell into a secondary
                    place by the incorporation of their country with Poland in 1386. Their language
                    is still retained by about 150,000 or 200,000 people in Germany, and by about
                    1,434,750 in Russia, where those of the western part of the government of Kovno
                    and the northern part of the government of Suwalki are known as Shomudes or
                    Samogitians. Two dialects are recognized—the High or Southern, and the Low or
                    Northern. The°Letts still number more than 1,000,000, situated in Courland,
                    Livonia, and Vitebsk. Old Prussian, extinct two hundred years ago, was very
                    similar to Lithuanian. With regard to the two languages marked in the table as
                    “unattached,” almost nothing is known of Old Dacian, and the history of Albanian
                    is but partially elucidated. The Skipitars, Amauts, or Albanians are one of the
                    most remarkable peoples of south-eastern Europe. They not only occupy Albania
                    proper, but also appear in considerable numbers throughout the rest of European
                    Turkey and Greece, —forming, it is calculated, a total of 1,500,000. The
                    colonies which settled in Italy and Sicily, though amounting to nearly 90,000,
                    have given up their native language. Hahn, who was the first to make a thorough
                    investigation of the subject, distinguishes two dialects —theToskan andthe
                    Gegian,—-which are as distinct as High German and Platt-Deutsch. Besides the
                    Greek alphabet another of dubious origin is also employed.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The Semitic languages are mere exotics in modern Europe. Hebrew, the most widely
                    distributed, is little more than the ecclesiastical language of the Jews, who
                    for the most part employ the common language of the country in which they reside
                    not only in public intercourse but also in privatq. At the same time it is
                    regularly taught in their schools, furnishes them with a number of familiar
                    every-day expressions, and is not only the language of the professional
                    literature of theologians, but appears in frequent quotations in their popular
                    periodicals. Arabic, at one time the dominant language not only of southern
                    Spain but of Sicily and part of Italy, is nowhere the usual speech of any
                    European community; but it is familiar to the educated classes of Turkey.
                    Maltese can still be recognized as of Arabic derivation, but has incorporated a
                    vast mass of foreign words. Mosarabic has been extinct at least since the 18th
                    century: the liturgical service in the cathedral of Toledo, which still bears
                    the name, is performed in Latin.</p>
                <p>The most important of the Finno-Tataric languages are the Turkish, the Hungarian,
                    and the Finnish. The first varies greatly in its vocabulary in different places
                    and grades of society; and the official form is largely composed of Arabic
                    words. As a popular speech in Europe it has a very limited and discontinuous
                    area. Hungarian, on the other hand, has maintained or recovered a remarkable
                    degree of homogeneousnese, and occupies on the whole a very compact territory in
                    spite of the intrusion of German; while its literature ranks as one of the most
                    vigorous of the secondary literatures of Europe. Finnish proper is spoken by
                    1,710,274 people in the Russian empire (of whom 1,615,613 are in the duchy of
                    Finland), and by 14,930 in Sweden and 7637 in Norway; while the closely cognate
                    Karelian numbers 303,277 in Russia. The Tchudes, Vepses, and Votes, who amount
                    to 48,000 in all, live in the governments ofθlonetz, Vologda, Novgorod, and St
                    Petersburg, in the neighbourhood of Lakes Ladoga and Onega. Their languages or
                    dialects are very similar to Esthonian, which, with the exception of Hungarian,
                    ranks as the most literary member of the group, and is spoken by upwards of
                    749,000 people. Livonian lingers as the speech of a few thousand seafaring folk
                    in Courland. The Lapps contribute 17,178 to the population of Norway, 6700 to
                    that of Sweden, and 7497 to that of Russia. Their language is divided into four
                    dialects. The Tcherernisses, Mordwines, and Votiaks are grouped together as
                    Finns of the Volga,—the first, to the number of about 260,000, situated in the
                    country between the rivers Viatka and Vetluga; the second being scattered, to
                    the number of about 792,000, through the governments of Samara, Saratoff,
                    Simbirsk, Pensa, Nizhni-Novgorod, Tamboff, Kazan, Ufa, Orenburg, and Astrakhan;
                    andthe third, about 240,500 strong, occupying the western half of the government
                    of Viatka. Another group is composed of the Permians, Siryenians, and Voguls.
                    The two former were at one time one people, and had considerable fame in the
                    Middle Ages for their commercial activity; they are now mere hunters, fishers,
                    and pedlars, and number respectively about 67,000 and 85,400 people in Perm,
                    Vologda, and Archangel. The Voguls are a little colony from Asia, 2000 strong,
                    in the government of Perm. The total number of Tatars in Russia is said to be
                    1,212,610. They are found in all the sixty-one governments, with the exception
                    of nine; but are most numerous in Kazan, Simbirsk, Ufa, and Viatka. They are
                    closely connected with the Bashkirs of Ufa, Orenburg, Perm, and Viatka, who
                    altogether amount to 757,000. The Nogaians, who live in the neighbourhood of the
                    Sea of Azoff, are a mixed people, containing remnants of the Khazars,
                    Petchenegs, and Cumanians; the Tchuvashes are a Tatarized branch of the Finns of
                    the Volga; and the Meshtcheryaks of Ufa, Orenburg, Pensa, and Kazan are also of
                    Finnish descent. The first still number 15,000, though a large number emigrated
                    to Turkey after the Crimean war, the second 569,000, the third 136,000. The
                    language of the Nogaians is the same with that of the Tatars proper, and that of
                    the Tchuvashes seems to lie midway between Nogairic and Turkish. The Kirghiz, of
                    whom there are 156,000 in Astrakhan and Orenburg, speak a dialect which is
                    equally difficult of comprehension to the Tatar of Kazan and the Bashkir; and
                    the Calmucks—107,000 in Astrakhan—are still more widely separated by language
                    from their nearest kin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In 1877, as appears by the table on page 703, the European territory was
                    distributed among 18 distinct political totalities (exclusive of the petty
                    states of San Marino, Andorra, Monaco, and Luxembourg), viz.—the German empire,
                    the Russian empire, the Ottoman empire, the united monarchy of Austria-Hungary,
                    the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the republic of France, the
                    kingdoms of Italy, Spain, and Portugal, the kingdoms of Belgium and of the
                    Netherlands, the kingdom of Denmark, the united monarchy of Norway and Sweden,
                    the kingdom of Greece, the republican confederation of Switzerland, and the
                    principalities of Montenegro, Servia, and Roumania. Several of these consist of
                    a greater or smaller number of partially independent states connected with each
                    other according to very different degrees of political copartnery. The German
                    empire, as one of the most recent as well as most extensive, naturally presents
                    an unusual number of anomalies. Founded April 16, 1871, it comprises no fewer
                    than twenty-six states under the presidency of the kingdom of Prussia, and these
                    states are very dissimilar in size, constitution, rank, and general importance.
                    Four, including Prussia, are kingdoms, six are grand-duchies, five are duchies,
                    seven are principalities, and three are free cities. The organization by which
                    they are united consists mainly of a federal council or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bundesrath,</hi> in which the individual states are represented by the nominees
                    of their several governments, and a <hi rend="italic">Reichstag,</hi> or
                    Imperial Diet, the members of which are elected by universal suffrage. All
                    military power is centralized in the hands of the emperor: his consent is
                    necessary for all important appointments in the different divisions of the army,
                    and he can command the erection of fortresses on the soil of any of the states,
                    and if occasion requires can declare any part in a condition of siege. The
                    practical dominancy of Prussia is further secured by the fact that it possesses
                    236 of the 397 members who compose the Imperial Diet. As separate states,
                    Prussia, Würtemberg, Saxony, and Bavaria are all constitutional monarchies, each
                    with its parliament or <hi rend="italic">Landstag,</hi> consisting of an upper
                    and a lower house. The various grand-duchies, duchies, and principalities have

                    chambers and some of one, and presenting considerable variety in the amount of
                    representation accorded to different elements of the community, in the rules of
                    election, and in the length of period for which it is valid. That unusual
                    combination of geographical names, Austria Hungary, and its equally unusual
                    adjective Austrian-Hungarian, which are so uncouth and bewildering to the
                    ordinary reader, are an attempt to indi-</p>

                <p>cate the relation of complete political equality established between the two
                    great sections of what is popularly known as the Austrian empire. Each has its
                    own parliament,—in Austria called the <hi rend="italic">Reichsrath</hi> or
                    Imperial Council, and in Hungary the <hi rend="italic">Reichstag</hi> or
                    Imperial Diet; each its own ministers, budget, and other administrative
                    machinery; and the transactions between the two countries not unfrequently show
                    like the transactions between two independent powers. The same person is monarch
                    over both, and the united army is under his command, but there practically the
                    unification ceases. Russia is an hereditary monarchy, nominally governed by the
                    absolute will of the emperor or czar, but really by this in combination with a
                    system of four great councils. Finland still retains its separate parliament,
                    instituted in 1772, and supplemented by an imperial senate under the presidency
                    of a governor-general. Switzerland is a confederation of twenty two states, with
                    a republican government. The supreme legislative power is in the hands of the
                    federal assembly, which is composed of a national council or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nationalrath,</hi> and a council of states or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stande-vath,—</hi> the members of the former being chosen by the people of
                    Switzerland in general, and the members of the latter by the people of the
                    individual cantons. The executive power is entrusted to a federal council, and
                    the highest judicial authority to a federal tribunal, consisting respectively of
                    seven and eleven members, nominated for three and six years by the federal
                    assembly. Sweden and Norway are two kingdoms under one king, with separate
                    government, constitution, and laws. In Sweden the legislative power is mainly in
                    the hands of the diet, which consists of two elective chambers, while the
                    executive is in the hands of the king and a council of state. The constitution
                    of Norway is rather more democratic: the full legislative power belongs to the
                    Storthing, and the king has no right of veto if the same bill passes three
                    times. The common affairs of the two countries are decided in a council of state
                    consisting of representatives of each.</p>
                <p>Such are the most abnormal political arrangements in Europe. Britain, Belgium,
                    Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Roumania, Servia, are
                    hereditary monarchies, with a parliament of two chambers and a responsible
                    ministry. Greece differs in as far as it has only one chamber. Montenegro is an
                    hereditary monarchy, with a senate; Monaco an hereditary principality, with a
                    council of state; and Andorra and San Marino are both republics, with a general
                    council.</p>
                <p>It may be safely affirmed that the population of Europe has been steadily
                    increasing since the time of the great Revolution, though it is impossible to
                    ascertain exactly the average rate. The number in 1787 is said to have been
                    144,000,000; at the peace of 1815, 180,000,000; in 1833, according to Balbi,
                    227,000,000; in 1854, 258,778,850; and in 1874, according to Behm and Wagner,
                    309,178,300. If the earlier estimates, which are little better than guesses,
                    even approximate to the truth, wo would have in 59 years an average annual
                    increase of 1,850,000. In England and Prussia rather more than one per cent, of
                    increase takes place every year, while in France during the greater part of the
                    century the gain has been considerably less, and in exceptional years there has
                    even been a decrease. If then we adopt one per cent, as the mean for Europe, the
                    180,000,000 people in Europe ought, in 1874, to be represented by 323,769,000.
                    Two causes have greatly diminished the growth—war and emigration. In the Crimean
                    war the direct loss was 386,000 soldiers; that of the French army in Italy was
                    10,173; and that of the German army in 1866 between 10,000 and 11,000. In the
                    war of 1871-72 the victors lost 45,000 and the conquered a still greater number.
                    The total loss since 1855 cannot be less than a million at the very least. Of
                    the extent to which emigration from Europe has gone on during the present
                    century every one has some idea; the immense territory occupied by people of
                    European descent speaks for itself. Since 1820, Germany has contributed about
                    two million inhabitants to the United States alone; since 1815, Great Britain
                    and Ireland have seen no less tlιau from eight to nine millions of their
                    populations leave their shores for ever. The drain on other countries, however,
                    has been much less,—France, for ex ample, counting her loss by emigration in the
                    ten years from 1849 to 1858 as 200,000, and Austria her loss from 1850 to 1868
                    at no more than 58,000.</p>
                <p>The general rule that, other conditions being equal, the population decreases
                    with the elevation of the country, holds especially true of Europe. None of its
                    larger cities lie far above the sea-level. The highest point of permanent human
                    occupation is the hospice of St Bernard—at an altitude of 2472 metres, or 8108
                    feet; and the highest village, St Veron la Ville, in the neighbourhood of
                    Briançon, has an altitude of 2009 metres, or 6589 feet. There is a little
                    hamlet'of German immigrants called Juf, 108 feet higher, in the Swiss valley of
                    the Avers, a tributary of the Rhine. Chaux de Fonds, a town of nearly 20,000
                    inhabitants in the Jura, stands at an altitude of 1000 metres, or 3280 feet, and
                    the average elevation of the Engadine, with its numerous villages, is about 6000
                    feet. The highest inhabited spot in the Dovre-Fjeld is said to be Hjerkin, at
                    3152 feet above the sea; in the Grampians C'orrour (Inverness-shire) at 1738, in
                    the Harz the Brockenhaus at 3739, and in the Pyrenees Mont Louis at 5208.<note

                <p>The districts of densest population, or nearly 400 to the square mile, are the
                    lower valley of the Thames, the neighbourhood of Newcastle, and the area which
                    includes Liverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield, and Leeds, in England, the district
                    between Boulogne and Liège, the neighbourhood of Cologne and Elberfeld-Barmen,
                    the valley of the Rhine for some distance above the junction of the Maine, part
                    of the valley of the Neckar, the country to the south of Leipsic, the vicinity
                    of Prague, a large portion of the valley of the Po, especially round about
                    Milan, the neighbourhood of Naples, and a little district round about Oporto.
                    Most of these districts of densest population are surrounded by areas in which
                    the ratio varies from 280 to 380 inhabitants per square mile. In France the only
                    districts approaching the higher figure are the vicinity of Paris and of Lyons;
                    and in Spain the only spot reaching the lower is San Sebastian. Pound about
                    Barcelona and on the coast between Cartagena and the mouth of the Jucar there
                    are from 190 to 240 per square mile. In no part of the Russian territory does
                    the ratio rise higher than 140, and most of it varies from 25 to 95. The same
                    low figures are applicable to the whole Scandinavian peninsula, with the
                    exception of the most southern part of Sweden, which, with eastern Denmark,
                    attains a ratio of 150 per square mile.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    35, 1874.</p></note> In a large part of Norway indeed, as well as in both the
                    north and the south-east of Russia, the ratio is not more than from 3 to 5. The
                    only other portions of the globe which reach the highest European density are
                    the valley of the Ganges, part of the Chinese empire, and possibly some parts of
                    central Africa.</p>
                <p>The numerical relation between the sexes is different in different countries as
                    well as in the differently constituted portions of the same national community.
                    The most prominent causes that interfere with the equilibrium are the greater
                    destruction of men in time of war, and the greater removal of men by emigration.
                    The following table gives the relations in the principal countries :—</p>

                <p>For Russia proper the census of 1858 gave 33,655,824 males to 35,275,904 females,

                <p>During the present century the industrial development of the more advanced
                    countries has led to a remarkable aggregation of the people into cities, and
                    facilities of travel have in many cases caused a large part of the city
                    population to take up their residence in suburbs more or less separate from the
                    central nucleus. In the following list of the towns and cities in Europe with
                    more than 100.000 inhabitants it is noticeable that no fewer than twenty-one
                    belong to Britain, and that nine of these are among the thirty, most of which
                    are or have been political capitals, whose inhabitante exceed 200,000.</p>

                <p>It must of course be kept in mind that lists like the above can only present an
                    approximate view of the facts,—first, because tbe censuses or estimates of the
                    various places are not strictly contemporaneous and do not proceed on the same
                    methods; and, secondly, because the areas to which they apply are determined by
                    different considerations in different cases. Jt is not unfrequently hard to say
                    what ought to be accepted as the limits between town and not-town,—whether
                    ancient villages and hamlets to which the city has grown outwards, or the modern
                    suburbs which it has built at short distances, should be included or excluded.
                    With those cities which have kept the characteristics of the walled towns of the
                    mediaeval period the matter is easily settled, but in most cases the modern city
                    has either got rid of its walls and turned their site into promenades or
                    boulevards, or, retaining them as an interesting historical monument, has
                    overflowed their limits in all available directions. In some very modem
                    instances, such as Elberfeld-Barmen in Prussia, clusters of dwelling-houses and
                    industrial establishments have sprung up sporadically along a convenient valley;
                    and while there are large gaps in what we may call the area of architectural
                    occupation, the various groups have a complete community of social and
                    commercial life. Municipal boundaries give us but little assistance, for these
                    are modified not only by the different municipal systems of the different
                    countries, but also by all kinds of local conveniences, traditions, and
                    rivalries.</p>
                <p>An enormous increase has taken place since the French Revolution, and indeed
                    within a much shorter period, in the size of the military establishments
                    throughout Europe. The rivalries and jealousies of the various nations have led
                    them to vie with each other in the strength of their armies and navies; and as
                    it is impossible to withdraw more than a certain number of men from productive
                    labour to non-productive drill and display, a strange return, under greatiy
                    modified conditions, has been made to that earlier state of society in which the
                    army was the whole mass of the male population capable of bearing arms.
                    Universal obligation or liability to personal service as a soldier is recognized
                    by Germany, Austria, Hungary, Greece. Italy, France, Spain, Porcugal, Denmark,
                    Switzerland, and Turkey. In Belgium the army is recruited by conscription, in
                    Russia mainly by conscription, and in the Netherlands and in Norway and Swedeu
                    partly by conscription and partly by voluntary <pb break="no"

                    there can be no standing army within the federal territory. The following table,

                <p>The maritime nations, almost without exception, maintain a considerable navy for
                    warlike purposes; and the greater powers have lavished their wealth on
                    experiment after experiment in the endless task of mutual competition for the
                    most destructive and indestructible fleet. In 1877-78 Britain had 58 ironclads
                    (of which 47 are described as efficient), France 58, Germany 20, Russia 29,
                    Austria-Hungary 14, Italy 16, Turkey 15 large and 18 small, Spain 10, and the
                    Netherlands 17. The difference of size and structure of the individual vessels
                    makes the fleets of the several countries practically incommensurable in a
                    general survey; and withorrt the actual test of conflict it would be hard to say
                    which of the approximately equal equipments is the most powerful. An American
                    official<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>King, <hi
                    rend="italic">The War Ships of Europe.</hi></p></note> investigator in 1877
                    decided in favour of Britain, which not only manufactures her own armoured
                    ships, but has constructed a large number of vessels for Russia, Turkey, Spain,
                    Holland, Italy, Denmark, Greece, and Portugal.</p>
                <p>A most important result of the military expenses of the different countries has
                    been the extraordinary development of national debts. In 1848 the total for all
                    the European states was about £1,700,000,000; by 1873 it had increased to
                    £4,680,000,000, or at the rate of £119,000,000 annually. Each successive war—the
                    Crimean, the French-Austrian, the Prussian-Austrian, and the French-German—has
                    added to the load. Mr Robert Dudley Baxter, in a paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal of the Statistical Society,</hi> 1875, arranged the countries in groups
                    according to the rate of interest they paid on the market price. The states of
                    low interest, paying from 3 to 4 per cent., were the United Kingdom, Denmark,
                    Holland, Belgium, and Germany; the states of moderate interest, 5 to 6∣ per
                    cent., Russia and France; the states of high interest, 6J to 10 per cent.,
                    Portugal, Hungary and Austria, Italy, and Turkey; while Spain, paying upwards of
                    16 per cent., ranked as astate of excessive interest. According to a table
                    furnished by Dr Kolb, if the several national debts were equally distributed
                    over the respective populations every inhabitant of Portugal would have to pay
                    about £27, every inhabitant of France about £25. 4s., of Great Britain £24,
                    15s., of Spain £22, 10s., of the Netherlands £18, 18s., of Italy £16, 16s., of
                    Turkey £13, of Austria-Hungary £10, of Belgium £5, 17s., and of Russia £5, 5s.
                    The country which ranks lowest is Switzerland, which has no standing army,—the
                    average for every man being there only about 8s. or 9s. Were it not for the
                    enormous development of European commerce such a state of matters could not be
                    supported, and even as it is several countries have been practically, if not
                    formally, bankrupt during the present century. The following table gives the
                    annual revenues of the different countries :—</p>

                <p>The commerce of Europe may be said to have had its beginning when the people of
                    the early stone period bartered on from horde to horde the flint or jade best
                    fitted for their weapons, and there is reason to believe that far back in
                    prehistoric times the amber of the Baltic found its way across the Alps to add a
                    new element to Italian decoration. It was not till the Roman period,
                    however,That the great lines of traffic were distinctly laid; Rome was the first
                    European city whose necessities and desires formed as it were a great centre of
                    combustion requiring a continual current from all directions to feed the
                    ever-brightening flame. Since the 10th century, when the northern nations had
                    finally settled in their present seats, the commercial activity of the continent
                    has increased from generation to generation, and in none has it made a greater
                    advance than in the present. Europe has now a hundred Romes; and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n736/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0736-0707"/> the mightiest of them is to the Rome that then
                    was as the world of the 19th century is to the “world” of the first. Along with
                    increased necessities and more varied desires have been developed greater
                    possibilities of supply and satisfaction; and the commerce of Europe has become
                    the commerce of the globe.</p>
                <p>The great indispensables are food and clothing, and in regard to neither of these
                    is Europe self-sufficing. Austria, Russia, Roumania, and Denmark are the only
                    countries that grow a sufficient quantity of the cereals to maintain a regular
                    export, and even these are indebted to foreign supply for much of their ordinary
                    food materials. Russia annually produces about 644,000,000 bushels of grain, and
                    of this she can spare upwards of 120,000,000. The chief corn-growing districts
                    are New Russia and Bessarabia, and the principal ports of outlet are Odessa,
                    Taganrog, Rostoff, Mariupol, and Berdiansk. Eugland and France purchase most of
                    the wheat, and Germany most of the rye. Austria-Hungary produces about
                    400,000,000 bushels; but it is only in favourable years that the export exceeds
                    the import. Roumania has an average harvest of about 89,000,000 bushels, and
                    exports to the value of about &lt;£4,500,000. Denmark counts about 79,000,000
                    bushels of produce, and has a surplus of 65,000,000. England and Ireland derived
                    in 1874 about 63 per cent, of its foreign wheat from the L <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> nited States and Canada, 11 per cent, from Russia, 8
                    per cent, from Germany, and 4 per cent, from Chili. The value of the whole
                    import amounted to upwards of &lt;£51,000,000; and it is calculated that on the
                    average England requires the produce of about 4,500,000 acres of foreign wheat
                    fields. The average harvest in France yields about 658,000,000 bushels; and in
                    favourable years she has a small export. Germany produces about 715,000,000, but
                    requires at least £80,000,000 worth additional. Belgium’s medium harvest reaches
                    64,000,000 bushels, but it is never sufficient for the population; in 1873 they
                    paid upwards of &lt;£64,000,000 for foreign supplies. The Netherlands produce
                    about 31,000,000, and purchase to the extent of £3,000,000. The Italian harvest
                    furnishes about 282,000,000 bushels, besides 27,000,000 bushels of rice, but the
                    import exceeds the export sometimes to a very high value. In favourable years
                    Sweden and Norway yield 82,000,000 bushels: the former country exports oats and
                    barley, and imports rye, wheat, and meal; the latter, with a surplus of oats,
                    requires a large foreign supply of all other grains. The Spanish produce varies
                    from 27 to 200 millions of bushels, but about £2,300,000 worth have to be
                    imported. Portugal, with a mean harvest of 30,000,000 bushels, purchases to the
                    amount of £250,000. For the whole of the continent the total harvest may be
                    stated at about 4,893,000,000 bushels.</p>
                <p>Europe finds greater difficulty in satisfying its demands for animal food. The
                    average consumption per head of population is rising iu all the principal
                    countries; and though the modern stock-raiser can produce a greater quantity of
                    flesh per ox or sheep, it is in several districts found more profitable to turn
                    the ground to other uses, and sheep and cattle farming are consequently on the
                    decline. There has thus grown up a great import trade, not only of Jiving
                    animals, but, within the last twenty years, of preserved meat, the principal
                    sources being North and South America and Australia. The trade is yet in its
                    infancy, and trustworthy statistics are not readily accessible.</p>
                <p>An ever-growing addition to the food supplies of Europe is made in the form of
                    what are called colonial wares— sugar, tea, coffee, &amp;c. Though the native
                    production of beet sugar amounts on an average to 22 or 23 million cwt. per
                    annum, that would only furnish about i lb on an average to each inhabitant;
                    while as far back as 1866, according to Robert Burger’s calculation, the average
                    demand was more than 11 lb per head, and in Britain had reached about 42 lb. The
                    consumption, moreover, has since then increased enormously—Great Britain having
                    advanced to 62 lb per head, France from 13 lb to 19 lb, and Germany from 10 lb
                    to 15 It). Almost the same might be said of tea, in the consumption of which
                    Britain again stands first, requiring about 4 H) a head per annum; and of
                    coffee, of which Belgium requires the greatest average supply, or about 9 lb a
                    head. And to all this must be added the multitudinous articles of consumption
                    from far and near that give such a cosmopolitan air even to an ordinary grocer’s
                    shop. For that most universal of all clothing materials, cotton, Europe is
                    almost entirely indebted to other parts of the world; and though it grows a
                    large quantity of wool and no inconsiderable amount of silk, its demand for both
                    far exceeds its domestic supply. So much, however, of what it imports is again
                    exported in the form of manufactured goods, that it is almost impossible to
                    obtain a correct estimate of its true consumption. For details on these enormous
                    trades the reader may consult the separate articles. The European production of
                    wool was reckoned in 1871 at upwards of 562,370,000 lb,—England contributing
                    159,000,000, France 91,108,000, and Russia 90,760,000 to the total. The
                    production of silk is about 12,000,000 lb.</p>

                    traffic of the world may be obtained from the following table of the strength of

                <p>If it were not for the enormous development which has been attained by its
                    manufacturing industries, Europe would have no means of paying for what the
                    other continents can afford to send; it has comparatively few raw materials
                    which it can give in exchange, and so it pays for them with its labour and its
                    skill. The countries which rank as emphatically industrial are Great Britain,
                    France, Saxony, Switzerland, Belgium, Würtemberg, Prussia, and Alsace-Lorraine.
                    In the manufacture of iron Britain stands at the head of the list, especially
                    for steel, wire, rails, and cast-iron. In the first department its principal
                    rivals are Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, Sweden, and Belgium; in the second
                    Germany, France, Sweden, and Belgium are also exporters, and Austria-Hungary and
                    Italy manufacture for their own markets; and in the third the state of matters
                    is much the same, with the exception that several other countries are also
                    producers in a small way. Tho manufacture of cast-iron is more widely
                    distributed, forming an important industry not only in most of the countries
                    already named, but also in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, &amp;c. Tho same
                    position of supremacy belongs to <pb break="no"

                    attention is devoted to this department by all the chief Continental nations.
                    Austria, for example, produces yearly about 600,000 scythes, more than 1,000,000
                    sickles, and about 200, <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 000 straw knives, and of
                    the first it exports a large number, especially to Russia. Vienna has a great
                    manufactory of fire-proof safes, and ranks with Steyr, Letten, Ferlach, Weipert,
                    and Prague, in the production of military weapons. Prussian pens and needles are
                    well known throughout the continent; and still better her cannon and
                    needle-guns. In the manufacture of copper, brass, and lead, the first place
                    belongs to France and Great Britain; and in that of zinc to Belgium, Great
                    Britain, and Prussia. In bronze France is distinguished both by the quantity and
                    variety of her productions. Great Britain, France, Austria, and Germany are the
                    only countries in which scientific instruments are made in large numbers, and
                    with excellent finish; in the manufacture of musical instruments the same
                    countries stand high, but have a greater number of competitors. In watchmaking
                    Britain, France, and Switzerland carry off the palm; the Belgian clocks are
                    accounted excellent; and the products of the Black Forest in the same department
                    are too well known to need even a passing mention. The ruder branches of the
                    ceramic art are almost universally cultivated, but only a few countries furnish
                    a large export of the finer wares. Porcelain is largely manufactured in Bohemia,
                    at the royal potteries of Meissen and Berlin in Prussia, at Dresden in Saxony,
                    at Limoges in France, at Copenhagen in Denmark, at the imperial potteries of St
                    Petersburg, and at Stoke-upon-Trent and Worcester in England. Freiburg in
                    Breisgau supplies the markets of a large part of the world with porcelain button
                    knobs and beads; and the Thüringerwald and Sicily are noted for their little
                    porcelain figures and ornaments. The manufacture of glass is also of the widest
                    distribution. Austria-Hungary numbers about 300 glass-works, Germany rather
                    more, Britain upwards of 220, France 175, Italy 70, and so on. Bohemia gives its
                    name to a well-known class of goods; France takes the first place for its beads
                    and glass-jewellery; and Belgium is perhaps even better known for supplying the
                    common wants of the glazier. The polishing of precious stones is carried to
                    greatest perfection in France; but Vienna, St Petersburg, London, Dublin,
                    Berlin, and several other great cities also rank high. Amsterdam has long been
                    the principal seat of the diamond trade. Bohemia and Baden find a valuable
                    industry in the working up of their garnets and rock crystals; and Oberstein in
                    Oldenburg is remarkable as the source of nearly all those fancy articles in
                    agate which, under various name3—Scotch pebbles and the like—are sold throughout
                    Europe. Rome is the principal seat of the production of cameos and mosaics, and
                    marble-cutting has attained its greatest development <hi rend="subscript">
                    i</hi> in Tuscany, It is impossible to enter into detail on the various
                    industries which use wood as their raw material; almost every country and
                    district has its share, and they differ not so much in the nature as the finish
                    of the articles which they produce. In the produce of the turning-lathe Austria,
                    Germany, England, and France rank highest, and they also keep their position in
                    the department of wood-carving. Italy is first in straw-plaiting, which is of
                    prime importance in Tuscany; and next come Switzerland and Belgium.
                    Leather-making and its associated industries are of universal distribution; the
                    brushmanufacture has reached its fullest development in England; and hair is
                    most successfully turned to artistic account in France.</p>

                    especially, it has long been the greatest centre, not only in Europe but in the

                    developing in Germany, France, Russia, and several other Continental countries.

                <p>In wool-spinning and cloth-weaving the chief countries are again Britain,
                    Germany, France, and Belgium, and to these succeed Austria, Italy, Russia,
                    Sweden, and Spain. As minor or domestic industries both branches have a very
                    wide distribution. The greatest amount of silk is spun in Italy and France, and
                    the latter country holds the first place in silk-weaving, though she has
                    powerful competitors in Germany, Britain, and Switzerland. Great Britain again
                    outstrips all her rivals in the general manufactures of flax, hemp, and jute; in
                    linen thread she is excelled by France, and in the extent of its rope works by
                    Russia. Linen weaving is widely distributed as a domestic industry, and is
                    rapidly developing as a factory industry in Germany, Belgium, and the

                    France are the greatest manufacturers of brandy, and Holland has almost given
                    its name to one of the principal liquors; but this whole department of industry
                    is of the very widest distribution. Among the more peculiar and local branches
                    may be mentioned the Kirschwasser and Eau de Cologne of Germany, the plum brandy
                    of Roumania, Servia, and Bosnia, the aniseed liqueur of Albacete in Spain, and
                    the famous productions of the monastic establishment at Chartreuse. Vinegar is
                    most largely and successfully manufactured in France. In the preparation of
                    tobacco, Germany stands first; and the Netherlands are indebted for a large
                    trade in this department to their East Indian colonies. The soap manufacture has
                    reached its highest development in France and Britain; while the greatest
                    exporters of tallow are Russia, Roumania, and Servia. Sweden is especially
                    famous for its matches, which are sent to all parts of the world. The
                    preparation of ultramarine is of great importance in Germany; and Austria has
                    unrivalled manufactures of white lead in Carinthia.</p>
                <p>Such are a few of the main features of that wonderful industrial activity which
                    is daily acquiring a more varied aspect and extending over a wider area. The
                    younger <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n738/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0738-0709"/> rations are developing their resources, and
                    turning their attention to industries that they had long neglected; and in the
                    older nations almost every year sees an addition to the bewildering multiplicity
                    of human occupations.</p>
                <p>While most of the several countries, as appears by the accompanying table, are on
                    the whole fairly supplied with internal railway communication, and a few have
                    developed a nearly perfect system of primary and secondary lines, much has still
                    to be done before the general international system will be approximately
                    complete. Of natural obstacles the mountains are the most formidable, and at the
                    head of the mountains in this respect, as in others, stand the Alps. Between all
                    the countries of northern and central Europe regular traffic is easily
                    maintained: the north of France, Belgium, Holland, and the north of Germany are
                    practically one as far as the great network of railways is concerned. Between
                    France and southern Germany the connexion is not so close, though the
                    Franco-German frontier is crossed by four or five lines, and the Swiss system,
                    which is well developed, affords several additional routes. Between Germany and
                    Austria there are almost equal facilities, more especially along the borders of
                    Bohemia and Saxony. Eastwards and southwards in Poland, Russia, and Austria, the
                    meshes of the net grow very wide, but the main threads are knotted together and
                    satisfy the necessities of international communication. Such is the state of the
                    case in the countries of central Europe; but if the traveller wishes to proceed
                    by rail to any of the three southern peninsulas, he finds himself in a very
                    different position. From France he can enter Spain only by two routes, one of
                    which takes him round the western end of the Pyrenees, and the other, opened in
                    1878, round the eastern end; at all other parts of the frontier the mountains
                    bid defiance to the engineer. From Spain, where he will find the internal system
                    still very incomplete, the traveller may cross the Portuguese frontier and
                    proceed by rail direct to Lisbon, but if he wish to reach Oporto without
                    visiting Lisbon he must resign himself to the old-fashioned road. His case is
                    better if he turn in the direction of Italy: from France he may glide into Italy
                    through the tunnel of the Col de Frejus, or as it is popularly called Mont
                    Cenis, which was completed in 1870 and opened in 1871; or from Bavaria he may
                    traverse the other extremity of the Alps by the Brennerbahn, and reach the
                    Lombard plain by the valley of the Adige. By all other routes he must in the
                    meantime accept the service of the diligence; but workmen have been busy since
                    1871 under the maβsif of St Gotthard, and within a few years he may be able to
                    pass right through from Zurich to Bellinzona and Milan It has also been proposed
                    to effect a communication between the railways of north Italy and the line of
                    the Rhone valley by means of a tunnel through the Simplon; and one German
                    engineer at least, Sturm, has a scheme for boring under Mont Blanc itself. Once
                    in Italy, the traveller can proceed as far as Otranto at the eastern end of the
                    peninsula, or to Reggio at the western. If, instead of Italy, it be his desire
                    to visit the countries to the south of the Danube, the railway altogether fails
                    him. By Austrian lines he may reach Sessek on the Save, Essek on the Drave, or
                    Bazias on the Danube; or if he go round by Galicia, he may proceed south through
                    Bulgaria, cross the Danube at Rustchuk, and continue as far as Varna on the
                    Black Sea. But at no point is there any connexion with the Turkish system, or
                    rather fragmentary beginnings of a system: the lines from Constantinople and
                    Aghatch which meet to the south of Adrianople, stop short in the valley of the
                    Maritza, and the line from Saloniki proceeds only as far north as Uskub. In
                    Greece there is but one little line, from the Piraeus to Athens. By the Russian
                    railways the traveller can journey direct south to Odessa, Nicolaieff, or
                    Sebastopol on the Black Sea, to Taganrog or Rostoff on the Sea of Azυff, or even
                    to Vladιkavkas in the Caucasus. Eastward he may advance as far as Tsaritsin or
                    Saratoff on the Volga, and to Orenburg at the end of the Ural range.
                    North-eastwards his limits are Nizhni-Novgorod and Vologda. According to the
                    plans of the Russian Government, a few years will see the construction of lines
                    of communication with eastern Siberia on the one hand and the new provinces of
                    central Asia on the other. It is sufficient to mention the projected tunnel
                    between France and England. The following table gives the length of the railway
                    lines in the several countries for 1860 and 1875:—</p>

                <p>Since 1875 the railway contractors have not been idle. At the end of 1876 there
                    were 16,872 miles open for traffic in Great Britain, and upwards of 5000 miles
                    in course of construction. In the beginning of 1877 the Belgian lines amounted
                    to 2228 miles or 3580 kilometres, and the French lines to 14,078 miles or 22,671
                    kilometres.</p>
                <p>The telegraphic system, as appears by the accompanying table, is well developed
                    throughout the continent, more especially in Switzerland, Great Britain,
                    Belgium, Bavaria, and Wiirtemberg. As far as it is international, it is largely
                    indebted to British enterprise and capital, and many of the most important
                    companies have their centres in London. All the maritime countries have
                    submarine cables. Norway has no fewer than 193, with a total length of 1233
                    nautical miles; Denmark 29, with a length of 101 miles; and Holland 18, with a
                    length of 36. The three Russian cables of the Baltic have a total length of 62
                    miles, and unite Cronstadt with the capital, and the islands Osel and Aland with
                    the continent. Of the 12 Italian cables the most important, about 118 miles
                    long, communicates with Sardinia; and of the 6 Spanish three are devoted to
                    Iviça, Minorca, and Majorca. Most of the 26 French cables are short, with the
                    exception of that which stretches across.the Mediterranean from Marseilles to
                    Algiers. Great Britain has a large number communicating with various parts of
                    the continent, as well as with Ireland, the Channel Islands, Orkney and
                    Shetland, the Hebrides, &amp;c. Of prime importance to the continent at large
                    are the great transatlantic cables, four of which have their European termini in
                    the west of Ireland, while a fifth, the longest yet laid down, stretches from
                    Brest in Brittany 2585 miles to St Pierre near Newfoundland, and a sixth from
                    Lisbon to Pernambuco in Brazil. Two others are projected—one from Portugal, and
                    another from the Shetland Islands round by the Faroes, Iceland, Greenland,
                    &amp;c. Direct communication is maintained between England and India by the
                    lines of the Eastern Telegraph Company, and other lines continue the system as
                    far as Australia on the one hand and Japan on the other.</p>

                <p>Within recent years fresh attention has been directed to the older canal-system,
                    which was by many regarded as having had its day. Not only are the canals which
                    had fallen into partial decay being in many cases restored, but new canals are
                    either constructed or planned. Without entering into the details of the separate
                    national systems, some idea may be formed of the extent of this means of
                    communication by the following facts. We may pa≡3 from the Rhone to the Loire,
                    and from either river to the Seine; the Seine in its turn is connected with the
                    Meuse and the Rhine; the Rhine communicates with the Danube in the south, and
                    with the Ems and the Weser in the north; the Weser is already in communication
                    with the lower part of the Elbe, and it is proposed to construct a line of
                    canals to unite these rivers further inland; from the Elbe we pass by the Spree
                    system to the Oder; the Oder, by means of its tributary the Wartha, gives access
                    to the Vistula; and the Bug, a tributary of the Vistula, brings us to the great
                    Russian network of rivers and canals by which we can journey from the Baltic to
                    the Black Sea or the Caspian, or from either of these to the White Sea in the
                    north. Thus it appears in brief that water highways exist between all the great
                    river systems and all the principal seas. It was only in the summer of 1876 that
                    the Dutch opened a new canal between Amsterdam and the sea; in 1877 the senate
                    of Finland voted 200,000 rubles for a canal between the Baltic and the White
                    Sea; and very extensive additions are proposed to the German system. A scheme
                    has even been started by an American engineer, H. C. Spalding, for connecting
                    the Black Sea and the Caspian, and thus increasing the area of the latter at the
                    expense of the neighbouring steppes; and a less quixotic proposal contemplates a
                    canal from the Don to the Volga across the ridge of nearest approximation. In
                    Frauce there is already a line of water-way between the Bay of Biscay and the
                    Mediterranean, but it is only available for inland traffic; and the proposal is
                    now entertained of constructing nothing less than a ship canal. Au earlier and
                    more extravagant project to make such a canal through Spain from Bilbao to the
                    valley of the Ebro has naturally remained a dead letter.</p>
                <p>Since the 18th century, there has been great advance in the general educational
                    condition of Europe. That it is the duty of every state, if not to provide
                    instruction for the rising generation of citizens, at least to see that it is
                    provided, is a principle more and more thoroughly recognized and acted upon; aud
                    the obscurantist doctrine that the lower classes become more ι∙evolutionary and
                    dangerous by becoming more intelligent and better informed is less frequently
                    employed as au open argument. Even in Turkey a law was at least passed in 1869
                    requiring the establishment of secondary schools and gymnasiums in the principal
                    towns; and education is one of the matters dealt with in the proposed reforms of
                    1878. How slow the movement has beeu even in the more civilized countries is
                    strikingly shown by the fact that England has not yet realized the far-sighted
                    schemes suggested more than a thousand years ago by her wise West Saxon king,
                    Alfred. The educational reformers of almost every country have had a hard battle
                    to fight in their endeavours after a satisfactory organization, and compromise
                    and half-measures have frequently been the order of the day. From time
                    immemorial the clergy have had, and they certainly for a long time had a right
                    to have, a predominant share in the control of all educational matters
                    throughout Europe; the sacred books of the various forms of religion or
                    doctrinal compendiums of individual sects have been the most familiar manuals of
                    primary instruction; and even when the teacher has been a layman, ecclesiastical
                    supervision more or less efficient has been added. The present tendency, even in
                    countries like Italy on the one hand, and Sweden on the other, where there is
                    little difference of creed among the population, is decidedly in favour of the
                    teachers being laymen and the instruction secular. That the clergy do not
                    readily acquiesce in the changes that diminish their influence is excusable; but
                    at the same time their demands have occasioned the most lamentable obstruction
                    to educational progress.</p>
                <p>In order that primary education may be rendered universal, it has been found
                    necessary to make it compulsory; and this has been done either directly or
                    indirectly in all the great countries of Europe. It is now easier to name those
                    that have not adopted direct compulsory measures than those that have adopted
                    them. The former list includes France, Russia (with the exception of the Baltic
                    provinces), Finland, Belgium, Turkey, Servia, and Montenegro. In England, the
                    gradual extension qf the schoolboard system practically involves the extension
                    of compulsory education, though the question is left in the hands of local
                    authorities instead of being decided once for all by the central legislation.
                    Owing to the differences existent between the organizations of the several
                    countries, it is impossible to institute an exact comparison; but the following
                    table, revised from Brachelli’s, presents an approximate survey :—<note

                <p>The countries of southern and eastern Europe are all very low in the scale; but
                    several of them, and notably Italy, Greece, and Russia, are making rapid
                    advances. The last of these has great difficulties to contend against in the
                    extent of its territory and the sparseness of its population; but such a fact as
                    the following speaks for itself: “In 1866,” says M. Hippeau,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Μ. Hippeau’s volumes, <hi

                    account of the education of most of the principal countries.</p></note> “in
                    every 100 conscripts only one could read and write; in 1870 this number had
                    risen to 11 in the 100.” Several of the local boards have recommended the
                    adoption of obligatory attendance at school. Much less hopeful is the condition
                    of Spain, where at the last census (1860) 72 percent, of the population could
                    neither read nor write. Yet even there the movement is in the right direction. A
                    fine contrast is afforded by the Scandinavian countries, where the peasantry
                    have long been accustomed to relieve the tedium of their winter nights by
                    reading the sagas of their native land, and by some of the Swiss cantons, where
                    there are only 4 per cent, of the population totally uneducated. In France,
                    according to the official statistics of 1875, there are 30 persons in every 100
                    unable to read or write; and in Belgium, according to the results of the census
                    of 1866, 42 in every 100 above seven years of age are in the same condition. The
                    high position of the German empire is mainly due to Prussia, which may be
                    regarded as the forerunner of educational progress in Europe. Among the other
                    states the differences are very considerable. Brunswick, Anhalt, Oldenburg,
                    Saxony, and Thuringia rise above the average of 152 scholars to the 1000
                    inhabitants; Mecklenburg and Bavaria sink as low as 121 and 126 respectively. A
                    high position is held by the free city of Bremen, where the public expenditure
                    for education has risen from 0 60 of a mark in 1847-51 to 8 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 45 marks in 1872-76 for each head of the population.
                    In Austria the contrasts between the provinces are enormous,—every thousand
                    inhabitants in Silesia, Bohemia, Moravia, or Tyrol sending from 130 to 136
                    children to school; while in Galicia, Dalmatia, and Bukovina the numbers are
                    only 29, 23, and 19.</p>
                <p>If statistics are unsatisfactory in regard to the condition of primary schools,
                    they are still more unsatisfactory as regards the institutions for the training
                    and education of the primary teacher. Till some approximation be made between
                    the systems of the several countries, it conveys almost no information to say
                    that in Prussia there are 107 and in Russia 45, in Switzerland 32 and in
                    Portugal 6. And still more impossible is it to institute a comparison with
                    respect to the secondary schools and the various insti tutions devoted to
                    instruction in special departments of art or science. In all the more advanced
                    countries they are increasing in number and in the specialization of their
                    work.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See an interesting

                <p>In Germany there are twenty-one universities, including the academy of Münster,
                    with about 1983 professors and teachers, and a total attendance of 19,000
                    students. The best known are Berlin, Leipsic, Göttingen, Halle, Tübingen, Bonn,
                    Heidelberg, Jena, and Erlangen. In Austria-Hungary there are ten, with 1018
                    professors, and upwards of 12,000 students. Italy numbers one more than Germany,
                    with 1093 professors, and not far from 10,000 students. Russia has nine,
                    including the Finland university of Helsingfors, and the practically German
                    university of Dorpat. The total teaching staff numbers upwards of 600, and the
                    students more than 7000. The four Scandinavian universities of Upsala, Lund,
                    Christiania, and Copenhagen, count 280 professors and 2700 students. There are
                    four in Holland, inclusive of the Amsterdam Academy, and four in Belgium, the
                    number of professors being respectively 149 and 229, and that of students 2056
                    and 2272. Since the addition of Geneva, Switzerland has the like number, with a
                    teaching staff of 250 to 300, and an attendance of upwards of 1200. Spain boasts
                    of ten universities with 400 professors, and, if her statistics are correct, has
                    more than 15,000 students. Portugal, in its one famous institute at Coimbra, has
                    about 1000 students, many of whom are from Brazil and the colonies. A university
                    was founded at Athens in 1837, another at Belgrade in 1838, and a third and
                    fourth at Bucharest and Jassy in 1864. The professors number in all 128, and the
                    students upwards of 2000. In France the organization of the higher education is
                    peculiar: Bordeaux and Lyons are the only two cities besides Paris which have
                    all the five faculties of theology, law, medicine, science, and literature, and
                    it is only in Paris that they are incorporated into a “university.” In sixteen
                    other towns there exist one or more of the separate faculties. The professors in
                    Frauce exceed 420, with 14,500 students. The Catholics have free “universities”
                    at Angers, Lyons, and Paris. Making allowance for defective statistics, it may
                    be said that continental Europe has about 7000 persons engaged in university
                    teaching, and that the students number from 88,000 to 90,000. In Britain the
                    universities differ greatly from each other in constitution and arrangement.
                    Oxford and Cambridge have together about 80 professors and over 5000
                    undergraduates. London university, which is merely an examining board, had
                    17,312 candidates for matriculation in 1877. Durham numbers 5 professors and 109
                    students. In the four Scotch universities there are 102 professors and about
                    5000 students. The Queen’s university, Ireland, has 54 professors and 745
                    students, and the Dublin university 39 professors and 1200 students.</p>
                <p>Europe, and especially northern and Germanic Europe, has long been distinguished
                    from eastern and southern countries by the greater social and educational
                    equality existing between the sexes; but in this, as in so much else, there is
                    still abundant room for improvement. A powerful movement has set in towards a
                    fuller recognition of the rights of woman; and the right to instruction is
                    recognized as one of the most fundamental. A greater assimilation is in most of
                    the more civilized countries being effected between the education given to boys
                    and girls; and a powerful party, with powerful arguments, support the thesis
                    that equal opportunities should also be afforded to young men and to young
                    women. In Prussia the general movement is represented by the Victoria or Lette
                    Union at Berlin, and the Otto Petter Union at Leipsic, both of which have <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n741/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0741-0712"/> founded institutions for the higher education of
                    women. The Jews of Frankfort-on-the-Maine have established two important
                    schools—the <hi rend="italic">Philanthropinum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Miister-schide;</hi> and the city of Carlsruhe has had a superior school for
                    σirls since 1826. The university of Zurich has set the example of the free
                    admittance of women; the London University opened its gates to them in 1877 ∖
                    and the older universities of England and Scotland have at least sanctioned
                    extramural lectureships and condescended to examine if not to teach them. A
                    women’s college has been opened at St Petersburg by Catherine Dikhova under
                    imperial patronage; Hungary has a similar institution; and so the innovation is
                    becoming familiar, and within a generation or two the condition of female
                    education at the beginning of this century bids fair to appear a semi-barbarian
                    state of things hardly credible at so recent a date.</p>
                <p>To recapitulate, European education is being more widely diffused, is passing
                    from the control of the clergy or the private citizen into the hands of the
                    state, is becoming more secular and less sectarian, and in its higher
                    departments shows a growing catholicity towards the more modern aspects of
                    thought and life.</p>
                <p>Europe is pre-eminently the country of monotheism, which forms the central
                    doctrine, not only of its dominant religion, Christianity, but also of the minor
                    riyals Judaism and Mahometanism. To none of these three religions has it given
                    birth; and, what is more remarkable, its peculiarly Aryan population have
                    adopted their religion from a Semitic people. The various nations of Europe were
                    still polytheistic when they first entered within the historic horizon; and this
                    polytheism has left more numerous traces of its influence than superficial
                    observers might imagine. Not only have the gods of the Greek and Roman pantheons
                    and their ruder rivals of the north obtained an immortality in the literature
                    and art of all the cultured nations of Europe, but amid the manifold traditions
                    and half-unconscious beliefs of the common people there are fragments of older
                    and baser creeds. Much has still to be done before the amount of such survivals
                    can be estimated with anything like accuracy, but that their number is
                    considerable has been already well established.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Tylor, jPrι⅛ι7⅛e <hi rend="italic"

                    consider how recent the introduction of Christianity into Europe really is, and
                    how, to vast masses of men, it came, not as a conviction of the intellect or a
                    captivation of the heart, but as the infliction of a conqueror or the command of
                    a king; and how, even when it was adopted through the persuasive eloquence of
                    genuine missionaries, it obtained, in many cases, but a divided allegiance, and
                    had to accept and sanctify as best it might the rites and symbolism of the
                    religion which it expelled. That the English still speak of Wednesday and
                    Thursday, that the French have their Vendredi and Mardi, the Italians their
                    Venerdi and Martedi, is of purely historic interest, and implies no lingering
                    attachment to Woden or Thor, to Venus or Mars; but there is no country in
                    Christian Europe in which the popular ideas about supernatural agency in general
                    are not the mongrel products of paganism and Christianity.</p>
                <p>Christianity in Europe is broken up into three main divisions, the Roman Catholic
                    Church, the Greek or Eastern Church, and the Protestant or Evangelical Church;
                    and each of these has received more or less numerous modifications and
                    subdivisions under the influence of different, political and social
                    environments. Roman Catholicism not only can boast of the greatest number of
                    adherents, but has the greatest claim to unity, at least in its external
                    organization, and stands in direct contrast to many portions of the Protestant
                    Church, which, while maintaining the superiority of their respective creeds, ac
                    knowledge the local and temporary character of their constitutions. The unity,
                    however, has all along been more nominal than real,—rather the beau-ideal of the
                    administrative hierarchy than the actual condition of the organization which
                    they control. Discordant elements have frequently threatened a disruption;
                    severe contests have taken place between the spirit of centralization in Rome
                    and the desire for local independence in individual countries; and in the
                    present century the irreconcilability of two great parties has given rise to the
                    so-called Old Catholics in Germany and Switzerland, who in the latter country at
                    least seem likely to break up iuto two distinct sections. There are two
                    religious communities in Europe which occupy a special relation to the Roman
                    Catholic Church, the United Greeks and the United Armenians, otherwise known as
                    Catholics of the Greek rite and Catholics of the Armenian rite. They both
                    acknowledge the supremacy of the pope, but they are permitted to retaiu many
                    peculiarities of organization and ritual. The United Greeks have an archbishop
                    at Gran in Hungary, and another at Lemberg in Galicia. The United Armenians are
                    found in Russia and Austria, but are still more numerous in the Ottoman empire.
                    A schism not unlike that of the Old Catholics broke out amongst them in 1869.
                    The pope by the bull <hi rend="italic">Reversuris</hi> claimed to exercise
                    certain rights which his predecessors had never enforced, and the Armenians not
                    only rebelled, but drove their patriarch Hussan into exile because he supported
                    the papal authority. The small church of Utrecht, which dates from the year
                    1704, retains the doctrines of the church of Rome, but emphasizes the
                    superiority of the councils over the pope, and has no connexion with the papal
                    organization.</p>
                <p>The Greek Church has beeu divided by political influences into several
                    independent communities, each with its own organization, but all united by a
                    common creed, and the consciousness of a common historic origin. The head of the
                    whole church was at one time the patriarch of Constantinople; but he never had
                    the same supremacy as the pope, and has gradually sunk to be little more than
                    tho head of that branch which is subject to the Porte. The Greek Church of
                    Russia began to establish its independence in the middle of the 13th century;
                    till about the middle of the 15th it sent its nominees for the office of
                    metropolitan of Kieff to the patriarch of Constantinople for consecration;
                    afterwards the consecration was performed by a council of Russian bishops; and
                    in 1589 the metropolitan was raised to be the ecclesiastical peer of the
                    patriarch. Peter the Great allowed the office to lapse, and supplied its place
                    by a council or synod, which still remains the central authority in the Russian
                    church, the emperor being recognized as the supreme defender of the faith, and
                    practically holding the place of chief administrator. The Austrian branch of the
                    Greek Church is also governed by a general synod composed of all the bishops
                    under the presidency of the patriarch of Carlowitz, and three provincial synods,
                    the Austrian proper meeting at Czernowitz, the Servian at Carlowitz, and the
                    Roumanian at Her-maunstadt. After the declaration of the political independence
                    of Greece, it was natural that theι⅛ should arise a desire for the independence
                    of the national church; and the patriarch of Constantinople was obliged to
                    recognize it» autonomy in 1850. A similar movement took place in Bulgaria in
                    1870. Though the Greek church is dominant in Russia, there is a very
                    considerable number of sectarian communities. Chief of these are the
                    “Raskolniks” (separatists or non-conformists), who seek to maintain a more
                    scrupulous accuracy in the ritual than the state church enforces. Of totally
                    different character are the heretical sects, some of whom, as the Molokani, show
                    great reverence fur the letter of scripture, while others, as the Skoptsi or <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n742/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0742-0713"/> Eunuchs, profess the wildest anti-scriptural
                    doctrines, and are carried into excesses of practical fanaticism.</p>
                <p>The Protestant churches of Western Europe, which have so marvellously exemplified
                    what naturalists call propagation by fission, may be doctrinally divided into
                    two great groups,—the “Lutheran,” which maintain the platform of the great
                    Reformer; and the “Reformed,” which have advanced further in their divergence
                    from Roman Catholicism. Politically there are three great classes—state
                    churches, free churches enjoying state endowments, and free churche3 which
                    either from necessity or choice are entirely independent. To the Lutheran group
                    belong the state churches of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, and that form prevails
                    also in Prussia, Hanover, and the Baltic provinces of Russia; the “Reformed”
                    includes the Cal vinistic churches of Holland and Scotland, and a great number
                    of ecclesiastical organizations in England, Scotland, Switzerland, Germany, and
                    France. The established church of England, though frequently classed with the
                    Lutheran group, has so many points of contact in doctrine and ritual, both with
                    Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other, that it may be
                    allowed to stand by itself. In Prussia, Baden, and a few of the smaller German
                    states, the two parties are associated under the title of the United Lutheran
                    Church, and have very close relations with the political administration. It is
                    impossible to do more than mention the minor subdivisions of Moravians,
                    Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Methodists, Independents, Quakers, Unitarians, for
                    which the reader may consult the separate articles, and such works as Stäudliu’s

                <p>Mahometanism or Islam has comparatively few adherents iu Europe, and has moreover
                    ceased to be aggressive. If it still occupies in Constantinople one of the
                    noblest of Christian churches, it is more than six hundred years since it
                    surrendered in Cordova one of the noblest of its mosques. Its adherents are
                    mainly Turks, Tatars, and Slavonians; and outside of Turkey they are nowhere
                    very numerous except in southern Russia. Judaism, which at one time had no small
                    proselytizing energy, has for a long period in Europe been nothing but the
                    religion of the people of Jewish descent. It is divided into two great
                    organizations, the so-called orthodox party representing traditionalism, and the
                    reformed party representing freedom of thought. Even among the orthodox
                    considerable laxity of observance is creeping in, and marriages with Christians
                    are growing more and more frequent. Buddhism is still professed by the Calmucks
                    of southern Russia; and the Tcheremisses, and several cognate tribes, and part
                    of the Lapps, Finns, and Samoyedes, still preserve their pagan creeds and
                    customs. The following table from Brachelli gives approximately the numerical
                    strength of the various religions:—</p>

                <p>The political history of Europe begins with the Greeks; but while they
                    contributed more extensively than any people have done since to the theory of
                    government, they have left practically no trace of their political organization
                    iu the present association of states. From first to last, in spite of religious
                    and political confederations, and of the unifying influence of the Macedonian
                    hegemony, they retained what in modern phraseology would be called their
                    particularism,—each city or state working out its own political development and
                    testing the value of the various forms of political life for itself. The Greeks
                    were not a conquering people; they felt nothing of the land-hunger of modern
                    nations; and even the great conquests to which they were led by the Asiatic
                    genius of Alexander the Great did not present themselves as acquisitions of
                    territory. They were great founders of cities, and their colonies were
                    distributed along the coasts of Europe from Spain in the west to the Black Sea
                    in the east; but if all the ground that they thus occupied were added together,
                    it would form a comparatively small country. The city, wherever it was,
                    continued an integral part of Hellas, but Hellas was. rather the name of a
                    people aud a civilization than of a country or a state. In this respect no
                    greater contrast could be found than that afforded by the next people of
                    European history. The history of Rome is almost from its beginning to its close
                    a history of conquest; the limits of its territorial advance were no sooner
                    fixed than the period of decadence set in. Where the Greeks had planted a city
                    the Romans subjugated a region. And thus it is that to the present day the lines
                    of Roman organization are as distinctly traceable on the political map as the
                    lines of Roman roadway in local topographies.</p>
                <p>As the Greeks had been the great defenders of Europe from the encroachments of
                    Persian ambition, so the Romans repulsed the Semitic power of the Carthaginians;
                    and as the defence against the Persians was the great determinating factor in
                    later Greek development, so the repulse of the Carthaginians was the prime
                    factor in the later Roman development. The Punic wars led to the conquest of
                    Sicily and Spain; a·ud the conquest of these gave at least a new emphasis to
                    what was already perhaps a national tendency. Iu 227 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> proconsuls were appointed for the province of Sicily and the province
                    of Sardinia and Corsica; the second Punic war left Rome master in 201 of the
                    greater part of Spain and supreme in the western Mediterranean; the capture of
                    Numantia in 133 put the rest of Spain in its power; the battle of Pydna secured
                    the subjugation of Greece; the campaigns of Julius Caesar added the vast
                    territory of Gaul to its domain; and when Augustus effected the great change in
                    the constitution which left its effete nomenclature to the 19th century, he was
                    able to adopt the Danube, the Rhine, and the ocean as the northeastern boundary
                    of the European part of his empire. His rule was paramount in all the region
                    which now comprises Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, western Holland, Rhenish
                    Prussia, parts of Baden and Wiirtemberg, most of Bavaria, Switzerland, Italy,
                    Tyrol, Austria Proper, Western Hungary, Croatia, Slavonia, Servia, Turkey in
                    Europe, aud Greece. The populations of many of these countries had already begun
                    to be Romanized in language and customs, but most of them were still distinctly
                    aliens. During the succeeding centuries of the empire a few comparatively
                    unimportant oscillations of froutier took place, aud a few additional elements
                    were added to the motley conglomerate of Roman citizenship; but the main
                    features were still the same when Constantine introduced his new administrative
                    distribution, aud fixed the seat of government in the city which still bears his
                    name. Christianity, which now received the sanction of the civil power, bad
                    gradually changed from an organ or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n743/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0743-0714"/> political disintegration into an organ of
                    political union. The worship of Christ and the service of the empire formed two
                    powerful bonds of association between the members of discordant races, and even
                    proved strong enough to break up several tribes into two sections,—one of which
                    was Christian and imperial, and the other pagan and barbarian. But even in the
                    reign of Constantine the frontiers were with difficulty maintained: he had
                    himself to resume the contest more than once with several powerful Germanic
                    peoples. Before long, the whole of the outer world to the north-east was in
                    motion. The Visigoths, or West Goths <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> were pressing
                    on the lower Danube; behind them, in the countries of the Bug and Dnieper, lay
                    the East Goths; and further east were the warlike, horse-loving Alans in the
                    country of the Don and the Volga. Other German tribes or confederations—Franks,
                    Saxons, Alemanni, Longobards—had settled or were settling along the upper Danube
                    aud the Rhine, and had crossed or were crossing into Roman territory. Far to the
                    east, over the country now known a3 Russia, the Scythians and Sarmatians were
                    nomadizing; and in the outskirts, along the Ural, we can dimly distinguish the
                    Magyars, the Avars, the Petchenegs, and other tribes that were afterwards to
                    force their way westward. In the reign of Valens a new impetus was given to the
                    barbarian hordes. The Huns, a wild nomadic people, suddenly appeared on the
                    lower Don, subjugated the Alans and the East Goths, and drove the defeated West
                    Goths across the Roman frontiers. As a Christian people the fugitives obtained
                    permission to settle on the south of the Danube; but the treatment they received
                    from the Roman officials drove them to rebellion; they defeated Valens in the
                    great battle of Adrianople, and threatened to invade Italy itself; and it was
                    not till the reign of Theodosius that they were persuaded by important
                    concessions to take peaceful possession of lands in Moesia, Dacia, and
                    Thracia.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the empire had, in spite of all the confusion of rival emperorsand
                    intrusive tribes, maintained a theoretical unity; in 395 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> a division was effected which practically proved definitive.
                    Arcadius, the eldest son of Theodosius, became emperor of the East, with his
                    capital at Constantinople; and Honorius his brother became emperor of the West,
                    with his capital not at Rome but at Ravenna. Had the Roman territory been
                    confined to Europe the division would have been extremely unequal, as Arcadius
                    only received the country to the south of the Danube and east of the Drinus, or,
                    in other words, little more than European 1αrkey and Greece; like the sultan’s,
                    his possessions were mainly in Asia and Africa.</p>
                <p>Instead of tracing the gradual disintegration of the Western empire, with its
                    monotonous detail of invasions, concessions, repulses, &lt;fcc., it will be well
                    to pass down to the 6th century, and see what has been effected in the interval.
                    We now find the German race almost everywhere in the ascendant. England is in
                    the hands of the English; the kingdom of the Franks extends from Brittany to
                    Thuringia; the West Goths are dominant in the greater part of Spain and nearly
                    all the country to the south of the Loire; the Suevi are in possession of the
                    remainder of Spain; the Burgundians occupy a compact territory, which includes,
                    besides the basin of the Rhone and Saone, parts of the contiguous basins of the
                    Rhine, the Seine, and the Loire; and the East Goths, under the sanction of the
                    emperor of the East, hold sway in the rest of western Europe, from Provence to
                    the Danube and from the Alps to the Sicilian Strait. Outside of the old frontier
                    the Gepidae (also German) have established a kingdom in the country to the north
                    of the Danube; on the. north-west they are conterminous with the Lombards; the
                    Thuringians are established to the west of the Böhmerwald; the Saxons he between
                    the Meuse and the Oder; the Danes are in possession of Denmark, and the other
                    Scandinavian peoples hold the country from which they derive their name. It
                    would seem as if Europe were in a fair way to become a German confederation, or,
                    it might be, a German empire. But all over the old Latin area the Germans are
                    ceasing to be Germans; and beyond that area, both in Europe and Asia, there are
                    other peoples destined to play a part in the settlement of the West. The
                    Bulgarians, a Mongolian tribe, have reached the country between the Dnieper and
                    the mouth of the Danube; the Czechs or Bohemians, already occupy the country
                    which now bears their name; the Croats are to the north of the Lombards; and
                    other Slavonic tribes have pushed south to the coast of the Adriatic.</p>
                <p>If we again pass down for about two centuries, the whole scene is changed. The
                    West Goths and East Goths have almost disappeared,—the former only living on in
                    the little kingdom of Asturia in the north of Spain; to the south of the Ebro
                    and the Douro the country is in the hands of Arabs, or Moors, who first crossed
                    the Strait of Gibraltar iu 711; the king of the Franks is that Charles the
                    Great, or Charlemagne, who is the mightiest monarch Europe has seen since
                    Constantine, and he has not only extended his kingdom on all sides, but he has
                    been chosen emperor of the West, and his authority is acknowledged from the Ebro
                    to the Elbe, and from the North Sea to the Tiber. A new political power has
                    arisen in the pope, or bishop of Rome, whose spiritual supremacy is beginning to
                    be widely recognized. The Eastern or Byzantine empire is more and more exposed
                    to the intrusion of Slavonians: they have under the name of Servians established
                    a considerable kingdom between the Adriatic and the middle Danube, and, mingled
                    with other races like the Bulgarians and the Avars, they occupy a large region
                    to the north of the Danube. Tn the country to the north of the Black Sea, as far
                    east as the Volga, has grown up a great kingdom called the kingdom of the
                    Khazars, with its capital at Balangiar or Astrakhan; the people is mainly of
                    Ugrian stock, but it has accepted the Jewish religion, and, allowing complete
                    religious toleration, is mingled with representatives of many nationalities;
                    politically it continues important for centuries as a bulwark against the
                    advance of the Slavonic tribes from the north. Of all these states from the
                    Atlantic to the Volga the one that showed most powerfully at the time, and which
                    has lived most prominently in historic record, is undoubtedly the empire of
                    Charles the Great; but of all it was the first to perish: even the nucleus of
                    his kingdom was divided into two—that of the West Franks and that of the East F
                    ranks.</p>
                <p>By the end of the 10th century the map again presents great modifications. The
                    Mahometans are still in possession of a great part of Spain, and the northern
                    region has been broken up into several independent states—the kingdom of Leon,
                    the little kingdom of Pampeluna, and the countship of Castile or Burgos. The
                    western Franks now form the kingdom of France with its capital at Paris, and
                    since 987 have been ruled by the dynasty of Capet, which will continue to modern
                    times. The duchies of Gascony, Aquitaine, Burgundy, and Normandy, and the
                    countships of Flanders, Champagne, and Toulouse, have been gathering strength,
                    and will maintain fur centuries a certain amount of independence. Germany has
                    recently become the representative of the Roman empire through the coronation of
                    Otto the Great of Saxony; and Otto III. is forming plans for the increase of the
                    imperial power. His authority is recognized by the dukes, not only of Lorraine,
                    Alemannia, Bohemia, and Carinthia, but by those of Sppleto, Benevento, and
                    Salerno, as well as by the minor potentates of Italy, with a few exceptions in
                    the far south. The duchy of Poland and the kingdom of Hungary are less formally
                    and <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n750/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0750-0715"/> steadily subordinate. Between Germany and France
                    lies the kingdom of Burgundy or Arles, which must not be confounded with the
                    duchy of Burgundy, and whose limits extend from Basel to Provence, including all
                    the lower basin of the Rhone. In the Balkan peninsula the Servian principality
                    maintains its independence, and the Bulgarians have extended their power from
                    the Danube southwards to Thermopylae. Among the peoples to the east the Russians
                    are already the most powerful; and the great empire of the Khazars has
                    disappeared.</p>
                <p>During the next five centuries Europe was full of hurry to and fro, of petty
                    strivings and plunderings, of great wars and invasions, of crusades and
                    conquests. At one time it appeared as if the Scandinavian peoples were to take
                    possession of England, and at another as if the English were to become masters
                    of France; the French attempted the annexation of Italy; the most powerful of
                    the Italian commonwealths extended its authority over the islands and mainland
                    of Greece; all Europe sent forth its armies for the recovery of the sacred
                    sepulchre; and all Europe was in alarm at the advance of the Ottoman power.
                    Amidst all the confusion and conflict, the modern nations were slowly taking
                    shape under the influence of a rapidly developing feudalism, and by the time we
                    reach the 16 th century we can speak of France and Germany, of Spain and
                    Portugal, of Poland, Russia, and Turkey, with something of the same meaning in
                    the words as they possessed till the Great Revolution.</p>
                <p>In the second decade of the 16th century the house of Hapsburg, in the person of
                    Charles V., attained an unprecedented preponderance. Through the action of the
                    laws of inheritance he acquired the Netherlands, the Spanish monarchy with the
                    kingdom of Naples, and the Austrian states of his paternal grandfather; and in
                    1519 he was elected to the imperial throne. On his abdication he left the German
                    states to his brother Ferdinand, and the rest of his possessions to his son
                    Philip. Between the various countries thus absurdly united with the Spanish
                    crown there was no kind of cohesion, and even in a period of repose the
                    association could hardly have been expected to last. The 16th century was
                    anything but a period of repose. The extent of the new monarchy raised the
                    rivalry of England and France; the Turkish power was dangerously aggressive in
                    the east; and religious discord added a new and potent element of
                    disintegration. War followed war in rapid succession; and many of the most
                    flourishing parts of the continent were laid waste with a desolation which
                    centuries of peace but partially effaced.</p>
                <p>It was not till 1648 that the treaty of Westphalia gave the greater part of the
                    continent another period of repose. The contest of which it was the immediate
                    termination left Sweden the most powerful of the Scandinavian states, with
                    important acquisitions from Denmark and Norway, from Germany, Russia, and
                    Poland. The Protestant Netherlands and Switzerland were now formally recognized
                    as independent. In Germany the house of Hapsburg was no longer in a position of
                    undisputed supremacy; the houses of Hohenzollern, Saxony, and Wittelsbach had
                    all gained in importance; and, instead of a powerful kingdom, there was nothing
                    but a “lax confederation of states.” The authority of Spain was still
                    acknowledged in Naples and Sicily, in Milan and Sardinia, as well as in the
                    Catholic portion of the Netherlands. Venice was the" principal native power in
                    the north of Italy, and a large part of the central region was in the hands of
                    the church. France had increased her territory by the acquisition of Alsace, and
                    was the most formidable military state in the continent. The three kingdoms of
                    the English crown had for some time been united under a common dynasty. Russia
                    was recovering her position; Poland was already beginning to decline; the
                    Turkish power was losing ground before the Germans and Hungarians, and, as a
                    natural consequence, the Hungarian kingdom was gathering strength.</p>
                <p>The rest of the 17th century was mainly remarkable for the series of wars with
                    which the name of Louis XIV. of France is more immediately associated. They
                    produced in the long run comparatively small alterations in the partitioning of
                    territory, as the treaty of Ryswick was in the main an instrument of
                    restoration. Of much greater effect was the death of Charles II. of Spain in
                    1700, followed as it was by the war of the Spanish succession, in which all the
                    principal states were more or less embroiled. At the close of the contest the
                    Bourbons of France got possession of Spain, Sicily, and Parma; the Austrian
                    branch of the house of Hapsburg obtained the Spanish Netherlands, Naples,
                    Sicily, and Milan; the Prussian kingdom of the Hohenzollerns was formally
                    recognized and its territory increased; the duke of Savoy became king of
                    Sardinia; and England secured the occupation of Gibraltar and Minorca. The
                    principal effect of the wonderful campaigns of Charles XII. of Sweden was to
                    leave his country in a condition so exhausted that, at the peace of 1720-1, it
                    had to give up a great part of what it had acquired during the 17th century. A
                    totally different result attended the equally daring but more politic
                    enterprises of Frederick the Great, who greatly increased his territory and
                    secured for his kingdom a brilliant future in Europe. About the same time, under
                    Peter the Great, Russia was making conquests both in south and north, and was
                    preparing to take her place side by side with the western powers.</p>
                <p>In the latter half of the 18th century, or, more precisely, about the year 1785,
                    the political map presented the following divisions. The German empire under
                    Joseph II. extended over an area of about 255,120 square miles, had a population
                    of upwards of 26,000,000, and consisted of no fewer than 289 states, of which 61
                    were free cities. The portion of the Austrian possessions which was not included
                    in the empire had an area of 152,000 square miles, and a population of
                    9,250,000; and the corresponding portion of Prussia had an area of 29,764 square
                    miles, and a population of 1,500,000. To France, at that time under Louis XVI.,
                    belonged no less than 201,970 square miles, and a population of 26,000,000. The
                    inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland numbered no more than 12,000,000; and
                    Spain, with her area of 195,600 square miles, had only about 10,500,000. Italy
                    was broken up among eleven states, and her total population was estimated at
                    16,250,000. The kingdom of tho Two Sicilies included the island of Sicily and
                    all the southern portion of the peninsula as far north as Terracina in the west
                    and Ascoli in the east; to the north lay the States of the Church, extending in
                    the east to the mouth of the Po, and in the west to the borders of Tuscany;
                    Tuscany in its turn was conterminous with the territory of Lucca and the duchy
                    of Modena; to the west of Modena lay the territory of Genoa and the duchy of
                    Parma; the duchy of Milan stretched along the northern half of the valley of the
                    Po from Lucarno to M·irandola; the kingdom of Sardinia included Savoy and all
                    the country westwards to the frontiers of Switzerland and France; and the
                    republic of Venice stretched its authority from Lucca in the west to Λquileia in
                    the east, as well as along the Dalmatian coast to the neighbourhood of the
                    Narenta. The republic of the united Netherlands had 7290 square miles of
                    territory, and 2,250,000 of a population. Norway was politically united with
                    Denmark; and the king of Denmark, Christian VII., consequently held sway over an
                    area of 165,830 square miles, and a population of 2,250,000. The Swedish
                    territory was about 233,860 square miles, but the population was only 3,000,000.
                    Switzerland occupied 14,880, with 1,750,000 inhabitants. The republic .of <pb

                    which it lost 6600 square miles, still possessed a territory of upwards of
                    223,000 square miles, and a population of about 14 000,000. Russia held
                    1,593,300 square miles, and Turkey about 215,000; and their respective
                    populations amounted to 25,000,000 and 15,000,000.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In 1789 the great French Revolution had fairly commenced, and for the next
                    quarter of a century the history of Europe is little more than a history of
                    France and her friends, and France and her foes. Never since the invasions of
                    the Germanic nations had there been such a complete overturning of all existing
                    political arrangements as was effected by the daring despotism of Napoleon. In
                    1812 the French empire included, not only France, Belgium, Holland, and
                    Luxembourg, but also the whole country to the left of the Rhine, the mainland of
                    Sardinia, part of Modena, Tuscany, and Rome, Geneva, Neufchatel, and Valais—a
                    total area of no less than 339,000 square miles, with an aggregate population of
                    42,366,000. The 35 states of the confederation of the Rhine, including the
                    kingdoms of Westphalia, Saxony, Bavaria, Wurtemberg, the grand duchies of
                    Frankfort, Berg, Baden, Hesse, and Wurzburg, were under the protection of
                    Napoleon; a similar position was held by the kingdoms of Italy and Naples, by
                    Illyria and the graud duchy of Warsaw; and French influence was paramount in
                    Switzerland, Prussia, Austria, and Denmark. England and Russia were the only
                    truly independent states of real political importance; Spain and Portugal were
                    fighting for their existence; and Sweden on the one hand, and Turkey on the
                    other, were practically outside of Europe.</p>
                <p>At the great monarchical congress of Vienna, an attempt was made to restore
                    nearly everything that the Revolution had undone. Austria recovered East Galicia
                    from Russia, and Tyrol and Salzburg from Bavaria; and in compensation for
                    Belgium, &amp;c., she obtained the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom of Italy, as well
                    as Dalmatia and Parma. Λ kingdom of the Netherlands was constructed out of
                    Belgium, Holland, and the German duchy of Luxembourg. The kingdom of Sardinia
                    was restored to Victor Emmanuel and strengthened by the addition of Genoa; and
                    Modena and Tuscany were assigned the one to Duke Francis IV. and the other to
                    Ferdinand the brother of the Austrian emperor. Naples and Sicily, as the kingdom
                    of the Two Sicilies, were given back to the former king Ferdinand; Spain and
                    Portugal to Ferdinand VII. and the house of Braganza respectively. Russia
                    incorporated Finland, Bessarabia, part of Moldavia, Ac.; the kingdom of Poland
                    was governed under Russian suzerainty by a vice-king, with a free constitution;
                    Cracow was declared a free state under the protection of Austria, Russia, and
                    Prussia. Switzerland was allowed to retain its federative system, and its
                    neutrality was guaranteed. Prussia not only got what she had lost by the peace
                    of Tilsit, but received a part of Poland, including Dantzic and Posen, the half
                    of the kingdom of Saxony, and a flourishing territory on the middle and lower
                    Rhine; Bavaria obtained the Palatinate of the Rhine; and Hanover, augmented by
                    East 1 risia, was made a kingdom. The restoration of a German empire being
                    rendered impracticable by the particularist tendencies of several of the larger
                    states, a German confederation, or Deutsches Bund, was substituted, under the
                    presidency of Francis of Austria and his successors. The diet of this
                    confederation had its seat at Frankfort-on-the-Maine, and consisted of the
                    representatives of no fewer than 38 sovereign states, which, besides the German
                    dominion of Austria, included the five kingdoms of Prussia, Bavaria, Hanover,
                    Saxony, and ⅛Viirtemberg, the electoral principality of Hesse-Cassel, seven
                    grand-duchies, nine duchies, ten prin cipalities, the landgravate of
                    Hesse-Homburg, and the four free cities, Frankfort, Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck.
                    England obtained possession of Malta in the Mediterranean and of Heligoland off
                    the Danish coast; and the Ionian islands were placed under an English
                    protectorate.</p>
                <p>And now a new glacial period of absolutism threatened to invade Europe. Alexander
                    of Russia, Frederick William of Prussia, and Francis of Austria united in a Holy
                    Alliance, which, based, perhaps honestly enough, on the noblest humanitarian
                    professions, proved practically an association for the strict preservation of
                    the royal prerogative against the encroachments of the people. The promise of
                    constitutional government made by many of the sovereigns to their subjects was
                    forgotten or ignored, and even when a constitution was granted it was not
                    unfrequently another form of despotic machinery. The Bourbons bourbonized in
                    France and Spain, and the policy of Metternich was dominant in Austria and
                    Italy. The pope did his best to restore the supremacy of the clergy by
                    concordats with the several states of Catholic Europe; the Jesuits were
                    re-established, and soon recovered a large part of their influence; and even the
                    Knights of St Johu were called back to a futile existence.</p>
                <p>But the principles of the Revolution were not dead; they only slumbered, and
                    before long they gave signs of awaking. Neither the political distribution of
                    the European territory established by the Congress of Vienna, nor the political
                    doctrines which mainly conditioned the distribution, were destined to endure.
                    The July revolution in France (1830), which drove out Charles X. and introduced
                    the constitutional government of Louis Philippe, was a signal of change. In the
                    same year the independence of Greece was permanently secured, after the treaty
                    of Adrianople had closed the Russo-Turkish war; and the separation of Belgium
                    from Holland was recognized by the five great powers in the London conference. A
                    great struggle for national existence burst out in Poland—only, however, to end
                    in its complete incorporation with Russia. By 1848 constitutionalism had made no
                    small progress; Russia, Austria, and Prussia were, indeed, as absolutist as
                    ever, but, besides England, France, and Switzerland, Spain and Portugal, Holland
                    and Belgium, Norway and Sweden, Denmark, Greece, and the greater number of the
                    minor German states had all attained a certain amount of political freedom. In
                    Germany, Duke Charles Augustus of Saxe-Weimar had given his subjects a
                    constitution as early as 1816; Nassau, Bavaria, and Baden followed the example
                    in 1818; and after violent disturbances the people of Würtemberg secured the
                    same privileges. If the July revolution of 1830 had been potent, much more
                    poteut was the more radical revolution of February 1848. The storm swept over
                    the Continent, and when it had ceased the political aspect of Europe had
                    changed. By the dreadful “Days of March,” the king of Prussia, Frederick William
                    IV., was forced to become a “constitutional king,” and a national assembly was
                    soon after instituted. In Austria, Metternich had to flee for his life, and
                    Ferdinand was constrained to submit to the demands of the Liberals. In Italy,
                    Rome expelled the pope and declared itself a republic; Sicily expelled the
                    Bourbons and chose the duke of Genoa as their king; and the northern states rose
                    against Austrian domination. A reaction, however, soon again set in. France
                    passed from a republican to a strongly monarchical government; the Prussian king
                    cancelled his constitution and issued another in its stead; Austria was
                    successful in putting down the Hungarian and Bohemian patriots and inflicting a
                    terrible revenge; and Italy saw the defeat of the army of Charles Albert, and
                    had to submit again to Austrian despotism in Lombardy, papal despotism in Rome,
                    and Bourbon despotism in Sicily and Naples. 1 he hope of a real German unity

                    Frankfort parliament, died away; Austria was still in the ascendant, and under
                    her countenance and support all liberal movements were violently suppressed in
                    the south German states. The first great disturbance of the sullen and sultry
                    peace which settled down over Europe was occasioned by the claim of Russia to
                    the protectorate of the Greek Christians in the Turkish empire, and her invasion
                    of the Danubian principalities. England and France determined to maintain the
                    integrity of Turkey, and the Crimean war was the result. By the treaty of Paris,
                    which closed the contest (March 1856), Russia ceded a small piece of territory
                    to the north of the Danube, the navigation of the river was declared free,
                    Moldavia and Wallachia were increased by the addition of the Russian surrender
                    and placed along with Servia under the protection of the contracting powers, and
                    the neutrality of the Black Sea was established. The real power of Turkey was
                    hardly increased; and in 1859 she had to utter useless protests against the
                    principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, which united into one under the name
                    of Roumania, and chose Alexander Cusa, a Moldavian nobleman, as their chief. The
                    Italian kingdom of Sardinia, which had joined in the Crimean war as an ally of
                    England and France, was soon to play a much more brilliant part in Europe. With
                    the powerful assistance of France it drove Austria out of Lombardy, and
                    practically secured the leadership among the states of Italy. In 1860 the first
                    Italian parliament contained representatives, not only of Sardinia and Lombardy,
                    but also of Tuscany, Modena, Parma, and the Roman Legations, all these states
                    having voted by general suffrage to cast in their lot with Sardinia. The same
                    year saw the marvellous campaigns of Garibaldi; and on the 17th March 1861
                    Victor Emmanuel was recognized as king of Italy by all the Italian states except
                    Austrian Venetia and the city of Rome. In 1864 another important alteration of
                    political boundaries was effected in the north. The provinces of
                    Schleswig-Holstein, occupied by a partly Danish and partly German population,
                    were conquered by the united forces of the German confederation. Before long it
                    was evident that Prussia meant to appropriate them to herself as of great
                    service to the development of her marine. By the Gastein convention of 1865 it
                    was arranged that the government of Schleswig should fall to Prussia and that of
                    Holstein to Austria, while Lauenburg was yielded to Prussia for 2⅜ millions of
                    Danish rixdollars. This treaty, however, proved only a very temporary
                    settlement,—the real question at issue being whether Prussia or Austria was to
                    be the dominant power in Germany. The diet, which, according to the treaty of
                    Vienna, ought to have been arbiter between them, was too weak to give effect to
                    any decision: it sided with Austria, and mobilized its army by the decree of
                    14th July. By 3d July 1866 the fate of Germany was decided by the battle of
                    Königgrätz or Sadowa, and on the 23d of August the treaty of Prague was signed.
                    The Austrians ceded the Venetian territory to the Italians (who had naturally
                    seized the opportunity of the war), gave up their claim to Schleswig-Holstein,
                    and promised to recognize the German confederation and any territorial changes
                    effected within its limits. In 1866-67 the confederation was constituted, under
                    the direction of Prussia, to include all the German states to the north of the
                    Maine; they were to have one common federal legislation and a federal army,
                    while in everything Prussia was to have the pre-eminence. The duchy of
                    Luxembourg in the same years threatened to involve Europe in a new war, as
                    Prussia refused to permit its transfer by the king of Holland to the French
                    emperor; but peace was secured by a conference of the great powers in London
                    (May 1867), who guaranteed the neutrality of the territory and secured the
                    dismantling of its fortresses.</p>
                <p>Another step in the unification of Germany was taken iu 1868 by the
                    reconstruction of the Zollverein or customs union. Meanwhile Austria had been
                    turning her attention to her domestic difficulties, and had settled the most
                    important by the recognition of the autonomy of Hungary, which was henceforth to
                    be associated with Austria proper on equal terms. In June 1867 Francis Joseph
                    and his consort were formally crowned at Pesth as king and queen of Hungary. The
                    year 1870 saw the completion of Italian unity by the occupation and annexation
                    of the city of Rome, and, what was of still greater consequence to Europe at
                    large, the rise of a dispute between France and Prussia about the succession to
                    the throne of Spain. The matter was of little real moment to either, but the
                    French Government was eager for the fray, and Prussia was not slow to take up
                    the gage. If the strength of the two combatants be considered, the terrible
                    conflict was soon over. The German troops, who had crossed the frontier in
                    August 1870, entered Paris in March 1871; the preliminary peace had been signed
                    at Versailles in February; and the final peace was concluded 10th May. Prussia’s
                    position in Germany and Europe was established, and her king had been recognized
                    as emperor of the German confederation on 18th June, in the palace of
                    Versailles. Europe again enjoyed peace for a few years; but in 1877Russia
                    declared war against Turkey, ostensibly as protector of the Christian
                    populations who were suffering from the anarchy of her government. In Europe and
                    Armenia the conflict continued with growing success on the part of the Russians
                    till the preliminary peace of San Stefano. The alterations demanded by Russia
                    were of the most sweeping kind, and would practically have removed Turkey from
                    the rank of a European power, as the territory to be left under her control was
                    both of small extent and discontinuous. The conclusion of the treaty on such
                    conditions was strongly opposed by the British Government, and for a time it
                    almost appeared as if Europe were to be involved in a far more terrible war than
                    that which had come to a close. After much political finessing it was at length
                    decided that the matter in dispute should be submitted to an international
                    congress, and the plenipotentiaries of the various powers accordingly met at
                    Berlin on Thursday, 13th June 1878.</p>
                <p>Such in the most meagre outline are the principal changes in the political
                    distribution of the territory of Europe. A clearer idea of the rise of the
                    several powers of the present time may be obtained from the following equally
                    rapid survey.</p>
                <p>Great Britain began in the little Saxon kingdom of Wessex, which, according to
                    the usual account, dates from Cerdic’s settlement in 519 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> and by 880 had extended its authority as far north as the Forth and
                    Clyde. The remoter portions of this territory afterwards gravitated now to
                    England and now to Scotland, till at last the boundaries between the two
                    kingdoms became what they still remain. Wales was subjugated by Edward I. in
                    1282; and the conquest of Ireland, begun in 1169 under Henry IL, was completed
                    by 1610. The English and Scottish crowns were united on the accession of James
                    of Scotland to the English throne in 1603, and the two countries became
                    politically one by the Act of Union in 1707. The representation of Ireland in
                    the English parliament dates only from 1801.</p>
                <p>France practically had its commencement when Hugh Capet united the duchy of
                    Francia with the minor territories still left in the hands of the petty
                    Carolingian kings, and established the capital at Paris. Its subsequent growth
                    was very gradual, and the successive additions were obtained partly by conquest,
                    partly by purchase, and partly by matrimonial alliances. Philip I. bought the
                    duchy of Berri; Philip Augustus secured possession of Anjou, Maine, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n753/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0753-0718"/> Touraine, and Poitou, and of Normandy,
                    Vermandois, Alençon, Auvergne, and Evreux; St Louis obliged the count of
                    Toulouse not only to give up part of his territory, but also to recognize the
                    reversionary rights of the crown; Philip IV. added the countship of Lyonnais,
                    and John incorporated Champagne and Brie. With the accession of the house of
                    Valois the duchy of that name naturally became part of the royal domain, and
                    shortly afterwards Dauphiné was obtained from the childless Hubert II. The long
                    English wars interrupted the advance and dismembered the kingdom, and it was not
                    till 1450 that the king of France was again in possession of his full
                    inheritance. In 1477 the great duchy of Burgundy was incorporated with
                    the-croavn: Provence, the Boulonnais, and Picardy were all acquired in 1481; and
                    in 1488 the death of the last duke of Brittany paved the way for the
                    incorporation of his duchy. Henry IV. brought part of Navarre, Bearn, and Foix;
                    Louis XIII. united Artois with the crown; and Louis XIV. secured not only the
                    greater part of Alsace, but also French Flanders, and Franche Comté. Corsica,
                    which had been conquered from Genoa in 1768, and Avignon and the Venaissin,
                    which had been held by the popes, were incorporated in 1791.</p>
                <p>Austria was originally a <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> established by Charles the
                    Great for the defence of Bavaria against the Avars. It was made a duchy by
                    Frederick Barbarossa in 1156, and in 1192 was increased by the addition of
                    Styria. The acquisition of Carinthia, Tyrol, and Trieste took place in the 14th
                    century; and in 1453 the duchy was made an archduchy by the emperor Frederick.
                    Dalmatia was gained by the treaty of Cambray in 1508; Hungary, Bohemia, and
                    Silesia, by the marriage of the archduke Ferdinand, the brother of Charles V.,
                    with the Hungarian princess in 1526; Galicia and Lodomeria at the partition of
                    Poland in 1772; and Bukovina from Turkey in 1778.</p>
                <p>The present German empire dates, as has been seen, only from 1872. Prussia,
                    conquered from the pagan Slavonians by the Teutonic knights of the 13th century,
                    was in 1525 granted by the Polish king Sigismund I. as an hereditary duchy to
                    Albert of Brandenberg, and in 1611 became independent of the Polish crown. In
                    1701 Duke Frederick was permitted by the emperor to assume the title of king of
                    Prussia; and under his grandson Frederick the Great the territory of the new
                    kingdom was increased by Silesia and large parts of Poland. In 1866 Hanover,
                    Hesse-Cassel, Nassau, and Frankfort were annexed.</p>
                <p>The battle of Morgarten in 1315 secured the independence of the Forest Cantons of
                    Switzerland; and in 1352 the first real confederation was formed by Schwyz, Uri,
                    Unterwalden, Lucerne, Zurich, Glarus, Zug, and Bern. Aargau or Argovia and
                    Thurgau or Thurgovia were annexed in 1415, and Ticino or Tessin in 1418. Soleure
                    or Solothurn and Freiburg or Fribourg joined the confederacy in 1481, Basel and
                    Schaffhausen in 1501, and Appenzell in 1513; St Gall, Geneva, Neufchatel or
                    Neuenburg, Valais or Wallis, and the Grisons or Graubünden shortly afterwards
                    became associated states; and in 1536 Vaud or Waadt was conquered from the dukes
                    of Savoy.</p>
                <p>The kingdom of Spain was formed by the union of Castile and Aragon in 1479.
                    Castile had become a kingdom in 1033, and had successively incorporated Toledo,
                    Leon, and Galicia; and Aragon, which represented the older kingdom of Sobrarve,
                    had gradually got possession of Catalonia and the countship of Barcelona,
                    Valencia, Majorca, Minorca, and Iviça. The conquest of Granada in 1492 and of
                    Navarre in 1512 completed the territorial extension. Portugal, which has more
                    than once been incorporated with Spain, was erected into a kingdom in 1139.</p>
                <p>lhe beginnings of the Russian empire are usually traced to a body of Scandinavian
                    adventurers in the 9th century, but the real commencement of the present
                    monarchy is the grand duchy of Moscow, which, in the 14th century, under Ivan
                    Kalita, began to be paramount among the various Russian principalities. During
                    the next 200 years these were gradually subdued, the last and greatest of all,
                    Novgorod, being incorporated in 1478. In 1654 the chief of the Zaporogian
                    Cossacks recognized the Russian supremacy, and Smolensk and part of White Russia
                    were annexed. In 1721 Livonia, Esthonia, Ingermanland, and part of Finland were
                    ceded by Sweden; in 1742 another part of Finland was added; in 1772 the northern
                    and eastern portions of White Russia, and in 1774 Azoff, Kertch, Yenikale, and
                    Kinburn. The whole of the Crimea was incorporated in 1783, and ten years after,
                    Volhynia, Podolia, and the government of Minsk. The year 1795 saw the annexation
                    of Lithuania, Courland, and Samogitia, and the first decade of the 19th century
                    the successive incorporation of Georgia, Mingrelia, and the remainder of
                    Finland. Imeritia was added in 1810, Bessarabia in 1812, and the duchy of Warsaw
                    in 1815; and the conquest of the Caucasian region was completed in
                    1859-1864.</p>
                <p>The Scandinavian kingdoms date from the 8th and 9th centuries; and their
                    territory has been at various periods very differently distributed among
                    themselves. An amalgamation was effected by the union of Calmar in 1397, and
                    lasted till 1524. The present union of Norway and Sweden dates from the treaty
                    of Kiel in 1814.</p>
                <p>To no man, however vast his experience and varied his sympathies, is it granted
                    to form even an approximate estimate of all the multitudinous forces that are at
                    work within the limits of a single country, and still less is it possible to
                    form such an estimate if the field of observation include the heterogeneous
                    activities of such an area as Europe. The local current is apt to be taken for
                    the general, and the recoil of the wave for the retreat of the tide. Still there
                    are movements and tendencies which force themselves on the notice of even the
                    superficial observer, about whose present potency there can be no question,
                    whatever antagonistic tendencies may be secretly gathering strength below the
                    surface or in the remoter parts of the area. Of several of these mention more or
                    less distinct has already been made, but it may be well to attempt a more
                    systematic survey.</p>
                <p>We have seen that nationalism is powerfully at work; the tendency to give
                    practical application in the political domain to the principle familiarity
                    expressed in the phrase <hi rend="italic">se ressemble s'assemble,</hi> birds of
                    a feather flock together. The so-called nations of Europe are still in painful
                    process of formation,—some in one stage and some in another, but all without
                    exception very imperfectly organized. As a mere vocable the word nation is old
                    enough, but the thought which it now vaguely expresses is a thought that men are
                    but beginning to think. Europe has had its tribes and its kingdoms, its
                    village-communities, its cities, its Achaean leagues, its Hanseatic
                    confederations, its republics, its empires; it is only developing its nations.
                    Hence iu part the difficulty of attaining a satisfactory definition of
                    nationality; and hence the endless collisions and confusions that arise in the
                    practical application of the principle. If all people of the same blood spoke
                    the same language, held the same religion, and occupied continuous territory,
                    the whole question would be solved. But, as has been seen, this is as far as
                    possible from being the case in Europe; and neither blood, nor language, nor
                    religion, nor continuity of territory can be accepted as master of the practical
                    arrangement. The principle of nationalism has consequently to work by
                    compromise. It sometimes appears as a restorative and conservative, sometimes as
                    an innovating and creative force; and any attempt to insist that it shall be
                    exclusively this or that is certain to be abortive.</p>

                <p>Here it is on the side of the weak and oppressed, and seems humane and benign;
                    there on the side of the strong and despotic, and seems stern and cruel. In
                    spite of all difficulties and opposition it is making rapid progress, and is
                    likely to be a powerful factor in Europe for generations to come,—building up
                    political unities, rehabilitating decadent languages, and calling new
                    literatures into life. Greece and Italy, Belgium and Bohemia, Hungary and
                    Roumania, are testimonies of its power in the past decades of the century: who
                    will say what it will have accomplished before the century is done?</p>
                <p>As a natural complement of nationalism we have internationalism, which in certain
                    aspects may be regarded as a stage in the progress to cosmopolitanism. Just in
                    proportion as the various nations develop and recognize their national
                    individuality they become conscious of their true relations to each other, and
                    find the necessity of regulating their mutual intercourse and common activity;
                    isolation is impossible. Reciprocity must increase with the capacities and
                    desiree of each: there are many things which can be attained only by concerted
                    action or division of labour. The tendency of internationalism is displayed in
                    the .purely political domain by the growth of international law, and the gradual
                    endeavours after a system by which international disputes may be settled by
                    arbitration and discussion rather than by armaments and devastation. That it
                    will end before long in something like a confederation of European states the
                    optimist believes and the philanthropist hopes. Every European congress
                    familiarizes the idea and establishes the habit. In the social domain the
                    tendency is equally potent. Facilities of travel and accumulation of wealth are
                    annually leading a greater proportion of the citizens of one country to make
                    personal acquaintance with the citizens of another. Ignorance and bigotry are
                    naturally lessened, though there are indeed an ignorance and a bigotry which
                    return from abroad only more ignorant and bigoted than before. It needs no
                    special insight to recognize the importance to the great progress of the world
                    of such an innovation as the railway; but it would require more than human grasp
                    of intellect to estimate the enormous extent and complexity of its influence. It
                    is the one touch of art which will make the whole world kin. As a mighty
                    upheaval lifts an archipelago of islands into a continent, so is this one power
                    heaving Europe into unity. The movement is perhaps most noticeable in matters of
                    little intrinsic importance as in the gradual dying out of national and
                    provincial costumes before the invasions of Parisian taste: but to the
                    philanthropist nothing can be uninteresting that either indicates or accelerates
                    the advance. In literature and art we have a still more important development of
                    internationalism; for it was in this domain that it first made itself powerfully
                    felt.. Though Spain, France, England, Germany, and Holland have each given birth
                    to distinct schools of painting, the influence of Italy has been paramount from
                    the beginning; and though the literatures of the several countries are
                    distinguished from each other by much that is characteristically local and
                    national, they have all been based more or less directly on the classical work
                    of Greece and Rome, and undergone continual modifications from their mutual
                    interaction. It is hard to conceive what would have been the progress of English
                    literature apart from the influence of Dante and Boccaccio, or, in later times,
                    the progress of French literature if Voltaire and his contemporaries had
                    received no inspiration from this side the Channel. To write the history of any
                    literature is impossible if no account is taken of its foreign indebtedness.
                    This mutual interaction is rapidly increasing, and in spite of the recent
                    additions to the number of distinct literary areas, it is imprinting more and
                    more of a common character on the whole. The novels of a Scott or the poems of a
                    Byron sweep over the Continent, and come back in manifold reverberations from
                    Germany and France, from Sweden and Spain. If the phrase the republic of letters
                    is appropriate, still more appropriate is the republic of science; if literature
                    is becoming international, science is international However bitter the
                    jealousies that may separate France and Germany, the French savant watches
                    eagerly for the work of his German compeer, and the German cannot afford to
                    disdain the contributions of the Frenchman. International congresses of the
                    representatives of particular departments of research are becoming mere matters
                    of course; a meteorological congress met at Vienna in 1868, a health congress at
                    Brussels in 1877. An association ultimately joined by nearly all the Continental
                    nations was formed at Berlin in 1866 to determine the meridian between Palermo
                    and Christiania, and thus furnish a standard unit for Europe; and in 1877 a
                    geographical congress for the exploration of Africa was opened under the
                    presidency of the king of the Belgians. How necessary such co-operation really
                    is is shown by the loss that science has already sustained from the existence of
                    different methods of registration and observation: the labour of years has not
                    unfrequently been rendered utterly useless to the general progress by the
                    employment of incommensurable systems. Considerable advances have happily been
                    made towards the universal adoption of the same metrical and monetary standards.
                    The French system of weights and measures was introduced into the Netherlands in
                    1820, into Spain in 1859, into Portugal in 1868, into Germany in 1872, and into
                    Roumania in 1876. In 1881 it will become obligatory in Norway and Sweden. A
                    monetary league, by which they agreed to perfect reciprocity of currency, was
                    formed in 1865 by France, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland, and they were joined
                    by Greece in 1875, and by Roumania in 1876. Uniformity of coinage was
                    established throughout the German empire in 1872, and in 1875 the Scandinavian
                    states agreed to adopt a common system. In 1874 a postal union was constituted
                    by a convention at Bern between Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Denmark, France,
                    Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway,
                    Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Servia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey; and
                    this has been followed by a similar telegraphic union.</p>
                <p>A third tendency fostered by the same conditions as internationalism is w hat is
                    known as religious and political toleration. The name is an unhappy one, as it
                    implies the mutual obnoxiousness of the various religious and political parties,
                    but the time has hardly come when it can be considered a misnomer; the foremost
                    countries of Europe are still far from having attained the full enjoyment of
                    that intellectual liberty which formed the ideal of a Milton, a De Tocqueville,
                    or a Stuart Mill. Thanks, indeed, to the influence of the French Revolution,
                    rapid progress has been made during the present century, and the severer forms
                    of persecution have fallen decidedly out of fashion. The Jews are the most
                    notable monument of the change. Their history for centuries was full of blood
                    and tears; they were despised and rejected; their very name was a byword and
                    reproach. The 19th century has seen them gradually admitted to all the rights of
                    citizens in the most flourishing countries of the continent, guiding the
                    destinies of nations and mingling their blood with the proudest nobilities. In
                    the more backward and conservative countries they still labour under many
                    disadvantages: from Norway and Russia Proper they are excluded by law, and in
                    Portugal and Spain they are emphatically aliens. The same number of Dr Lehmann’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Per Israelite</hi> one of the organs of the orthodox party,
                    reports that Roumania is preparing a law for the civic and political
                    equalization of the native Jews, and that in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n755/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0755-0720"/> Bulgaria the hatred against the Jews is so great
                    that, on the evacuation of Rustchuk by the Turks, the Bulgarians sent a
                    deputation requesting the Russian commander to expel the whole Jewish community
                    and to plunder their shops. The liberal movement of Roumania was dictated partly
                    by a desire to obtain the sympathy of Western Europe; for until recently
                    persecution of the Jews was carried on as vigorously there as in the
                    neighbouring countries. Between Roman Catholics and Protestants the ancient feud
                    has lost some of its bitterness. In Scotland and Eugland the legal emancipation
                    of the Catholics in 1829 has been followed by social changes of great
                    importance, the extent of which may be estimated by the little opposition which
                    was offered to the restoration of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in Scotland in
                    1878. In Prussia and throughout the German empire there has been a recrudescence
                    of animosity between the confessions; but it is to be observed that the contest
                    is rather between the state and a political party than between the Catholics as
                    Catholics and the Protestants as Protestants. In fact, it is only part of a
                    wider contest which is being fought under varying forms throughout the greater
                    part of Europe, as to whether the state or the church is to be the dominant
                    power. Many of the measures which the Government has adopted have certainly led
                    to what is practically religious persecution; but this persecution is totally
                    different in its character from the persecutions of the Huguenots in the 17th
                    century. The most extreme exertions of power have been the suppression of
                    religious communities, the removal and appointment of priests and bishops by the
                    civil authorities, the prohibition of religious processions, and in 1876 the
                    closing of all Catholic schools and the assertion of complete state control over
                    all church property. In Switzerland the movement was similar; the Old Catholic
                    party was recognized by the state in 1875, and the cathedrals of Bern and Geneva
                    handed over to its clergy. In Belgium the Liberal and Protestant minority have
                    excited violent disturbances in several cities, as Ghent and Brussels, and the
                    social fermentation has been carried to dangerous extremes; but by the
                    constitution there is full religious liberty, all the churches are subsidized by
                    the Government, and by a curious anomaly the heaviest subsidy is paid to the
                    weakest denomination. The relations established between Italy and the pope, by
                    the absolute irreconcilability of their territorial claims, has naturally led
                    the Italian Government to adopt a strongly anti-ecclesiastical policy: the state
                    religion is Roman Catholicism, but the suppression of monasteries has been
                    vigorously carried out, and religious processions outside of the churches can
                    only take place by special permission of the prefects. The constitution
                    sanctions full religious liberty. In France Roman Catholics, Protestants, and
                    Jews all receive grants from the public treasury. The Russian Government
                    exercises its authority in favour of the Greek church in a way that frequently
                    infringes on the liberties of other religionists, and no secession can take
                    place from the pale of the establishment; but at the same time the profession of
                    any creed is legally allowed. Spain, by the last of her many revolutions, has
                    taken a step backwards: private worship is still permitted to non-Catholic
                    religions, and foreigners are considered inviolable, but all public
                    manifestations, by printed notices, emblems, or otherwise, are strictly
                    prohibited.</p>
                <p>It has Happily become impossible for even the most retrograde of nations to
                    recall the days of the Inquisition,—a fact that is at least partly due to the
                    influence of another great movement, which may be distinguished as
                    humanitarianism. This movement is evident in so manÿ departments of thought and
                    action, here introducing a less painful process of killing into the
                    slaughter-house, and there affecting the decision of questions of speculative
                    theology, that only a few suggestive facts need be mentioned. The penal codes of
                    all European nations have been cleared of most of their mediaeval barbarism; and
                    the infliction of direct physical suffering is reserved for the more brutal
                    class of criminals. Instruments of torture are mere antiquarian curiosities. The
                    punishment of death, once the common penalty for trivial and heinous offences,
                    already appears to many minds .as altogether inhuman, and has been completely
                    abolished or discontinued in Holland, Belgium, Portugal, Switzerland, and
                    Roumania. The bill for its abolition in Italy in 1875 was lost by 73 to 36, and
                    the district of Tuscany, which had adopted the abolition about twenty years
                    before, was forced to conform to the general law. In 1876, however, the
                    committee for the revision of the penal code unanimously voted for the
                    abolition. The introduction of private instead of public executions is a step in
                    the same direction, though like many other partial measures it may delay the
                    complete disuse of capital punishment, Mention may also be made of the
                    amelioration of prison discipline, of the magnificent progress in the treatment
                    of the insane which has been effected by the philanthropists of the last two
                    generations, of the enormous increase which has taken place in the number of our
                    hospitals, asylums, and benevolent institutions, and of the growing attention
                    that is paid to relief of the sufferings of the lower animals. Whatever be the
                    wisdom of the measure, the law of 1876 in England in regard to vivisection
                    speaks volumes for the advance of the humanitarian movement. In this respect as
                    in others the various European nations are in very different stages: while the
                    English magistrate is fining a collier or carter for lending his countenance to
                    a cockfight, the Spanish magistrate is applauding the exploits of a <hi
                    rend="italic">picador</hi> or <hi rend="italic">matador.</hi> That we are
                    approximating to a unity of sentiment is shown among other things by the support
                    which has been given to the Geneva convention for the mitigation of the
                    sufferings of the wounded in war, which w as formed in 1864 by the
                    representatives of Baden, Belgium, Denmark, France, Hesse, Italy, the
                    Netherlands, Prussia, Switzerland, and Wiirtemberg, and which has since obtained
                    the adhesion of Greece, Great Britain, and Turkey. (∏∙ A. w.)</p>
