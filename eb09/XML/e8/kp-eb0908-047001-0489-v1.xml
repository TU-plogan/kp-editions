                <p><label type="entry">EPHRAEM SYRUS, or Ephraim the Syrian</label>, flourished in
                    the 4th century of the Christian era, acquired great renown among his
                    contemporaries, and has since been esteemed one of the most celebrated fathers
                    of the church. So highly was he honoured that, according to the testimony of
                    Jerome <hi rend="italic">(Script. Eccl.,</hi> c. 115), his homilies were read in
                    many of the churches of Greece immediately after the reading of scripture. His
                    name is almost never mentioned without the prefix <hi rend="italic">Mor</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">Mari</hi> (master). Of the events of his life but little
                    is known, and what has been handed down to us is much lessened in value by an
                    admixture of apocryphal stories. The following is a translation of a short
                    memoir of Ephraem from a Syriac source. The original is found in a 14th century
                    MS., which is printed by Assemani in the Roman edition of Ephraem’s works.</p>
                <p>“The blessed Mor Ephraem was a Syrian by birth; his father was of Nisibis, his
                    mother of the city Amida. His father was an idolatrous priest, and they lived in
                    the time of Constantine Victor <hi rend="italic">[i.e.</hi> the Great]. His
                    father expelled him from home because he was not obedient to his wicked will; he
                    therefore went and lived with the holy Mor Jacob, the bishop of Nisibis, and led
                    an entire life of godliness until the time of Jovian [when Nisibis was, in 363,
                    surrendered to the Persians]. He then left that place and came to the city
                    Edessa, where he received the gift of the Holy Ghost, and abundantly supplied
                    the church with the gifts and doctrine of the Spirit. After a time he went to
                    the desert of Egypt, and from thence to Caesarea of Cappadocia to Basil, and
                    received from him the imposition of hands for the diaconate. He immediately
                    returned to Edessa, and ended his life there in the year 684 (of the Greeks), on
                    the ninth day of Haziron (June), that is, in the year 373 of the advent of our
                    Lord.”</p>
                <p>A much longer life, also extant in Syriac, gives no more historical data which
                    can be relied on; and the so-called testament or will, which professes to
                    contain curious autobiographical matter referring to his religious history and
                    feelings, is of doubtful authenticity. A careful recension of the piece is given
                    by Overbeck in his <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">Selecta.</hi>
                    The statement of the manuscript just quoted, that Ephraem was born at Nisibis,
                    has the authority of Sozomenus in its favour; and Ephraem himself, in his
                    commentary on Genesis, refers to Mesopotamia as his native country. The Syrian
                    sources are unanimous about the date of his death, and, according to Dr Bickell,
                    the dubiety of Rödiger has arisen from a misinterpretation. At Edessa Ephraem
                    adopted a monastic life, and is said to have dwelt in a cave near the town. The
                    story of his visit to Egypt is probably mythical. Though the external facts of
                    Ephraem’s life are thus few and doubtful, there is no question of the manner in
                    which he impressed his genius and spirit upon his own age, or of the great value
                    of his literary remains. His popularity and influence among the luxurious and
                    refined people of Edessa were very great. He wrote against Julian, and combated
                    the heresies of Bardesanes the Gnostic philosopher, of the Arians and
                    Sabellians, of the Manichaeans and Novatians. Whether he was acquainted with
                    Greek or not is a matter of dispute which can hardly be decided by his writings;
                    but Geiger has rendered it probable that he had come considerably under Jewish
                    influence, not a few words being employed by him in an acceptation foreign to
                    Syriac, but well-known in the Hebrew of his time and country. His works consist
                    of commentaries, sermons, tractates, and hymns. Of many the original Syriac
                    appears to have perished; and they are only preserved in Greek, Latin, Armenian,
                    or Slavonic. The greater proportion of the sermons and tractates are composed in
                    a metrical form, the verses being of various measures—tetrasyllable,
                    heptasyllabic, or octosyllabic,—and arranged in strophes varying from four to
                    twelve lines. Rhyme and assonance are both employed at irregular intervals, and,
                    as Geiger has pointed out in the <hi rend="italic">Ztschr. d. 1). Morg.
                        Ces.,</hi> 1867, a considerable number of the pieces are alphabetical or
                    nominal acrostics, though the fact is sometimes disguised in the MSS. by the
                    misarrangement of the lines. That he has applied his verse to such prosaic
                    purposes as the refutation of heresy and the inculcation of orthodoxy would seem
                    of itself to make heavily against Ephraem’s reputation as a poet; but it is
                    impossible to read some even of his most unpromising pieces without admitting
                    that he has a genuine poetic gift. Some of his hymns on the death of children
                    may rank for pathos and happy simplicity with the finest lyrics of their class;
                    and there can be no doubt of the imaginative force of such lines as the
                    following :—“For before that time Death by this was made arrogant, and boasted
                    himself of it, ‘ Behold priests and kings lie bound by me in the midst of my
                    prisons.’ A mighty war came without warning against the tyrant Death; and as a
                    robber, the shouts of the foe surprised him and humbled his glory. The dead
                    perceived a sweet savour of life in the midst of Hades; and they began to spread
                    the glad tidings among one another that their hope was accomplished.” Several of
                    the Nisibean poems are impassioned odes on events in contemporary history, and
                    are thus of value to the historical student. The <hi rend="italic">Repentance of
                        Nineveh</hi> partakes of the character of the epic.</p>
                <p>The principal edition of Ephraem’s works was prepared and published at Rome under
                    the patronage of the popes Clement XL, Clement XII., and Benedict XIV. It
                    consists of three volumes of Greek texts and three volumes of Syriac texts, with
                    a Latin translation. The first vol., published in 1732, was edited by Joseph
                    Simon Assemani, the 4th and 5th (1737 and 1740) by Petrus Benedictus, the 6th
                    (1743) by Benedictus (who died before it was completed) and Stephanus Evodius
                    Assemani, and the 2d and 3d (1743 and 1746) by Joseph Simon Assemani. An earlier
                    edition of 171 pieces in 3 folio volumes, edited by Gerhard Vossius, had
                    appeared at Rome in 1589, 1593, and 1598; and Edward Thwaites had published a
                    folio of Greek texts from Oxford MSS. in l$09. The following are the principal
                    modern contributions to our knowledge of Ephraem and his works :—Spohn, <hi
