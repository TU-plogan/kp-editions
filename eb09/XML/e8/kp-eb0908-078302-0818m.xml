                    rend="italic">permutatio</hi> or innominate contract <hi rend="italic">(Daiur
                    res ut vicissim res</hi><hi rend="italic">detur)</hi> of the civil law, about
                    which a fierce controversy raged between the Proculian and Sabinian schools, as
                    to whether it was truly a sale or a separate contract. Both schools used to
                    quote the words of Homer, “And thence, too, wine was got by the longhaired
                    Achaeans, some bartering it for bronze, and others the glistening steel, some
                    hides, and some the cows themselves, and some again slaves.” This Roman contract
                    was not constituted by consent, but by a formal stipulation; it did not pass the
                    property of movables, if the seller had not a title; and it waa liable to be
                    rescinded on proof of great inequality. In each of these features it has been
                    modified by the modern law of most European states. Erskine says <hi
                    rend="italic">(Inst.,</hi> iii. 3, 13), “This doctrine (of property not passing
                    apart from title) may be equitable if directed only against the party himself
                    and his heir; but there could be little security in the commerce of movables if
                    it were extended against a singular successor who had <hi rend="italic">bona
                    fide</hi> bought the subject from the party after the exchange.” In other
                    points, such as the risk of a subject being destroyed, or the remedies on breach
                    of contract, permutation of movables falls under the same rules as sale. The
                    feudal lawyers amused themselves by discussing what name should be given to a
                    contract in which the consideration consisted partly of money. They called it
                    sale where <hi rend="italic">major pars in</hi><hi rend="italic">pretio
                    quam</hi><hi rend="italic">in re</hi><hi rend="italic">permutata.</hi> In the
                    more limited sense of the exchange of heritable subjects, this contract received
                    from the feudal law some advantages not given to sale. Thus, the burdensome
                    right of the superior called <hi rend="italic">protimesis,</hi> or pre-emption,
                    did not apply to excambions. The <hi rend="italic">decuriones,</hi> or town
                    councils, of the imperial <hi rend="italic">municipia</hi> were allowed to
                    excamb, although they could not sell, the town-lands; and so with regard to
                    church lands, the <hi rend="italic">fundus</hi><hi rend="italic">dotalis,</hi>
                    and other subjects partly withdrawn from commerce, ex cambions, but not sales,
                    were permitted. Sovereigns, too, were allowed to excamb parts of the royal
                    domain, although, as may be seen from the Scotch annexation and dissolution
                    statutes of the 16th century, it required special authority to feu or alienate
                    such subjects. The modern Scotch excambiou may consist in the exchange of any
                    heritable subjects whatever, i.&lt;7., a patronage or, what often occurs, a
                    portion of a glebe for servitude. The older form of an excambion was in separate
                    dispositions by each “copermutant,” as Pothier calls him, in favour of the
                    other, or sometimes mutual charters, each party becoming in turn vassal and
                    superior. And according to the <hi rend="italic">Leges</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Burgorum,</hi> c. 55, where lands or houses in burgh were exchanged, the form
                    of delivering sasine consisted in the <hi rend="italic">apertio</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">clausio</hi> of the door, or the passing out and in of the parties
                    respectively, each of whom gave two pennies <hi rend="italic">(duo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nummi)</hi> to the bailie. But this early form was soon superseded
                    by one contract of excambion (originally drawn by Gilmour and Nisbet, and
                    preserved in the MS. Style Book of Bain of Pitcarly) containing both
                    dispositions, and proceeding generally on the narrative that the parcels of laud
                    excambed lie remote from or at least discontiguous to the mansion-house or the
                    principal estate, and, being intersected by the lands of the other party, form a
                    run-rig possession. This contract gives to each party a sufficient narrative of
                    his own title to the lands he is disponing, and it provides, although the law
                    implies this in every express excambion, that on eviction the contract and
                    sasine shall be void and null, and that immediate “recurrency” or regress be
                    given <hi rend="italic">brevi</hi><hi rend="italic">manu</hi> to tho lands which
                    were excaml ed by the party evicted. Such real warrandice, as it is called,
                    affects excambed land in the hands of singular successors who have purchased <hi
                    rend="italic">bona fide,</hi> and hence it is often provided that notice of any
                    action of eviction shall be given to the excamber or his heirs. This exceptional
                    severity reminds one of the civil law which distinguished between sale, where
                    delivery of possession with warraudice against eviction was sufficient
                    performance by the seller, and exchange, where an absolute title of property
                    must be given. Writing, however, is not, by the law of Scotland, essential to an
                    excambion. Chiefly in favour of the class of cottars and small feuars, and for
                    convenience in straightening marches, the law will consider the most informal
                    memoranda, an I even a verbal agreement, if supported by the subsequent
                    possession. The power to excamb was gradually conferred on entailed proprietors.
                    The Montgomery Act, which was passed in 1770, to facilitate agricultural
                    improvements, permitted 50 acres arable and 100 acres not fit for the plough to
                    be excambed. This was enlarged by the Rosebery Act in 1836, under which
                    one-fourth of an entailed estate, not including the mansion-house, home farm,
                    and policies, might be ex cambod, provided the heirs took no higher grassum than
                    £200. The power was applied to the whole estate by the Ruthβrfurd Act of 1848,
                    and the necessary consents of substitute heirs are now regulated by the Entail
                    Amendment Act of 1875.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Exchange,</hi> in English law, is defined as the mutual grant
                    of equal interests, the one in consideration of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0819-0784"/> other. The peculiarities of this very ancient
                    common law conveyance or assurance were—(1) equality of estates, not in value or
                    in subject matter, but in legal right of ownership; (2) the use of the word
                    exchange <hi rend="italic">(excambium, e.g.,</hi> in Domesday book, <hi
                    rend="italic">hanc</hi><hi rend="italic">terram cambiaυit Hugo,</hi> &amp;c.);
                    (3) that, though formal delivery of seisin was not required, possession or entry
                    was required to complete the transaction by making it notorious: (4) that, in
                    the case of incorporeal hereditaments, and where the lands lay in different
                    counties, a deed was required; (5) an implied condition of re-entry on the lands
                    of him whose title failed (Coke on Littleton, 50 <hi rend="italic">a;</hi>
                    Blackstone by Sweet, ii. p. 323), the liability to re-entry affecting an
                    alienee, but the right to re-enter being personal to the exchanger and his
                    heirs. This condition, however, did not long survive the statute <hi
                    rend="italic">Quia</hi><hi rend="italic">emptores</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and exchanges are now generally effected by mutual conveyances with the usual
                    covenants for title, which the Act 8 and 9 Vict. c. 106 declares not to imply
                    any condition, whether the word “exchange” be used in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >testatum</hi> or not. Exchanges are also very frequently made, by order of the
                    inclosure commissioners, under the various Acts of Parliament for the inclosure,
                    exchange, and improvement of lands, from 8 and 9 Vict. c. 118 to 31 and 32 Vict.
                    c. 89 (see Cooke <hi rend="italic">On Inclosures).</hi> In these cases, the
                    property taken is simply impressed with the title of the property given in
                    exchange. So also statutory exchanges are made under the Acts for the Sale and
                    Exchange of Charity Estates, the Charitable Trust Acts, from 16 and 17 Vict. c.
                    137 to 32 and 33 Vict. c. 110, which now apply to Roman Catholic charities,
                    formerly under 23 and 24 Vict. c. 134. There are also statutes enabling
                    ecclesiastical corporations to exchange, with the approval of the church estate
                    commissioners. Powers of exchange are generally given to trustees under English
                    settlements, and these are exercised by revocation of the original uses and
                    appointment of new uses, all ancillary powers being given by implication under
                    23 and 24 Vict. c. 145 (see Davidson’s <hi rend="italic">Precedents in
                    Conveyancing,</hi> vols, ii., iii., and v.).</p>
                <p>In what may be called international conveyancing, the exchange of territories is
                    accomplished by treaties, of which there is no fixed style. A well-known example
                    is Art. XII. of the Treaty of Nimeguen, “Les terres enclavées seront exchangees
                    contre d’autres qui se trouveront plus proches et à la bienséance,” &amp;c. The
                    Italian duchies and islands have very frequently been exchanged. Thus, in the
                    Quadruple Alliance of 1720, Philip V. exchanged a reversionary title to Sicily
                    for a reversionary title to Sardinia. The exchange of prisoners in war is often
                    regulated by documents called cartels, which specify a certain agreed on value
                    for each rank of prisoners. The transference of prisoners is often carried out
                    by cartel ships, which, though prohibited from carrying cargo or passengers, are
                    entitled to certain privileges. It was in the 17th century that this practice
                    (which seems to have been unknown to Grotius) superseded the older one of ransom
                    at the end of the war.</p>
