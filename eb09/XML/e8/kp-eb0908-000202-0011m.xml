                <p>The inquiry into a disputed parliamentary election was formerly conducted before
                    a committee of the House of Commons, chosen as nearly as possible from both
                    sides of the House for that particular business. The decisions of these
                    tribunals laboured under the suspicion of being prompted by party feeling, and
                    by the above-named Act of 1868 the jurisdiction was finally transferred to Her
                    Majesty’s judges, notwithstanding the general unwillingness of the bench to
                    accept a class of business which they feared might bring their integrity into
                    dispute. In future no election shall be questioned except in accordance with the
                    provisions of this Act. Section 11 of the Act orders, inter alia, that the trial
                    of every election petition shall be conducted before a puisne judge of one of
                    the common law courts at Westminster and Dublin; that the said courts shall each
                    select a judge to be placed on the rota for the trial of election petitions;
                    that the said judges shall try petitions standing for trial according to
                    seniority or otherwise, as they may agree; that the trial shall take place in
                    the county or borough to which the petition refers, unless the court should
                    think it desirable to hold it elsewhere. The judge shall determine “whether the
                    member whose return is complained of, or any and what other person, was duly
                    returned and elected, or whether the election was void,” and shall certify his
                    determination to the Speaker. When corrupt practices have been charged the judge
                    shall also report (1) whether any such practice has been committed by or with
                    the knowledge or consent of any candidate, and the nature thereof; (2) the names
                    of persons proved to have been guilty of any corrupt practice; and (3) whether
                    corrupt practices have extensively prevailed at the election.</p>
                <p>Questions of law may be referred to the decision of the Court of Common Pleas.
                    The report of the judge is equivalent to the report of an election committee
                    under the old system. Petitions may be presented by the following persons :—(1)
                    some person who has voted or had the right to vote at the election; (2) some
                    person claiming to have a right to be returned or elected; (3) some person
                    alleging himself to have been a candidate. The trial of a petition shall be
                    proceeded with notwithstanding the acceptance by the respondent of an office of
                    profit under the Crown, and notwithstanding the prorogation of Parliament;
                    though it would appear that the dissolution of Parliament abates a petition. The
                    judge appointed to try a petition shall be received with the same state as a
                    judge of assize in an assize town. The costs and expenses of the petition shall
                    be paid by the parties in such manner and such proportions as the court or judge
                    may determine, regard being had to the discouragement of needless expense by
                    throwing the burden thereof on the parties by whom it has been caused, whether
                    they are on the whole successful or not. W <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> hen a
                    returning officer has wilfully neglected to return a person found on petition to
                    have been entitled to be returned, such person may sue the officer (within one
                    year of the act complained of, or six months of the trial of the petition), and
                    shall recover double the damage he has actually sustained, together with full
                    costs of suit.</p>
                <p>To meet the additional work imposed on the English courts of common law by this
                    Act, power was given to appoint an additional judge to each of them. Section 58
                    applies the provisions of the Act, with certain modifications, to Scotland.</p>
                <p>This, like the Ballot Act, is a continuing Act.</p>
                <p>Petitions against municipal elections are dealt with in 35 <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0012-0003"/> and 36 Vict. c. 60. The election judges under the
                    last described Act appoint a number of barristers, not exceeding five, to try
                    such petitions. No barrister can be appointed who is of less than fifteen years
                    standing, or a member of Parliament, or holder of any office of profit (other
                    than that of recorder) under the Crown; nor can any barrister try a petition in
                    any borough in which he is recorder or in which he resides, or which is included
                    in his circuit. The barrister sits without a jury. The provisions are generally
                    similar to those relating to parliamentary elections in the former Act. The
                    petition may allege that the election was avoided as to the borough or ward on
                    the ground of general bribery, &lt;kc., or that the election of the person
                    petitioned against was avoided by corrupt practices, or by personal
                    disqualification, or that he had not the majority of lawful votes. And no
                    election shall be questioned by any other process whatsoever for a matter for
                    which it might have been questioned under this Act.</p>
