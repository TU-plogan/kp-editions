                    mysterious events, and especially all diseases of body or mind, so that the
                    exorcists, who are usually priests or sorcerers, become in fact the recognized
                    order of physicians (see article <hi rend="smallcaps">Demonology).</hi> From
                    among the numerous accounts of modes of exorcism among rude tribes may be
                    instanced that among the Dakota Indians, where the medicine-man summoned to cure
                    a sick person chants “hi-le-li-lah!” to the accompaniment of a gourd rattle, and
                    sucks at the part affected till the possessing spirit is supposed to come out
                    and take flight, when men in waiting at the tent-door fire guns at it
                    (Schoolcraft, <hi rend="italic">Indian Tribes of North America,</hi> part i. p.
                    250, part ii. p. 199); and that of the Zulus, among whom the ghosts of the dead
                    who enter men’s bodiee and cause disease are got rid of by the sacrifice of
                    cattle, with expostulations, such as, “I say, cease; leave off making me ill”
                    (Callaway, <hi rend="italic">Religious System of the Amazulu,</hi> p. 157). In
                    the most ancient known civilizations we find records of exorcism. An Egyptian
                    tablet records the possession of a princess of the land of Bakhten by a demon,
                    and the exorcism of this spirit by the god Khonsu, who was sent thither in his
                    ark and cured her at once, the spirit saying, “Thou hast come in peace, great
                    god, driver away of possessors. I am thy slave, I will go to the place whence I
                    came” (Birch, in <hi rend="italic">Records</hi><hi rend="italic">of the
                    Past,</hi> vol. iv. p. 53). Among the formulas in ancient Babylonian exorcism
                    are such as these :—“May the noxious spirit of the neck, the noxious wind, from
                    the man himself and the clothing of the body be driven forth!” “From the burning
                    spirit of the entrails, which devours the man, may the king of heaven preserve!”
                    (Sayce, in <hi rend="italic">Records</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Past,</hi>
                    vol. i. p. 131). In Greece men of no less distinction than Epicurus and
                    Aeschines were the sons of women who lived by the exorcist’s art; and both were
                    bitterly reproached, the one by the Stoics, and the other by Demosthenes <hi
                    rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Cor.),</hi> for having assisted their
                    parents in these practices. This power was in some instances considered as a
                    divine gift; in others it was thought to be acquired by investigations into the
                    nature of demons and the qualities of natural productions, as herbs, stones,
                    &amp;c., and by the use of certain forms of adjurations and ceremonies. The
                    power of expelling demons Josephus places among the endowments of Solomon, and
                    relates that he left behind him the manner of using exorcisms by which they
                    drive away demons. (For the pretended fragments of these books see Fabricius,
                    <hi rend="italic">Cod. Pseud. Vet. Test.,</hi> p. 1054.) He relates that he had
                    seen a man named Eleazar releasing people that were demoniacal, in the presence
                    of Vespasian, his sons, captains, and soldiers, by means of a certain root set
                    in a ring, on the application of which to the nose of the patient, the devil was
                    expelled through his nostrils. (See <hi rend="italic">Antig.</hi> viii. 2, § 5;
                    and <hi rend="italic">De Bell. dud.</hi> vii. 6, § 3.) The profession of
                    exorcist was not uncommon among the Jews; and the epithet applied to such
                    persons <hi rend="italic">(τr(pιeρχομTvωv;</hi> Vulg., <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">circumeuntibus</hi><hi rend="italic">J</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">udoeis)</hi> perhaps iudicates that they were travelling
                    mountebanks. The passages of the New Testament which refer to the exorcism of
                    demons from epileptic, insane, and other diseased persons are too numerous and
                    well known to require particular reference. The prominence of exorcism in the
                    early ages of the Christian church appears from its frequent mention in the
                    writings of the fathers, and by the 3d century there seems to have been an order
                    of exorcists (see Bingham, <hi rend="italic">Antiquities of the Christian
                    Church).</hi> The ancient rite of exorcism in connexion with baptism is still
                    retained in the Roman ritual, as is also a form of service for the exorcising of
                    possessed persons. The exorcist signs the possessed person with the figure of
                    the cross, desires him to kneel, and sprinkles him with holy water; after which
                    the exorcist asks the devil his name, and abjures him by the holy mysteries of
                    the Christian religion not to afflict the person possessed any more. Then,
                    laying his right hand on the demoniac’s head, he repeats the form of exorcism as
                    follows: “I exorcise thee, unclean spirit, in the name of Jesus Christ; tremble,
                    O Satan, thou enemy of the faith, thou foe of mankind, who hast brought death
                    into the world, who has deprived men of life, and hast rebelled against justice,
                    thou seducer of mankind, thou root of evil, thou source of avarice, discord, and
                    envy.” Houses and other places supposed to be haunted by unclean spirits are
                    likewise to be exorcised with similar ceremonies.</p>
