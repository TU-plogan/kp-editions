                    (1796-1864), one of the founders of Saint-Simonism, was born at Paris, February
                    8, 1796. He was the son of a banker of Dauphiny, and after receiving his early
                    education at a lyceum, was sent in 1813 to the Ecole Polytechnique In March 1814
                    he was one of the band of students who, on the heights of Montmartre and
                    Saint-Chaumont, attempted resistance to the armies of the allies then engaged in
                    the investment of Paris. In consequence of this outbreak of patriotic
                    enthusiasm, the school was soon after closed by Louis XVIII., and the young
                    student was compelled to seek some other career instead of that of the soldier.
                    He first engaged himself to a country winemerchant, for whom he travelled in
                    Germany, Russia, and the Netherlands. In 1821 he entered a banking-house newly
                    established at St Petersburg, but returned two years later to Paris, where he
                    was appointed cashier to the Caisse Hypothécaire. At the same time he became a
                    member of the secret society of the Carbonari. In 1825 a new turn was given to
                    his thoughts and his life by the friendship which he formed with Olinde
                    Rodriguez, the favoured disciple of Saint-Simon. Introduced by Rodriguez to the
                    master, who was then near his end, be ardently embraced his doctrines and
                    schemes of social, political, and religious reformation. With Rodriguez he
                    received the last instructions of Saint-Simon, and the two were entrusted <pb

                    system. Their first step was the establishment of a journal, entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Le Producteur,</hi> and of a limited liability company for its
                    support. This journal had for its motto “The Golden Age, hitherto placed by
                    blind tradition in the past, is before us.” Enfantin contributed largely to its
                    pages; and setting forth in it not only the doctrines of his master, but also
                    new views of his own, he gave offence to some of his supporters, and in the
                    course of 1826 the journal was discontinued. He had now become known, and had
                    found influential adherents in some members of the Liberal party, among them
                    Blanqui, Bazard, Duveyrier, Pereire, Auguste Comte, Michel Chevalier, and Pierre
                    Leroux. Before the close of 1828 they had their public meetings and lectures,
                    not in Paris alone, but also in many provincial towns. The revolution of July
                    (1830) brought a new freedom to the socialist reformers, and they did not fail
                    to avail themselves of the occasion. A proclamation was issued demanding the
                    community of goods, the abolition of the right of inheritance, and the
                    enfranchisement of women. Enfantin now resigned his office of cashier, and
                    devoted himself wholly to his cause. He obtained the support of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Globe</hi> newspaper, made appeals to the people by systematic
                    preaching, and organized centres of action in some of the principal cities of
                    France. The headquarters in Paris were removed from the modest rooms in the Rue
                    Taranne, and established in larga halls near the Boulevard Italien. Ba,zard and
                    Enfantin were proclaimed “Pères Suprêmes.” This union of the supreme fathers,
                    however, was only nominal. A divergence was already manifest, which rapidly
                    increased to serious difference and dissension. Bazard had devoted himself to
                    political reform, Enfantin to social and moral change; Bazard was organizer and
                    governor, Enfantin was teacher· and consoler; the former attracted reverence,
                    the latter love. A hopeless antagonism arose between them in reference to the
                    proposal of Enfantin to supersede the formula of Saint-Simon, which was in
                    substance “the greatest good of the greatest number,” by another thus worded—“To
                    each one according to his capacity, to each capacity according to its works.”
                    The breach was widened by Enfantin’s announcement of his theory of the relation
                    of man and woman, which would substitute for the “tyranny of marriage” a system
                    of “free love.” Bazard now separated from his colleague, and in his withdrawal
                    was followed by all those whose chief aim was philosophical and political.
                    Enfantin thus became sole “father,” and the few who were chiefly attracted by
                    his religious pretensions and aims still adhered to him. New converts joined
                    them, and Enfantin assumed that his followers in France numbered 40,000. He wore
                    on his breast a badge with his title of “Père,” was spoken of by his preachers
                    as “the living law,” declared, and probably believed, himself to be the chosen
                    of God, and sent out emissaries in quest of a woman predestined to be the
                    “female Messiah,” and the mother of a new Saviour. The quest was very costly and
                    altogether fruitless. No such woman was discoverable. Meanwhile believers in
                    Enfantin and his new religion were multiplying in all parts of Europe. His
                    extravagances and success at length brought down upon him the hand of the law.
                    Public morality was in peril, and in May 1832 the halls of the new sect were
                    closed by the Government, and the father, with some of his followers, appeared
                    before the tribunals. He now retired to his estate at Menilmontant, near Paris,
                    where with forty disciples he continued to carry out his views. In August of the
                    same year he was again arrested, and on his appearance in court he desired his
                    defence to be undertaken by two women who were with him, alleging that the
                    matter was of special concern to women. This was of course refused. The trial
                    occupied two days and resulted in a verdict of guilty, and a sentence of
                    imprisonment for a year with a small fine. This prosecution was the death-blow
                    to the new society, which soon became extinct. Enfantin was released in a few
                    months, and then, accompanied by some of his followers, he went to Egypt. He
                    stayed there two years, and might have entered the service of the viceroy if he
                    would have professed himelf, as a few of his friends did, a Mahometan. On his
                    return to France, a sadder and practically a wiser man, he settled down to very
                    prosaic work. He became first a postmaster near Lyons, and in 1841 was
                    appointed, through the influence of some of his friends who had risen to posts
                    of power, member of a scientific commission on Algeria, which led him to engage
                    in researches concerning North Africa and colonization in general. In 1845 he
                    was appointed director of the Paris and Lyons railway. Three years later he
                    established, in conjunction with Duveyrier, a daily journal, entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Credit,</hi> which was discontinued
                    in 1850. He was afterwards attached to the administration of the railway from
                    Lyons to the Mediterranean. Father Enfantin held fast by his ideal to the end,
                    but he had renounced the hope of giving it a local habitation and a name in the
                    degenerate obstinate world. His personal influence over those who associated
                    with him was immense. “He was a man of a noble presence, with finely formed and
                    expressive features. He was gentle and insinuating in manner, and possessed a
                    calm, graceful, and winning delivery” <hi rend="italic">(Gent. Mag.,</hi> Jan.
                    1865). His evident sincerity, his genuine enthusiasm, gave him his marvellous
                    ascendency. Not a few of his disciples have since ranked amongst the most
                    distinguished men of France. He died suddenly at Paris, September 1, 1864.</p>
