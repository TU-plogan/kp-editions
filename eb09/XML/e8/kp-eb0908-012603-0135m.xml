                    legend connects the festival at Eleusis directly with the mythical incidents
                    arising out of the rape of Persephone, known preeminently as Kore or the Maiden.
                    Mourning bitterly for the loss of her child, who has been borne away by Hades or
                    Aidoneus to the regions beneath the earth, the goddess Demeter wanders over sea
                    and land in a vain search, until she comes to Eleusis. Here seated on a stone,
                    and absorbed in her grief, she is accosted by the daughters of the Eleusinian
                    king Celeus, and by them brought into his house, where she finds a home and
                    becomes the nurse of his only son Demophoon. To make the child immortal she
                    plunges him each night into a bath of fire; but before the work is done, the
                    process is seen by his mother Metanira. Her terror excites the wrath of the
                    mysterious stranger, who, throwing off her garment of humiliation, exhibits
                    herself in all her majesty, and, rebuking the folly which has marred the
                    fortunes of Demophoon, promises to prescribe the rites to be celebrated in the
                    temple which is to be built to her honour on the hill above the fountain. In
                    this temple she <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n136/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0136-0127"/> takes up her abode; but the grief from which she
                    had been roused for a while by the jests and sarcasms of the serving maid Iambe
                    again settles down upon her; and the earth, sympathizing with the Mourning
                    Mother, refuses to yield her fruits until Zeus sends Hermes, his messenger, to
                    the unseen land, and the maiden is restored to her mother at Eleusis, a name
                    which means simply the trysting-place. The myth w as thus localized in the
                    little town, which retained its religious pre-eminence after it had been
                    included in the Athenian state. Here was to be seen the stone on which the
                    goddess was seated when the daughters of Celeus addressed her; here was the hill
                    on which she bade them raise her shrine, and the well Callichorus, with its
                    overshadowing olive tree, near which she had rested. Here also were the homes of
                    Eumolpus, Triptolemus, and Diodes, whose descendants retained for ages their
                    hereditary functions in the mysteries which attended the great annual festival.
                    In the same way each incident in the legend was reproduced in the feast or in
                    its accessories. Rude and coarse raillery addressed to the passers-by
                    represented the rough jests of the maid Iambe; the posset of barley-meal mingled
                    with water and mint, which the goddess drank in the house of Celeus, was still
                    given to her worshippers; while the torch by which Hecate had guided her during
                    part of her wanderings had its place in the ritual of the feast, every portion
                    of which had thus her august sanction.</p>
                <p>In later times, when Eleusis had lost its political independence, a temple of the
                    goddess at Athens, called the Eleusinion, became to some extent the rival of the
                    shrine at Eleusis; but the dignity of the ancient sanctuary was still marked by
                    the solemn procession yearly made to it from Athens, during the greater of the
                    two Eleusinian festivals. To this feast it would seem that at first Athenians
                    only were admitted, the origin of the lesser festival being ascribed to a
                    request made by Hercules to be initiated before his descent into Hades.
                    Strangers being, it was said, excluded from the mysteries, the lesser Eleusinia
                    were instituted to extend the benefit to all Greeks who might wish to share it.
                    The great feast, celebrated yearly during the month of Boedromion (Sept.-Oct.),
                    lasted nine days. The first day bore the name άγυρμός, the day of gathering at
                    Athens for those who had been initiated in the lesser mysteries. On the second
                    day, which was named from the cry Αλαδe μυστat, the mystae went in procession to
                    the sea-shore and were there purified. The third was, it seems from the scanty
                    notices which we have of it, a day of fasting. On the fourth a basket containing
                    pomegranates and poppy seeds (the latter representing the stupefying power,
                    Νάρκισσο?, under whose influence the maiden Persephone was stolen away, the
                    former denoting the fecundating principle by which the earth is prepared for the
                    outburst of vegetation after the sleep of winter), was carried on a waggon in a
                    basket, whence the procession received the name Καλάθου κάθοδος. The waggon was
                    followed by women carrying small cases, Κίσται μvστικai, in their hands. On the
                    fifth day, the day of lamps, the torches borne in procession to the temple at
                    Eleusis denoted the wanderings of the goddess in search of her child, through
                    the season of darkness and gloom. The sixth, the most solemn day of all, was
                    known by the name of Iacchus, Ιακχο?, who in the Eleusinian legend is described
                    as a son of Demeter, but who, according to the Theban tale, is, under his name
                    Dionysus, the child of Zeus and Semele. The statue of this god, bearing a torch,
                    was carried in solemn procession to Eleusis from the Athenian suburb of
                    Kerameikos (Ceramicus). During the night which followed this celebration those
                    who sought initiation were admitted to the last rites, in the presence of those
                    only who, having been already initiated, were called ίπόπται.. After taking the
                    usual oath of secrecy, they passed from the darkness of night into the lighted
                    interior of the shrine, and there saw the things which none but Epoptae could
                    look upon, and which they were bound not to reveal. The imagination of later
                    writers, not speaking from personal knowledge, ran riot in description of
                    terrible ordeals and scaring sights undergone by the mystae before the final
                    splendours burst upon their eyes; while the fancy of Christians invested the
                    preparatory rites with even greater horrors. Probably both the awfulness of the
                    ordeal and the glories of the subsequent revelation were absurdly exaggerated.
                    The whole of this part of the ritual is on its face symbolical of the passage
                    through death to life, first in the case of the fruit-bearing earth, aud then of
                    the soul of man.</p>
                <p>The real work of the festival was now over. The pilgrimage of the Mourning Mother
                    had been traced from the moment·when her child had been torn from her to the
                    hour when by the Eleusinian fountain she was restored to her in all her
                    loveliness. The seventh day was a day of jesting and raillery, denoting most
                    probably the joy involved in the outburst of spring, although the institutional
                    legend ascribed it to the efforts of Iambe or Baubo to dispel the grief of the
                    goddess before the return of the maiden. The eighth day, called Epidauria, is
                    said to have been added because on that day the god Asclepius (Aesculapius),
                    arriving too late for the ceremonial of the sixth day, asked for initiation.
                    This legend is a set-off to the one which was supposed to account for the
                    institution of the lesser Eleusinia for the benefit of Hercules. The pouring of
                    water or wine from two vessels, one held towards the east, the other towards the
                    west, some mystic words being at the same time recited, gave to the ninth and
                    last day its name ΙΙλημοχόαι..</p>
                <p>The nature of the mysterious doctrines set forth before those who were initiated
                    in the Eleusinian festival is a question which belongs rather to the subject of
                    mysteries in general. Enough has been already said to show that one great
                    feature in this feast was the dramatic symbolism which described the
                    revivification of the earth after the death of winter. This symbolism assumed
                    forms which would explaintheir meaning even to the uninitiated. But the revival
                    of nature would be inseparably associated with the thought of the fife into
                    which the human soul passes through the gateway of death; and in a festival
                    where everything was dramatic the one truth or fact would be expressed by signs
                    not less than the other. The Eleusinian legend represents Dionysus or Iacchus as
                    the son of Demeter; and in the great Dionysiac festival at Athens the phallus
                    was solemnly carried in procession, as in like state the veiled ship or boat of
                    Athene was borne to the Acropolis. This ship or boat was represented by the
                    mystic cists or chests carried by the pilgrims to Eleusis, and answers to the
                    yoni, as the phallus corresponds to the lingam of the Hindu. The methods of
                    initiation based on these signs might be gross or spiritual, coarse or refined,
                    according to the genius of the people by whom they were used; nor would it be
                    surprising if both these elements were more or less mingled in all mystical
                    celebrations. There is no reason for supposing that the Eleusinian mysteries
                    involved any more than this symbolical teaching which centres on the two ideas
                    of death and reproduction; there is no valid ground for supposing .that it
                    involved less. Hence when Dr Thirlwall expresses a doubt whether the Greek
                    mysteries were ever used “for the exposition of theological doctrines differing
                    from the popular creed,’ or when Mr Grote asserts it to be altogether improbable
                    that “any recondite doctrine, religious or philosophical, was attached to the
                    mysteries or contained in the holy stories” of any priesthood of the ancient
                    world, the remark is probably right, if by this recondite teaching be meant <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n137/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0137-0128"/> doctrines relating to the nature of God and the
                    divine government of the world; but we should be scarcely justified in pushing
                    it further.</p>
                <p>How far in the Eleusinian mysteries the ritual was strictly Greek or even
                    strictly Aryan is a question of greater difficulty, and perhaps of greater
                    interest It may, be enough here to say that the Iacchus or Dionysus who in the
                    Eleusinian legend is the son of Demeter is preeminently a Theban god, and that
                    to Thebes especially is traced the introduction from Asia of that orgiastic
                    worship in which the frenzy of the -worshippers denoted the irresistible
                    impulses by which the decay and reproduction of the natural world are
                    governed.</p>
