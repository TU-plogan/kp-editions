                    Mirror of theWorld, the Mirror for Magistrates, the Steele Glas, and a hundred
                    others of the same type. It may possibly have arisen early in the Middle Ages,
                    and it is distinctly mentioned in a book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Generibus Ebriosorum,</hi> or “Concerning the kinds of drunkards,”
                    published in 1515. No definitive explanation has been given of the origin of the
                    name, but one interpretation makes it rest on the fact that man recognizes his
                    faults no more than an owl that looks into a mirror, and another finds the
                    original form in the Low German Ul en Spiegel, or Ul den Spiegel, which would
                    signify “Cleanse the looking glass.” The popularity of the book has not only
                    enriched literary German with the words <hi rend="italic">Eulenspiegelei,</hi>
                    waggery, <hi rend="italic">Euleηsρiegcln,</hi> to play the wag, Ac., but it has
                    furnished French with <hi rend="italic">espiègle</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >espièglerie.</hi> Ben Jonson refers in his <hi rend="italic">Masque of
                    Fortune</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Sad Shepherd</hi> to Owl-glass,
                    Ulenspiegle, and Owlspiegle, and Taylor makes a peculiar use of the word when he
                    says—</p>
                <p>“Ride on my best invention like an asse To the amazement of each Owliglasse.”</p>
                <p>According to an old tradition, the tricks and jests of the collection are
                    attributed to a certain Till or Tyll Eulenspiegel, otherwise Till the Saxon or
                    Tylus Saxonicus, who was born at Kneitlingen near Schoppeustadt, in the duchy of
                    Brunswick, and was the son of Claus Eulenspiegel and Anna Wortbeck. He is
                    usually stated to have been buried in 1350 at Mölln, about four leagues from
                    Lubeck, but the people of Damme in Belgium claim that his grave is with them. At
                    Mölln, to quote an old book of travels cited by Nares, the townsmen “yearly keep
                    a feast for his memory, and yet show the appareil he was wont to wear;” and his
                    tomb was adorned with a fantastic effigy, holding in one hand a little tankard
                    with a jack-in-a-box, and in the other a basket full of little mannikins with
                    fool’s caps on their heads. That there was such a person as Tyl seems not
                    improbable, but what connexion he had with the Owlglass it is hard to discover;
                    Eulenspiegel at least* is pretty certainly a later addition to his name. Mr
                    William F. Thoms found the Irish peasantry telling stories of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Old Espeel,</hi> and a writer in the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman's
                    Magazine,</hi> September 1877, Mr David Fitzgerald, “met with pretty clear
                    traces of Eulenspiegel in the traditions of the county of Limerick, where he
                    figures as one <hi rend="italic">Ulas,</hi> whose confession, like that of his
                    prototype, is yet a favourite tale.”</p>
                <p>The book was originally, it would appear, composed in Low German; and, according

                    1550, atθιleans, 1571, at Antwerp, 1579, at Rouen, 1701. Delepierre published an
                    edition at Bruges, 1835, and another at Brussels, 1840; and a complete
                    translation into modern French from the 1519 edition was printed at Paris by P.
                    Jannet, 1858. An English edition was published in 1860, under the direction of
                    Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie, and with illustrations by Alfred Crowquill. In 1865
                    appeared a photolithographic reprint of the Lower Saxon version, originally
                    printed by Servais KruiΓter (Servetius Cruftanus). There is no complete copy of
                    the original, but portions in the Royal Library at Vienna and in the Royal
                    Library at Berlin complete each other.</p>
