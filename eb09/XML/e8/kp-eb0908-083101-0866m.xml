                    of the Massoretic text. Though for many centuries they have thus been treated as
                    separate compositions, we have abundant evidence that they were anciently
                    regarded as forming but one book. Thus, Origen (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H.
                    E.,</hi> vi. 25), expressly enumerating the twenty-two books of the old covenant
                    as acknowledged by the Jews and accepted by the Christian church, gives as one
                    of them ’Έσδρας πρώτος και δεύτερος <hi rend="italic">ev eve</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Έζρά.</hi> Melito of Sardis (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi>
                    iv. 26) in like manner mentions the book of Esdras only. So also the Talmud (in
                    <hi rend="italic">Baba bathra,</hi> 14, 2), nor can it be supposed that Josephus
                    in his enumeration<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n867/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0867-0832"/> (Ci <hi rend="italic">Ap.</hi> i. 8) reckoned
                    Nehemiah as apart from Ezra. Some of the oldest copies of the LXX. make no
                    division between 2 Esdras and Nehemiah; and that the Massoretes themselves
                    recognized no real separation is shown by their epicrisis on Nehemiah.</p>
                <p>If the external evidence for the unity of the book of Ezra-Nehemiah is strong,
                    the internal evidence is decisive. As the result of long-continued careful
                    examination, modern criticism, with practical unanimity (Hävernick and Keil are
                    hardly exceptions), has reached the conclusion that Ezra and Nehemiah, so far
                    from being separate compositions, together constitute but a section of a larger
                    historical work, the origin, authorship, and plan of which have already been
                    discussed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Chronicles,</hi> to which the
                    reader is referred. Comparatively little remains to be said here on the special
                    questions that arise in connexion with the Ezra-Nehemiah portion of the
                    work.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Contents.—</hi> Resuming the abruptly broken off narrative of
                    Chronicles, the first six chapters of Ezra relate how, in the first year of
                    Cyrus king of Persia (537-6), Zerubbabel (called Sheshbazzar in chap, i.), along
                    with Joshua and some 50,000 others who are enumerated according to their
                    families, returned to Jerusalem, set up the altar of burnt-offering there, and
                    in face of many difficulties and discouragements succeeded iu rebuilding the
                    temple, which was finally dedicated in the sixth year of Darius Hystaspis (516).
                    An interval of fifty-eight years is then passed over in silence. The next
                    chapters (Ezra vii.-x.) tell of Ezra’s mission to Jerusalem in 458, and the
                    dissolution of the heathen marriages there the one result of a period of eight
                    months’ activity. Another blank of thirteen years occurs in the history. Then we
                    read (Neh. i. 1-vii. 73α) of Nehemiah’s expedition to Jerusalem, of the
                    difficulties he encountered on his arrival there (445-4), and how,
                    notwithstanding all the opposition of the Samaritans, the building of the walls
                    was successfully completed in fifty-two days. The list of those who had returned
                    under Zerubbabel is given as in Ezra, chap. ii. The narrative then goes on to
                    relate (Neh. vii. 73δ-x, 39) how in the same year the law of Moses was anew
                    promulgated by Ezra, being solemnly read by him in the presence of a national
                    assembly; how the feast of the tabernacles was then observed with a strictness
                    that had been unknown since the days of Joshua the son of Nun; and bow a written
                    covenant was drawn up and signed by which the people pledged themselves to
                    observe the whole law. After some genealogies and other lists have been given
                    (Neh. xi.-xii. 26), we next have an account of the ceremonial which took place
                    at the dedication of the walls (440); also further particulars of arrangements
                    for due support of the temple-worship, and of steps taken for the exclusion of
                    alien3 from the congregation of Israel. Finally, after an interval of not less
                    than twelve years, we read of a second visit of Nehemiah to Jerusalem (probably
                    iu 432). This visit was the occasion of renewed efforts towards religious and
                    social reformation. Special mention is made of a collision withEliashib the
                    high-priest, and also with Joiada his son, which resulted in the expulsion of
                    the latter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Authorship.—</hi> The abstract given above shows very clearly
                    that Ezra-Nehemiah cannot claim to be a continuous chronicle of all the
                    important events of the 110 years of Jewish history over which it extends.
                    Indeed, of the 110 years only some twenty are referred to at all. This want of
                    continuity cannot be attributed to lack of materials; but rather to the specific
                    purpose by which the author was guided in the selection of his facts. That
                    purpose manifestly was to give an account of the progress of the restored
                    theocracy in Judah and Jerusalem, particularly in what related to the temple,
                    and to the share of the priests and Levites in the temple-worship. The striking
                    literary peculiarities which are here displayed in all that is not merely copied
                    from earlier documents, and even in the manner in which these documents
                    themselves are handled, all indicate one and the same author for Chronicles and
                    for Ezra-Nehemiah.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sources.—</hi> It lies open to the most superficial observation
                    that the work of the Chronicler is a compilation derived from many sources. The
                    authorities for this portion of it may be classified as follows: (1) Statistics
                    derived from official records. The list contained in Ezra ii., and repeated with
                    some variations in Neh. vii., may be taken as a specimen. It was already old in
                    Nehemiah’s day (Neh. vii. 5). The author mentions also a book of chronicles <hi
                    rend="italic">{dibre</hi><hi rend="italic">hajjâmîm,</hi> Neh. xii. 23), from
                    which the information in Neh. xii. 1-26 was derived. Neh. xi. 3-36 and 1 Ch. ix.
                    3-33 are also probably drawn from a common source of an official character. (2)
                    A history of the building of the temple and of the obstacles that had to be
                    overcome, written in Chaldee. This history seems to have furnished the section
                    Ezra v. 1-vi. 18, and also to have been the source of the document given in Ezra
                    iv. 8-23, (3) Ezra’s personal memoirs. These have been directly transcribed in
                    Ezra vii. 27-ix. 15; and they have been drawn upon for Ezra vii. 1-11, for chap,
                    x., and also for Neh. vii. 736-x. (4) Nehemiah’s personal memoirs. These have
                    been extracted from in Neh. i. 1-vii. 5, xi. 1, 2, xii. 31-42, xiii. 4-30, and
                    they have been combined with those of Ezra in Neh. vii. 73ô-x.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Date.—</hi> In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Chronicles</hi>
                    it has been shown that the genealogies there given (1 Ch. iii. 19 sy.), when
                    fairly interpreted, must be taken as reckoning the descendants of Zerubbabel to
                    six generations, thus bringing the history down to near the close of the Persian
                    monarchy. In Ezra-Nehemiah all the indications of date which are given go to
                    support the same conclusion. Neh. xii. 11, 22 brings the list of high-priests
                    down to Jaddua, the contemporary of Alexander the Great. In verse 22 there is a
                    reference, moreover, to Darius Codomannus, the opponent of Alexander. The kings
                    of Persia are throughout alluded to in a manner which is fitted to suggest that
                    the Persian empire had already passed away. Ezra and Nehemiah themselves are
                    occasionally spoken of, not as contemporaries, but as vanished heroes of the
                    venerable past (see, for example, Neh. xii. 26, 47). But the same data which
                    forbid us to fix a date for Ezra-Nehemiah earlier than 350 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> manifestly also forbid the conclusion of Spinoza <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Tract. Theol.</hi><hi rend="italic">Polit.,</hi><hi rend="italic">X. 28)</hi>
                    who placed the work later than the Maccabees.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Credibility.—</hi> The doubts raised by Graf and others with
                    reference to the historical value of the earlier portion of the work of the
                    Chronicler do not extend to the Ezra-Nehemiah section. There is general
                    concurrence in the conviction that the sources he had access to fully guarantee
                    the trustworthiness of his narrative. A question has, indeed, been raised as to
                    the measure of sagacity he has shown in his employment of some of the materials
                    he had at his disposal, Bertheau and others believing (in opposition to Ewald)
                    that he has inappropriately introduced into the narrative of Ezra iv. certain
                    documents which really refer to the later period of Nehemiah.</p>
                <p>The text of Ezra-Nehemiah has reached us in a somewhat impure state. Great
                    caution requires to be exercised, especially as regards the numerals and proper
                    names. Some help may be got from the TAX. translator, who has been faithfully
                    literal “almost to unintelligibility.”</p>
