                    before proceeding further, it is necessary to determine as far as possible what
                    that reading is. In the Authorized Version the epistle opens with the words,
                    “Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at
                    Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.” “At Ephesus” is the expression in
                    dispute. The two words are omitted by the first hand of the Vatican and Sinaitic
                    MSS., and by the second hand of 67, a cursive MS. of the 12th century, whose
                    corrected text Griesbach considered much more valuable than the text as it
                    originally stood; but they are found in all other MSS. and versions.</p>
                <p>Strong as is the evidence arising from the combination of the Vatican and the
                    Sinaitic MSS., it would be difficult to resist the singular amount of authority
                    opposed to them, were it not for passages from writers and fathers earlier than
                    the earliest of our existing MSS., which show that the absence of the words was
                    not only known to them, but was so far accepted, as at least probably correct,
                    that they made it a ground of curious speculation with regard to the particular
                    method of designating Christians then employed by the apostle. The earliest
                    witness is Marcion, about the middle of the 2d century, although he deals only
                    with the fact. We gather Marcion’s view from the language of Tertullian. In his
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">Contra Marcionem</hi> (v. 11, 17), the African father
                    charges Marcion with having, contrary to the <hi rend="italic">veritas
                    ecclesioe,</hi> given a false title to the epistle, designating it as the

                    known to him. Such greetings are wanting also in the epistles to Thessalonica,
                    although the apostle wrote to that city under circumstances peculiarly calling
                    forth his affectionate remembrance of his converts there. It is otherwise with
                    the indications contained in the epistle itself that its writer was personally
                    unknown to those to whom he writes, and that they, on their part, knew of him
                    and of his work rather by the information of others than by actual experience
                    :—“If so be that ye heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was
                    given me to youward” (iii. 2), where the particles ei <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>
                    cannot be understood as stating only the ground, without the introduction of
                    doubt, upon which the argument was proceeding (Alford), a use of «’ <hi
                    rend="italic">ye</hi> not allowed by grammarians (Moulton’s Winer, p. 561), and
                    where the certainty wanting in the particle is not given by the context (as
                    Meyer); “For this cause 1 also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus
                    which is in yourselves, . . . cease not to give thanks for you ’’ (i. 15, 16),
                    where the parallel passage in Colossians (i. 9 compared with i. 6), contrasting
                    the day when the apostle first “heard ’’ of their knowledge of the grace of God
                    in truth with that when they first “heard” of that grace, points out to us in a
                    way not to be mistaken the sense in which the verb is to be understood
                    (Lightfoot, <hi rend="italic">On the Col.,</hi> p. 28). But St Paul could not
                    have used such language in reference to the Ephesians. He had laboured too long
                    among them, had been too successful in his ministry, and had acquired too
                    intimate a personal knowledge of their condition, to have permitted him to speak
                    thus either of himself or them. Add to this the fact that in Eph. i. 1 the
                    apostle does not associate Timothy with himself, although that disciple was well
                    know n to the church at Ephesus, while he does mention him in the salutations of
                    the epistles to the Colossians and to Philemon written at the same time, and the
                    evidence is very strong that the epistle before us was not, in the first
                    instance at least, addressed to the Ephesian church.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Another consideration worthy of notice is
                    suggested to the writer by a friend. In Eph. v. 1 the apostle calls upon his
                    leaders to be <hi rend="italic">imitators of God.</hi> It is the only occasion
                    on which he does so. Writing to those to whom he was personally known, be always
                    calls upon them to imitate <hi rend="italic">himself 1</hi> Cor. iv. 16, xi. 1;
                    1 Thes. i. 6; 2 Thes. iii. 7-9. The same friend (Mr A. Forbes, Aberdeen)
                    suggests also, the importance of comparing the tone of the Ephesian epistle with
                    that of St Paul’s address to the Ephesian elders in Acts xx. From that address
                    we learn how he would have spoken, as he did speak, to members of the Ephesian
                    church—not “if ye have heard,” or “when ye read ye may understand,” or “if so
                    bethat ye were taught in him but “ye know; ’’ “I have not shunned to declare
                    unto you the whole counsel of God “I kept back nothing, but have showed you,”
                    &amp;c.; “remember that I ceased not to warn every one of you.” The difference
                    in tone is very marked.</p></note> (2.) Another theory, generally associated
                    with the name of Archbishop Ussher, although hardly less connected with that of
                    Beza, has in later years found such general acceptance that it may probably be
                    regarded as at this moment the prevailing view,—that the epistle is a circular
                    letter, designed, not for Ephesus alone, but for many churches of Asia or the
                    Peloponnesus or still wider districts. The modifications of this theory have
                    been extremely numerous, varying with the adoption or rejection of the reading
                    “at Ephesus” in i. 1, as well as with the difficulties felt by those adopting it
                    as to the manner in which the epistle was to be circulated. It is unnecessary to
                    examine these theories separately. They are, as a group, exposed to objections
                    which appear to be insuperable. 1. There is not the slightest trace of the
                    existence of such a theory in Christian antiquity. 2. Had the apostle intended
                    the epistle to be a circular one, nothing would have been easier for him than to
                    say so. He does employ such a general designation in Gal. i. 2 and 2 Cor. i. 1.
                    The expression “the churches of Asia” was familiar to him (1 Cor. xvi. 19, comp.
                    Rev. i. 4). 3. No other name than Ephesus, except</p>
                <p>Laodicea, appears to have been at any time connected with the epistle. Even this
                    name, too, seems not to have been placed in the text. The statement of Marcion,
                    our only authority for thus associating Laodicea and the epistle with one
                    another refers not to the text, but to the title. 4. The epistle has distinct
                    reference to particular persons (i. 15, 16, vi. 22). 5. The idea of a number of
                    copies furnished to Tychicus with a space in blank for the name to be filled in
                    is entirely at variance with the simplicity of the apostle and the character of
                    the apostolic age. The circular hypothesis, in any of the forms thus proposed,
                    may be abandoned with little hesitation. (3.) There remains a third theory w
                    hich cannot be omitted. It adopts the circular idea, but at the same time
                    identifies the epistle to the Ephesians with the epistle spoken of at Col. iv.
                    16 as “that from Laodicea.” This theory has beeen adopted by Canon Lightfoot in
                    the following words :—</p>
                <p>“The apostle wrote at this time a circular letter to the Asiatic churches, which
                    got its ultimate designation from the metropolitan city, and is consequently
                    known to us as the epistle to the Ephesians. It was the immediate object of
                    Tychicus’s journey to deliver copies of this letter at all the principal centres
                    of Christianity in the district, and at the same time to communicate by word of
                    mouth the apostle’s special messages to each (Eph. vi. 21, 22). Among these
                    centres was Laodicea. Thus his mission brought him into the immediate
                    neighbourhood of Colossae. But he was not charged to deliver another copy of the
                    circular letter at Colossae itself, for this church would be regarded only as a
                    dependency of Laodicea; and, besides, he was the bearer of a special letter from
                    the apostle to them. It was sufficient, therefore, to provide that the Laodicean
                    copy should be circulated and read at Colossae.”</p>
                <p>Dr Lightfoot further expresses his belief that “educated opinion is tending,
                    though slowly, in this direction,” and that “ultimately this view will be
                    generally received” <hi rend="italic">(Colossians,</hi> p. 347). In the absence
                    of Dr Lightfoot’s as yet unpublished arguments in favour of the view thus taken
                    by him, it is impossible to say whether he may be successful in establishing it
                    or not. But, in the meantime, it seems liable, with the exception of that part
                    which identifies the epistle to the Ephesians with the epistle “from Laodicea”
                    of Col. iv. 16, to all the objections which we have urged against the circular
                    hypothesis, together with the additional difficulty of supposing that Tychicus,
                    starting with a number of copies of the letter in his hands, should either leave
                    his last copy at Laodicea, or that, if any remained, the Colossian church,
                    instead of getting one of them, should be instructed to procure its copy from
                    Laodicea. If, on the other hand, it be said that the words “the epistle from
                    Laodicea” are not a mere note of the place whence the epistle might be procured,
                    but that, in one way or another, they point to a special connexion between the
                    epistle and the city, it will follow that the former had a particular
                    designation and was not circular.</p>
                <p>The theories examined by us are all unsatisfactory. We have to ask whether there
                    is any other way of meeting the difficulties of the case.</p>
                <p>1. The first thing here arresting attention is, that wholly Gentile readers are
                    presupposed in the epistle (ii, 11, 12; iιi. 1; iv. 17). Nor this alone. When St
                    Paul speaks of his apostleship, he speaks of himself with much greater emphasis
                    than usual as the apostle of the Gentiles (iii. 1—8). And, still further, in two
                    highly important passages, the force of which is lost iu the Authorized Version,
                    he shows that he has the Gentiles in view, not in what they become when they are
                    brought to form part of the one holy temple, of the one redeemed family, of God,
                    but in what they are when regarded as distinct and separate from the Jews:—“In
                    whom <hi rend="italic">every</hi> building fitly framed together groweth into a
                    temple holy in the Lord” (ii. 21);<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    “every family” of iii. 15.</p></note> “For <pb corresp="pbn9461"

                    whom <hi rend="italic">every</hi> family in heaven and on earth is named” (iii.
                    14, 15). It has been customary to say that in the church addressed the Gentile
                    element prevailed, and that hence the wants of the Gentiles are mainly before
                    the writer. But, in fact, there is no trace of Jewish readers in the
                    epistle,·“not even in ii. 15,” and Dr Davidson, observing this, not unnaturally
                    grounds upon it the argument that, addressed to the church at Ephesus, it must
                    be later than St Paul’s time, because the apostle could not have left the Jewish
                    Christians unnoticed <hi rend="italic">(Intr.,</hi> i. p. 379).</p>
                <p>May not the true conclusion be one of an altogether different character ?—that
                    our epistle to the Ephesians was not addressed to a <hi rend="italic"
                    >church</hi> at all. There was probably no church at that time in Asia composed
                    of Gentile converts alone. All of them were mixed communities. The tone of the
                    epistle to the Colossians shows us that the errors prevailing in Colossae were
                    of a Judaeo-Gnostic character, and that the most powerful element in that church
                    was Jewish. It is not an unfair inference that this must also have been the case
                    in the neighbouring churches of Laodicea, Hierapolis, and Ephesus. How then
                    could St Paul, writing to any one of these churches, speak to it as if it were
                    wholly Gentile, as if the Jewish element had no existence in it? The true
                    explanation seems to be, that we have in the Ephesian epistle not an epistle to
                    a <hi rend="italic">church;</hi> that we have an appeal to Gentile Christians as
                    such; that the apostle is thinking of his readers in that capacity, and not as a
                    merely constituent part of any local church whatever.</p>
                <p>2. A second point claiming consideration is, that we have no small reason to
                    suppose that “the epistle from Laodicea” of Col. iv. 16 is that before us. The
                    authority of distinguished critics can be quoted for this view (Grotius,
                    Wetstein, Hammond, Mill, Canon Lightfoot, &lt;fcc.); and it is not to be
                    regarded as mere conjecture. We have seen that Marcion, as the result of
                    diligent inquiry, had come to the conclusion that the epistle to the Ephesians
                    ought to have borne the name of the epistle to the Laodiceans. We know also that
                    a passage quoted by him from the latter is found in the former (see in
                    Tischendorf’s New Te3t. Eph. i. 1), thus identifying the two epistles by their
                    contents as well as by their titles. We must give some weight to the
                    improbability that an epistle to which St Paul attached such importance that he
                    directed it to be passed on from one church to another would be lost; and, when
                    we put all these circumstances together, there seems every reason to think that
                    “the epistle from Laodicea” is no other than our epistle to the Ephesians.</p>
                <p>On these grounds, then, rests the suggestion which we offer.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Since this article was written, the writer's
                    attention has been called to the fact that Ewald, in his <hi rend="italic"

                    1870, has adopted the same view of the destination of the epistle. He had not

                    rend="italic">V. I.,</hi> and the writer was not aware of the fact. Ewald, at
                    the same time, attributes the epistle to a disciple and friend of the apostle,
                    writing 70-80 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.D.</hi> He urges that St Paul himself never
                    wrote except to distinct churches (p. 157). But that very circumstance would
                    surely have led any one writing in his name to adhere to the apostle’s practice,
                    and to avoid exposing his epistle to the suspicion which a departure from it
                    could not fail to awaken. ’ Why, too, if the writer adopted from Col. iv. 7 the
                    idea of «ending the epistle by Tychicus, does he not adopt from Col. i. 1 the
                    idea of uniting Timothy with himself in the salutation?</p></note> Adopting the
                    idea that the epistle to the Ephesians is “the epistle from Laodicea” of Col.
                    iv. 16, it seems to us that it was not intended to be an epistle to the <hi
                    rend="italic">church</hi> of the last-named city. It was an epistle to the
                    Gentile converts, as such, in the first place of Laodicea, in the second place
                    of Colossae.</p>
                <p>The view now taken derives much confirmation from the light thrown by it upon
                    some of the difficulties connected with the epistle which no theory yet proposed
                    has succeeded in removing. (1.) It at once explains the want of those local
                    references which we should naturally expect in a letter written to an organized
                    community; while, at the same time, the persons for whom the letter is intended
                    are a sufficiently limited class to justify the expressions of i. 15 and vi. 22.
                    (2.) It explains the absence of any special designation in i. 1, and relieves us
                    from the necessity of supposing that there was a blank space left in that verse.
                    St Paul could hardly have inserted the name of a town without leading to the
                    false impression that he was writing to its church. (3.) It explains the fact
                    that the name of a place should have been permitted to find its way into i. 1,
                    where no name originally stood. Had the epistle been intended for any <hi
                    rend="italic">church</hi> or <hi rend="italic">churches,</hi> they, even though
                    not inserting their own names, would not readily have permitted the insertion of
                    another. They would have claimed their own epistle. General Gentile readers, as
                    not organized, could not so easily do so. (4.) It explains the remarkable
                    expression of Col. iv. 16, “the epistle from Laodicea.” We might have expected
                    “the epistle to the Laodiceans.” But what had been written was not an epistle to
                    the Laodiceans, and therefore it is not styled one. It was an epistle to a
                    particular section of Christians both in Laodicea and Colossae, and only sent to
                    Laodicea first. Hence the designation, “the epistle from Laodicea.” (5.) It
                    explains what has been found so inexplicable (Davidson, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iηtr.,</hi> i. p. 381; Harless, <hi rend="italic">Ephes. Brief,</hi> p. 40),
                    that, writing both to the Colossians and the Laodiceans by the same messenger,
                    the apostle should include the brethren in Laodicea in a salutation of the
                    epistle to Colossae, and should enjoin an epistle meant for the Colossians to be
                    read to Laodiceans who had one of their own by the same hand. He was not writing
                    to the church at Laodicea; therefore let the church there have both its letter
                    and its salutations through the neighbouring church to which he was writing at
                    the moment. (6.) It explains the absence from the epistle of all allusion to
                    doctrinal error on the part of its recipients. We see from the Colossian epistle
                    how deep was the hold of such errors at Colossae. In any circumstances it would
                    hardly be possible to imagine that similar errors did not exist both at Laodicea
                    and Ephesus; and this conclusion as to the first of these two cities is in the
                    present instance confirmed by the fact that the epistle to the Colossians,
                    filled with controversy as to doctrinal errors, was directed to be read there.
                    Again, therefore, their being left unnoticed in our so-called epistle to the
                    Ephesians seems to be a proof that St Paul is not writing to the church of the
                    city addressed by him. Had he been doing so he would naturally have taken its
                    whole condition into account; but he is dealing with one portion of its
                    community alone, and with that portion mainly, if not only, upon one point of
                    interest. (7 ) It explains even to some extent the difficult words of i. 1, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">toÎç</hi> άγιοι? roîç o*σιv και <hi rend="italic"
                    >∙πaττcn&lt;s</hi><hi rend="italic">év</hi><hi rend="italic">Χριστιρ Ιησού.</hi>
                    There appears to be but one meaning of which these words are susceptible, “To
                    the saints existing and faithful in Christ Jesus.” All other renderings proposed
                    either do injustice to the Greek, or make the apostle say what it is not
                    possible he should have said in conformity with his general teaching. This, the
                    rendering of Origen, is natural and idiomatic. Its peculiarity is of course that
                    it makes the substantive verb of the original more than a simple copula. It
                    makes it a distinct predicate, pointing out a characteristic of the condition of
                    those addressed.</p>

                <p>They have a being, a place, a name; they “are,” they are “existing,” in Christ
                    Jesus. The expression is undoubtedly most peculiar, having probably no perfect
                    parallel in the New Testament. Yet it is there, and no reading that we can adopt
                    removes it. The view that we have taken of the destination of the epistle seems
                    to some extent to offer an explanation. There was a special propriety in
                    reminding the Gentile Christians that they existed, that they had a place, that
                    they “were” in Christ Jesus. We see from the whole tone of the epistle that this
                    was the very point on which they were perplexed. There was no doubt about the
                    Jewish Christians. It is taken for granted by the apostle, and he repeats it
                    more than once, that they were “near” (ii. 13, 17). What he had especially to
                    enforce is that the Gentiles were “near” also. He did not require to say of the
                    former what it was so needful to say of the latter. What he does say, indeed,
                    might have been said equally of both. Both, when believing, <hi rend="italic"
                    >“were</hi> in Christ Jesus.” But the words have a peculiar force when applied
                    to Gentile Christians who had been “strangers to the covenant of the promise,”
                    and who had to be encouraged to feel with greater depth and power than they yet
                    experienced that they were partakers of the full privileges of those who were
                    fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of God. There is thus an
                    emphasis on the τοίς oυσιv. The Gentile Christians are not merely in Christ, but
                    in Him they “are.” In Him they too have a real and genuine existence, such as
                    those only have who are in covenant with God.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We are not without distinct examples of a use
                    of the substantive verb approaching extremely near to this in the epistle to the
                    Colossians, written at the same time as the epistle to the Ephesians. In ii. 3,
                    ii. 10, and iii. 1 of that epistle the “are” and “is’' are not to be connected
                    with “hidden,” “fulfilled” (Authorized Version, “complete”), or “sitting.” These
                    are all secondary predicates. .The first predicate is the substantive verb, to
                    which the others are added. The treasures of wisdom spoken of “are” in Christ,
                    and are “hidden;” the Colossian Christians “are” in Him, and are “fulfilled;”
                    Christ himself “is” when the things above are, and He is there “sitting” at the
                    right hand of God (comp. Lightfoot, <hi rend="italic">in loc.).</hi> Even in the
                    Ephesian epistle itself, we have something of a similar kind. The Authorized
                    Version of ii. 5 conveys a very imperfect idea of the Greek. The words there
                    used do not mean “by grace ye are saved,” but “by grace ye are, saved men.’’
                    With such examples before us we need have less difficul ty in putting Origen’s
                    metaphysical meaning into the “are” of i. 1; nor does there seem to be so much
                    over-refinement in this notion as is often thought. If the Almighty chose for
                    Himself the name I <hi rend="smallcaps">am,</hi> why may not His people be said
                    to “be” in Him? All, however, that we urge is, that such a use of the verb has
                    more than ordinary force when applied to Gentile believers. I <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">am</hi> is a covenant title. No one doubted that the Jews were
                    within the covenant; what needed enforcement was that the Gentiles were not less
                    so.</p></note></p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Object of the Epistle.—</hi> This is much more definite
                    than it is often thought to be. The apostle has something more precise in view
                    than to set forth the glory of the redeemed and Christian standing of his
                    readers (Meyer), or to describe the life by which the Christian community is
                    marked (Schenkel), or to explain the ground, the coarse, and the end of the
                    Christian church (Alford). It is not his purpose only to pour himself forth in
                    adoring contemplation of the blessings received by us in Christ (Harless); and
                    it is far too little to say that he desires to strengthen the faith and to
                    encourage the hopes of those to whom he writes (Gloag). Even Canon Lightfoot
                    seems hardly to give a special enough object to the epistle when he finds its
                    principal theme in “the life and energy of the church as dependent on Christ”
                    <hi rend="italic">(On the Coloss.,</hi> p. 329). These views may be all
                    partially correct; but they are not enough. In this very setting forth of the
                    greatness of the church, in this description of her life, in this presenting of
                    her to us in all the ideal glory of her state as united to her Lord, the apostle
                    has a further and immediately practical aim—to show us that this ideal glory
                    contemplated from the first the union of both Jews and Gentiles in equal
                    enjoyment of the privileges of God’s covenant, that to the completeness of the
                    body of Christ the latter are as necessary as the former, and that it is only
                    when both are <hi rend="italic">together</hi> in Christ that His fulness is
                    realized and manifested. It is God’s eternal plan that all things shall thus be
                    restored and united in the Beloved; and, unless they are so, frankly, freely,
                    and fully, that plan will be defeated. Hence it is that the apostle begins by
                    describing in the loftiest language that realizing of the Almighty’s purpose
                    formed before the foundation of the world which was to be effected in “a” (not
                    “the,” for it is the thought of God with which we are dealing) “dispensation of
                    the fulness of the seasons” (not “times ”), when He would “sum up,” or gather
                    together under one head, “all things in the Christ, the things in heaven and the
                    things upon the earth” (i. 3-10). Hence it is that Israel “also” (i. 11), which
                    had before hoped in the Christ, had been made an inheritance in Him; but not
                    Israel alone, for the Gentiles “also” (και fyι∈7ς) had been made a similar
                    inheritance, “sealed with the Spirit of <hi rend="italic">the promise,”</hi> and
                    to the same end, “the praise of the glory of God’s grace” (i. 10-14; comp,
                    especially verses 12 and 14, and note the article before δo'Λyς in verse 14).
                    Therefore he prays that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, “the Father of the
                    glory,” will reveal this knowledge fully (επιγvωσeι) in them, that so they may
                    understand the ex ceeding greatness of His power which He wrought in Christ,
                    when He raised Him from the dead and made Him to sit at His right hand in the
                    heavenly places, constituting him Head over all things to the one church which
                    is his body, the <hi rend="italic">pleroma</hi> of Him whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >pleroma</hi> is only reached when all things in all are “fulfilled” in Him (i.
                    15-23), This participation in the <hi rend="italic">pleroma</hi> had been
                    bestowed on them, Gentiles though they were (νρ,άς emphatic at ii. 1.), when
                    they, in the same manner as the Jews (καl ⅞∕√,∈7ς, ii. 3), had been quickened
                    together with the Christ, been raised from the dead, and been made to sit
                    together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, this new and higher life being
                    nothing more than the execution of God’s great design (ii. 1-10). The apostle
                    next makes a practical appeal to his readers, as Gentiles, calling on them to
                    remember their present as contrasted with their former state, especially in this
                    respect, that the same Lord who was the peace of the Jews was also their
                    peace,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    afar off were now, as well as those who had been nigh, united in one new man,
                    having access in one spirit to the one Father, and that now even they were
                    fellow-citizens with the saints, members of the family of God, resting on the
                    one foundation on which every building (not “the whole building” of Authorized
                    Version), Gentile as well as Jew, grows up a part, fitly framed to the other
                    parts, of one holy temple in the Lord (ii. 11-22). At this point the apostle
                    seems to have been about to address to them the practical exhortation which
                    meets us only at iv. 1, but he is again carried away by the thought of the great
                    mystery which fills his mind. He turns to it therefore anew, only looking at it
                    first as committed to him rather than in its effects on them. Yet it is the same
                    mystery as that of which he had already spoken, that the Gentiles were made
                    fellow-heirs and fellow-members of the body and fellow-partakers (mark the
                    repeated <hi rend="italic">σvv</hi> used with such striking frequency in this
                    epistle) of the promise in Christ Jesus through the Gospel, and bursting forth
                    into a prayer to the Father, of whom every family (not “the whole family” of
                    Authorized Version) in heaven and on earth is named, that Christ may dwell
                    through faith in their hearts in love, so that they may be fulfilled unto all

                    singular prominence of the thought of the church in St Paul’s mind at this
                    moment, shown by the mention of it before the mention of Christ, “in the church
                    and in Christ Jesus” (v. 21), ought not to escape the notice of the reader (iii.

                    where the practical exhortation, suspended for a time, is taken up, the apostle
                    has this unity that is in Christ still pressing upon his thoughts; for he no
                    sooner mentions the unity (verse 3) than in the fulness of his heart he hastens
                    to enlarge on it; and, recalling all the gifts which Christ had bestowed upon
                    His chμrch, he speaks of them as given to secure that we may “all,” that is
                    again, Jewish and Gentile Christians, attain unto the unity of the faith and of
                    the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a full grown man, unto the measure of the

                <p>It is not necessary to analyse further the teaching of this epistle, the

                    to show that one great thought runs through it all, not so much the glory of
                    Christ in Himself, as that glory realized in the church which is His body, in
                    which the scattered “buildings'’ are united into one holy temple, the scattered
                    “families” into one great family, the scattered “joints of supply "’into one
                    strong and vigorous body; and all this in Jesus Christ, whose glory is only

                <p>More, however, has to be said, for it is obvious that the description thus given
                    of the glory of the church is not given for its own sake only. It is neither a
                    pious meditation nor the splendid vision of an ecstatic hour. It has all a
                    practical bearing upon Gentile Christians. It is to show them that their calling
                    into the church is no accidental, doubtful thing. It is a part of God’s eternal
                    plan, the execution of which is essential to the accomplishing of the glory of
                    the Christ and of Himself in Him. Whatever, therefore, was their past state of
                    alienation, it could only be temporary. They must have their full share in the
                    privileges of those who are one with God, must be an integral portion of the one
                    body of His Son. None can be more near than they, for none in whom Christ is
                    revealed can be more near than others in whom the same revelation has been made.
                    Let them dispel their doubts, rest in the assurance that He who is the peace of
                    Israel is also their peace, and walk worthy of Him whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >pleroma</hi> they help to “fulfil.” The whole is the practical unfolding and
                    application of the thoughts which filled the apostle’s mind in his epistle to
                    the Colossians. The great importance to be attached to the Ephesian epistle in
                    the construction of the Pauline system of doctrine will thus be apparent. It
                    presents to us the realizing of that dispensation of God which belongs to the
                    fulness of all preceding “seasons” (i. 10), which is to exhibit the exceeding
                    riches of His grace to all ages that are to follow, one succeeding auother,
                    without end (ii. 7; mark the compound, not the simple verb, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ιτrepχοpivοii).</hi> It takes up everything that went before; and nothing can
                    be added to what it contains. It sets before us the completion of an edifice
                    whose foundations had been laid in a past eternity, and which was to stand for
                    ever. It is especially the storehouse of truth connected with the church, using
                    that word in its most comprehensive sense, for it treats of all the most
                    important features of her condition, her foundation, spirituality, unity,
                    organization, aim. The consequence is that the nature of the spiritual life is
                    brought out in this epistle to a wonderful degree Nowhere in the writings of St
                    Paul is such frequent allusion made to the work of the Spirit in the soul and in
                    the church. It would seem as if the apostle, feeling that in previous epistles
                    he had said all that he had to say of the <hi rend="italic">source</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">medium</hi> of redemption, desired to dwell, before he closed his
                    labours, upon its <hi rend="italic">application,</hi> to contemplate fully not
                    merely the. love of God and the grace of Christ, but the power of the Spirit, as
                    He enlightens, renews, seals, and fills the heart.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Relation to the Epistle to the Colossians,—</hi> We arc
                    thus prepared to examine the relation of our epistle to the epistle to the
                    Colossians. The complaint of De Wette upon this point has been echoed by many
                    later writers. The resemblances between the two epistles are said to be so great
                    that the former must be regarded as a mere verbose expansion of the latter Even
                    those by whom the authenticity of the Ephesian epistle is defeuded admit the
                    striking similarity; but they find the explanation of it in the fact that the
                    two epistles were written at the same time, when the same ideas were in the
                    author’s mind, and when be was writing to two churches in a similar condition. A
                    long succession of writers from Pa∣ey onwards have adopted this line of defence,
                    many of whom have at the same time rather inconsistently admitted that the
                    epistle to the Ephesiane shows no trace of the doctrinal errors combated in that
                    to the Colossians, and that what may be called the doctrinal portion of the two
                    epistles exhibits differences at least as striking as the similarities. The real
                    explanation seems to lie in a wholly different direction, and is to be found
                    neither in attempting to weaken the force of the similarities, nor in urging,
                    while admitting them, that the -wants of the readers were the same. The truth is
                    that there is no reason to doubt that the two churches of Laodicea and Colossae,
                    as might indeed from their proximity to each other have been expected, were in a
                    very similar condition, both doctrinally and practically, and that the same
                    great doctrines were in the apostle’s mind when he wrote to both. This
                    consideration explains the similarities which strike the reader; while the
                    difference.? spring not from difference of doctrine, but from the wholly
                    different and independent point of view from which the same doctrines are looked
                    at in each epistle. Thus Col. i. 14 is much the same as Eph. i. 7; Col. i. 20 as
                    Eph. i. 10; Col. i. 16 as Eph. i. 21; Col. i. 18, 19 as Eph. i. 22, 23; Col. ii.
                    13 as Eph ii. 5; Col. ii. 11 as Eph. ii. 11; Col. i. 20 as Eph. ii. 16; Col. i.
                    25, 26 as Eph. iii. 2, 3; but a comparison of these passages will show that,
                    whatever the resemblance be, they have in each epistle a distinct purpose of
                    their own: in that to the Colossians to set forth the glory of Him in whom the
                    whole church lives; in that to the Ephesians to show that this glory cannot be
                    fulfilled except by the bringing of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> into unity in His
                    one church so that there cannot be two separate communities, but only one body
                    in Christ. In short, the epistle to the Colossians is occupied with Christ
                    himself. In opposition to the Judaeo Gnostic errors prevailing in Colossae, and
                    doubtless in Laodicea also, the apostle sets forth in it Christ in His person,
                    life, death, resurrection, and exaltation in heaven. He is the true solution of
                    their religious perplexities. He is the one and only Mediator between God and
                    humanity, the one and only principle of the divine life to which humanity is to
                    be brought. The epistle to the Ephesians is occupied with the church. In
                    opposition to the arrogance of Jewish and the fears of Gentile Christians
                    prevailing in Laodicea, and doubtless in Colossae also, the apostle sets forth
                    in it the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n483/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0483-0464"/> church in its unity.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A distinct intimation of the arrogance with
                    which the Jewish looked down upon the Gentile Christians and of the contemptuous
                    language which they used concerning them, is afforded by Eph. ii. 11 (comp.
                    Meyer <hi rend="italic">in loc.}.</hi></p></note> It is the one body of Christ,
                    and the Gentiles must be a constituent part of the body if the body is to be
                    complete,— a part of the fulness, of the <hi rend="italic">pleroma,</hi> of
                    Christ, if that <hi rend="italic">pleroma</hi> is to be reached. They are not
                    therefore to suppose that, because they were once far off, they are not now
                    nigh, as nigh as those who claimed, and might appear, to have been always nigh
                    in a sense peculiar to themselves.</p>
                <p>It will thus be observed that the two epistles of which . we speak are in the
                    strictest sense complementary to one another; and we thus better understand how
                    it was that St Paul directed that the two should be read together (Col. iv. 16).
                    Without the other each was incomplete. But together they make up the complex
                    thought, “I am the vine, ye are the branches;” “Abide in me, and I in you.” Nor
                    is it without interest to notice that this is not a solitary instance of such a
                    relation between two different books of the New Testament written by the same
                    pen. A similar relation exists between the gospel of St Luke and the Acts of the
                    Apostles, and between the gospel of St John and the Apocalypse. In the first of
                    each of the three pairs we have Christ the head, in the second His body which is
                    the church. It will thus be seen, too, that, in the absence of direct historical
                    evidence we may be spared the inquiry as to which of the two epistles was
                    written first. All inquirers allow that the interval between them was extremely
                    short. The chief point of interest is that in this short interval the epistle to
                    the Colossians is first in order of thought, though not necessarily in order of
                    time. The inference of Harles3 from iv. 16 <hi rend="italic">(Eph. Brief,</hi>
                    Einl., p. 51) that, supposing the Ephesian epistle to be “that from Laodicea,”
                    it must have been written before the epistle to the Colossians, an order of
                    writing which he rejects, may be weakly founded, but it may also be correct.
                    There is nothing to hinder the supposition that with two aspects of the truth in
                    his mind, one of which is logically prior to the other, the apostle might first
                    transfer to paper the last of the two. The circumstances calling for it might at
                    the moment seem to be the most urgent. The priority of the Colossian epistle in
                    every respect worth speaking of will still remain, although we allow the
                    correctness of the inference drawn by Harless from the verse referred to, and
                    the argument for the identity of the epistle to the Ephesians with that “from
                    Laodicea” will be unaffected by the admission.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Authenticity of the Epistle.—</hi> It is only in
                    comparatively recent times that doubts have been entertained upon this point.
                    Usteri, in his <hi rend="italic">Paul. Lehrb.,</hi> 1824, appears to have been
                    the first to express them, although he did not hesitate to use the epistle for
                    the purpose of his book. The same doubts were afterwards more fully expressed by
                    »Schleiermacher, in his <hi rend="italic">Einleitung</hi><hi rend="italic">ins
                    N^.T.,</hi> from whose oral lectures, according to Bleek (Introd. Clark’s
                    Translation, ii. p. 39), Usteri had received his views. De Wette followed in
                    successive editions of his <hi rend="italic">Einleitung,</hi> from 1843 onwards,
                    not, however, deciding against the epistle, but only questioning its
                    authenticity on the ground of its want of specific purpose, its dependence on
                    the epistle to the Colossians, its poverty of thought, and its divergence both
                    in teaching and style from the genuine epistles of St Paul. He was followed by
                    Baur in his <hi rend="italic">Paulus,</hi> 1845, and by Schwegler in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Nachap.</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeitalt.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >,</hi> 1845, these two critics connecting the language of the epistle with the
                    Gnostic and Montanist heresies of the 2d century, and for the first time
                    unhesitatingly rejecting it. Ewald agrees with Baur and Schwegler in denying the
                    Pauline authorship of the epistle, but takes the date of its composition further
                    back, ascribing it to “an unnamed disciple and friend of the apostle” desirous
                    to speak in his spirit and name truths which St Paul himself had been too much
                    occupied with other things to utter <hi rend="italic">(Geschieht^</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d. V. I.,</hi> 1859, vii. p. 246-7). Lastly, Hilgenfeld may be
                    mentioned, who in his <hi rend="italic">Einleitung,</hi> p. 669, &lt;fcc., 1875,
                    gathering together the objections of his predecessors, and adding one or two
                    minor ones of his own, assigns the epistle to the Gnostic times of the 2d
                    century, and supposes it to have been written by a Christian of Asia belonging
                    to the Paιdine school, who was desirous at once to regain for the apostle the
                    alienated affections of the Asiatic Christians, and to compose the differences
                    between the Jewish and Gentile sections of the church.</p>
                <p>»Such being the state of the argument against the authenticity of the epistle, it
                    will be seen that the more important objections have been already, by
                    anticipation, met in the previous positive statements of the article.</p>
                <p>(1.) In particular, it ought to be necessary to say little more upon what has
                    been generally felt to be the most powerful of these, the want of specific aim
                    betrayed by the epistle, and its dependence upon the epistle to the Colossians.
                    A specific aim, however erroneously conceived, is distinctly attributed to it by
                    its later opponents; and we have only to compare it a little more closely with
                    the epistle to the Colossians in order to see that, so far from merely
                    containing the teaching of that epistle in an extended form, it exhibits
                    thorough independence. Its very resemblance to the Colossian epistle makes this
                    the more striking, because it shows us not something entirely new, but that new
                    use of old truths which is often more difficult to produce than what is wholly
                    new. It is not thus that the imitator or forger discovers himself. To be able to
                    wield a great doctrine in this way, to present it to one’s self and others in
                    different lights, to apply it to varying circumstances, indicates a full and
                    original possession of it. An imitator would of necessity have repeated what had
                    been said before. He would have shown no originality or power in his treatment
                    of the doctrine, and we should have received at his hands nothing but broken and
                    imperfect fragments of what he had not himself assimilated. No traces of such
                    weakness meet us here. We are in the presence of a master who has felt the
                    fulness of the truth proclaimed by him, and who can see with his own eyes the
                    different applications of which it is susceptible. Careful attention, again, to
                    the passages quoted in support of the assertion that the Ephesian is not merely
                    a reproduction of the Colossian epistle, but one indicating comparative poverty
                    both in ideas and words (such as Eph. iii. 15 compared with Col. ii. 19; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> Eph. i. 17, 18 compared with Col. i. 9) will show
                    that the richness of thought and language is often on the side of the former of
                    the two. But the true answer to the objection is to be found not in any attempt
                    to exalt either epistle at the expense of the other so much as in marking the
                    independent handling by both of the closely related truths with which they deal.
                    Both will then appear in the light in which even Baur was disposed to regard
                    them, “twin brothers coming together into the world” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Paulus,</hi> p. 455); and the question will no longer be one of copying, but
                    of authorship later than the apostolic age.</p>
                <p>(2.) This, accordingly, is the objection that next meets us. It is urged that the
                    epistle to the Ephesians bears evident marks of having spnιng up in the midst of
                    the Gnostic heresies of the ∣ second century. The peculiar phraseology of many
                    parts of the: epistle is supposed to confirm this. Thus we are prepared by the
                    words of iv. 14 to suppose that the writer has false teachings in his eye; and
                    when we find him speakingas he does of “the mystery’ of God’s·will (i. 9, comp.
                    iii. .4, 9, v. 32, vi. 19), of the <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pleroma,</hi><hi rend="italic">''</hi> that favourite term of the Gnostic
                    systems (i. 23, iii. 19, iv. 13; comp. iv. 10, V. 18), of the “aeon” of this
                    world (ii. 2), the “aeons” (ii. 7, iii. 9, 11), the “aeon of the aeons” (iii.
                    21), of “the prince of the power of the air” (ii. 2), of “the principalities and
                    the authorities in the heavenly places” (iii. 10, comp. i. 21, vi. 12), of the
                    “knowledge” (iii. 19) and the “full knowledge” (i. 17, iv. 13) to which
                    Christians are to come, and of the “manifold wisdom of God” (iii. 21), the
                    conclusion is considered irresistible, that we have in all this an opposition to
                    Gnosticism, and a date later than the first century. We shall not attempt to
                    deny the probability that there is a reference to Gnostic errors in expressions
                    such as these. To say that they were originally employed by the apostle in order
                    to unfold after his own manner the truth that he had to proclaim, and that they
                    were then, in speculative abuse, made the foundation of, or essential elements
                    in, Gnostic systems is unnatural. They are too peculiar, too different from the
                    language of St Paul in his earlier epistles, to permit such an explanation.

                    first into existence with the Gnostics of the second century we should at once
                    give up the argument. The whole question is thus one of date. Had such ideas or
                    words existence in the apostolic age or had they not? Answer must be made in the
                    affirmative. Some of the expressions referred to, “mystery,” “aeon,”
                    “knowledge,” “full knowledge,” “wisdom,” occur with remarkable frequency in St
                    Paul’s undisputed epistles to the Romans, Corinthians, and Galatians. “The
                    prince of the power of the air” combined with “the worldrulers of this darkness”
                    (Eph. vi. 12) presents only an unmistakable parallel to “the prince of this
                    world” in the gospel of St John (xii. 31, xiv. 30, xvi. 11), a gospel which, in
                    the present state of criticism upon the point, it would be absurd to bring down
                    to the middle of the second century. Speculations, again, regarding the
                    different ordere of the celestial hierarchy, in regard to its thrones and
                    dominions and principalities and powers, in regard also to the worshipping of
                    angels, can be traced to the very confines of the apostolic age; and from the
                    masterly dissertation on the word <hi rend="italic">pleroma</hi> attached by
                    Canon Lightfoot to his epistle to the Colossians, it will be seen what a high
                    probability there is that that word belonged to the apostolic age itself (comp.
                    Burton’s <hi rend="italic">Lectures on the Gnostic Heresies,</hi> Leet. v.).</p>
                <p>It thus appears that these Gnostic ideas were in circulation before the apostolic
                    age was out. That it was later before they were combined and elaborated into the
                    systems now known as the Gnostic systems, and that the elaboration of these
                    systems may itself have been promoted by the use in the sacred writings of the
                    terms mentioned, is no doubt true; but that is no proof that the ideas
                    themselves did not possess at the earlier date a powerful hold over the minds of
                    men. If so, then the province of Asia was one of the great centres of their
                    influence. Its cities were the meeting place of all eastern as well as western
                    thought; and in them, far more than in Rome or Corinth or Thessalonica or
                    Galatia, Gnosticism found at once a home and a starting-point for further
                    progress. What, then, was an apostle to do when he went to places where such
                    thoughts prevailed, and where they were injuriously affecting the life of the
                    church? Exactly what St Paul did in the epistles to Laodicea and Colossae. The
                    new terms used by him came from the new teaching made necessary by the places
                    and the time. As he thought of the wants of those to whom he wrote, he saw that
                    the truth committed to him could meet their more speculative errors, could
                    satisfy their more speculative wants, as fully as it had met and satisfied
                    necessities of a still earlier and simpler kind. He learned to see more clearly,
                    to estimate more highly, the grandeur of his trust. He hastened, therefore, with
                    it to the rescue; and, like any one on whom a new vision of divine truth has
                    dawned, he did it with an exuberance of language, with a power of expression,
                    with a swing of exultation, such as he had only on rare occasions exhibited
                    before. Nor only so. The very form of his teaching was modified, and took traces
                    of the speculations it was designed to counteract. The spectacle is a most
                    interesting one, and ought to be most encouraging and quickening to Christian
                    faith. The truth does not differ in the epistles to which we allude from what it
                    was in earlier epistles by the same author. But there is growth, development.
                    There is a <hi rend="italic">theology</hi> in the proper sense of the term even
                    in the New Testament itself—a spur to theologians of every age to adapt in like
                    manner the eternal truth to the wants of their own times, and to construct a
                    theology which shall be living, because, while founded on the great facts of the
                    gospel, it is cast in the mould which their times demand.</p>
                <p>(3.) Hilgenfeld’s view as to the harmonizing tendency of the epistle, as to its
                    effect in uniting opposing parties into one catholic church, has also been
                    substantially met. The epistle is throughout addressed to one class of persons,
                    not to two classes; and there is no allusion whatever to any factious spirit
                    exhibited by the former. That the church of Christ is one was surely a truth
                    which sprang, not out of the controversies of hostile parties, but out of the
                    teaching of Christ Himself in the gospels (comp. esp. Johu x.), and which is
                    nowhere more strenuously insisted on than in the acknowledged epistles of St
                    Paul (Rom. xii., 1 Cor. x. xi. xii.). The peculiarity here is not in the thought
                    itself, but in the mode in which the thought is presented; and the explanation
                    of this is to be found in the considerations already adduced.</p>
                <p>(4.) Other objections to the authenticity of our epistles, such as its <hi
                    rend="italic">aτa½ Xtyipiva</hi> and its un-Pauline statements, may be passed
                    over in a few words. The former are certainly not more numerous than may be
                    expected when we remember the peculiar state of circumstances to which the
                    apostle addresses himself. The most important examples of the latter are—ii. 20,
                    “apostles and prophets” as the foundation, the citation in v. 14, which it is
                    said cannot be identified, and the mode in which justification is alluded to in
                    ii. 8, while Hilgenfeld, not satisfied with these examples from Baur, finds a
                    proof that we have a Pauline disciple rather than St Paul himself before us in
                    iii. 8, “the least of all saints,” instead of “the least of the apostles” as in
                    1 Cor. xv. 9. It is hardly possible to follow such minute objections here. For
                    the first compare 1 Cor. xii. 28; for the second we may compare Isa. lx. 1, 2,
                    and may remember the freedom with which the Old Testament is often quoted in the
                    New; for the third it may be noticed that in a statement which Baur finds
                    unfavourable to Pauline authorship, Hilgenfeld finds a clear proof of Pauline
                    discipleship (p. 677); and for the fourth that, in the verse in Corinthians
                    immediately preceding that referred to, the apostle designates himself “an
                    abortion,” a much more humbling expression than “the least of all saints.” Those
                    who allow force to what has been said on the first three objections will not be
                    stumbled by such minor difficulties. Those who refuse it will feel that what
                    they consider their unanswered objections are sufficient to justify their
                    position. We may omit further notice of them, and may simply urge upon the point
                    before us that, the field being thus cleared of the objections, we are thrown
                    back upon what is really the main ground upon which the New Testament books are
                    to be accepted, the tradition of the church. It is quite a possible thing that
                    in a particular case, whether relating to the Old or New Testament, that
                    tradition may be incorrect. All fair criticism, therefore, is to be welcomed;
                    but, when no good objection to an accepted opinion of the church has been
                    established, there is everything to lead us to acquiesce in it with confidence.
                    The early church was not so thoughtless upon these points as she is often said
                    to have been. She guarded her treasures with great care, and was very watchful
                    lest anything should be placed amongst them in whose genuineness she had not
                    every confidence. What the tradition of the church is in the present instance is
                    not doubted; and it is unnecessary to enter here into detail. The ordinary
                    introductions to the New Testament and the prologomena of the different
                    commentators on the epistle contain all the facts. <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Occasion, Place, and Date of the Epistle.—</hi> It will not
                    be necessary to say much upon these points. The occasion was evidently afforded
                    by the despatch of Tychicus and Onesimus to Colossae (Col. iv. 7-9; comp. Eph.
                    vi. 21). By them St Paul would send letters to the Colossian church and to
                    Philemon, one of its members. He embraced the opportunity of writing also to the
                    Gentile converts of Loadicea, and of the neighbouring church at Colossae; and
                    that epistle, not being written to a church, but being primarily intended for a
                    section of the Christian communities of the two cities, had no name of a place
                    inserted in it as the object of its destination. In this respect it resembles,
                    and may be regarded as a counterpart of, the epistle to the Hebrews.</p>
                <p>As to the place where it was penned, the question lies between Rome and Caesarea,
                    for St Paul was a prisoner at the time (iii. 1, iv. 20), and his imprisonment in
                    one or other of these two cities must be referred to. The question has been
                    decided by some in favour of Caesarea on such grounds as the following :—that
                    Caesarea was nearer Asia than Rome was, and that thus the spiritual condition of
                    the Asiatic churches would be more easily known to the apostle at the former
                    than the latter city; that for the same reason Onesimus, who we know from the
                    epistle to Philemon was met by the apostle in the place of his imprisonment,
                    would be more likely to flee from his master to Caesarea than to Rome; that the
                    words of the epistle to Philemon “departed for a season” (v. 15) imply a shorter
                    absence than is involved in the thought of Rome, and therefore point to
                    Caesarea, because it is not likely that St Paul would have so many of his
                    friends beside him at Rome as he had when he wrote the three letters of which
                    the epistle to the Ephesians is one—Tychicus, Aristarchus, Mark, Jesus Justus,
                    Epaphras, Luke (see the epistles); because if the apostle wrote from Rome,
                    Tychicus and Onesimus would pass through Ephesus or Laodicea on their way to
                    Colossae, and we ought therefore to find Onesimus commended to the church there,
                    whereas, if the apostle wrote from Caesarea, his two friends would be at
                    Colossae first, and Tychicus, leaving Onesimus behind, would proceed thence
                    alone; because the words “that ye also may know” (vi. 21) lead to the inference
                    that others had been told of the apostle’s state, who can only be the
                    Colossians, visited on the way between Caesarea and Ephesus; because it would
                    seem that the apostle intended at the close of his imprisonment to visit Phrygia
                    (Philemon i. 22), whereas we learn from Phil. ii. 24 that at the close of the
                    Roman <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n485/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0485-0466"/> imprisonment he intended to visit Macedonia. In
                    so far as these considerations relate to the thought of a place where
                    information as to the state of distant churches could most easily be had, where
                    friends would be most likely to congregate, or in which fugitives would most
                    readily seek refuge, it is obvious that they are better fulfilled by Rome than
                    by Caesarea. The idea again of visiting Macedonia might be fulfilled by its
                    being taken on the way to Asia. No stress can be laid on the omissiou of the
                    name of Onesimus, and the meaning of vi. 21 does not seem to be that ye “also,”
                    in addition to the Colossians, <hi rend="italic">of whom nothing had been
                    said,</hi> “may know,” but that ye, of whose state I have spoken freely as one
                    thoroughly acquainted with it, may “also” know my state. The decisive argument,
                    however, for Rome rather than Caesarea, as the place whence the epistle was
                    written, arises from the fact that all the epistles known as those of the
                    imprisonment must have been written from the same place, and that this
                    epistolary activity is more naturally connected with Rome than with Caesarea. In
                    the former city the apostle had much greater freedom than in the latter, both to
                    receive intelligence and to write to friends (Acts xxviii. 30, 31). Upon the
                    whole, the commonly entertained belief that our epistle was written at Rome may
                    be received without hesitation. If so, it was written towards the close of the
                    apostle’s captivity in that city, 63 A.D.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literature.—</hi> In dealing with an epistle such as. this it
                    is unnecessary to devote much space to the literature of the subject. Any one
                    desirous to study the epistle will gradually become acquainted with it as he
                    pursues his task. But references may be made to the various Introductions to the
