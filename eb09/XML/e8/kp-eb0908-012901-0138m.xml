                    487 square miles, or 312,375 acres, nearly one-third of which may be considered
                    as under cultivation. As thus limited, the county comprises but the eastern
                    portion of the ancient province of Moray, which extended from the Spey on the
                    east to the river Beauly on the west, and from the sea to the Grampians
                    southwards.</p>
                <p>Elginshire naturally divides itself into two portions, distinguished not less by
                    physical aspect and geological structure than by the products of the soil—the
                    seaboard and the upland. The surface of the former, as its local name, “laigh o’
                    Moray,” implies, is level, rising, however, between the mouth of the Lossie and
                    Burghead, and westward from Elgin, into ridges of some height. Throughout this
                    district the prevailing rock is sandstone, overtopped to the south and east of
                    Elgin, and in several other localities—as at Lossiemouth—by a species of
                    limestone or “cherty rock.” From the mouth of the Spey we3t and south till the
                    gneissose rocks of the uplands are reached, the sandstone is of a dark red
                    colour, and belongs undoubtedly to the Old Red or Devonian formation. Elsewhere
                    in the district it is grey or yellow, apparently overlying beds of this Old Red,
                    but almost destitute of fossils, except in the coast ridge and the parallel
                    portion of the inland ridge already mentioned, where are the famous
                    reptiliferous strata whose age has lately given rise to so much discussion.
                    Oolitic patches, indicative of a formation of mesozoic age having once existed
                    in the neighbourhood, are also found scattered between Elgin and the sea.
                    Favoured by an excellent climate and rich soil, the lowlands of Moray have been
                    long noted for their fertility. Wheat, barley, and oats are all grown in great
                    perfection, and exotic fruits of various kinds ripen freely in the open air.
                    Since the beginning of the present century, agricultural pursuits have been
                    carried on in a spirit that has greatly increased the natural resources of the
                    district. Within the same period the breeding and rearing of cattle has become
                    one of the most profitable occupations of the farmer; and some of the finest
                    shorthorned and polled cattle in Scotland are to be seen here, as well as
                    crosses between these two breeds. On a number of the more extensive farms large
                    flocks of sheep, chiefly Leicesters, are kept all the year round. The upland
                    portion of the county is hilly, gradually rising higher and higher above the
                    level of the sea,—the loftiest of its ridges being the Cromdale hills, one point
                    of which has an elevation of 2328 feet. Here the rocks are metamorphic, with
                    associated limestones and veins of granite, closely resembling the rocks
                    elsewhere met with around the Grampians, between the Old Red and the central
                    masses of granite and other once molten matter. Their strike is N.E. and S.W.,
                    the same as prevails between Aberdeen and Argyll. The climate of this district
                    is much colder and damper; oats is the principal cereal, barley being confined
                    to the glens and straths; the cattle partake more of the character of the
                    Highland breed; and the blackfaced sheep takes the place of the Leicester.</p>
                <p>The rivers of Elginshire are three in number—the Spey in the east, the Lossie in
                    the centre, and the Findhorn in the west. The first of these rises in Badenoch,
                    a district of Inverness-shire, and, after flowing north-east for a distance of
                    about 120 miles (including windings), of which 50 are in Elginshire, falls into
                    the Moray Firth at the village of Garmouth. It is said to be the most rapid
                    river in Scotland, and to discharge a larger volume of water than any other
                    Scottish stream, the Tay alone excepted. The Spey receives a number of
                    tributaries, the chief of which are the Truim, the Dulnain, the Avon, and the
                    Fiddich. The Lossie, by far the smallest of the three, and the only one of them
                    that rises within the boundaries of the county, issues from a small loch of the
                    same name in the uplands, and, after a somewhat tortuous course of about 25
                    miles, empties itself into the sea at Lossiemouth. The Findhorn, like the Spey,
                    has its source in Inverness-shire, in the western slope of the Monadleadh
                    mountains, which for a number of miles form the watershed between it and the
                    Spey. It then flows through parts of Nairn and Moray shires, and, after running
                    in a north-easterly direction for about 70 miles, of which not more than 11 are
                    within the boundaries of the latter, reaches the sea at the village of Findhorn,
                    where it expands into an estuary of some extent. For seven or eight miles after
                    it enters Morayshire, the scenery along its banks is among the grandest and
                    finest of the kind in Britain. Of all the rivers affected by the memorable
                    rainfall that occurred in the north of Scotland in August 1829, none rose higher
                    or committed greater havoc than the Findhorn. Both the Spey and the Findhorn
                    abound in salmon and grilse, the fisheries for which are very valuable. West of
                    the estuary of the latter are the Culbin sandhills, some of which, though ever
                    shifting, have an average height of 118 feet. They cover what was 200 years ago
                    an extensive estate, then comprising thousands of acres of the finest land, but
                    now presenting an impressive scene of desolation and solitude. The lochs are
                    small and few in number. The sea coast is very exposed; rocky between
                    Lossiemouth and Burghead, elsewhere low and sandy. Of its few harbours, Burghead
                    is the most sheltered by position; but a good deal has been done by art for that
                    of Lossiemouth, in which a number of vessels may sometimes be seen lying. For a
                    number of years the herring fishery was successfully prosecuted at Lossiemouth,
                    Burghead, Hopeman, and Findhorn, there being one season as many as 120 boats
                    fishing from Lossiemouth alone; but latterly it has been more or less a failure,
                    owing to the herring, for some cause or other, having become scarcer in their
                    eld feeding grounds. Large quantities of haddock, cod, and ling are caught in
                    the firth and sent south during the winter and spring. Elginshire is not
                    particularly rich in minerals. No true coal has yet been discovered within its
                    limits; and though iron ore is said to exist in the higher parts, it cannot,
                    owing to the absence of coal, be profitably worked. Lead occurs to the west of
                    Lossiemouth. Attempts formerly made to extract it from the rock in sufficient
                    quantities to prove remunerative failed; but operations lately undertaken give
                    promise of success. The yellow sandstone of the lower district is a
                    building-stone of superior excellence, practically inexhaustible,—the distinct
                    glacial striae, seen on most of its outcropping strata, proving how capable it
                    is of resisting all atmospheric influence. The rough impracticable gneissose
                    beds of the upper district offer no favourite building-stone, and true slates
                    are unknown. The plantations consist of larch, fir, and to a less extent oak.
                    The country is well wooded, but since the introduction of railways a
                    considerable quantity of timber has been cut down. The forest of Damaway, on the
                    left bank of the Findhorn, is believed to be a remnant of the natural wood with
                    which a great part of Scotland was once covered. The manufactures are by no
                    means important. Shipbuilding is carried on at the mouth of the Spey, though not
                    on a large scale. The Highland Railway, which traverses Morayshire from east to
                    west, is joined at Alves and Kinloss by branches from Burghead and Findhorn
                    respectively, the latter of these being at present (1878) disused. At Forres the
                    main line of the same railway strikes off for Perth by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n139/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0139-0130"/> valleys, first of the River Findhom and
                    afterwards of the Spey, the Garry, and the Tay. The Great North of Scotland
                    Railway has also been extended from Keith to Elgin by a somewhat circuitous
                    route, and is connected with the Highland Railway at Boat of Garten in
                    Strathspey. The Morayshire Railway, joining Elgin to Lossiemouth, the first line
                    formed north of Aberdeen, is now worked as a branch of the Great North. In 1872
                    there were in Elginshire 251 owners of land of 1 acre and upwards in extent, the
                    principal among them being the earl of Seafield (Castle Grant), 96,721; the earl
                    of Fife (Innes House), 40,951; Sir William G. Gordon Cumming, Bart. (Altyre
                    House), 36,387; the earl of Moray (Darnaway Castle), 21,669; and the duke of
                    Richmond and Gordon (Gordon Castle), 12,271. In the same year the annual value
                    of the land in the county was estimated to be upwards of £200,000. The number of
                    inhabited houses was 8452. The aggregate population of the whole county was, in
                    1831, 34,498; in 1841, 35,012; in 1851, 38,959; in 1861, 44,218; in 1871,
                    43,612. It unites with Nairnshire in returning a member to parliament. In
                    1877-78 the combined constituency was 1837 of which 1555 voters were in
                    Elginshire. The county contains 22 parishes. Ecclesiastically it is part of the
                    synod of Moray, the limits of which are nearly co-extensive with those of the
                    ancient province, except that Strathbogie has been added.</p>
                <p>There are two royal burghs in Elginshire—Elgin, the county town (for which see
                    below), and Forres. Forres (population in 1871, 3959) must have been a place of
                    some importance at an early date, though it was subsequently overshadowed by the
                    neighbouring burgh or city. Its castle was for 300 years the official residence
                    of the hereditary sheriffs of Moray; and of the lands anciently bestowed upon it
                    by royal favour it still possesses upwards of 1000 acres. The town is pleasantly
                    situated at the foot of the Cluny Hills, several wooded eminences traversed in
                    all directions by public walks that are sheltered alike from the heat of summer
                    and from the cold of winter. On the southern slope of one of them is a large
                    hydropathic establishment. Forres being one of the centres of railway
                    communication in the north, all parts of the country are easily accessible from
                    it. Its most noteworthy memorial of antiquity is Sweno’s Stone, one of those
                    remarkable sculptured monuments peculiar to the north-east of Scotland. Besides
                    the villages on the coast mentioned above, Elginshire contains those of
                    Fochabers, Rothes, and Grantown.</p>
                <p>In all parts of the county the oldest names of places are Celtic, showing clearly
                    what race had at one time been in possession of the soil. At the dawn of
                    authentic history we find Macbeth, Ri or Mormaer of Moray, in rebellion against
                    “the gracious Duncan.” The sequel is well known. A century or so later there was
                    a great influx of strangers into Moray—Normans, Saxons, and Flemings—who got
                    large grants of land from David I. and his immediate successors. It was in those
                    days that the family of De Moravia became the owners of the fairest part of the
                    province. At the same period, and under the fostering influence of the same
                    kings, the church acquired extensive lands in Moray. In addition to the
                    cathedral at Elgin, there were the abbey of Kinloss, and the priories of
                    Urquhart and Pluscarden, all well endowed. Chief among its ruined castles are
                    Spynie Palace, the country residence of the bishops of Moray; Duffus, once the
                    home of the De Moravias, and “still the admiration of the antiquary;” Rothes,
                    for centuries the seat of the Leslies; and, built on an island in the middle of
                    a loch of the same name, Lochindorb, which was in the 13th century one of the
                    mountain strongholds of the then powerful family of Cornyn. Another interesting
                    locality is the promontory of Burg head, or “the Broch,” as it is still
                    familiarly called, anciently the site of a Christian church, the date of the
                    planting of which there is some evidence to show goes back as far as the days of
                    Columba, and probably the site also of one of those brochs or fortresses so
                    common in the more northern parts of the kingdom, the nationality of whose
                    builders is still a matter of dispute. The headland was afterwards turned,
                    apparently by the destruction of these or other buildings, into a kind of
                    fortified camp, a plan of which has been preserved by General Roy, in his
                    Military Antiquities of North Britain, Except a remarkable well cut in the solid
                    rock, and -of older date at least than the mounds sketched by Roy, few vestiges
                    of the former importance of Burghead now remain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Elgin,</hi> a royal and parliamentary burgh of Scotland, and
                    the county town of the above county, which, from its having been once the see of
                    a bishop, and occasionally the residence of the kings of Scotland, claims for
                    itself the designation of a city. It occupies a sheltered situation on the banks
                    of the small river Lossie, about five miles from where the latter enters the
                    Moray Firth. From Edinburgh it is distant by railway 200 miles, from Aberdeen
                    71, and from Inverness 36∣. Elgin has one main street about a mile in length,
                    with several others running parallel or at right angles to it. Northwards across
                    the Lossie is the suburb of Bishopmill, in a different parish, but within the
                    parliamentary boundaries of the burgh. In the outskirts of Elgin proper, as well
                    as in the neighbourhood of Bishopmill, are a large number of villas, most of
                    them built within the last thirty years. On an eminence at the west end of the
                    High Street stands Gray’s Hospital, opened for the reception of patients in
                    1819. It was built and is maintained out of the proceeds of a legacy of £24,000,
                    bequeathed for the purpose by Alexander Gray, surgeon, H.E.I.C.S., a native of
                    the town. The site of the old church of St Giles is occupied by the parish
                    church, erected in 1828, at an expense of nearly £9000. At the eastern extremity
                    of High Street is Anderson’e Institution, “for the education of youth and the
                    support of old age,” opened in 1833. This building cost nearly £12,000. Its
                    founder, the son of a poor woman who cradled him among the ruins of the
                    cathedral, rose from the ranks to be a major-general in the service of the East
                    India Company, and bequeathed for the erection and endowment of this institution
                    £70,000. On the top of Ladyhill rises a column 80 feet high, surmounted by a
                    statue of the last duke of Gordon in his robes as chancellor of Marischal
                    College and University, Aberdeen. Along the High Street are many handsome modern
                    structures, erected mainly for business purposes, prominent among which are
                    those belonging to various banking companies. Other public buildings and
                    institutions are—the District Asylum, the Assembly Rooms, the Market Buildings,
                    the Burgh Court-house and the County Buildings, the Club-house and Reading-room,
                    the Museum, and the Morayshire Union Poorhouse. The places of worship, besides
                    the parish church, are the High and South Free churches, the Moss Street and
                    South Street U.P. churches, the Congregational church, and the Episcopal, the
                    Roman Catholic, and the Baptist chapels, all of them of recent date. Elgin is
                    well supplied with schools, the old grammar school of. the burgh being
                    represented by the Elgin Academy. The ruins of the cathedral are situated at the
                    east end of the town. In 1390, after it had stood 166 years, the “Wolfe of
                    Badenoch,” a natural son of King Robert IL, having quarrelled with Bishop Barr,
                    set fire to the splendid pile. The destruction thus wrought was repaired but
                    slowly, owing in part to the lawless condition of the country in those days.
                    After the Reformation, the lead was stripped from the roof in 1568 by order of
                    the Privy Council, and shipped for Holland to be there sold. The building being

                    of the weather, andin 1711 the great central tower fell to the ground. It
                    remained in a neglected state till about 1820, when it was taken possession of
                    in the name of the Crown by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests. The
                    cathedral is now well inclosed, and every attention paid to its preservation
                    from further decay. Adjoining are the ruins of the town house of the bishops of
                    Moray, whose official residence was Spynie Palace, situated about three miles to
                    the north. The Museum, already mentioned, contains, besides objects from various
                    parts of the world, a very complete collection illustrating the natural history
                    and antiquities of the county, chiefly formed through the zeal and activity of a
                    band of local workers.</p>
                <p>The trade of Elgin is largely connected with its weekly and other markets. It
                    has, however, two woollen manufactories, a tanwork, one or two small iron
                    foundries, two breweries, and some other industrial establishments. Its port is
                    Lossiemouth, with which it is connected by railway, but it has likewise railway
                    communication with Burghead. The railway from Aberdeen to Inverness passes the
                    town, and a branch line strikes off southwards here that traverses Strathspey.
                    There are several newspapers, one of which is published twice a week; and,
                    besides a circulating library and book clubs, Elgin has a literary and
                    scientific society in connection with the Museum. Attracted by early
                    associations, by the salubrity of its climate, or by other advantages it enjoys,
                    not a few gentlemen of independent means make it their home. The municipal
                    corporation of the burgh and city of Elgin consists of a provost, 4 bailies, and
                    12 councillors; and, along with Banff, Cullen, Inverurie, Kintore, and
                    Peterhead, it returns one member to the imperial parliament. Population in 1871,
                    7340; parliamentary constituency in 1877-8, 918.</p>
                <p>The first notice we have of Elgin carries us back beyond the middle of the 12th
                    century. In a charter granted by David I. to a priory in its neighbourhood, it
                    is referred to as “my burgh of Elgin.” Certain privileges bestowed on its
                    citizens by this king were afterwards confirmed and extended by his grandson,
                    William the Lion, who seems to have oftener than once held his court in its
                    castle. William’s son and successor, Alexander 11., frequently resided there,
                    and it was in his reign that it became an episcopal city. When Edward I. of
                    England entered Scotland in the year 1296 at the head of his army, he marched
                    northwards as far as Elgin, where he remained some days. The town or city must
                    then have been a place of considerable importance. Its castle, the ruins of
                    which are still to be seen on a green mound near its western boundary, called
                    Ladyhill, was one of the seats of Scottish royalty. Beneath this fortress, and
                    commanded by it, ran the single street— now High Street—that formed the ancient
                    town, with the East and West Ports at either end. Two short lanes branching off
                    near its centre led to the North and South Ports respectively. At one time these
                    four Ports were no doubt connected by some defensive works. About half-way
                    between the East and West Ports, stood a church dedicated to St Giles, the
                    patron saint of Elgin, and surrounded by a graveyard. A little to the west of
                    this church was the Tolbooth. There is evidence that the clergy and landed
                    proprietors of the town and neighbourhood had even then residences within the
                    limits of the town. But its glory was its noble cathedral, founded in 1224 by
                    Bishop Andrew Moray, and declared by Billings to have been “the most stately and
                    the most beauti fully decorated of all the ecclesiastical edifices of the
                    country.” Clustered round the cathedral were the deanery, and the manses and
                    gardens of the canons,—the whole constituting the “College,” and inclosed by a
                    stone wall 20 feet high and 6 feet thick. Among its other ecclesiastical
                    buildings were two monasteries, one of black and the other of grey friars, and a
                    chapel to the Virgin connected with the castle. The Keformation, by stripping
                    Elgin of its ecclesiastical honours, greatly reduced its influence. It
                    continued, however, till towards the close of the last century to be the winter
                    residence of the chief landowners of the district, some of whom lived in houses
                    surrounded by large gardens, others in mansions fronting the street and resting
                    on squat pillars and arches. A characteristic specimen of the latter is shown by
                    Billings in his Baronial and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Scotland. The
                    merchant gentlemen of the town, some of whom earned on a very extensive import
                    and export tιade in all sorts of commodities, occupied dwellings of the same
                    class, while the humbler burgesses lived in smaller houses, whose crow-stepped
                    gables were turned to the main street. With the change that, owing to various
                    influences came over the social habits of the upper classes in the course of the
                    last century, the importance of Elgin was a second time threatened, but when the
                    agricultural resources of the country began to be more fully developed, its
                    position as the centre of one of the most fertile districts of Scotland gave a
                    new impetus to its prosperity.</p>
