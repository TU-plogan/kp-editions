                    born towards the close of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was
                    the son of Polymnis, and belonged to a noble family. Brought up in poverty, he
                    was diligent in acquiring the culture of the age, and became skilful in
                    gymnastic exercises and in playing the flute. For his intellectual education he
                    was chiefly indebted to lysis of Tarentum, a Pythagorean exile. According to the
                    account given by Plutarch, he served on the Spartan side at the battle of
                    Mantinea in 385 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> along with Pelopidas, who having
                    fallen apparently mortally wounded during the engagement, was protected by
                    Epaminondas at the risk of his life. Some have supposed this incident to have
                    been the origin of a friendship which is one of the most honourable and enduring
                    in ancient Greek history. Epaminondas was almost past his prime before he took
                    any prominent part in public affairs. He refused at first to co-operate in the
                    revolution of 379 B.c., of which his friend Pelopidas was one of the leaders,
                    owing to Pythagorean scruples as to the possible shedding of innocent blood. But
                    his desire to be freed from the Spartan yoke was as keen as that of any of his
                    fellow citizens, and after the blow was struck he did his utmost to stir up the
                    Theban youth to maintain their independence. In 371 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Epaminondas was one of the chief representatives of Thebes at the
                    conference at Sparta where the Athenians sought to arrange a peace. He claimed
                    the right to sign the treaty for Boeotia, thus asserting the supremacy -of
                    Thebes over the Boeotian cities. The claim was not recognized by the
                    representatives of the other states, and as Epaminondas insisted on it, Thebes
                    was excluded from the treaty altogether. A Spartan invasion of Boeotia under
                    Cleombrotus immediately followed the rupture of negotiations. With an army not
                    one-half the strength of that opposed to it, Epaminondas inflicted a crushing
                    defeat upon the invaders in the celebrated battle of Leuctra (371). He
                    immediately set himself to consolidate the position of Thebes by forming
                    alliances and by weakening Sparta. With the latter object in view, he supported
                    the founding of Megalopolis and the organization of Arcadia as an independent
                    government. In 369 he entered the Peloponnesus, and took another important step
                    towards the weakening of Sparta by establishing the Messenians in their own
                    country, and founding the city of Messene on Mount Ithome. On their return home
                    Epaminondas and Pelopidas were accused of having retained their command beyond
                    the legal period. Though there was no doubt that they had broken the letter of
                    the law, Epaminondas made a spirited defence, which secured the acquittal of
                    both. In the spring of 368 Epaminondas was again in the Peloponnesus, and
                    detached Sicyon and Pellene from the Lacedaemonian alliance. On his return,
                    however, he was repulsed by Chabrias in an attack which he made upon Corinth.
                    Later in the same year he took part in the unsuccessful expedition sent to
                    Thessaly to deliver Pelopidas from Alexander of Pherae, though he did not hold a
                    command, having been degraded owing to an impression that he had not been
                    sufficiently active against Sparta in the previous campaign. In the next year
                    (367) he was sent at the head of an army into Thessaly, and succeeded in freeing
                    Pelopidas without requiring to give battle. Meanwhile the relation of the
                    Arcadians with Thebes had been growing unfriendly, and all the efforts of
                    Epaminondas could not prevent them from forming an alliance with Athens. Matters
                    were. brought to a crisis in 363, when the Theban governor of Tegea arrested the
                    representatives of Arcadia, who had met there to conclude a peace with Elis.
                    Though the prisoners were released in a short time, and an apology made for
                    their arrest, the Arcadians demanded the punishment of the governor. Epaminondas
                    replied that the mistake lay not in the arrest but in the release, and that he
                    would come shortly and reduce the Arcadians to reason. Accordingly in 362 he
                    invaded the Peloponnesus for the fourth time. A. pitched battle was fought at
                    Mantinea, in which the Thebans were victorious, but Epaminondas was mortally
                    wounded. He was carried out of the throng, and being told that he would die as
                    soon as the javelin was withdrawn from his wound, he did not allow this, to be
                    done until he had heard that his army was victorious and that his shield was
                    safe. A column was erected over his grave, which was made on the spot where he
                    fell.</p>
