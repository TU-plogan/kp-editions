                    in 1791, became lieutenant in 1797, and in 1798 was attached as aide-de-camp to
                    General Eblé. In his first campaign in Italy he greatly distinguished himself;
                    and in April 1799 he was rewarded for his services by the grade of captain in
                    the 16 th regiment of dragoons. In the same year he took part with honour in
                    several battles connected with the conquest of Naples, and was promoted to the
                    rank of major; and in 1801 he became aid de-camp to General Murat. He was named
                    chief of a squadron in 1803, and he accompanied Murat in the Austrian, Prussian,
                    and Polish campaigns of 1805, 1806, and 1807. At the passage of the Danube, and
                    in the battle of Wertingen, he specially distinguished himself; he was made
                    colonel of the 1st regiment of chasseurs for the valour which he displayed at
                    Austerlitz; and after the battle of Eylau in 1807 he obtained the rank of
                    brigadiergeneral. In 1808 he accompanied Murat to Spain, but was there made
                    prisoner and conveyed to England. On regaining his liberty in 1811 he went to
                    Naples, where King Murat appointed him grand master of horse; but when Murat
                    became estranged from Napoleon, Exelmans left his court and joined the French
                    army. Napoleon was then entering on his Russian campaign, and gave him welcome
                    and immediate employment as a general of division. He was present at the battle
                    of Moscow, and in the famous retreat from that city his steadfast courage was
                    conspicuously manifested on several occasions. In 1813 he received, for services
                    in the campaign of Saxony, the decoration of the Legion of Honour; and in 1814
                    he reaped additional glory by his intrepidity and skill in the campaign of
                    France. When the Bourbons were restored in 1815 he retained his position in the
                    army, but this did not prevent Napoleon on his return from Elba from intrusting
                    him with the command of the 2d army corps. After the second Restoration he was
                    proscribed, and lived in Belgium, and subsequently in Nassau, till 1819, when he
                    was recalled to France. In the following year he was appointed to an
                    inspector-generalship of cavalry; and after the July revolution of 1830 he
                    received from Louie Philippe the grand cross of the Legion of Honour, and was
                    created a peer of France. In the House of Peers he denounced the execution of
                    Marshal Ney as an “abominable assassination.” At the revolution of 1848 Exelmans
                    was one of the adherents of Louis Napoleon; and in 1851 he was, in recognition
                    of his long and brilliant military career, raised to the dignity of a marshal of
                    France. His death, 10th July 1852, was the result of a fall from his horse.</p>
