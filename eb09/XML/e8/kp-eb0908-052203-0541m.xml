                <p><label type="entry">ERIGENA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Johannes Scotus</hi></label>,
                    one of the most important thinkers of the Middle Ages, flourished during the 9th
                    century. The date and place of his birth are still undetermined. He was
                    undoubtedly a native of the British isles, but of which is quite uncertain. He
                    has been claimed for England by Gale, who thinks that the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Erigena</hi> is derived from Ergene in Herefordshire; for Scotland by
                    Mackenzie, who supposes him to have been born at Aire; for Ireland by Moore and
                    the majority of writers. The name Erigena, often written <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jerugena,</hi> seems to point to Ireland, <hi rend="italic">lerne,</hi> as the
                    place of his birth or training; <hi rend="italic">Scotus</hi> may be thought to
                    indicate that he was of Scottish extraction. As to the date of his birth, the
                    best authorities fix it about 800-810, but on grounds entirely conjectural. Of
                    his early education litGe or nothing is known. He appears to have studied in the
                    best schools of Ireland, and to have been destined for the church. It is highly
                    improbable, however, that he took orders as a priest. Had he done so, some
                    reference would be made to the fact by those who attacked his writings as
                    unorthodox. From his knowledge of Greek, and from a passage in a certain MS.
                    ascribed to him, it has been supposed that he had travelled and studied in
                    Greece. But the passage is of doubtful authority, and the knowledge of Greek
                    displayed in his works is not such as to compel us to conclude that he had
                    actually visited Greece. That he had a competent acquaintance with the Greek
                    language is manifest from his translations of Dionysius the Areopagite and of
                    Maximus, from the manner in which he refers to Aristotle, and from his evident
                    familiarity with neo-Platonist writers and the fathers of the early church.
                    Roger Bacon, in his severe criticism on the ignorance of Greek displayed by the
                    most eminent scholastic writers, expressly exempts Erigena, and ascribes to him
                    a knowledge of Aristotle in the original.</p>
                <p>The only portion of Erigena’s life as to which we possess accurate information
                    was that spent at the court of Charles the Bald. Charles invited the philosopher
                    to France soon after his accession to the throne, probably in the year 843, and
                    placed him at the head of the court school— <hi rend="italic">schola</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Palatina.</hi> The reputation of this school or college seems to
                    have increased greatly under Erigena’s leadership, and the philosopher himself
                    was treated with the greatest familiarity and indulgence by the king. William of
                    Malmesbury’s amusing story illustrates both the character of Scotus and the
                    position he occupied at the French court.</p>
                <p>The first of the works known to have been written by Scotus during this period
                    was a treatise on the eucharist, which has not coιħe down to us. In it he seems
                    to have advanced the doctrine that the eucharist was merely symbolical or
                    commemorative, an opinion for which Berengarius was at a later date censured and
                    condemned. As a part of his penance Berengarius is said to have been compelled
                    to burn publicly Erigena’s treatise. So far as we can leam, however, Erigena’s
                    orthodoxy was not at the time suspected, and a few years later he was selected
                    by the famous Hincmar to defend the doctrine of liberty of will against the
                    extreme predestinarianism of the monk Gottshalk (Godeschalchus∕. The treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Divina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Predestinatione,</hi> composed on this occasion, has been preserved, and from
                    its general tenor and method one cannot be surprised that the author’s orthodoxy
                    was at once and vehemently suspected. Scotus argues the question entirely on
                    speculative grounds, and starts with the bold affirmation that philosophy and
                    religion are fundamentally one and the same·— “Conficitur inde veram esse
                    philosophiam veram religionem, conversimque veram religionem esse veram
                    philosophiam” <hi rend="italic">(De Div. Pred.,</hi> i. 1). Even more
                    significant is his handling of authority and reason, to which we shall presently
                    refer. The work was warmly assailed by Florus and Prudentius, and was
                    condemned<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n542/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0542-0523"/> by two councils—that of Valence in 855, and that
                    of Langres in 859.</p>
                <p>Erigena’s next work was a translation of Dionysius the Areopagite (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dionysius)</hi> undertaken at the request of the king. This
                    also has been preserved, and fragments of a commentary by Scotus on Dionysius
                    have been discovered in MS. A translation of the Areopagite’s pantheistical
                    writings was not likely to alter the opinion already formed as to Erigena’s
                    orthodoxy. Pope Nicholas I. was offended that the work had not been submitted
                    for approval before being given to the world, and ordered Charles to send Scotus
                    to Rome, or at least to dismiss him from his court. There is no evidence,
                    however, that this order was attended to. Erigena appears still to have remained
                    in favour.</p>
                <p>The latter part of his life is involved in total obscurity. The story that in 882
                    he was invited to Oxford by Alfred the Great, that he laboured there for many
                    years, became abbot at Malmesbury, and was murdered by his scholars, is
                    apparently without any satisfactory foundation, and doubtless refers to some
                    other Johannes. Erigena in all probability never left France, and Hauréau has
                    advanced some reasons for fixing the date of his death about 877.</p>
                <p>The works of Erigena that have come down to us are the following :—(1)
                    thetreatise on predestination, first published in 1650; (2) a commentary on
                    Marcianus Capella, published by Hauréau in 1861; (3) translation of Dionysius
                    the Areopagite, published in Floss’s edition of Erigena, vol. cxxii. of Migne’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Patrologice</hi><hi rend="italic">Cursus Completus;</hi> (4)
                    miscellaneous treatises, some still in MS., <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Visione</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dei,</hi> and the commentary on Dionysius, which has been published in <hi

                    Gregory of Nazianzen, published in Gale’s edition of (6) the great work, <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Divisione</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae,
                    πefi φvσiωv μeρiσμου.</hi> Of this last work three editions have appeared—that
                    of Gale, Oxford, 1681, that by Schlüter, 1838, and that by Floss, 1853.</p>
                <p>Erigena is without doubt the most interesting figure among the Middle Age
                    writers. The freedom of his speculation, and the boldness with which he works
                    out his logical or dialectical system of the universe, altogether prevent us
                    from classing him along with the scholastics properly so called. He marks,
                    indeed, a stage of transition from the older Platonizing philosophy to the later
                    and more rigid scholasticism. In no sense whatever can it be affirmed that with
                    Erigena philosophy is in the service of theology. The above-quoted assertion as
                    to the substantial identity between philosophy and religion is indeed repeated
                    almost <hi rend="italic">totidem</hi><hi rend="italic">verbis</hi> by many of
                    the later scholastic writers, but its significance altogether depends upon the
                    selection of one or other term of the identity as fundamental or primary. Now
                    there is no possibility of mistaking Erigena’s position: to him philosophy or
                    reason is first, is primitive; authority or religion is secondary, derived.
                    “Auctoritas siquidem ex vera ratione processit, ratio vero nequaquam ex
                    auctoritate. Omnis enim auctoritas, quae vera ratione non approbatur, infirma
                    videtur esse. Vera autem ratio, quum virtutibus suis rata atque immutabilis
                    munitur, nullius auctoritatis adstipulatione roborari indiget” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{De Div. Nat.,</hi> i. 71). F. D. Maurice, the only historian of note who
                    declines to ascribe a rationalizing tendency to Erigena, obscures the question
                    by the manner in which he states it. He asks his readers, after weighing the
                    evidence advanced, to determine “whether he (Erigena) used his philosophy to
                    explain away his theology, or to bring out what he conceived to be the fullest
                    meaning of it.” These alternatives seem to be wrongly put. “Explaining away
                    theology” is something wholly foreign to the philosophy of that age; and even if
                    we accept the alternative, that Erigena endeavours speculatively to bring out
                    the full meaning of theology, we are by no means driven to the conclusion that
                    he was primarily or principally a theologian. He does not start with the datum
                    of thβology as the completed body of truth, requiring only elucidation and
                    interpretation; his fundamental thought is that of the universe, nature, <hi
                    rend="italic">τo πo.v,</hi> or God, as the ultimate unity which works itself out
                    into the rational system of the world. Man and all that concerns maħ are but
                    parts of this system, and are to be explained by reference to it; for
                    explanation or understanding of a thing is determination of its place in the
                    universal or all. Religion or revelation is one element or factor in the divine
                    process, a stage or phase of the ultimate rational life. The highest faculty of
                    man, reason, <hi rend="italic">intellectus, intellectualis visio,</hi> is that
                    which is not content with the individual or partial, but grasps the whole and
                    thereby comprehends the parts. In this highest effort of reason, which is indeed
                    God thinking in man, thought and being are at one, the opposition of being and
                    thought is overcome. When Erigena starts with such propositions, it is clearly
                    impossible to understand his position and work if we insist on regarding him as
                    a scholastic, accepting the dogmas of the church as ultimate data, and
                    endeavouring only to present them in due order and defend them by argument.</p>
                <p>Erigena’s great work, <hi rend="italic">Be</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Divisione</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae,</hi> is arranged in five books. The
                    form of exposition is that of dialogue; the method of reasoning is the
                    syllogistic. The leading thoughts are the following. <hi rend="italic">Nαturα,
                    &lt;pυσ&gt;t,</hi> is the name for the universal, the totality of all things,
                    containing in itself being and non-being. It is the unity of which all special
                    phenomena are manifestations. But of this nature there are four distinct
                    classes;—(1) that which creates and is not created; (2) that which is created
                    and creates; (3) that which is created and does not create; (4) that which
                    neither is created nor creates. The first is God as the ground or origin of all
                    things, the last is God as the final end or goal of all things, that into which
                    the world of created things ultimately returns. The second and third together
                    compose the created universe, which is the manifestation of God, God <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">processu,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Theophania.</hi> Thus we distinguish in the divine system beginning, middle,
                    and end; but these three are in essence one—the difference is only the
                    consequence of our finite comprehension. We are compelled to envisage this
                    eternal process under the form of time, to apply temporal distinctions to that
                    which is extraor supra-temporal. The universe of created things, as we have
                    seen, is twofold <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> that which is created and
                    creates,—the primordial ideas, archetypes, immutable relations, divine acts of
                    will, according to which individual things are formed; <hi rend="italic"
                    >second,</hi> that which is created and does not create,— the world of
                    individuals, the effects of the primordial causes, without which the causes have
                    no true being. Created things have no individual or self-independent existence;
                    they are only in God; and each thing is a manifestation of the divine, <hi
                    rend="italic">theophania.</hi><hi rend="italic">divina, apparitio.</hi></p>
                <p>God alone, the uncreated creator of all, has true being. He is the true
                    universal, all-containing and incomprehensible. The lower cannot comprehend the
                    higher, and therefore we must say that the existence of God is above being,
                    above essence; Goil is above goodness, above wisdom, above truth. No finite
                    predicates can be applied to him; his mode of being cannot be determined by any
                    category. True theology is negative. Nevertheless the world, as the <hi
                    rend="italic">theophania,</hi> the revelation of God, enables us so far to
                    understand the divine essence. We recognize his being in the being of all
                    things, his wisdom in their orderly arrangement, his life in their constant
                    motion. Thus God is for us a Trinity— the Father as substance or being (oυσij),
                    the Son as wisdom (δt‰α an), the Spirit as life (6√ay*&lt;α) These three are
                    realized in the universe—the Father as the system of things, the Son as the
                    word, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the realm of ideas, the Spirit as the life or
                    moving force which introduces individuality and which ultimately draws back all
                    things into the divine unity. In man, as the noblest of created things, the
                    Trinity is seen most perfectly reflected <hi rend="italic">intellectus</hi>
                    (voûs), <hi rend="italic">ratio {λ0yοs),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sensus</hi>
                    (S.dva.a) make up the threefold thread of his being. Not in man alone, however,
                    but in all things, God is to be regarded as realizing himself, as becoming
                    incarnate.</p>
                <p>The infinite essence of God, which may indeed be described as <hi rend="italic"
                    >nihilum,</hi> nothing, is that from which all is created, fιom which all
                    proceeds or emanates. The first procession or emanation, as above indicated, is
                    the realm of ideas in the Platonic sense, the word or wisdom of God. These ideas
                    compose a whole or inseparable unity, but we are able in a dim way to think of
                    them as a system logically arranged. Thus the highest idea is that of <hi
                    rend="italic">goodness;</hi> things <hi rend="italic">are,</hi> only if they are
                    good; being without wellbeing <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n543/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0543-0524"/> is nought. <hi rend="italic">Essence</hi>
                    participates in goodness—that which is good has being, and is therefore to be
                    regarded as a species of good. <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> again, is a species
                    of essence, <hi rend="italic">wisdom</hi> a species of life, and so on, always
                    descending from genus to species in a rigorous logical fashion.</p>
                <p>The ideas are the eternal causes, which, under the moving influence of the
                    spirit, manifest themselves in their effects, the individual created things.
                    Manifestation, however, is part of the being or essence of the causes, that is
                    to say, if we interpret the expression, God of necessity manifests himself in
                    the world and is not without the world. Further, as the causes are eternal,
                    timeless, so creation is eternal, timeless. The Mosaic account, then, is to be
                    looked upon merely as a mode in which is faintly shadowed forth what is above
                    finite comprehension. It is altogether allegorical, and requires to be
                    interpreted. Paradise and the Fall have no local or.temporal being. Man was
                    originally sinless and without distinction of sex. Only after the introduction
                    of sin did man lose his spiritual body and acquire the animal nature with its
                    distinction of sex. Woman is the impersonation of man’s sensuous and fallen
                    nature; on the final return to the divine unity, distinction of sex will vanish,
                    and the spiritual body will be regained.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable, and at the same time the most obscure portion of the work is
                    that in which the final return to God is handled. Naturally sin is a necessary
                    preliminary to this redemption, and Scotus has the greatest difficulty in
                    accounting for the fact of sin. If God is true being, then sin can have no
                    substantive existence; it cannot be said that God knows of sin, for to God
                    knowing and being are one. In the universe of things, <hi rend="italic">as</hi>
                    a universe, there can be no sin; there must be perfect harmony. Sin, in fact,
                    results from the will of the individual who falsely represents something as good
                    which is not so. This misdirected will is punished by finding that the objects
                    after which it thirsts are in truth vanity and emptiness. Hull is not to be
                    regarded as having local existence; it is the inner state of the sinful will. As
                    the object of punishment is not the will or the individual himself but the
                    misdirection of the will, so the result of punishment is the final purification
                    and redemption of all, even the devils shall be saved. All, however, are not
                    saved at once; the stages of the return to the final unity, corresponding to the
                    stages in the creative process, are numerous and are passed through slowly. The
                    ultimate goal is <hi rend="italic">deificatio, thcosis,</hi> or resumption into
                    the divine being, when the individual soul is raised to a full knowledge of God,
                    and where knowing and being are one. After all Lave been restored to the divine
                    unity, there is no further creation. The ultimate unity is that which neither is
                    created nor créa les.</p>
