                    edition of the German Bible (where for the first time the apocryphal books were
                    sharply separated from the canonical) these two books of Esdras or Ezra stood
                    first in the former class (1530). Though neither of them was included by Luther
                    in his version of the Apocrypha published in 1534, they both reappeared in
                    Coverdale’s English Bible (1535) at the head of the list, and this position they
                    have maintained in all subsequent English translations. On the other hand, they
                    do not occur in the Complutensian polyglot (1514-17); they were wholly excluded
                    from the canon by the Council of Trent (1546); nor did they appear in the
                    Sixtine edition of the Vulgate (1590). They were printed, however, in the
                    Clementine edition of 1592, along with the Prayer of Manasseh, though merely as
                    an appendix, and with a preface to explain that they were permitted thus to
                    appear only because they had been occasionally referred to by the fathers, and
                    had found their way into some Latin Bibles both written and printed. Though
                    associated thus closely in the vicissitudes of their later history, they have no
                    such intimate relationship to one another as is suggested by their names. They
                    differ widely in age, origin, theological interest, literary and historical
                    importance, and must accordingly be treated as entirely separate works.</p>

                    by verse the narrative of 2 Ch. xxxv. <hi rend="smallcaps">1-xxxvl</hi> 21.
                    There are, indeed, numerous verbal discrepancies, which show that the writer had
                    before him a Hebrew text somewhat different from that which we now possess, or
                    else that he made use of a Greek version other than the Alexandrian. Sometimes,
                    too, he may seem to have deliberately abridged or expanded the text that lay
                    before him; but the fact that on the whole he depended on the Chronicler must be
                    abundantly manifest to any reader, and needβ not be demonstrated here. The whole
                    of the canonical book of Ezra is next incorporated, but with an interpolation
                    and a dislocation. Chap. ii. 1-14, telling of the edict of Cyrus and the return
                    of the Jews under “Samanassar” or “Sanabassar,” closely follows Ezra i. In like
                    manner, chap. ii. 15-25, telling how the works at Jerusalem were interrupted by
                    the interdict of Artaxerxes, though introduced at an earlier stage in the
                    narrative, is entirely derived from Ezra iv. 7-24. Chap. iii. 1-v. 6, <pb

                    of Darius, and successfully reminded him of a forgotten vow to rebuild Jerusalem
                    and the temple, and to restore the holy vessels and permit the return of the
                    citizens to their places, is, as has already been indicated, either an original
                    contribution or one derived from some source which is no longer accessible to
                    us. Chap. v. 7-70, containing the list of those who returned with Zerubbabel
                    under “Darius,’’with an account of the progress of the temple under “Cyrus,” and
                    of the subsequent interruption “for the space of two years,” until the reign of
                    “Darius,” is derived from Ezra ii. 1-iv. 5. Chaps, vi. and vii., corresponding
                    to Ezra v. and vi., relate how the work was resumed under Darius, and completed
                    in the sixth year of his reign. Chap, viii. 1-ix. 36 repeats the narrative of
                    Ezra vii,-x., and chap. ix. 37-55 that of Neh. vii. 73-viii. 13.</p>
                <p>The abruptness which characterizes the book as we now have it, both in its
                    beginning and at its close, suggests the idea that possibly it may be merely a
                    fragment of some larger compilation to which reference is perhaps made in 2
                    Macc. ii. 13. In its present form it has little to distinguish it as a
                    composition from the work of the Chronicler, of which it is virtually an
                    incomplete abridgment The special object which the compiler may have had in view
                    is indeed not easily conjectured. Some writers think they can discover a twofold
                    purpose,—to give prominence to the new story about Zerubbabel, and to
                    remove-chronological difficulties which are raised by the canonical book of
                    Ezra. If the latter was indeed part of his aim, he has been singularly
                    unsuccessful. Far from obviating any of the difficulty caused by the
                    Chronicler’s having apparently introduced Artaxerxes Longimanus and Xerxes
                    between Cyrus and Darius Hystaspis, he has landed himself in new and glaring
                    inconsistencies (comp., <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> ii. 10, 14, with iv. 44). A
                    more likely hypothesis is that his design was to give to the public something
                    more readable than the bald and literal Alexandrian translation. Critics are not
                    unanimous upon the question whether he took his work directly from the Hebrew or
                    from the present LXX. version. The majority are in favour of the former view;
                    but Keil has the influential support of Schürer (in Herzog’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopädie,</hi> i. 497, 1877) in the latter opinion. It is uncertain where
                    he wrote. Egypt and Palestine have both been suggested, but without adequate
                    data for a definite conclusion. Whoever he was he had a good command of Greek,
                    nor was he ignorant of Hebrew. As for the date of the work, all we know is that
                    it was already in existence and in repute in the time of Josephus That historian
                    has unfortunately followed its order of events in preference to that of the
                    canonical Chronicler, andso has brought his narrative into inextricable
                    confusion in all that relates to the Persian period.</p>
                <p>Unmistakable references to the work as authoritative are to be met with in

                    preface to Ezra and Nehemiah (λvhich is to be found in all modern editions of
                    the Vulgate), has condemned both books of Esdras as “somnia” and “procul
                    abjicienda.” It does not occur in any list either of canonical or of

                    (Greek) text has been lost; but numerous ancient translations still testify to
                    the wide-spread popularity which the work enjoyed during the earlier centuries
                    of the Christian era. Five distinct versions are now known to scholars,—the
                    Latin, Syriac, Ethiopie, Arabic, and Armenian. Of these the Latin is the oldest
                    and the best. In most of its MSS., and in all the eastern versions, the first
                    two and the last two chapters of the received Vulgate text are omitted; and
                    eighty-three verses are inserted between vii. 35 and vii. 36. The genuineness of
                    these verses cannot be doubted: they were known to Ambrose, Vigilantius, and
                    Jerome, and in 1875 were rediscovered by Bensly in a MS. of the 9th century. The
                    four chapters just mentioned Fritzsche proposes to call the fifth book of Ezra.
                    They are certainly distinct from the original 2 Esdras, and are by general
                    consent assigned to a Christian authorship of or near the 3d century.</p>
                <p>The apocalyptic character of 2 Esdras has already been indicated (vol. ii. p.
                    175-6). Its seven visions all have reference to the future of Jerusalem, the
                    central question being whether and when the city is to be restored and its
                    enemies punished. The fifth vision (xi. 1-xii. 51) is of chief importance to the
                    critic; his conclusions upon the date and origin of the book must depend almost
                    entirely upon his interpretation of the symbolical eagle, the wings, the
                    feathers, and the heads there described. According to Laurence, C. J. van der
                    Vlis, and Lücke (2d edition), the vision is to be explained as having reference
                    to the whole course of Roman history from Romulus to Julius Caesar. The three
                    heads are Sulla, Pompey, and Caesar; and the work was composed about the time of
                    the assassination of the last-named. Hilgenfeld, in his earlier interpretation
                    of the vision (1857), referred it to the Ptolemies; but in.1867 ho substituted
                    the Seleucidae, while adhering to his original opinion that the three beads are
                    Caesar, Antony, and Octavian, and that the work was written immediately after
                    the death of Antony. The majority of modern critics believe that Rome under the
                    empire is intended; but there are numerous differences as to the details of this
                    interpretation. Gutschmid and some others identify the three heads with
                    Septimius Severus, Caracalla, and Geta, thus placing the date of the composition
                    of this part of the work as late as the year 218 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gutschmid
                    agrees with Hilgenfeld as to the date of the rest of the work.</p></note> But
                    the more general opinion since Corrodi (1781) has been that the three Flavian
                    emperors, Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, are intended by that symbol. Corrodi
                    himself and Ewald assign the book to the reign of Titus; Volkmar, Langen, and
                    Renan to that of Nerva; and Gfrörer, Dillmann, Wieseler, and Schürer to that of
                    Domitian. On the whole, it may be said that there is a growing consensus of
                    opinion in favour of a date somewhere between 81 and 97 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>As upon the question of date, so upon the question of authorship, critics are now
                    more nearly agreed than formerly in the belief that the book belongs to the
                    Jewish cycle of apocalyptic literature, and that its author was probably a
                    Pharisee, and possibly one who may have fought on the walls of Jerusalem in the
                    final struggle. It is, indeed, <pb break="no"

                    sympathies; and it is not a little remarkable that it should have made so little
                    impression upon the Jewish mind, while by the Christians, on the other hand, it
                    was received with great respect, and was indebted to them for its preservation.
                    It has not passed through their hands without alteration. The insertion of the
                    word “Jesus” in chap. vii. 28 may he mentioned as an instance of the changes it
                    has undergone.</p>
                <p>By the author of the epistle of Barnabas (chap, xii.), by Clement of Alexandria

                    scripture. The unfavourable judgment of Jerome upon both books of Esdras is on
                    the other hand repeated with special emphasis with regard to this in his
                    treatise against Vigilantius. The work was never included in any list of
                    canonical or “ecclesiastical” writings, nor did it generally appear in MS. Latin
                    bibles. It was printed, however, in Pfister’s Bamberg Latin Bible (1460), and
                    frequently thereafter. To this circumstance, doubtless, it owes its somewhat too
                    high position, both in the Protestant and in the Romish Apocrypha. It may be
                    interesting to notice that Columbus drew from chap. vi. 42 one of the arguments
                    by which he supported his cause in the conference of Salamanca in 1487
                    (Navarrete, <hi rend="italic">Coleccioη,</hi> ii. 261).</p>
                <p>It cannot be doubted that 2 Esdras has exercised considerable influence on the
                    course of Christian thought, especially on eschatological subjects; but in cases
                    of real coincidence between its teaching and that of Paul, the honour of
                    priority is now very generally conceded to the canonical writer. The work is of
                    great authority in some Oriental churches; and it has been a special favourite
                    with many Western mystics, such as Schwenkfeld and the once famous Antoinette
                    Bourignon.</p>

                    distinguished from 2 Esdras. It seems to date from the 3d century of the
                    Christian era, and to belong originally to the Christian cycle (see vol. ii. p.

                    (1869) and of O. F. Fritzsche <hi rend="italic">(Libri Apocryphi,</hi> as
                    above). A good account of the work, with an almost exhaustive catalogue of the
                    modern literature of the subject, is given by Schürer in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Neutestamentliche</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeitgeschichte</hi> (Leipsic, 1874). In
                    1875 Bensly published the results of an examination of the Amiens MS., which
                    dates from the 9th century. The missing fragment has also been found in a
                    Spanish MS. (see <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Journal of Philology,</hi> 1877).
