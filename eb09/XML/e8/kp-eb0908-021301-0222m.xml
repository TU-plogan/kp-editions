                    rend="italic">Eηgadina),</hi> the valley of the Inn from its source to the
                    Austrian frontier at Martinsbruck, a distance (by road) of about 65 miles. It is
                    divided politically into two districts, the Upper and Lower</p>
                <p>Engadine, and four circles, which form part of the</p>
                <p>Gotteshausbund, one of the three leagues comprised in canton of Grisons,
                    Switzerland,</p>
                <p>The Upper Engadine has only one circle, whose chief village is Samaden. It
                    consists of the valley of the Inn with its tributaries. The river flows through
                    a long and straight trough, about 30 miles in length, and varying from a mile to
                    half a mile in breadth, lying between lofty mountains, at a mean height of 5500
                    feet above the sea, being, after the Avers and Spöl valleys, the highest
                    inhabited region of central Europe. Unlike most Alpine valleys the Engadine is
                    closed at its head only by a low bank. The Maloya Pass (5942 feet) is hardly 100
                    feet above the lake of Sils. The lakes of Silvaplana and St Moritz lie at nearly
                    the same level. Samaden (ad summum Oeni) stands at the junction of the Inn and
                    its first considerable tributary the Flatzbach. This stream drains the principal
                    glaciers of the Bernina chain, the largest glacier group in eastern Switzerland,
                    remarkable for its closely-clustered summits, the highest of which, Piz Bernina,
                    attains a height of 13,294 feet. Beside the Flatzbach runs the road to the
                    Bernina Pass (7658 feet), leading into the Vai Tellina. It passes Pontresiua, a
                    village of late years much frequented in summer by travellers of all nations.
                    Its name has been assumed to be a trace of the presence of Saracens in this part
                    of the Alps (Pons Saracenorum). Another and more plausible derivation (Pons
                    Rhaetiae) has been suggested.</p>
                <p>The valley below Samaden is for some distance level and uniform, and studded with
                    flourishing hamlets. The boundary between the two Engadines lies between Scanfs
                    and Zernetz, in an uuinhabited part of the valley.</p>
                <p>Owing to its great elevation, the scenery of the Upper Engadine has a bleak
                    northern aspect. Pines and larches aloue flourish, garden vegetables are grown
                    only in sunny spots, and there is no tillage. The Alpine flora, however, is very
                    rich and varied, and the Upper Engadine has been called “a paradise for the
                    botanist.” Snow always lies low on the mountain sides, aud often falls even in
                    the valley in the month of August. Hence the climate is described in the
                    proverb—“Nine months winter and three months cold weather.” The mean annual
                    temperature is 36 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5° Fahr., that of the summer
                    months 50 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8° Fahr., of the winter 17 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5° Fahr. The villages are built entirely of stone.
                    The houses are large and roomy, a cattle stable being often included under the
                    same roof. The small deeply-set windows bear witness to the severity of the
                    climate. Those of the lower story are protected with iron gratings, a precaution
                    the character of the people does not justify. An abundant use of paint and
                    whitewash gives many of the dwellings an almost Dutch air of cleanliness, and
                    the window-sills are usually decorated with carnations aud other bright
                    flowers.</p>
                <p>The Lower Engadine is divided into three circles. Schuls is the chief village;
                    next in importance is Zernetz, which stands at the junction of the Inn and Spöl.
                    The latter stream issues from Vai di Livigno, the only inhabited valley north of
                    the Alps belonging to Italy. At this point the Inn flows for a few miles due N.
                    through a wooded defile before resuming its N.E. course. From Suss to
                    Finstermunz it runs in a deep channel, while the villages lie high on terraces
                    on the mountain sides, cut off from one another by deep ravines, through which
                    descend streams from the glaciers of the Silvretta (Silva Rhaetiae) range on the
                    N. and from the wild dolomite ridges of the Scarlthal on the S. In the recesses
                    of the latter bears are still found. The villages of the Lower Engadine are not
                    so well built as those of the upper valley, and the inhabitants are said to be
                    less energetic and more ignorant than their neighbours.</p>
                <p>Below the village of Schuls, on the left bank of the Inn, lie the baths of
                    Tarasp, much resorted to by North Germans. The springs to which they chiefly owe
                    their repute are saline-alkaline in character.</p>
                <p>One of the highroads into Italy has since early times passed through the Upper
                    Engadine. The Romans used the Bernina Pass in conjunction with the Julier. In
                    the Middle Ages this route was the most frequented between the Mont Cenis and
                    the Brenner, and was chosen by travellers who wished to avoid the Milanese
                    territory and the Spanish troops. In recent years the old mule-track over the
                    Bernina Pass has been converted into a military road, and the internal
                    communications of the country have been opened up on all sides. Roads have been
                    made over the Albula, Fluela, and Ofen Passes, and the villages of the Lower
                    Engadine, previously almost inaccessible on wheels, have been united by a good
                    road both to the upper valley and to Tyrol.</p>
                <p>The population of the valley at the last census (1870) was 9756, of which 8402
                    are Protestants and 1335 Catholics. The Catholics are found chiefly at Tarasp
                    and in the secluded glens of Samnauu and Sampnoir on the Tyrolese frontier. The
                    people are industrious, frugal, and alive to their own interests, and at the
                    same time more independent in manner, and less courteous to strangers than those
                    of central Switzerland. With the exception of Tarasp, which is mostly German,
                    the whole district is “Romantsch.” The language is a dialect known as “Ladin,”
                    nearly allied to <pb break="no"

                    Abtei, and Enneberg. It has a scanty literature, consisting of a translation of
                    the Bible, some prayer and hymn books, and one newspaper, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >F'ogl d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Engiadina,</hi> printed once a week at
                    Samaden. German is now taught in all the schools of the valley. The wealth of
                    the inhabitants consists in their hay meadows and pastures. The lower Alps feed
                    large herds of cows, the upper are let to Bergamasque shepherds, who travel
                    thither every summer with their flocks. A considerable trade is also carried on
                    in Italian products and Val Tellina wines, in which the Engadiners serve as
                    carriers. Formerly many of them used to emigrate to different parts of the
                    world, where they found employment, especially as pastry-cooks. Of late years
                    the sudden influx of strangers lias changed the picturesque villages into groups
                    of hotels, and diverted the inhabitants from their former pursuits. The iron
                    springs of St Moritz, the cause and centre of the immigration of summer visitors
                    from all parts of Europe, have been known since the 16th century. They had been
                    steadily resorted to by Germans and Italians since the days of Paracelsus,
                    though it was not till the present century that any bath-house was erected for
                    the convenience of the guests, who found sufficient accommodation in the
                    village. The waters are highly charged with alkaline salts and carbonate of
                    iron, with a small proportion of phosphoric acid, and traces of iodine, bromine,
                    &amp;c. Their influence, in combination with mountain air, is extremely
                    beneficial in cases requiring strong tonic treatment.</p>
