                    of the first order struggling through high hills or rather low mountains,
                    prolongations of the chain of Anti-Taurus, and making an exceedingly tortuous
                    course as it forces its way over a rocky or a pebbly bed from one natural
                    barrier to another. As it winds round its numerous barriers it carries
                    occasionally towards each of the cardinal points a considerable body of water
                    and is shallow enough in some places for loaded camels to pass in autumn, the
                    water rising to about 4∣ feet. The general direction of the left arm of the
                    Euphrates, which is termed the MurAd-chai, and which, rising near Diyadin,
                    skirts the plains both of Mιish and Kharpiit, is westerly as far as its junction
                    with the right arm near Keban Maaden. This right arm again, which rises near
                    Erzeroum, and which, though of inferior length and size, is generally regarded
                    as the true Euphrates, runs southwesterly by ErzingAn Kamakh <hi rend="italic"

                    point of junction. There, however, the direction of the river changes. Meeting
                    obliquely the Anti-Taurus, which afterwards rises into the Jûjik-dagh (the Mount
                    Abus of antiquity), it is forced to the south through some very precipitous
                    gorges to the vicinity of Malatieh. It then crosses the broken country between
                    the Anti-Taurus and Taurus, and finally forces its way through the latter range
                    in a succession of rapids and cataracts for a space of about 40 miles, till it
                    emerges upon the great Syrian plain, a short distance above SamsAt, the ancient
                    Samosata, where Lucian dwelt and wrote. The Euphrates now enters on its middle
                    division, which may be considered to extend from SamsAt to Hit. The direction
                    here is at first S.W., then S., and afterwards S.E. from about the 36th parallel
                    of latitude to its embouchure in the Persian Gulf. The river in this part of its
                    course runs through a valley of a few miles in width, which it has eroded in the
                    rocky surface, and which, being more or less covered with alluvial soil, is
                    pretty generally cultivated by artificial irrigation. The method of irrigation
                    is peculiar, dams of solid masonry being run into the bed of the river,
                    frequently from both sides at once, so as to raise the level of the stream and
                    thus to give a water power of several feet in height which is used to turn a
                    gigantic wheel sometimes 40 feet in diameter. The water is thus raised to a
                    trough at the top of the dam, and from thence is distributed among the gardens,
                    and melon beds, and rice fields, occupying the valley between the immediate bed
                    of the river and the rocky banks which shut it out from the desert. The wheels,
                    which are of the most primitive construction, being made of rough branches of
                    trees, with 100 or 150 rude clay vessels slung on the outer edge, raise a
                    prodigious amount of water, and are moreover exceedingly picturesque, the dams
                    or aqueducts to which they are attached being often formed of a series of
                    well-built Gothic arches; but they are great impediments to navigation, as they
                    cause a current of six or seven knots an hour, which cannot be surmounted by any
                    ordinary steam power. In some parts of the river 300 of these wheels have been
                    counted within a space of 130 miles, and when our steamers first appeared upon
                    the river, not forty years ago, at least one-third of the wheeb were in working
                    order; but they have since fallen very generally into ruin, the Arab population,
                    which used to cultivate the immediate banks of the river, having for the most
                    part moved further off into the desert. The rocks which form the river banks
                    during this part of its course are composed of gypsum, sandstone, and conglomer
                    ate with mica and felspar, and at some points, as at Helebi-Jelebi (the ZabA
                    andZalA of the Arabs) approach close to the water’s edge. Beyond the rocky banks
                    on both sides is the open desert, covered in spring with a luxuriant verdure,
                    and dotted here and there with the black tent of the Bedouin, the great tribe of
                    Shamar holding the left bank or Joziréh, as the ’ Λnezeh possess the right bank
                    or ShAmiyeh. The middle course of the Euphrates has also played a great part in
                    history. In very early times it formed a boundary between the empire of Assyria
                    to the east and the great nation of the Khetta, or Hittites, to the west; and
                    the capital of the latter people, known in Scripture as Carchemish (2 Chron
                    xxxv. 20), was built upon its banks. The ruins of this city, now known as
                    YerAbolus, a corruption of the Greek Hierapolis, have been recently examined by
                    Mr George Smith, and are found to contain numerous well-preserved bas-reliefs
                    (with inscriptions in the Hamathite character), which promise to be of the
                    utmost importance as forming the connecting link that has been long sought
                    between Egyptian and Assyrian art. In the vicinity of Hierapolis, or Carchemish,
                    was the upper passage of the Euphrates on the road conducting from Syria to
                    Nineveh. The site is now known as Bir or Birejek, but it retained the title of
                    Zugma (Greek, <hi rend="italic">ζeυypa),</hi> according to the Arab geographers,
                    to comparatively modern times (see Yacht in voce), and the remains of the old
                    bridge were still to be seen there in the 7th century of the Hegira, popularly
                    known as the &lt;7⅛r <hi rend="italic">Me mb if</hi> or bridge of Membij, the
                    Arabic form of the Syriac Mabog or Hieropolis. The lower passage of the
                    Euphrates conducting from Syria to Babylonia, which retained, among the Greeks,
                    the old Semitic title of Thapsacus (or ∏DSΓ&gt; 1 Kings V. 4, &amp;c.), is
                    usually placed at Der, 200 miles lower down the river; but Captain Lynch, who
                    carefully examined the country, would prefer the position of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Phunsak</hi> above Racca, where he found the remains of an ancient bridge.
                    The Euphrates is singularly deficient in tributaries after it leaves the
                    mountains; with the exception, indeed, of the <hi rend="italic">Sanjeh</hi>
                    (2ιγγας of the Greeks) and the <hi rend="italic">Sajur</hi> (Sangar of the
                    Assyrian inscriptions) on the right bank, and the <hi rend="italic">Bilikh</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Khdbur</hi> on the left, which have retained their present
                    names unchanged for thirty centuries, there is no affluent to the Euphrates of
                    any consequence after it has once broken through the Taurus range. In antiquity,
                    indeed, there would seem to have been a river named Araxes by Xenophon, and
                    Saocoras by Ptolemy, which descended from the Sinjar hills, and, running due
                    south, joined the Euphrates between Der and Annah; but no traces of such a
                    stream are now to be found, and it has been suggested therefore that its
                    disappearance may be due to the same upheaval of the land at the south-eastern
                    foot of the Sinjar hills, which diverted the Nisibin river (Gozan of scripture,
                    Mygdonius of the Greeks, and Hermas of the Arabs) from its ancient course by
                    Hatra to Tekrit on the Tigris, and forced it to join the Khabιir and ultimately
                    the Euphrates.</p>
                <p>During the Mahometan period there were many flourishing towns on the banks of the
                    river in the middle part of its course. The geographers mention in succesion
                    Somei-sAt, Rüm-Kaleh, Jisr-Mambej or Bir, Beles, El Ja’aber (or Dusar), Racca
                    (Nicephorium at the mouth of the Bilikh), Kerkessieh (Circesβium at the mouth of
                    the Khabdr). Rahbeh, Dér-el-KAim (Gordian’s tomb? and the boundary between the
                    Roman and Persian empires), Annah (or Anatho), Haditheh, Alιis, NAιiseh, and
                    Hit. Many of these cities are now in ruins, but the sites can for the most part
                    be identified, and they would all well repay a careful examination; at present
                    the most consider able towns are SamsAt, Bir, Annah, and Hit. From Bir to
                    Ja’aber the river is rather sluggish, running over a sandy or pebbly bed;
                    further down, and as far as Hit, the general character of the bed is rocky, and
                    between Annah and Hit, it is thickly studded with islands, on which were built
                    in former times the castles and treasuries of the rulers of the land, many of
                    these inlands being still inhabited.</p>

                    the middle and lower divisions of the river, stands at the head of the alluvial
                    deposit. It is distant about 750 miles by the windings of the river from the
                    point where the Euphrates breaks through the Taurus range, and the further
                    course of the stream measures about 550 miles to the sea. The hills and cliffs
                    and rocky banks which have hitherto lined the river disappear, and, with the
                    exception of one limited tract a short distance above Babylon, named El Haswa,
                    there is not a stone or a pebble to be seen on the surface of the desert all the
                    way to the sea. In the immediate vicinity of Hit a large canal was taken off on
                    the right bank of the river, which followed the extreme skirt of the alluvium
                    the whole way to the Persian Gulf, and thus formed an outer barrier,
                    strengthened at intervals with watchtowers and fortified posts, to protect the
                    cultivated land of the Sowâd against the incursions of the desert Arabs. This
                    gigantic work, the line of which is still to be traced throughout its course,
                    was formerly called the <hi rend="italic">Khandak-Sabdr,</hi> or “Sapor’s
                    trench,” being historically ascribed to the Sassanian king, Shapιir Dhulaktaf,
                    but it is known in the country as the Cherra·Saideh, and is in popular tradition
                    believed to have been excavated by Bokhtunasr (Nebuchadnezzar) for his favourite
                    “sultâneh,” Saideh, “the fortunate.” The great irrigating canals, however, which
                    especially distinguished Babylonia, were derived from the left bank of the
                    river, and watered the country between the Euphrates and the Tigris. Many of
                    them must have been of the most remote antiquity, as the majority of the
                    primitive capitals—such as Kuthâ, and Niffer, and Larsa, &amp;c., sister cities
                    of.Babylon—were built upon their banks, and are thus proved to be of a later
                    date than the canals. In the time of the Arabs the chief canals were the Nahr
                    Isâ, the Nahr Sarsar, the Nahr Malcâ (the royal river of the Greeks), and the
                    Nahr Kuthâ, and the cuts from these main channels, reticulating the entire
                    country between the rivers, converted it into a continuous and luxuriant garden.
                    The most important canal, however, was the large stream which left the
                    Babylonian branch of the Euphrates just above the city, and under the name of

                    canals are kept open so as to receive a limited supply of water at the rise of
                    the river in May, which then distributes itself over the lower lying lands in
                    the interior, almost without labour on the part of the cultivators, giving birth
                    in such localities to the most abundant crops; but by tar the larger portion of
                    the region between the rivers is at present an arid, howling wilderness, strewed
                    in the most part with broken pottery, the evidence of former habitation, and
                    bearing nothing but the camel thorn, the wild caper, the colocynth-apple,
                    wormwood, and the other weeds of the desert. It must further be borne in mind
                    that the course of the river and the features of the country on both banks are
                    subject to constant fluctuation. Between Hit, it is true, and Felugia (near the
                    ancient Perisabor, <hi rend="italic">Anbar</hi> of the Arabs) which is at the
                    head of the canal system, no great change is possible owing to the height of the
                    river banks, but lower down everything depends on the care bestowed on the
                    artificial embankments of the stream. When the Euphrates, for instance, breaks
                    through at Felugia, and fills the Saklawieh canal (in the line of the old <hi
                        rend="italic">Nahr</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">lsa)</hi> the whole country west
                    of Baghdad is submerged, and a still more important flooding occurs lower down
                    near Mussäib, at the head of the modern Hindιeh canal. Here in all ages there
                    has been a great bifurcation of the river. We may infer that the right arm was
                    the original bed, and the left arm, on which Babylon was built, the artificial
                    derivation, because from the earliest times, as we learn from the cuneiform
                    inscriptions, the Babylon stream has always been called the river of Sippara and
                    not the Euphrates. In the time of Alexander, it is true, the nomenclature had
                    been reversed, the right arm being then known as the Pallacopas, which means an
                    artificial canal;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    times, the old distribution has again prevailed, the Euphrates being always

                    Nejef, the tomb of Ali), while the present stream, passing along the ruins of
                    Babylon to Hιllah and Diwanteh, has been universally known as the Nahr <hi

                            spot cannot now be recognized, owing to the frequent destruction and
                            reformation of the banks of the river in this part of its course. Under

                            modern town of <hi rend="italic">Mufsdib.</hi></p></note> At the present
                    day the preservation of the embankments at the point of bifurcation demands the
                    constant care of the Baghdad Government. The object is to allow sufficient water
                    to drain off to the westward for the due irrigation of the lands cultivated by
                    the Khezzâil Arabs below Nejef, whilethe Hιllah bed still retains the main
                    volume of the stream, and is navigable to the sea: but it frequently happens
                    that the dams at the head of the Hindieh are carried away, and that a free
                    channel being thus opened for the waters of the river to the westward, the
                    Hillah bed shoals to 2 or 3 feet, and is everywhere fordable. But whether the
                    main body of the stream may flow in therightarm or in the left, the lower
                    portion of the Euphrates —that is, a tract of 200 miles in length intervening
                    between Diwànieh and the junction of the two great rivers at Korna,—forms and
                    has always formed a succession of reedy lagoons of the most hopeless character.

                        Batihdt</hi> of the Arabs, and they are best known to us at present as the
                    Lemhin marshes, though that name is by no means of general application. It may
                    be doubted if the fall of the <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0908-0696-0671"/> land will ever admit of theso marshes being
                    drained, and certainly in its present condition a more unproductive and
                    unpromising tract of country than the lake region can hardly be conceived. The
                    navigation through the long lines of reeds is subject to constant interruption,
                    the climate is pestilential, the inhabitants wild and inhospitable, and yet
                    there are many mounds and ancient sites among the marshes that would well repay
                    excavation, dating as they do from the earliest Chaldean times. The antiquities,
                    indeed, of the lower Euphrates are all of the highest interest, for here were
                    established the earliest seats of civilization, and here accordingly were
                    localized the traditions of a terrestial paradise. Erech (modern Warka) and “Ur
                    of the Chaldees” (now Mugheir) were both in the immediate vicinity of the river,
                    the banks of which, below the junction of the Samâwâ branch, the outpour of the
                    Hindieh waters, everywhere bear evidence of a teeming population in ancient
                    times. From Korna, where the Tigris and Euphrates at present unite, the river
                    sweeps on in its majestic course to Bussorah; it is here 1000 yards in width,
                    and from 3 to 5 fathoms deep, so as to be navigable by vessels of war, which not
                    unfrequently ascend as far as the junction. Bussorah, which was formerly a very
                    considerable city, but has now dwindled to a small town of 10,000 inhabitants,
                    lies in a creek at a distance of a couple of miles from the river. Off the mouth
                    of the creek, however, the Euphrates usually presents a somewhat animated
                    appearance, the head-quarters of the Turkish naval force in the Persian Gulf
                    being here established, and several mercantile steamers from Bombay and Baghdad
                    being also not unfrequently anchored in the roads. The native craft is likewise
                    numerous, and occasionally the port is visited by a vessel of war from the
                    British squadron in the gulf. From Korna to Bussorah the banks of the river are
                    well cultivated, and the date groves are almost continuous. Twenty-five miles
                    further down the river Karιin from Shuster and Dizful throws off an arm, which
                    seems to be artificial, into the Euphrates. This arm is named the Haffar, and at
                    the confluence is situated the Persian town of Mohamrah, a place which is most
                    conveniently placed for trade, and which in the future is likely to become a
                    place of much consequence. In the vicinity of Mohamrah was situated, at the time
                    of the Christian era, the Parthian city of Spasini-Charax, which was succeeded
                    by <hi rend="italic">Pahrnan Λrdeshir</hi> (now Bamishir) under the Sassanians,
                    and by <hi rend="italic">Moharzi</hi> under the Arabs. The left bank of the
                    river from this point belongs to Persia. It consists of an island named Abadân,
                    about 45 miles in length, which has been formed by the alluvial deposits brought
                    down by the river during the last fifteen centuries. New laud, indeed, is yearly
                    rising at the mouth of the river; and Fao, where we have established our
                    telegraphic terminus connecting the Bombay and Constantinople wires, although at
                    present on tho sea-shore, is not likely long to remain so. The entire length of
                    the Euphrates from its source near Diadin to Fao cannot be less than 1600 miles,
                    and for three-quarters of that distance, or as far as Bir, it is more or less
                    navigable by light boats and rafts.</p>
                <p>The Euphrates valley, independently of its great natural advantages, has
                    attracted some attention in recent times from its geographical position, forming
                    as it does the most direct line of transit between the Mediterranean and the
                    Persian Gulf, and thus offering an alternative means of communication with
                    India, not greatly inferior to the route through Egypt. During our wars with
                    Napoleon, early in the present century, and indeed up to the time when the
                    introduction of steam navigation rendered the Red Sea accessible at all seasons
                    of the year, the political correspondence of the home and Indian Governments
                    usually passed by what is called “the Euphrates route,” swift dromedaries
                    conveying the mails across the desert from Bussorah to Aleppo on one line, while
                    Tartars on post horses on the other rode from Baghdad direct to Constantinople;
                    and even to the present day these postal lines are kept up with some
                    modifications for the conveyance of correspondence between Baghdad and Europe.
                    The greater facilities and the greater expedition of the Egyptian
                    route,—especially since the construction of railways from Alexandria to Suez,
                    and yet more recently the opening of the Suez Canal,—have, it must be allowed,
                    established that line in.popular estimation as the high road to India, but still
                    not entirely to the exclusion of the Euphrates valley route. Various plans,
                    indeed, have been suggested and partly executed at different times, with a view
                    to opening up communication between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. The
                    British Government commenced in 1835 by sending out Colonel Chesney at the head
                    of an expedition to Syria, with instructions to transport two steamers from the
                    Mediterranean to the Euphrates, and after putting them together at Bir, N.E. of
                    Aleppo, to attempt the descent of the river to the sea. One of these steamers
                    was lost in a squall during the passage down the river, but the other performed
                    the voyage in safety, and thus demonstrated the practicability of the downward
                    navigation. Following on this first experiment, the East India Company, in 1841,
                    proposed to maintain a permanent flotilla on the Tigris and Euphrates, and sent
                    two vessels accordingly, the “Nitocris” and the “Nimrod,” under the command of
                    Captain Campbell of the Indian Navy, to attempt the ascent of the latter river.
                    The experiment was so far successful that, with incrediblo difficulty, the two
                    vessels did actually reach Beles, about the same parallel as Aleppo, but the
                    result of the expedition was to show that practically the river could not be
                    used as a high road of commerce, the continuous rapids and falls during the low
                    season, caused mainly by the artificial obstructions of the irrigating dams,
                    being insurmountable by ordinary steam power, and the aid of hundreds of hands
                    being thus required to drag the vessels upthe stream at those points by main
                    force; and all subsequent experience has confirmed this view, so that at the
                    present day, although many of the dams have been cleared away, and the
                    navigation of the river has been generally much improved, the Turkish
                    authorities do not attempt to run their steamers up and down throughout the
                    year, but content themselves with a few trips between Beles and Hillah, while
                    the river remains in flood from April to August, with the political object of
                    controlling the riverain tribes rather than for purposes of commerce. The
                    unsuitability of the Euphrates for continuous steam navigation was no sooner
                    clearly ascertained than public attention began to be directed to a
                    communication between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf by rail, and from
                    that time to the present, under a hundred different forms, the Euphrates valley
                    railway has been under the consideration both of the political and the
                    commercial world. In the year 1872 a select committee of the House of Commons
                    reported generally in favour of the line, remarking that about £10,000,000
                    sterling would probably be sufficient to cover the expense of a railway along
                    the shortest route between the seas; and adding that the principal advantages to
                    be derived from such an expenditure would be:—1st, the more rapid transmission
                    of the mails between England and India; 2d, the possession of an alternative and
                    more rapid route for the conveyance of troops; and 3d, tho great extension of
                    commerce which would follow from the opening up of such a line of communication
                    between India and England. How tho money was to be obtained, however, the
                    committee did not venture to recommend. They merely suggested that the English
                    Government should enter into communication with the Turkish Government, with a
                    view to some <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n697/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0908-0697-0672"/> arrangement for il joint responsibility in
                    raising the necessary funds, and it was on this money question that the whole
                    scheme, and a great number of similar private schemes, fell through. It is
                    pretty certain, indeed, that a railway of 1000 or 1200 miles through the Syrian
                    and Mesopotamian deserts, dependent for its support entirely on the termini upon
                    the two seas, can never be pecuniarily remunerative; . and so long, therefore,
                    as the British Government retains its hold on the Egyptian line it can hardly be
                    worth its while to embark on so costly an undertaking merely for its possible
                    political advantages. If the Sublime Porte had retained its position in the
                    political world, it might have been a sound and proper measure of domestic
                    economy to have laid down a railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf,
                    with a view to developing the resources of the intermediate countries, and
                    consolidating the power of the central government. Midhat Pasha, indeed, the
                    author of the Turkish constitution, had thus some years ago, when he was
                    governor of Baghdad, actually completed the preliminary surveys for a line from
                    Tripoli on the Mediterranean, across the desert to Tekrit on the Tigris, and
                    thence by Baghdad to Bussorah; and if he had remained in office the project
                    would have been probably executed; but under present circumstances, when Asiatic
                    Turkey threatens to become yearly more hopelessly disorganized, there is no
                    reasonable prospect of such a scheme being resumed under native auspices. It is
                    only, indeed, in the possible event of the Tigris and Euphrates valleys falling
                    into the hands of a European power that we can look with any hope to the
                    construction of railways, or the scientific embankment of the rivers, or the
                    excavation of canals, or any of those measures of internal improvement which,
                    however, if executed with care and skill, would soon restore these now desolate
                    regions to their former exceptional condition of populousness, wealth, and
                    general prosperity.</p>
                <p>It may be of interest to add that the India Office has recently employed Captain
                    Felix Jones, an accomplished officer of the late Indian navy, and one of the
                    most experienced surveyors of that noble service, in constructing a map of the
                    Euphrates and Tigris upon a large scale. All the charts and plans executed by
                    Col. Chesney, Capt II. B. Lynch, and the various officers of the Indian navy who
                    have been employed during the last 40 years on the survey of Mesopotamia, and
                    most of whose memoirs have been published in the current volumes of the Royal
                    Geographical Society’s Journal, have been utilized for the purpose, and the
                    result has been the production of a map not less remarkable as a specimen of the
                    highest cartographic skill than for its general scientific accuracy and its
                    unusual fulnese of detail. It is to be hoped that this map will be soon
                    engraved, and thus rendered generally accessible to the public. (H C R )</p>
