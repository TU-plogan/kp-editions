                <p><label type="entry">EXTRADITION</label>. When a person who has committed an
                    offence in one country escapes to another, what is the duty of the latter with
                    regard to him? Should the country of refuge try him in its own courts according
                    to its own laws, or deliver him up to the country whose laws he has broken? To
                    the general question international law gives no certain answer. Some jurists,
                    Grotius among them, incline to hold that a state is bound to give up fugitive
                    criminals, but the majority appear to deny the obligation as a matter of right,
                    and prefer to put it on the ground of comity. And the universal practice of
                    nations is to surrender criminals only in consequence of some special treaty
                    with the country which demands them.</p>
                <p>There are two practical difficulties about extradition which have probably
                    prevented the growth of any uniform rule on the subject. One is the variation in
                    the definitions of crime adopted by different countries. The second is the
                    possibility of the process of extradition being employed to get hold of a person
                    who is wanted by his country, not really for a criminal, but for a political
                    offence. In modern states, and more particularly in England, offences of a
                    political character have always been carefully excluded from the operation of
                    the law of extradition.</p>
                <p>Extradition, as stated above, has for the most part been regulated by special
                    treaties. A full list of the extradition treaties between the principal
                    civilized countries will be found in Phillimore’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >International Law,</hi> vol. i. c. 21. Just before the passing of the
                    Extradition Act of 1870, England had only two treaties subsisting—one with
                    France, another with the United States. Both were confirmed by Acts of
                    Parliament. The “Extradition Act 1870” enacts that “where an arrangement has
                    been made with any foreign state, with respect to the surrender to such state of
                    any fugitive criminals, Her Majesty may, by Order in Council, direct that this
                    Act shall apply in the case of such foreign state,” subject to any limitations,
                    conditions, or restrictions that may be thought expedient. It is expressly
                    provided—</p>
                <p>1. That a fugitive criminal shall not be surrendered for a political offence, or
                    if he prove that his surrender has in fact been required with a view of trying
                    him for a political offence.</p>
                <p>2. Provision must be made that a surrendered criminal shall not be tried for any
                    but the extradition crime.</p>
                <p>3. Criminals accused or convicted of offences in England shall not be surrendered
                    in extradition until they are discharged.</p>
                <p>4. There must be an interval of 15 days between the committal to prison and the
                    surrender.</p>
                <p>An Order in Council under the Act must be in conformity with its provisions, and
                    must provide for the determination of the arrangement after not more than a
                    year’s notice.</p>
                <p>When the Act applies, a fugitive criminal of a foreign state is liable to
                    surrender. A requisition for that purpose must be addressed to a secretary of
                    state by some person recognized as a diplomatic representative of the foreign
                    state. The secretary of state, unless he thinks the offence is one of a
                    political character, may inform a police magistrate of the requisition, and
                    require him to issue his warrant for the apprehension of the criminal. The
                    police magistrate, when the criminal is brought before him, shall receive any
                    evidence tending to show that the offence is political, or is not au extradition
                    crime. If the evidence is such as would justify a committal for trial in
                    England, or would prove that the prisoner has been convicted, the magistrate
                    commits him to prison, and after fifteen days’ interval, or if a <hi
                        rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> is issued after the decision of the court,
                    the secretary of state may by his warrant deliver him over to the
                    representatives of the foreign country. If the prisoner is not removed within
                    two months he must be discharged. The Act’applies, with certain modifications,
                    to all British possessions.</p>
                <p>“Fugitive criminal” means any person accused or convicted of an extradition crime
                    committed within the jurisdiction of any foreign state, who is in, or is
                    suspected of being in, any portion of Her Majesty’s dominions. The following is
                    a list of extradition crimes, to be construed according to the law existing in
                    England :—</p>
                <p>Murder and attempt and conspiring to murder; manslaughter; counterfeiting or
                    altering money, and uttering; forgery, counterfeiting, and altering what is
                    forged, &amp;c.; embezzlement and larceny, obtaining money and goods by false
                    pretences; bankruptcy crime: fraud by bailee, banker, agent, &amp;c.; rape;
                    abduction; childstealing; burglary apd housebreaking; arson; robbery with
                    violence; threats by letter or otherwise, with intent to extort; piracy by law
                    of nations; sinking or destroying a vessel at sea, or attempting or conspiring
                    to do so; assaults on board ship on the high seas, with intent to destroy life
                    or to do grievous bodily harm; revolt or conspiracy to revolt by two or more
                    persons on board a ship on the high seas against the authority of the master.
                    The Extradition Act of 1873 adds the following :—Kidnapping and false
                    imprisonment; perjury and subornation of perjury; and indictable offences, not
                    previously named, under the Larceny and other Criminal Acts of 1861 (24 and 25
                    Vict. c. 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101).</p>
                <p>The countries with which England has entered into extradition treaties are the
                    following :—Austria, 3d December 1873; Belgium, 30th May 1876; Brazil, 13th
                    November 1872; Denmark, 31st March 1873; France, 13th February 1843; Germany,
                    14th May 1872; Hayti, 7th December 1874; Honduras, 6th January 1874; Italy, 5th
                    February and 7th May 1873; Netherlands, 10th June 1874; Sweden and Norway, 26th
                    June 1873; Switzerland, 31st March 1874; United States, 9th August 1842 (Abdy’s
                    edition of Kent’s <hi rend="italic">International Law,</hi> Cambridge, 1878).
                    The treaties with France and the United States, it will be noticed, are those
                    which were in force before the English Extradition Acts. Difficulties have
                    arisen between this country and the United States as to the effect of the
                    Extradition Act on the subsisting treaty. In 1875 the English Government
                    protested against the trial for a second offence of a criminal who had been
                    surrendered to the United States. The United States Government maintained that
                    the principle of the English Extradition Act (that the surrendered criminal
                    shall not be tried for any offence committed prior to his surrender other than
                    the extradition crime) did not apply to the treaty of 1842, that this treaty
                    could not be newly construed at the will of one of the parties, and that the
                    claim of the English Government made it impossible for the United States to ask
                    or grant extradition under it. The English Government have in the meantime
                    surrendered three fugitive criminals without insisting on their claim. A royal
                    commission on the Extradition Acts is now sitting (1878).</p>
