                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> Ethnography embraces the descriptive
                    details, and ethnology the rational exposition, of the human aggregates and
                    organizations known as hordes, clans, tribes^ and nations, especially in the
                    earlier, the savage and barbarous, stages of their progress. Both belong to the
                    general science of anthropology or the natural history of mankind, being related
                    to it as parts to a whole. Ethnography and ethnology, indeed, run up into
                    anthropology as anthropology does into zoology, and zoology into biology. No
                    very sharp line can be drawn between these two sciences themselves, their
                    differences being mainly those between the particular and the general, between
                    the orderly collection of local facts, and the principles according to which
                    they may be grouped and interpreted. Ethnographists deal with particular tribes,
                    and with particular institutions and particular customs <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n635/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0635-0614"/> prevailing among the several peoples of the
                    world, and especially among so-called savages. Ethnologists bring simultaneously
                    under review superstitions, legends, customs, and institutions which, though
                    scattered in distant regions of the earth, have some common basis or
                    significance. Ethnography and ethnology run as easily one into another, as the
                    two sections of general anthropology, viz., (1) <hi rend="italic"
                    >anthropology</hi> proper, as expounded by anatomists and physiologists, who
                    deal with the different races of man, their elements, modifications, and
                    possible origin; and (2) <hi rend="italic">demography,</hi> which, as
                    constituted by the researches of Quételet and his friends and disciples, as
                    Farr, Galton, Guillard, and Bertillon, treats of the statistics of health and
                    disease, of the physical, intellectual, physiological, and economical aspects of
                    births, marriages, and mortality.</p>
                <p>Ethnography, ethnology, and anthropology are interwoven with philology,
                    jurisprudence, archaeology, geography, and the various branches of history. A
                    fact may require to be investigated successively by linguists, anatomists, and
                    mathematicians. In current language ethnography and ethnology are often used
                    indiscriminately, but if a distinction is to be made between them, an
                    instinctive perception teaches us to speak of ethnographic facts and
                    ethnological theories, of ethnographic literature and ethnological science,—
                    ethnology being related to ethnography as the wine to the grape.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Division.—</hi> Just as the lines which separate ethnology,
                    anthropology, and history one from another are vaguely traced, so are the
                    boundaries of* the several provinces of ethnology themselves indefinite We are
                    obliged, for the sake of convenience, to draw up classifications, but the more
                    rigorous we make them the more artificial they become. “Nature,” as Lamarck has
                    said, “recognizee neither kingdoms, nor classes, nor orders, nor genera, nor
                    sub-genera; nature recognizes nothing but individuals.” The older sciences may
                    be tabulated to a degree which the younger sciences cannot allow, and ethnology
                    is one of the youngest of all,—its existence, even its name, not dating further
                    back than the present generation. Ethnologists are pioneers in a new field of
                    inquiry,— squatters in the Far West of learning. Intent on opening the first
                    paths through the dark forest of prehistoric times, on driving the first plough
                    through these virgin prairies, they erect uo structures which pretend to more
                    than a provisional character. They throw up now a log cabin, and now a wooden
                    shanty, leaving to their successors the work of building substantial houses of
                    brick, and in the far future stately edifices of enduring marble.</p>
                <p>At first sight it might appear convenient to divide ethnology into two great
                    branches :—(1) <hi rend="italic">historic ethnology,</hi> comprising researches
                    into the origin, the filiation, the customs and institutions of wild and
                    barbarian tribes still existing, or of whom we have authentic records; (2) <hi
                    rend="italic">prehistoric ethnology,</hi> comprising similar researches into the
                    early condition of man, but founded necessarily on deductions, and not on
                    positive testimony. But the fitness and the simplicity of this division are more
                    apparent than real. The two sections as thus indicated caunot be treated apart,
                    because so few or incomplete are the vestiges of prehistoric man that they
                    cannot furnish a basis for sound theories unless these remains are studied in
                    the light of the knowledge which we possess of tribes existing in the
                    non-civilized state, and who thus form the connecting link between historic and
                    prehistoric man. Being a part of natural history, anthropology deah principally
                    with the question of the several races, their anatomy, physiology, and
                    pathology. It seeks to determine which are the permanent varieties, by the
                    crania, by the facial features, by the stature and proportion of the body, by
                    the miscroscopic structure of the hair, by the colour of the skin, ft analyses
                    the great problems of evolution. It assigns to food, to climate, to what the
                    French call the <hi rend="italic">milieu,</hi> and the Americans “the
                    surroundings,”—the share which each has had in producing or fostering the
                    variations of human types. Ethnography does not discuss anew the solutions
                    presented by anthropology, but accepts them as generally true, and observes if
                    they fit and work satisfactorily in its department. The task, thus limited in
                    order to secure its better execution, is still a gigantic one. Human development
                    branches out into a multitude of ramifications, which may be brought under the
                    following heads:</p>

                </table>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Method.—</hi> Astronomy starts from the principle that the
                    laws of mathematics and those of light and matter are universal,—that they are
                    true not Only on the earth but throughout the universe. Ethnology takes its
                    stand on the assumption that the laws of intelligence have always been what they
                    are, and have always operated as they do now, that man has progressed from the
                    simple to the complex, from the particular to the general. This assumption does
                    not interfere with the discussion which the anthropologists carry on respecting
                    monogeny or polygeny, —that is to say, the common or multiplex origin of the
                    different races which inhabit the earth, nor does it affirm that the progress
                    has been always continuous and well-marked. It recognizes the fact that some
                    races may have been stationary and some may even have retrograded. It postulates
                    simply that mankind, whatever be its origin, is, or has become, a mass
                    practically homogeneous, more uniform than diverse The wide differences between
                    civilized and uncivilized man are now admitted to be only differences in
                    degree,—actual civilization being the adult age, and savagery the infancy of
                    mankind. “The conditions and habits of existing savages,” says Sir John Lubbock,
                    “resemble in many ways those of our own ancestors at a period now long gone by;
                    they illustrate the earlier mental stages through which the human race has
                    passed.” To the casual observer, savages seem to be, as to Dr Johnson, all
                    alike, and in fact they are so in comparison with ourselves; but to the close
                    observer who compares savages with savages, they are easily distinguishable.
                    Although contemporaries, they are separated by differences in culture so great
                    that it would seem the work of centuries for the more backward to attain the
                    state already reached by the more advanced. Great, indeed, are the facilities
                    which ethnology confers on the historian who may, for example, explain the
                    condition of the Israelites under the Judges by that ot the Maories of New
                    Zealand, as they were almost within the present generation, or may compare the
                    earliest Aryan races with the Malay-Indian populations of to-day. By its aid the
                    philosopher may trace an institution through all countries and in every period,
                    accumulating illustrations of its progressive stages, and piecing them together
                    in their natural sequence like the scattered bones of an extinct animal.
                    Uncivilized countries are for us a standing exhibition of prehistoric matters,
                    museums where we find duplicates of objects which were thought to be lost or
                    which were forgotten; each of them is a Pompeii, exhumed from beneath the
                    rubbish of ages. To study wild tribes is, as it were, to discover in the forests
                    of Central America an ancient city, not crumbling and desolate, but still
                    inhabited by a race preserving the old Maya habits and manners. The laying bare
                    of all these scientific riches gave the impulse to which we owe ethnology. It
                    does not require much reflection to understand that the principle just developed
                    is an instance of the great law of evolution. According to the naturalist of the
                    modern school, evolution has transformed successively the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n636/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0636-0615"/> animal genera; according to the anthropologist,
                    it has transformed the races of man; and, according to the ethnologist, it has
                    transformed human thought. It must be confessed that evolution has yet opponents
                    who contend that history records, not progress, but degeneration from a state of
                    innocence and bliss, from an age of gold or Saturnian cycle. This doctrine,
                    borne out by the unanimous testimony of all tradition, was assumed at one time
                    to be beyond dispute, and had nearly become an article of faith. But in recent
                    times it has not remained unchallenged. I·n answer to its assailants, the theory
                    of degeneration has, within this century, been reasserted with great ingenuity
                    and vehemence by ultramontane writers, such as De Maistre and De Bυnald, and in
                    our own country it has been more recently defended by Whately with
                    characteristic vigour. But an effective reply has been given by such writers as
                    Lubbock and Tylor, especially the latter, who concludes an exhaustive discussion
                    by these words, to which most ethnologists will subscribe :—</p>
                <p>“We may fancy ourselves looking on civilization as in personal figure she
                    traverses the world; we see her lingering or resting by the way, and often
                    deviating into paths that bring her toiling back to where she had passed by long
                    ago; but, direct or devious, her path lies forward; and if now and then she
                    tries a few backward steps, her walk soon falls into a helpless stumbling. It is
                    not according to her nature; her feet were not made to plant uncertain steps
                    behind her; for both in her forward view and in her onward gait she is of only
                    human type.”— <hi rend="italic">Early Culture,</hi> ii.</p>
                <p>To the facts and reasonings adduced by the naturalists Mr Herbert Spencer adds
                    the weight of speculative argument :—“Each organism, “he says,” exhibited within
                    a short space of time a series of changes which, when supposed to occupy a
                    period indefinitely great, and to go on in various ways instead of one way,
                    gives us a tolerably clear conception of organic evolution in general. The whole
                    exhibits one grand scheme of progression.” These words are the substance of the
                    whole philosophy of evolution, which, sketched out by Maupertuis, Lamarck, and
                    Goethe, reasserted and victoriously demonstrated by Darwin and Wallace, and
                    taken up by Huxley, Virchow, Quatrefagee, Broca, and Haeckel, now underlies all
                    ethnological research.</p>
                <p>In the view of its supporters, evolution has not only in past ages differentiated
                    genera and species, but is at work to-day in transforming the actual types. Here
                    may be the place to advert to the great law, of which Von Baer and Agassiz were
                    the most thorough and successful exponents, namely, “that the development of the
                    individual is an epitome of that of the species.” The human embryo, for example,
                    passes rapidly through all the principal phases, in one or other of which whole
                    series of inferior animals stay permanently, in such a manner that every new
                    generation repeats in an abridged manner those that have gone before. Of the
                    many corollaries which follow from this theory, the most important seems to be
                    that, however much some groups of animals may differ from each other in
                    structure and habits, they must have descended from the same parent form, if
                    they are found to pass through similar embryonic stages. This is <hi
                    rend="italic">heredity.</hi> Ethnologists, again, have not been slow in
                    borrowing this law from anatomists. The embryo going over the same organic form
                    as the species, they argue that the child too must repeat the intellectual
                    developments of past mankind. Parents, and not only the observers among them,
                    had already reversed the opinion of the philosophers that savages are children
                    by saying that children are savages. The remarkable similarity between their
                    ideas, language, habits, and character, though generally admitted, had been
                    regarded merely as a curious accident; but coincidences of such vast magnitude
                    are not to be considered as merely accidental. Everybody know⅛ and the fact is
                    as important as it is obvious, how boys delight in romping, running, leaping,
                    boating, swimming, and all out-door exercises, and how their favourite heroes
                    are the Red Rover, Robin Hood in the forest green, Robinson Crusoe in the
                    solitude of his island home, where he had to begin all anew.</p>
                <p>Peculiar instances of the general law of inheritance have been called <hi
                    rend="italic">atavism.</hi> It occurs often that one individual is the exact
                    countertype of his grandfather, or some more remote ancestor. By this law, still
                    a very obscure one, ethnologists explain how men are occasionally met with who
                    live in the midst of our civilization as mere savages. The passion manifested by
                    many people for hunting and fishing as a sport, for a tramping roving life, the
                    frequent falling or relapse of French settlers in Canada (the Bois brûlés) into
                    Indian habits, are supposed to be manifestations of atavism. But our stiff and
                    rigid civilization is averse to those old fashioned individuals, who roam about,
                    living from hand to mouth; the existing system of law can scarcely be brought to
                    distinguish them from criminals. Moralists attribute to atavism a large number
                    of offences which lawyers attribute to guilty dispositions. Now-a-days more than
                    one Boadicea emerges into a brief celebrity upon being sentenced to hard labour
                    in the house of correction; more than one Cassivellaunus has been severely
                    flogged and sent to penal servitude. Mr Dugdale, an industrious statistician of
                    New York, has traced to its common ancestor a family, the Jukes, consisting of
                    1200 people, of which the majority are paupers, thieves, or prostitutes, in a
                    greater or less degree, and who are computed to have cost the state in prison
                    maintenance, almshouse relief, &lt;fcc., something like £260,000. The ancestor
                    was a descendant of the early Dutch settlers, and lived much as backwoodsmen do
                    now upon the Indian frontiers. He is described as a “hunter and fisherman, a
                    hard drinker, jovial and companionable, averse to steady toil, working hard by
                    spells and idling by turns, becoming blind in his old age, and his blindness has
                    been entailed upon his children and grandchildren.”</p>
                <p>It is not, however, owing to atavism, but to the mere continuance of an old order
                    of things, that so many of our ill-educated classes, shepherds, agricultural
                    labourers, and even factory hands, are as little developed, and live a life as
                    little intellectual as savages. Latent in our small hamlets and large cities
                    there is more savagery than many reformers are aware of, and it needs but little
                    experience to discover something of the old barbarity lurking still in minds and
                    hearts under a thin veil of civilization.</p>
                <p>Atavism is a word applied to persons; <hi rend="italic">survival,</hi> an
                    expressive word for which we are indebted to Tylor, has a similar meaning, but
                    is applied to things. Survivals are habits, ideas, or expressions which are
                    senseless and perfectly inexplicable by the light of our present modes of life
                    and thought, but can be explained by reference to similar customs or prejudices
                    which are still to be found among distant tribes, or which are mentioned by
                    ancient writers. The word <hi rend="italic">survival</hi> corresponds exactly to
                    the Latin word <hi rend="italic">superstition,</hi> meaning the remainder or
                    residue of bygone ages. But as the use of the word superstition is practically
                    restricted to matters pertaining to religion and magic, a more general word had
                    to be coined. “Survivals,” says Tylor, “are milestones on the way of culture.”
                    They are intellectual fossils. Just as spear heads and fragments of ancient
                    pottery are disinterred by the plough in the midst of our fields, so survivals
                    may be picked out in our daily conversation, in our habits and manners, but it
                    requires a trained intelligence to detect them. Their original meaning has been
                    lost, and they have been modified and distorted to serve modem purposes.
                    Survivals may be compared to those muscles or pieces of <pb break="no"

                    and even in the human frame, as relics of a former construction. But sooner or
                    later they will fall to the ground. Nature closely husbands her means; she may
                    keep for a while forms that are apparently useless; it seems that she has
                    forgotten them, or that she intends to fall back on them in case of failure; but
                    when the new type is firmly settled, everything that is not· serviceable
                    disappears.</p>
                <p>The scientific exploration of caverns with a view to discovering the remains of
                    ancient men and beasts, as Pengelly has described it in the case of the Kent
                    Cave, may serve as a model to ethnographers. The explorers did not leave an inch
                    of soil untouched; all the mound was dug out yard by yard, and carefully sifted;
                    nothing was taken up, nothing thrown away without good reason; the objects
                    collected were labelled with care, and even the nature and the condition of the
                    refuse recorded. So the main work of the ethnographer consists in scooping the
                    historic or the prehistoric soil, in picking up everything that has lived, or
                    that has been touched by living hands, and not rejecting as valueless anything
                    as long as he is not perfectly cognizant of its nature. Thus he finds precious
                    things and valuable information where the ignorant seesbut heaps of offal and
                    scourings. And when he travels, especially in semi-civilized countries, there is
                    no limit to the things he may look aud inquire after; the less the people are
                    civilized, the richer the harvest he may gather in. One investigator prefers to
                    study the people themselves, another their institutions. But whatever be the
                    study, the first rule will always be to observe the facts with unprejudiced
                    eyes; to draw a deep line of demarcation between them and all mere conjectures.
                    Besides, all explanations have to be called in question, even those which seem
                    sensible and judicious; the student is in duty <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>
                    bound to distrust every theor, and interpretation, especially his own glosses
                    and commentaries. Rushing to conclusions is a fault into which beginners are
                    sure to fall. The unscientific mind resembles the child in many respects, and in
                    none more than this; it is impatient and cannot bear suspense. Ready
                    acquiescence in the assertion of others is dangerous, and easy conviction in
                    one’s own ideas is the worst bane to science.</p>
                <p>One single fact well observed, well authenticated, is a positive gain, and may
                    turn out to be of the highest value in future studies. But a single fact proves
                    too much or too little; as long as it stands alone, nobody can know whether it
                    demonstrates a general law, or only an exception, as we see by the controversies
                    still held on the famous skull of Neanderthal. Laws are obtained by grouping
                    analogous facts in series. In nature, as in history, a series may be termed the
                    development of an idea. Therefore, when the ethnographer does not restrict
                    himself to the simple description of a single subject, of a single locality, of
                    a single custom, he will have to search for analogous facts, that he may give
                    the reader a scale of comparison. For he would expose himself and his readers to
                    gross errors if he were to conclude from a single trait to the whole
                    institution, or from a single institution to the whole national organization.
                    Such primitive populations as the Aleutians or the Todas it would be easy to
                    represent as living either in a moral paradise or in a moral hell, according as
                    one chose to regard only the attractive or only the repulsive side of their
                    character. A fine ethnographical portrait, which is an abstract representation,
                    will be always difficult to draw. In the sketch of that collective individual, a
                    nation, the features must be impressed with the many lines and furrows which the
                    wear and tear of existence have left on the original. In describing an
                    institution which is a collective fact, the numerous and contradictory feelings
                    must be indicated yhich it stirred up in the many mindsand hearts on which it
                    acted, and which reacted on it. But masters only know how to blend light and
                    shade—how with some few colours to express a multitude of things.</p>
                <p>Ethnology, having entered on the scientific stage of development, requires to be
                    treated as a science. The fields of anthropology and ethnology are no longer the
                    tilting-yard for fancies against opinions, for hypotheses against guesses; they
                    are now the place where facts well authenticated are stored up and gathered into
                    orderly groups. Ethnology has become a science of observation, a branch of
                    natural history. It was born the last of all sciences, not because it is the
                    most difficult, but, on the contrary, because, being easy enough, people have
                    dealt with it too lightly. Everybody thought himself able to judge, and his
                    sentences expressed his biases or dislikes. Now, ethnology requires of its
                    adepts that they be as unprejudiced as mathematicians, that they discard all
                    preconceived ju⅛lg ments as much as do the chemists and physicists.
                    Ethnographers must be exact observers and faithful recorders. Science and virtue
                    alike begin and prosper by the same means—by sincerity and by effort.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Material Development.—</hi> Any inquiry into the material
                    progress of man bears upon a multitude of details. Briefly stated, the most
                    important are Food, its nature and its preparation; Weapons, Tools, and
                    Implements; Shelter and Clothing; Domestic and Public Fires; Barter and
                    Trade.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pood.—</hi> Man has been defined as a digestive tube. He is
                    happily something else as soon as his most imperious physical wauts are
                    satisfied, but it must be confessed that, until the cravings of his hunger or
                    thirst are allayed, he is little better than a ravenous brute. For the statesman
                    and the economist there is scarcely any question of more gravity than that of
                    subsistence, even in the face of our enormous accumulation of wealth, in spite
                    of our gigantic means of communication. There are four great phases through
                    which nations pass, or have passed,— hunting and fishing, sheep and cattle
                    tending, agriculture, and industry; and these are nothing else than a succession
                    of improvements in the means of raising food. All the results of manifold
                    culture converge towards a grand total, —more food for more men, better food for
                    every man, and consequently lives longer and more numerous. A simple calculation
                    shows how much modern industry increases the amount of disposable food. From the
                    United States census, showing the extent of land occupied by the Redskins in
                    1825, it was calculated that the hunting tribes, although they raised some
                    maize, required 1 ’ 75 square miles per head. At that rate, all Europe,
                    including Russia, could feed two millions of Indians and no more; but, thanks to
                    its agriculture and to its industry, it supports three hundred millions of
                    inhabitants. It would be hazardous to estimate how many more Indians the North
                    American prairies might feed, if those Indians had taken to bison breeding
                    instead of bison hunting. According as the chief produce of the herd is to be
                    milk or meat, the calculations would vary by large amounts. Nor ought the yield
                    of our improved breeds to be taken as the measure. But, to proceed, it is
                    reckoned that an area under wheat affords from ten to twelve times more human
                    food than it would give under grass for cattle or sheep. That ratio, ten or
                    twelve to one, may express in human lives the progress which was realized when
                    husbandmen succeeded to nomad communities. With the introduction of steam as our
                    great mechanical agent, we are entering the period of large cities. Human
                    anthills of one million souls and more exist already in many parts of the world;
                    they increase constantly both in absolute numbers and relatively to the
                    population at large. It is already necessary that the supply of food to these
                    immense agglomerations of “digestive tubes” be as regular as clockwork.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0638-0617"/>
                <p>For the chief information we have on the subject of human food in prehistoric
                    times, we are indebted to Professor Riitimeyer, who examined the fauna of the
                    lake dwellings in Switzerland, and to Steenstrup and Thomsen, who dug up the
                    shell mounds of Denmark. They have displayed in their researches an amount of
                    science and sagacity which is an honour to our century.</p>
                <p>The quality of food is calculated to exert a great influence upon the
                    temperament, the health, the vigour, and the intelligence of men. There is thus
                    some truth in Buckle’s statement that the history of the most civilized nations
                    may be explained by the chemical constituents of their food; but until the
                    action of aliments on bodily and intellectual organisms is better known, the
                    discussion would be premature. Besides, the subject belongs to anthropology, and
                    if ethnologists mooted it, they would trespass upon their neighbours’ preserves.

                    >1</hi> Plausible reasons may be given for and against such a view. As men can
                    feed on men but exceptionally, the question would be better discussed in the
                    chapters relating to religious sacrifices and to the progress of morality and
                    intelligence. ⅛</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Weapons, Tools, and Implements.—</hi> Ethnology centres in this
                    study, and by far the greatest number of ethnologists have made it the chief
                    subject of their researches. They go everywhere, beating about all corners,
                    looking for potsherds, bones, teeth, chirts, nephrites, flints, and everywhere
                    their search is more or less successful. <hi rend="italic">Hx</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ungue leonem</hi> is their motto. As the tool, so the work and so
                    the workman; as the arrow-point, so the archer. And they are right. Man is a
                    tool-using, or, as Franklin defined him, a tool-making animal. These weapons,
                    these implements were subservient to the tyrannic necessity of obtaining food.
                    The better the weapons, the more regular the supply of nourishment, and as the
                    food changed, the tools had to be changed. Wood, bones, and rough stones were
                    first used, then polished stones, afterwards bronze, and lastly iron,—each
                    marking a new era. Strong doubts, however, begin to be entertained in many
                    quarters about the separation in two periods each of the stone and of the
                    metallurgic ages: it is objected, first, that polished stones were used as
                    articles of luxury, or where flints could not be had, and, secondly, that the
                    finding of bronze implements much older than any of iron does not prove that
                    bronze was invented before iron, because bronze keeps in a tolerable state of
                    preservation when iron, which oxidizes readily, has long disappeared; and,
                    moreover, it is asserted by technologists that iron or steel tools are
                    indispensable in the fabrication of bronze. Be that as it may, every invention
                    was more than a simple addition to the old stock; it was an advance in quality
                    and variety as much as in quantity; it marked a new progress in intelligence.
                    Tylor says—</p>
                <p>“The ethnographer's business is to classify such details with a view to making
                    out their distribution in geography and history, and the relations which exist
                    among them. To the ethnographer, the bow and arrow is a species, the habit of
                    flattening children’s skulls is a species, the practice of reckoning numbers by
                    ten is a species. The geographical distribution of these things, and their
                    transmission from region to region, have to be studied as the naturalist studies
                    the geography of his botanical and zoological species. Just as certain plants
                    and animals are peculiar to certain districts, so it is with such instruments as
                    the Australian boomerang, the Polynesian stick-and-groove for fire-making, the
                    tiny bow and arrow used as a lancet or phleme by tribes about the Isthmus of
                    Panama; and in like manner with many an art, myth, or custom, found isolated in
                    a peculiar field. Just as the catalogue of all the species of plants and animals
                    of a district represents its flora and fauna, so the list of all the items of
                    the general life of a people represents that whole which we call its culture.
                    And just as distant regions so often produce vegetables and animals which are
                    analagous, though by no means identical, so it is with the details of the
                    civilization of their inhabitants. How good a working analogy there really is
                    between the diffusion of plants and animals and the diffusion of civilization
                    comes well into view when we notice how far the same causes have produced both
                    at once. In district after district, the same causes which have introduced the
                    cultivated plants and domesticated animals of civilization have brought in with
                    them a corresponding art and knowledge. The course of events which carried
                    horses and wheat to Amorica carried with them the use of the gun and the iron
                    hatchet, while in return the old world received not only maize, potatoes, and
                    turkeys, but the habit of smoking and the sailor’s hammock.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">House and Shelter.—</hi> Previous to the recent scientific
                    movement to which we owe ethnology under its present form, architects had
                    already divined and applied to their art ethnological principles. They had
                    understood that the most superb temples and palaces, the most splendid
                    monuments, when they have a national character, reproduce on a large scale the
                    modest abodes of the country people. A greater care is bestowed on the
                    construction of a princely hall, its materials are more costly, the proportions
                    more stately; but in most cases it is a poor man’s cottage magnified. So a
                    church may be but the enlargement of a sepulchre. If the homesteads of the
                    earlier inhabitants were caves or some piled-up slabs, if they were tents or log
                    cabins, the primitive physiognomy will be still detected in the disposition of
                    the magnificent buildings, and even in the costly furniture. For one sees in the
                    Egyptian temples that their columns were imitations of Nile reeds tied in a
                    bundle, that their walls were an imitation of plaited mats. What is called the
                    architectural style is the character of the nation and of the epoch expressed in
                    wood, stone, or brick.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fire.—</hi> After some discussion, it appears now to be the
                    general belief that there has not been within historical times any race of men
                    ignorant of fire. There is certainly a wide chasm between civilized and
                    uncivilized men, but none so deep as would imply the absence of fire, the use of
                    fire being the great practical distinction between man and brute. We have to
                    avoid the double danger of supposing uncivilized tribes to be either too
                    intelligent or too stupid. Indeed, if it had not been for fire, mankind could
                    not possibly have become what it is. It is a theory amongst architects, to whose
                    relations towards ethnology we have just adverted, that the first buildings of
                    men, inhabitants of caves, holes, or trees, were not dwellings for themselves,
                    but simple hearth-places protected by reed walls and some thatching agaiust wind
                    and rain. They believe that on this model of a prytaneum, or abode of the
                    firegod, the abode of his priest, and then of the kings and the chiefs of noble
                    families, were successively erected, and that it is only in later times that all
                    families obtained a fire-place of their own.</p>
                <p>We have spoken of tools and weapons; their history and that of modern industry
                    are inseparable from the history of fire. Everywhere the stone celts and arrows
                    were alleged imitations of thunderbolts, and are still believed by many
                    villagers to have been once hurled down from the skies. Fire is mixed up with
                    whatever men had to tell about things of the earth, of heaven, or of hell. Fire
                    lore is a science by itself.</p>

                    Lindenschmidt and Peschel have reacted against the current belief that the tools
                    and implements of bronze and steel had been manufactured in the countries where
                    they have been found. They note that commerce already existed in the earliest
                    ages of which we have any notice. It must have been by barter that the cave
                    dwellers of Perigord, in the reindeer period, obtained rock crystals, Atlantic
                    shells, and the horns of the Polish saiga antelope. The Phoenicians, and their
                    descendants the Carthaginians, were attracted to and retained in Spain by the

                    cannot be produced. The Celts may have had some skill in metallurgy, as they
                    taught the Romans the art of tinning utensils, and were taught by them the
                    fabrication of coins. Important mines were worked in the Scilly Islands and in
                    Cornwall. If Carthaginian or Phoenician vessels ever reached the west coast of
                    France or entered the Channel, they must have been in quest of tin, and probably
                    too of <hi rend="italic">debouches</hi> for their manufactured bronze. At all
                    events there was intercourse between the northern countries and the
                    Mediterranean by land. That such land traffic existed is proved by the early
                    foundation and prosperity of Marseilles; moreover, the lumps of tin ore which
                    have been found among the Swiss relics of the bronze age must have reached
                    Helvetia by inland commerce. It was owing to the presence of tin that the Celts
                    of Gaul and Britain were of far higher social development than the Teutons of
                    the time of Caesar. The possession of an article of export so indispensable, and
                    the fact that tin was in such great request in the age of bronze, was in itself
                    the means of promoting civilization, for commerce at a very early period brought
                    the Britons into contact with the Mediterranean nations, and especially with the
                    Etruscans, the great bronze-smiths of antiquity. The inhabitants of the coast of
                    the North Sea, and still more of the Baltic, possessed an analogous property in
                    amber. It is doubtless to this coveted substance that the numerous “finds” on
                    the shores of the Baltic are due, where Greek and Roman coins, as well as bronze
                    instruments, were brought, some by way of the Euxine and Pannonia, along the
                    Danube, some along the Rhone and the Rhine, and even some few across the huge
                    barrier of the Alps.</p>
                <p>The obsidian blades which are occasionally met with in ancient graves to the east
                    of the Mississippi must have reached by barter the places where they are now
                    discovered. λVe must not imagine that the Redskins had no intercourse but that
                    of murderous feuds. Merchant boats passed along the great rivers, and transit
                    dues were taken by the chiefs. In South America, curare, the arrow poison, the
                    preparation of which was understood only by a few hordes, formed a valuable
                    article of commerce among the Indians of the Amazon, so that people living near
                    the Napo were obliged to make canoe voyages of three months’ duration in order
                    to procure it. Even where bands of hawkers and pedlars did not wander through
                    the country, goods, such as nephrit hatchets, salt, curious shells, colouring
                    stuffs, were bartered between horde and horde; and thus a system of intercourse
                    might have extended throughout an entire quarter of the world. English wares,
                    deposited at Mombas on the eastern side of South Africa, have been recognized at
                    Mogadυr, on the west coast of Northern Africa. From these circumstances we
                    assume that commerce has existed in remote ages and among most inhabitants of
                    the world. And we must not lose sight of the fact that if we find trade and
                    emporiums in one place, some corresponding industries and manufactures must
                    exist elsewhere in connexion with them.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Family Development.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> To say that
                    of all institutions the family is the oldest and most sacred, that from it all
                    social rights and duties are derived, like branches from the parent stem, would
                    be considered a truism. Nothing looks more plausible than the universal
                    traditions, apparently well founded on historical records, according to which
                    the founder of the nation, the ancestor, as he is called, had sons, who founded
                    families, which increasing at every generation, became so many tribes, which
                    coalesced as time went on. Historians and moralists have not been slow to credit
                    the poets whose idylls described in glorious colours these primitive families.
                    It was the belief that, notwithstanding the expulsion of man from paradise, and
                    the murder of Abel by his brother Cain, the progenies of our first parents led a
                    gladsome life, scarcely less innocent than it was when lambs and lions frolicked
                    together on the banks of the Gihon and the Pison. Directly after the deluge the
                    so-called patriarchal family is thought to have arisen. Perhaps even then it was
                    a little tainted with polygamy and some other minor defects, but on the whole,
                    it was a model of virtue, worthy to be set as an example to a degenerate
                    posterity. Modern research flatly contradicts this common-place romance, denies
                    these self-evident propositions which have become historical axioms. Science is
                    no longer of opinion that tribes and nations have been evolved from the family;
                    on the contrary, it holds that the family has been evolved from tribes and
                    hordes. It is not denied that the first step in the path of material and moral
                    progress began with the rearing of a family, and that family cares have been the
                    most powerful agents of civilization, but it is denied that the family has
                    existed in a perfect state from the beginning. The family had to grow like every
                    thing else. As we see it now, it is an institution of a comparatively recent
                    date.</p>
                <p>In the same manner the belief, conscious or unconscious, has prevailed in most
                    minds that monogamy was the first law of marriage, and that polygamy and
                    polyandry have been wilful departures from a known rule. The reverse appears now
                    to be the fact. In a book which was published as far back as 1861 Professor
                    Bachofen of Basel propounded a theory, deduced from a careful study of classical
                    literature, that true marriage, unknown to the hunting, the fishing, and the
                    nomadic tribes, arose with the spreading of agriculture, the husbandman wedding
                    the wife at the same time that he wedded the soil. Previous to “husbandry” in
                    both senses of the word, pre vious to any regulation in the matter, the females
                    and the children, he contends, were the common property of all the males of the
                    tribe. In some legends this state of things was symbolized by the spontaneous
                    vegetation of the marshes, rushes and wild asparagus. But the woman, spoil of
                    the victors, passed or knocked about from man to man, and even from tribe to
                    tribe, yearned after a better regulated state of things. Under her influence,
                    the rudiments of the family grew into shape. Paternity was an idea which did not
                    and could not have a place in such societies. A child had a hundred fathers or
                    none, but he had one mother; he knew the breasts which had given him suck. In
                    this state of human relations, descent was traced exclusively through mothers.
                    The first kinship was between the offspring of a common female ancestor. To
                    trace descent through the male is an idea of far later date. By this discovery
                    (for it deserves to be ranked as a discovery) a flood of light was thrown on a
                    whole region of the obscure past. It is assumed that under the influence of the
                    then recent idea of motherhood diverse religions arose, all having as principle
                    the worship of Mother Earth, Demeter. And starting from the supposition that
                    religions have been always the expression of the deepest thought and the
                    loftiest aspirations of their worshippers, that practice was the exact
                    counterpart of philosophy, Professor Bachofen inferred that, the Divine Mother
                    having been recognized as the fountain of existence and the source of all right,
                    the human mother was likewise the fountain of authority; and that in some
                    places, and for a certain period * at least, woman as such had exercised
                    political power, and had enjoyed a certain degree of social supremacy,—a
                    startling conclusion, which the stories and traditions respecting Oriental
                    queens did not sufficiently justify.</p>

                    limit of valid deduction had been overstepped, but the great law of maternal
                    filiation has proved sound. Meanwhile, in his <hi rend="italic">Fssay on

                    <hi rend="italic">Mutterrecht,</hi> about the system of kinship through females
                    only. He made the system clear, not by abstract and farfetched considerations,
                    or on scanty testimony transmitted by Herodotus, Hesiod, or Aeschylus, but by
                    the unmistakable instances which ethnography most abundantly supplies. It is now
                    admitted as a fact that maternal kinship was anterior to the paternal, or, as
                    Sir John Lubbock puts it, “children were not in the earliest times regarded as
                    related equally to their father and their mother; but the natural progress of
                    ideas is, first, that a child is related to his tribe generally; secondly, to
                    his mother, and not to his father; thirdly, to his father, and not to his
                    mother; lastly, and lastly only, that he is related to both.” M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> Lennan had been led to formulate the principle by a
                    careful study of that old Roman legend, the Rape of the Sabines. He demonstrated
                    that the legend was in accordance, not only v ith the practice still prevalent
                    in many savage countries of capturing wives by violence, but with the sham
                    fights and mock scuffles which, even in our days and in Europe, take place
                    between the bridegroom’s party, pretending to carry off the bride, and the
                    bride’s party, pretending to ward off the bridegroom’s attack. He showed that
                    the symbol implied something more than the mere lawlessness of savages, and
                    proved the fact that at one time wives were systematically obtained by theft or
                    force. And as real capture could not have been practiced by peaceful neighbours
                    in the midst of the same community, it was necessary to infer that wives were
                    captured from other tribes, whence the distinction between <hi rend="italic"
                    >exogamous</hi> tribes, marrying outside the pale of their community, and <hi
                    rend="italic">endogamous</hi> tribes, marrying within it. He supposes that the
                    origin of exogamy is to be connected with the practice in early times of female
                    infanticide, which, rendering women scarce, led at once to polyandry within the
                    tribe, and the capturing of women from without. To tribes surrounded with
                    enemies, struggling against the difficulties of existence, sons were a source of
                    strength, both for defence and in the quest for food; daughters a source of
                    weakness,—they ate and did not hunt. They weakened their mothers when young, and
                    when grown up were a temptation to surrounding tribes. Hence the cruel custom
                    which made the primitive humau hordes prey upon one another for wives.</p>
                <p>Tylor, who has also called attention to exogamy, regards it as mainly due, not to
                    infanticide, but to the beneficial effect of marrying out-and-out, and to the
                    physiological evils of marrying in-and-in. This theory is favoured by
                    established maxims, breeding in-and-in being perhaps held by public opinion as
                    more noxious to the human species than professional breeders think it for animal
                    stock. As an exogamous tribe increased and enlarged its territory, it may have
                    become endogamous for practical reasons. Sir John Lubbock suggests another
                    motive. “Endogamy seems to have arisen from a feeling of race pride, and a
                    disdain of surrounding tribes, which were either really or presumably in a lower
                    condition.” Sir Henry Maine is very suggestive :— “The barbarous Aryan is not
                    generally monogamous, but exogamous. He has a most prodigious table of
                    prohibited degrees. The Mussulman, however, is not only pυly-gιmous, but
                    endogamous; his law permits comparatively near relatives to intermarry. The
                    comparative liberty of intermarriage is a part of the secret of Mahometanism’s
                    success in India.”</p>
                <p>Lewis Morgan, au American who had studied by personal intercourse the
                    organization of the family among the Seneca Indians, into whose tribe he was
                    adopted, says, in his <hi rend="italic">Ancient Society,</hi> that exogamy and
                    endogamy are not as antagonistic and contradictory to each other as they are
                    supposed to be. According to him, the community at large is often practically
                    endogamous, while the <hi rend="italic">gentes,</hi> or set of families, which
                    constitute it are rigorously exogamous. Ιhe lineage is in most cases through
                    descent in the female line, and the males aro obliged to marry into other
                    geutes.</p>
                <p>Family institutions are in themselves an interesting object of study, and they
                    have besides a wide practical bearing, as they are everywhere inseparably

                    hordes were scattered over vast areas, and were each very small. It is probable
                    that they were recruited not only from within by births, but from without by
                    capture of women and children, and by the voluntary or forced accession of their
                    neighbours to their ranks. We draw a distinction between the human horde, which
                    we hold to be superior only in degree to a herd of brutes, and the tribe, in
                    which we recognize the first buddings of culture. The love of the mother for'
                    the young is an impulse to intelligence and devotion among all higher animals.
                    The certainty of parturition at a period fixed for every species induces
                    precaution and forethought. The rudiments of true humanity we conjecture
                    therefore to have been the acknowledgment of motherhood by the tribe, and the
                    first regular provision for the care of the expected infant. As it has been said
                    already, the family had its origin in the gathering of children round their
                    mother. These children became to one another brothers and sisters by the
                    remembrance of the care they had enjoyed in common. They kept together; so did
                    their children and their children’s children; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gens</hi> took shape and life.</p>
                <p>Probably the original horde was by degrees remodelled into tribes by the gentes
                    which had taken birth in it. The word gens, equivalent to clan, sept, or totem,
                    being the best known of all, may be used in a general sense to denote all
                    kindred institutions. The tribe became an organization of gentes. An Indian
                    tribe, according to Lewis Moτga□, is composed of several gentes, developed from
                    two or more, all the members of which are intermingled by marriage, and all of
                    whom speak the same dialect. To a stranger the tribe is visible, and not the
                    gens. It is highly convenient for a tribe to contain at least two gentes, which,
                    if they choose to intermarry, would find wives at their own door. A fundamental
                    law of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n641/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0641-0620"/> gens prohibited marriage between gentiles, or
                    members of the same gens. For most communities were deeply averse to
                    consanguineous marriages, which they branded with the infamous name of incest,
                    though some others held them to be highly commendable. The original rule was
                    that all descendants by the same mother were to be regarded as brothers and
                    sisters, and they were soon forbidden to contract matrimonial unions. As there
                    was no relationship by the father’s side, the patriarch Abraham could in all
                    propriety take his sister, or rather his half-sister, as a wife. And such a
                    tribe, consisting of two gentes only, intermarrying constantly, might be
                    composed of first cousins only, and be strictly endogamous nevertheless.</p>
                <p>Further rights and duties of the gentiles were the reciprocal obligations of
                    help, defence, and redress of injuries against any one from without. They had
                    the same religious rites, and a common burial place. The archaic gens inherited
                    the property of its members, as they wero taken away by death, and redistributed
                    it every year, or at stated periods. All children of earth return by death to
                    her bosom, and all the gentiles were brought to rest in a common burial place.
                    The gens was primarily a great motherhood, and the gentiles, all of them, were
                    supposed to be brothers and sisters, and to live in their mother’s home.</p>
                <p>As in the course of time the gentes increased, they segregated to a certain
                    extent, but maintained their association for certain common objects; the
                    enlarged association was called a <hi rend="italic">phratna</hi> or brotherhood.
                    Each of the four tribes of the Athenians was organized in three phratrias, each
                    composed of thirty gentes. The Roman <hi rend="italic">curia</hi> was the
                    analogue of the Grecian and the Iroquois phratrias.</p>
                <p>In the normal course of events the tribes increased and segregated as the gentes
                    had formerly done. And “as the gentes had recoalesced in phratrias, so did the
                    tribes reunite in confederacies. Where one Indian tribe had divided into
                    several, and the subdivisions occupied independent but adjacent territories, the
                    confederacy reintegrated them in a higher organization, on the basis of the
                    common gentes which they possessed, and of the affiliated dialects which they
                    spoke. The confederacy had the gentes for its basis, and the mother language as
                    the measure of its extent. Its formation required the highest skill. The
                    Iroquois ascribed the origin of theirs to divine inspiration; they considered it
                    to be the masterpiece of wisdom.” To bring many tribes together, Co conciliate
                    the conflicting interests in a superior organization, and make it work, requires
                    an intelligence much superior to that which is required for gaining victories in
                    the battlefield. Therefore confederacies have been always rare achievements. The
                    common course of events has beeu rather that tribes have become nations, not by
                    peaceful and voluntary aggregation, but by the bloody work of war and conquest,
                    by constant encroachments on the territory of neighbours, by killing part of
                    them, and enslaving the rest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Authority.—</hi> When not actually engaged in a war or in a
                    hunting expedition, wild tribes are often without recognized chiefs. In case of
                    need, in dangerous emergencies, natural superiority soon asserts itself, and the
                    boldest, strongest, most intelligent, or most experienced steps forward as
                    leader. With the children of nature authority is of a more transient and less
                    definite character than with us. Their aggregations are, as a rule, very small.
                    In order to understand the most ancient condition of human society, says Sir
                    Henry Maine, all distances must be reduced, and we must look at mankind, so to
                    speak, through the wrong end of the historical telescope. Many anthropologists
                    are of opinion that civilization has increased the differences in the anatomy of
                    man and woman, in the stature of giants and dwarfs. There is stronger evidence
                    that it has increased intellectual differences. The oscillations on either side
                    of the average line of learning and intellect are widest in our populous and
                    complicated communities, where the talented are more talented, and the stupid
                    more stupid than elsewhere. In small bodies politic, there is not the same
                    necessity for strict discipline as in the large ones. And the larger they grow,
                    <hi rend="italic">totis</hi><hi rend="italic">paribus,</hi> the more despotic
                    they become. History has shown it to be the case with all great monarchies,
                    which in times ancient and modern have been synonymous with despotisms. When
                    conquering Rome overstepped the limits of the Italian territory, she ceased to
                    be a republic, and despite the desperate efforts of her best citizens she became
                    an empire. The larger the territory, the greater are the inequalities between
                    the inhabitants, and the greater the danger of despotism. To our eyes kingdoms
                    like those of Dahomey, of Ashantee, or of Uganda, may not appear very large, but
                    to negroes, whose minds are unable to grasp any thing very complex, they seem
                    immense. In fact, some savage rulers believe themselves to be real gods,—
                    believe without a shadow of doubt that their ancestor created heaven and earth;
                    they are persuaded that the limits of the habitable world are not far beyond the
                    boundaries of their petty dominions. We are expressly told by travellers that
                    their subjects hold them in greater reverence than divinities. The innumerable
                    variety of governments is perplexing to ethnologists, who find often the most
                    heterogeneous forms side by side, and see intelligent and courageous nations
                    submit to a tyranny which would often appear intolerable to their neighbours.
                    Forces are constantly in operation, of which some tend to increase the liberty
                    of the citizen, and some to increase the authority of government. If we are
                    believers in the general principle that self-government is the best, then we
                    shall be astonished to find how often it has been obtained by nations which we
                    deem much inferior to ourselves. So-called savages possess a degree of freedom
                    and enjoy an absence of restraint which well may kindle the enthusiasm of the
                    youthful readers of Fenimore Cooper, and provoke melancholy reflections in many
                    people who feel over-governed, and ruled down, who complain that the price which
                    we pay for the blessings of civilization is too high.</p>
                <p>For the men who exercise power, it is dangerous not to have an eye open, if not
                    to the general benefit, at least to the interest of some powerful class. This
                    fact is often disregarded; historians easily overlook the circumstance that a
                    ruler, however violent, rash, and headstrong, is in most cases but the tool,
                    conscious or unconscious, of a party. Because orders are given in his name
                    alone, it is not remembered that in reality he acts not in his personal
                    capacity, but as the general manager of a joint-stock company with numerous
                    shareholders. If we revert to the historic origin of authority, it is highly
                    probable that the gens, to which is attributed the interior organization of the
                    tribe, has been also the most efficacious constituent of political power. The
                    most powerful gens taking the lead of the other gentes, the head of that gens
                    became easily the regular chief of the tribe. Such a government might as easily
                    become republican as monarchical or oligarchic. To the Commoners of the English
                    Parliament corresponds the assembly of the people,—that is, of all the gentiles;
                    to the senate, or Lords, corresponds the council of the elders and chiefs of
                    gentes. Either the council, or the assembly, or both together, entrusted the*
                    executive power to one pre-eminent official, who may have exercised at once the
                    functions of priest, general, and chief justice,— for in early times the
                    cumulation of offices was the rule, and the division of labour was the
                    exception. In his interesting book, <hi rend="italic">La Cite Antique,</hi>
                    which depicts society under the posterior gentile organization, M. Fustel de
                    Coulanges represents the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> as being at once a
                    tiller of the soil, a warrior, a judge in his own household—</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n642/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0642-0621"/>
                <p>invested with the power of life and death over his wife, his children, and his
                    slaves,—a priest and an offerer of sacrifice, when officiating before his sacred
                    hearth. The <hi rend="italic">rex</hi> or <hi rend="italic">basileus,</hi>
                    acting on behalf of the whole city, was the representative paterfamilias, acting
                    in the name and on behalf of all his brethren.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Property</hi> is an institution which stands second in
                    importance to none. Property went on increasing in amount from the hunting and
                    fishing period to the pastoral, and from the pastoral to the agricultural—not to
                    stop there. Riches increased in proportion to the intelligence and to the amount
                    of work done. As riches accumulated, so increased not only the greed but, what
                    is an apparent contradiction, the need for them. The men in authority, the
                    strong, took more than their share, the weak growing constantly weaker, the
                    poorer becoming either paupers or slaves. When riches were made fairly abundant
                    by agriculture, the pristine gens with maternal kinship had to give way to the
                    gens with paternal kinship; for it was contrary to logic that the privileges of
                    riches and power should be still bestowed by enslaved women, when the
                    circumstances of family life established a sufficient certitude of paternity.
                    Thus internal revolutions modified totally the character of the gens in the
                    course of time. It had begun by being feminine in character, it ended in being
                    exclusively masculine. Originally property was held in common by all gentiles;
                    by degrees its ownership became restricted to constantly diminishing circles of
                    relations, and finally an end was made of collective property; the principle of
                    private ownership obtained the victory, and reigned supreme as it does now.</p>
                <p>And when, in the leading states, the principle of collective property which
                    underlay the gens had lost its vital force, the gens fell or was overthrown and
                    crumbled to dust. This mighty fabric, the most considerable perhaps of Ml human
                    institutions, has broken down everywhere, but it has not been totally destroyed.
                    Its <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> lie broadcast over the earth, from Rajputana
                    to Scotland and Ireland, and thence to America. In the still existing <hi
                    rend="italic">House or Village Communities in the East and West,</hi> as
                    described by Sir Henry Maine, we see living remnants of that institution in
                    which formerly all ideas of peace, industry, justice, and progress had centred.
                    Once the gens was all, and it was believed that it would remain all to all time.
                    At that period, the gens was a political and a religious no less than a family
                    institution; each gens was a complete state in itself. Where the gentes absorbed
                    all the members of the tribe, leaving nobody out of its pale, and giving a fair
                    share to all, the institution was perfectly compatible with progress, at least
                    for a long time. But it happened otherwise in many instances, and especially
                    among the gentes which are the best knf&gt;wn to us, those of Greece and Rome.
                    There the gentes took advantage of the fact that they were the first organized
                    body to arrogate all power, and most obstinately they kept it, making themselves
                    a privileged class, ruling a mob of paupers, exiles, fugitives, runaway slaves,
                    and their progeny the <hi rend="italic">proletariate.</hi> Theoretically the
                    gens might have endured for ever, if it had consented to take up outsiders. But
                    collective bodies lack generosity, especially when they are powerful. The
                    gentiles went on increasing the number of non-gentiles by their raids and wars,
                    conquering and enslaving other free men, until the privileged ones were
                    outnumbered, outwitted, and finally ousted from power by the multitude of the
                    nonpossessors. And thus sovereignty, which for long ages rested upon the family
                    system, rests now upon the territorial system.</p>
                <p>VII. <hi rend="italic">Intellectual Development, Language, Literature, and
                    Arts.—</hi> To no other auxiliary science is ethnology so much indebted as to
                    philology. Not long ago the two sciences were confounded with each other, and
                    purely linguistic disquisitions went under the name of “ethnographic
                    researches,” as in the <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi> of Balbi, where the word
                    “ethnography” occurs perhaps for the first time (in 1826).</p>
                <p>Formerly the words “nations” and “languages” were synonymous. In Genesis the
                    confusion of the tongues is said to have caused the separation of mankind into
                    nations. A language is to be considered as the collective brain of a nation; the
                    vocabulary shows the richness of its ideas, the syntax how it works them. While
                    our lexicographers count their words by the ten thousands, we are assured that
                    the savage is scarcely able to use more than twelve hundred words, and that many
                    English rustics have not more than four or five hundred words at their disposal.
                    A nation’s language is the sum of its developed intellect, the record of its
                    previous intellectual efforts. From that store of accumulated ideas and feelings
                    our children draw the best part of their information, the most of their morals.
                    Our mother tongue is our intellectual motherland.</p>
                <p>For a long time, the element of race had been considered to be the greatest of
                    all ethnological factors. Some even drew between Aryans and non-Aryans a line
                    which would have been scarcely sharper if it had been between men and brutes.
                    But after all, affinity of blood seems to have much less influence on men than
                    the affinity of religions, and the affinity of religions less than the affinity
                    of languages, at least in modern times,—for this reason, that language is the
                    sum and religion a part only of our thoughts. A curious example of the power of
                    language is observed in Roumania. Its inhabitants claim descent from Italian
                    colonists, an obscure and certainly very mixed stock. For a time they were
                    thought to have disappeared among the Slavs, whose Greek religion had already
                    conquered them, and already acted powerfully on their language. But the language
                    which had been brought to the plains of Moldo-Wallachia by poor soldiers and
                    ignorant peasants stubbornly resisted extinction, and at last obtained the
                    advantage over its invader, because as a vehicle of thought it brought with it
                    the ideas and memories which are preserved in the pages of Virgil and Cicero,
                    and finally the Roumanians elected to enter into the fellowship of Latin
                    nations. It is the English language which in the United States has welded into
                    one nation the motley crowd of immigrants landing from so many countries and
                    professing so many religions.</p>
                <p>Ethnologists, as such, are not concerned to inquire into the difficult problem of
                    the origin of languages, which is to be worked out by the professed
                    philologists. The solutions, however, which seem self-evident to linguists on
                    mere philologie grounds, if they do not tally with ethnological experience, will
                    have their acceptance postponed by ethnologists until further examination. For
                    example, some authors will have it that nations must be considered as belonging
                    to different races, and descended from ancestors of totally inconsonant minds,
                    if one uses as a prefix what another would use as a suffix, or if oue puts the
                    attribute after the substantive when another puts it before. Between the <hi
                    rend="italic">isolating,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">agglutinative,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">inflexional</hi> languages they have drawn the same
                    distinctions as those established by the botanists between acotyledonous,
                    monocotyledonous, and dicotyledonous plants; and they want the ethnologists to
                    classify nations accordingly,—the last of the three, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the inflexional, being supposed to have a preponderance as great as
                    that of the vertebrates over the invertebrates. And, furthermore, considering
                    that the inflexional languages are less sonorous and abundant in forms than they
                    were in their earlier stages, philologists took much to heart what they regarded
                    as a linguistic deterior⅛ tion. From that degeneration theory there is an easy
                    transition<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n643/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0643-0622"/> to the belief that language is a divine
                    revelation, or at least a sudden and spontaneous birth in the soul of every race
                    (Renan). This theory, which presupposes the plurality of races, may be very
                    acceptable to philologists, but is one with which most ethnologists do not
                    agree. Where philologists see a difference in nature, ethnologists ses rather a
                    difference in degree; they object that “it must not be by any means supposed
                    that complexity in language implies excellence or even completeness.”</p>
                <p>What mere philologists call debasement, philologists who are also philosophers
                    call improvement. Mere artists or calligraphers may deplore the deterioration of
                    hieroglyphics with elaborate drawings into a cursive, demotic writing, which has
                    led to the adoption of our unpicturesque alphabets. “The phonic alteration,”
                    says an able linguist, Μ. Michel Bréal, “helped the emancipation of thought; it
                    furthered the first steps of mau in the path of abstract thought; it gave to the
                    human mind the same assistance as algebra gives to the mathematician, when it
                    substituted signs more abstract still.” Mr Sweet <hi rend="italic">{Language and
                    Thought},</hi> considering it an amelioration that English has cast off “an
                    effete inflexional system,” does not lament that “English is to be compared in
                    part with agglutinating in part with isolating languages, such as Chinese.”</p>
                <p>These reservations are made not because ethnologists think little of philology
                    applied to ethnologic research, but rather because they know that alliance to be
                    a vital necessity, and hope by concerted action to increase its usefulness.
                    Philology, like history, was long limited to a study of the Greek and Latin
                    languages, untiL it was made a totally new science by the discovery of Sanskrit,
                    and by the vocabularies which travellers collected from all parts of the globe.
                    In the hand of modem observers, such as Bopp, Schleicher, Fick, Max Müller,
                    Friedrich Müller, Curtius, Pictet, philology has become a sort of telescope by
                    which human sight penetrates the night of centuries long past. “By marvellous
                    efforts of sagacity it has reconstituted the social state, the uses, the ideas,
                    the beliefs of the ancient Aryas, whose moral history is now better known to us
                    than some periods of Roman history. It has discovered bonds of parentage between
                    nations, which, as the Greeks and Persians did, reproached each other with being
                    barbarians, and it has descried a diversity of origin between nations, which, as
                    the Greeks and Egyptians, thought themselves to be closely allied” (Bréal). How
                    the sagacity of the philologists adds to the achievements of ethnology is shown
                    by Peschel, who thus sums up the results of their labours for finding out where
                    was the cradle of our Indo-European ancestors :—</p>
                <p>“When the ancient vocabulary of the primordial Aryan age is restored by
                    collecting the roots common to all the members, we at the same time obtain an
                    outline of the social condition of these nations in the most ancient period. We
                    thus learn that they already tilled the ground, ploughed it with oxen, used
                    carriages with wheels, kept cattle for the production of milk, and ventured on a
                    neighbouring sea in rowing boats, but did not use sails. It is more than
                    doubtful whether they smelted metals, especially as the name for bellows is not
                    derived from the primordial place of abode. As they were not acquainted· there
                    with the ass and the cat, both ancient domestic animals in Africa, they had not
                    as yet interchanged any of the treasures of civilization with the Egyptians. As
                    they had the same terms for snow and winter, and the other seasons afterwards
                    received different names, we may be certain that in ancient Arya there was an
                    alternation of hot and cold months. In these primitive abodes dwelt bears,
                    wolves, and otters, but there were neither lions nor tigers. It lay eastward of
                    Nestus in Macedonia, which in the time of Xerxes was the limit of the European
                    lion. It was also further north than Chuzistan, Irak-Arabi, and even than
                    Assyria, where lions are still to be met with. It cannot have included the high
                    lands of west Iran and the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, for tigers still
                    wander in search of prey as far as those districts. Hence every geographer will
                    probably agree that t* <hi rend="superscript"> le</hi> Indo-Europeans occupied
                    both slopes of the Caucasus, as well as the remarkable gorge of Dariel, and were
                    in the habit of visiting either the Euxine or the Caspian Sea, perhaps
                    both.”</p>
                <p>Mr Hyde Clarke shows that the original names of some African weapons are still
                    names of stones,—an interesting circumstance, as the belief gains ground in some
                    quarters that the despised Negro invented the smelting and the working of iron,
                    a discovery which ranks second to none, and to which are mainly due the wonders
                    of our modern civilization in this, the true Iron Age. Geiger claims to have
                    proved that, as recently as the Homeric period, men had a very imperfect and
                    even deficient perception of colours. Bolder still is Herr Fick, who has
                    construed some hundreds of proper names by which the “Proeth∙ nians,” supposed
                    ancestors of the Celts, Germans, and Zends, may have been called before Sanskrit
                    was yet born. Many other proofs might be given that philologists, who quite
                    recently dared not, as it were, lose sight of the Mediterranean coasts, now
                    navigate the most distant seas, far beyond the Ultima Thule of yore.</p>
                <p>Language is the highest work of a nation, a work of art, and often ι nation’s
                    only one. The study of languages leads to the study of popular poetry, of songs,
                    of dances, and of music, all subjects upon which we possess a mass of
                    information, but little knowledge. The details are ready, collected from all
                    parts of the world, but the synthesis has not yet been made.</p>
                <p>It is a curious fact that very accurate and even artistic etchings made on bone
                    or horn, with the point of a flint, are found in the remains of the early stone
                    age, but are wanting not only in the later part of the stone age, but also
                    throughout the so-called bronze period. The ornamentation of pottery was very
                    rude and scanty, progressing very slowly, but in the age following it seems to
                    have taken a start—imitations of plants and animals being essayed. The Eskimo
                    are fair draughtsmen. The Indians draw like children. Polynesians do not draw,
                    but carve and paint. The Bushmen and Kaffirs have no idea of perspective, the
                    Chinese very little. Drawing on a flat surface requires a certain degree of
                    thought, and encountered probably much prejudice, because it was supposed to
                    catch the shadow, or the soul of the objects. Carvings and mouldings in clay
                    were easier, not to execute, but to attempt. It is beyond question that personal
                    ornament was the beginning of art. Savages are passionately fond of adorning
                    their persons with painting (probably the hunters of Cro-Magnon, Schussenried,
                    andThayingen bedaubed themselves with the ochre found near their bones), with
                    tattooing, with all sorts of necklaces, bracelets, necklets, armlets, leggings,
                    breast-plates, and stomachers, with fantastic headgear, and quills, pearls,
                    shells, and rings through the nose, ears, and lips. Even the front teeth have
                    been inlaid with shining knobs, as among the Dyaks. We are, in this department,
                    encumbered by a mass of details, which require to be systematically arranged,
                    examined, aιid compared, in order that they may become part of a science, or
                    even a science by itself.</p>
                <p>VIII. <hi rend="italic">Religious Development, Myths and Legends, Magic and
                    Superstition.—</hi> Controversies have been waged upon this question—-“Do any
                    tribes exist which have no kind of religion <hi rend="italic">1”</hi> What made
                    the dispute interminable, and of little profit, is the fact that the disputants
                    attached different meanings to the same word. Reports of missionaries were
                    quoted, some affirming, some denying. Thus facts have been brought forward to
                    prove either that the* Russian peasants are very religious or very irreligious.
                    The truth is that the religion of these simple-minded people is so mixed up with
                    superstition that rigorous critics who maintain that superstition is the reverse
                    of religion, as much as of morals, have no difficulty in proving that many of
                    these country folks practice real shamanism under the cloak of Greek
                    Christianity. But ethnologists are not expected to be either severe or
                    indulgent; they have to give a definition<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n644/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0644-0623"/> covering the ground occupied by all religions, be
                    they true or false. Their definition of the word, although a philosophic one,
                    falls in with that which many theologians have formulated. “Religion is the
                    feeling which falls upon man in the presence of the unknown.” Man fears and must
                    fear the unknown, because the unknown may be dangerous and terrible, because the
                    infinite is hidden in the unknown. Man personifies the Unknown; when his mind is
                    strongly excited, he cannot do otherwise. And that personification he seeks to
                    propitiate.</p>
                <p>As regards superstitions, while moralists and social reformers consider them to
                    be baneful weeds which it is their duty to dig out and destroy, ethnologists
                    consider them as wrecks of former beliefs, over which the waves of many
                    centuries have washed. The symbol has remained, but its significance is gone;
                    the comprehension, never more than superficial, became lost, but the reverence
                    was great, and survived. Thus, paganism underlies Christianity still, especially
                    among ignorant rustics, a fact which the word pagan itself illustrates <hi
                    rend="italic">(pagani,</hi> country folk).</p>
                <p>Classic paganism, the product of a late idealism, was in its theory too
                    philosophic to be understood except by the few; it propounded the worship of the
                    sun and aether as male principles and sources of light, heat, and life. It had
                    succeeded to the so-called chthonic religions, of which Professor Bachofen <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mutterrecht)</hi> and M. Jules Baissac <hi rend="italic">(Les
                    Origines</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Religion)</hi> have been the exponents. The
                    Earth Mother was then the centre of stellar, solar, and lunar deities, lunar
                    deities especially, the moon being often considered as of the male sex. From
                    internal evidence, it may be supposed that these religions were devised under
                    the influence of agricultural practices, when the idea of paternal filiation
                    began to be slowly evolved from the maternal. And the chthonic religions were
                    themselves in their origin an innovation upon animal worship, which corresponded
                    to the rise of Totemism (M <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Lennan, Spencer) upon
                    Shamanism, and the still ruder Fetichism. The lowest religions are characterized
                    by their containing the greatest proportion of magic and the least of science
                    and morality. In that stage, the invisible powers of witchcraft and sorcery are
                    made to explain whatever is not understood,—even the fact of natural death, the
                    explanation of which one would have thought to be the first to loom on these
                    dark intelligences. But seeing around them so many violent deaths, among men as
                    well as among brutes, they believed that all death, and even all diseases, were
                    owing to magic.</p>
                <p>Magic has been analysed. Its essence is the belief in the action of spirits or
                    souls of dead men. That belief is called <hi rend="smallcaps">Animism</hi> (g.
                    <hi rend="italic">v.)</hi> by Tylor, whose researches on the subject constitute
                    one of the most important results of English ethnology. He says—</p>
                <p>“Animism characterizes tribes very low in the scale of humanity, and thence
                    ascends, deeply modified in its transmission, but from first to last preserving
                    an unbroken continuity, into the midst of high culture. Animism is the
                    groundwork of the philosophy of religion, from that of the savages up to that of
                    civilized men; but although it may at first seem to afford but a meagre and bare
                    definition of a minimum of religion, it will be found practically sufficient;
                    for where the roots are, the branches will generally be produced. The theory of
                    animism divides into two great dogmas, forming parts of one consistent doctrine;
                    first, concerning souls of individual creatures, capable of continued existence
                    after death; second, concerning other spirits, upward to the rank of powerful
                    deities. Spiritual beings are held to affect or control the events of the
                    material world, and man’s life here and hereafter; and it being considered that
                    they hold intercourse with men and receive pleasure or displeasure from human
                    actions, the belief in their existence leads naturally sooner or later, to
                    active reverence and propitiation.”</p>
                <p>Indications are not wanting that prehistoric men were addicted to magic. In the
                    Swiss lake-dwellings, crescentshaped implements in baked earth have been found,
                    which are supposed by some to be amulets, and related to moon worship; and the
                    absence of all bones of hares in the kitchen middens is generally explained by a
                    superstition avoidance of that animal’s flesh.</p>
                <p>Superstition or prehistoric religion still survives even in the heart of
                    civilized Europe, where many of its bizarre and grotesque practices are to be
                    found similar to those prevailing in China, and in the dark corners of Africa
                    and Australia. How is this universal prevalence to be explained? Does it prove
                    that the communications between distant members of the human family were more
                    active than it is commonly supposed that they were I Does it prove that we did
                    all come from the same stock? Or is the true explanation this, that the
                    similarity of effects results from the similarity of causes, and that men
                    evolved analogous beliefs because they have analogous minds? Mr Herbert Spencer
                    <hi rend="italic">(Animal Worship)</hi> is of opinion that, considering the sum
                    of knowledge which primitive men possessed, and the imperfection of their signs
                    of language and thought, the conclusions which they arrived at were after all
                    the most reasonable. Till recently sensible men did but shrug their shoulders
                    when they heard of superstitions. They had little thought of collecting them
                    with care, and still less of studying them in earnest as subjects of scientific
                    inquiry, and precious as embodying the oldest accessible thoughts of mankind.
                    Some beginning has been made. Brandes, Henderson, and Wright in England, Wuttke
                    in Germany, Kreutzwald in Esthonia, Grohmann in Bohemia, Dennys and Doolittle in
                    China, and many others have collected precious documents. A mass of material
                    lies scattered about, especially in books of travels. Explorers in this field of
                    inquiry ought not to be repelled by the amount of nonsense they encounter; the
                    more absurd the text, the more ancient and genuine it probably is. Most things
                    would be inexplicable if they stood alone, but one explains another. Here, as in
                    natural history, the value and signification of the individual object is best

                <p>Fairy tales and popular legends find little favour with many enlightened people.
                    Of course if these tales were to be taken literally, they would be pronounced
                    pure nonsense, but their meaning, like that of poetry, is an ideal one; they are
                    intended to please and invigorate the imagination of children. In ancient times,
                    when their primitive form and meaning were less altered, they had a higher
                    purpose. Those mixed up with animal stories of a certain character appear to
                    have been Buddhist parables intended to teach fairness and goodness towards “the
                    weaker brethren."’ But although twenty centuries old and more, they belong to
                    the later creations in the development of human thought. The oldest stories are
                    scraps of prehistoric myths, cosmologies, and epics. Although they have been
                    patched up a thousand times, they have still kept enough of their original
                    traits to be still recognizable.</p>
                <p>And it is not only popular tales and proverbs which are to be regarded as records
                    of ancient lore, but also children s plays, nursery rhymes, and infantine
                    dances, as has been pointed out by Tylor and by Rochholz <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Kinderlied und Kinderspiel).</hi> Among Kirghiz, Chinese, Redskins, and Bantu
                    negroes, counterparts have been found to the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> to the grand myths of Hercules and
                    Prometheus, to the traditions of the Argonauts,of Danae, Andro mede, Proserpine,
                    not to forget the most charming romance of Psyche. During the Middle Ages many
                    of those tales were bedaubed with theological additions, and transformed into
                    hagiologies and “Golden Legends.” As such they had a separate existence, but
                    fortunately they did not obliterate the recollection of the originals from which
                    they sprang. Struck with a happy idea, and wishing to prove that tl.e moderns
                    were as good as the ancients, Charles Perrault put his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Contes</hi> into writing, which he little suspected to be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n645/mode/1up"

                    the Greeks. His narrations were gems of elegant simplicity, and their success
                    caused them to be followed by many similar productions, which were enjoyed as
                    light literature, their scientific import being little suspected, until the
                    brothers Grimm collected the <hi rend="italic">Deutsche Hausmarchen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> one of the most popular books published in this
                    century. These savants opened a most fertile field of investigation by their
                    discovery that many German popular tales had for their substratum German
                    mythology. Adalbert Kühne’s <hi rend="italic">Herabkunft</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Feuers</hi> marked a new step. He showed most clearly that our tales have
                    the same relation with the old Vedan mythology as our languages with the
                    Sanskrit. Benfey proved by other considerations the same thesis. Following them,
                    M. Bréal gave in his <hi rend="italic">Mythe</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cacus</hi> a model of science made clear and pleasant. A host of
                    diligent searchers, mostly Germans, for the Germans have taken the lead in this
                    department, devoted themselves to collecting, translating, commenting upon
                    popular tales, songs, and mythology. Folklore now constitutes quite a special
                    literature. We have already legends from all five parts of the world, legends
                    from nearly every important country, and in some countries from almost every
                    province. The immense task of sifting and reconstructing prehistoric mythology
                    has next to be commenced.</p>
                <p>IX. <hi rend="italic">Justice and Morals.—</hi> Law is anterior to justice. The
                    lower races, says Lubbock, are deficient in any idea of right, though quite
                    familiar with that of law. In fact, civil law, in its origin, is a custom and
                    nothing else,—a custom meeting some particular want. Therefore laws will not
                    last if they be arbitrary, if they be founded on the caprice of a legislator,
                    and do not subserve the interests of the majority. True laws are the expression
                    of the people’s will; legislature and magistracy are delegations of the people’s
                    authority. In primitive communities such delegation is often uncalled for; the
                    community acts directly as judge and law-giver, its resolutions being guided not
                    by abstract principles of justice, but by self-interest and a desire for
                    self-preservation,—seldom, if ever, by unselfish considerations. <hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Salus populi suprema</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lex.”</hi> As the community enlarges this feeling widens and becomes
                    generalized; by degrees the idea of justice is evolved out of common
                    convenience. Absorbed by their petty local interests, early tribes could
                    scarcely realize the idea of absolute justice, which is inseparable from the
                    idea of mankind at large. Both ideas are of a recent origin; they seem
                    contemporaneous with the rise of the Roman empire, when it strove to take
                    possession of the whole world, and when the positive principles of jurisprudence
                    were set forth with a logic, a vigour, and a lucidity not surpassed, not even
                    equalled since. Our civilized countries have enriched themselves with a
                    ponderous apparatus of written laws, which are, or are affirmed to be, the
                    outgrowth of customary laws, and an accepted fiction sets forth that every
                    citizen knows and understands perfectly that immense miscellany of rules and
                    statutes.</p>
                <p>Criminal law has a similar origin; it is the part of justice evolved out of
                    vengeance, which, from being with some animals and the lowest tribes a boundless
                    passion, was by degrees restrained, acquired a definite form, and became the law
                    of <hi rend="italic">retaliation,—</hi> “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
                    tooth.” From that principle men were sure to infer, “Do not to others what thou
                    wouldst not like to be done to thyself,”—the negative side of a principle which
                    was far sooner understood than its positive side, '∙ Do unto others as ye would
                    that men should do unto you.” The abandonment of <hi rend="italic">vendetta</hi>
                    is one of the steps which lead from semi-civilization towards civilization. But
                    its adoption by primitive communities had in its time heralded an improved state
                    of things. Its principle is that all the members of a gens are bound to avenge
                    the death or the hurt of any individual member. Thereby the gentiles were
                    involved in continual troubles. By degrees they came to find out that the surest
                    way to minimize the troubles arising out of vendetta was to avoid its causes.
                    This led to the softening of manners. The next step was for the gens to impose
                    upon its affiliates the obligation to resort directly to its tribunal in case of
                    offences. Thus by degrees redress came to be substituted for revenge, and
                    justice taken at one’s own hand to be regarded as fit only for barbarians.</p>
                <p>Like the tribe, the gens was for its members an enlarged self, and its motto
                    was—One for all, all for one,—an ideal motto among brothers in a brotherhood,
                    but one fit also to promote' strifes of brotherhood against brotherhood.
                    Friendship, honesty, justice, and even self-sacrifice within the circle of
                    kinship; cunning, violence, murder, ruthless brutality outside. The gentile
                    stood by the gentile for weal or woe, for wrong or right. Men’s minds and hearts
                    are now so far enlarged that they can embrace the idea of a whole country, their
                    own. But have we gone really much further?</p>
                <p>X. <hi rend="italic">Progress.—</hi> Ethnology, in its actual state, centres upon
                    the theory of progress. It has not only to prove the existence of progress, it
                    has to demonstrate how it operates, and to measure the amount of its work in the
                    different periods. Progress, put in question in all the branches of human
                    development, is nowhere more fiercely discussed than in its relation to justice
                    and morals. This is the most important, the most interesting, and also the most
                    perplexing theme. It is the easiest to discourse upon, as there are no external
                    standards by which to measure internal phenomena, no fixed canon by which to
                    compute the ever-shifting correlations between the two great principles of
                    social order and individual liberty—custom and progress, which, far from working
                    harmoniously together, clash so often one against the other. This question is
                    not merely a theoretical one: it has very practical bearings, now that our
                    civilization is about to take possession of all the world,—now that
                    representatives of our culture invade in so many places the soil occupied by
                    less advanced communities. Before the last remainders of ancient ages be
                    destroyed, it is certainly worth while to pause and to consider, Are we right in
                    doing away with them, and will the world at large be a gainer by it? The United
                    States, the colonial administrations, are constantly called on to deal with
                    native reserves, native wars, and, alas! with native extermination. We cannot
                    forget that the landing of Columbus at Guanahani cost the lives of many millions
                    of American and African aborigines, and that the last Tasmanian, the last
                    Guancho, the last Beothus, have been “improved” off the face of earth. We can
                    hardly regard with unmixed feelings the prospect that the whole of the African
                    continent will soon be open to “European enterprise.”</p>
                <p>We will give an epitome of the debates which are carried on, striking off many
                    arguments for the sake of brevity. It will be but fair to give the first word to
                    a friend of the attacked and (must we say <hi rend="italic">1)</hi> the doomed
                    races.</p>
                <p>Mr Wallace, after having given a charming picture of some Malay communities which
                    he had visited, tells us: . . . “It is very remarkable that among people in a
                    very low stage of civilization we find some approach to such a perfect social
                    state. Each m⅛n scrupulously respects the rights of his fellow, and any
                    infraction of these rights rarely or neveι∙ takes place. In such community all
                    are nearly equal. There are none of these wide distinctions, of education and
                    ignorance, wealth and poverty, master and servant, which are the product of our
                    civilization; there is not that severe competition and struggle for existence or
                    for wealth which the dense population of civilized countries inevitably creates.
                    . . It is not too much to say that the mass of our populations have not at all
                    advanced beyond the savage code of morals, and have in many cases sunk below
                    it.”</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n646/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0646-0625"/>
                <p>Such pictures as that drawn by Mr Wallace are not unfrequent, and we might have
                    transcribed many pleasant descriptions of the peace, concord, and fraternity
                    reigning among the Todas, Aleutians, and some other primitive communities.</p>
                <p>Now comes tbe indictment by Lubbock, Tylor, and others. It is a heavy one.</p>
                <p>“The Veddahs of Ceylon are of opinion that it signifies little whether they do
                    right of wrong” (Davies). “To Australians the words good and bad had reference
                    to taste or bodily comfort, and did not convey any idea of right or wrong. . . .
                    The whole tendency of their system is to give every thing to the strong, to the
                    prejudice of the young, and more particularly to the detriment of women” (Lang).
                    . .“To believe,” says Sir George Grey, “that man ina savage state is endowed
                    with freedom, either of thought or action, is erroneous in the highest degree. .
                    . . Offences, in Fijian estimation, are light or grave according to the rank of
                    the offender. . . . In Tahiti the missionaries considered that no less than
                    two-thirds of the children were murdered by their parents.” . . . “Conscience
                    does not exist in Eastern Africa. Repentance expresses regret for missed
                    opportunities of mortal crime. Robbery constitutes an honourable man. Murder—the
                    more atrocious the midnight crime the better—makes the hero” (Burton).</p>
                <p>And is civilization any thing else? reply the others. Is it not the same struggle
                    for existence, but here on a gigantic scale? Is not our incessant battle for
                    life little short of wholesale murder? Is it not accompanied with the same envy,
                    with the same remorseless hatred, but under a thicker veil of perfidy and
                    hypocrisy? The Anthropological Society in London was told by the late Winwood
                    Reade that among the savages of Africa he had not seen anything as bad as the
                    pauperism, as the mass of misery and degradation to be found in our large
                    cities. The Anthropological Society of Paris was told by Mr Coudereau that in
                    our modern Europe the moral and intellectual development of the multitude is not
                    superior to that of the Dahomians. It was said by Mr Lavrof: “Between our
                    peasants and the primitive savages there is little difference. The religions and
                    the most advanced philosophies, which hold so large a place in the history of
                    mankind, have never been taken up in reality except by a minority numerically
                    insignificant. Were they profitless to the majority? No, they enriched it with
                    new amulets, new magical signs, new forms of divination. And when practical
                    results of science, such as the electric telegraph, enter into common use, their
                    real signification is as little understood by our country folks as it would be
                    by the Marquesas Islanders.”</p>
                <p>Although there may have been some exaggeration in the expression, the facts which
                    have been alleged on both sides are true; none is to be explained or trifled
                    away.</p>
                <p>Thus it is evident that among civilized men all is not satisfactory, while among
                    uncivilized all is not unsatisfactory. We are led to infer that civilization
                    amplifies and intensifies its elements. We had already occasion to note that
                    among ourselves the extremes are wider apart than among the barbarians. We can
                    say that we are at once materially much better and much worse off, and morally
                    much better and much worse than savages. And as to man himself it can be said
                    that of all ferocious brutes he is the most cruel, and of all gentle animals the
                    most affectionate.</p>
                <p>Cau material progress be disputed 1 An increased production of food has enabled
                    greater numbers of men to live; their daily ration of eatables and drinkables
                    has been increased; the quality of their vestments has been improved; most
                    people do not dwell in damp holes dug in the earth; they do not any longer roost
                    in the branches of trees. Not to speak of other comforts, the invention of
                    lucifer matches and of candles have been splendid achiev-ments in their day..·
                    That the intellectual progress has been prodigious from the time when our
                    forefathers were unable to count their own fingers, even of one hand, as Spix
                    and Martius tell of the Brazilian Wood Indians, to the transformation of
                    mathematics into a powerful scientific engine, to the calculations of Newton and
                    Laplace, to the wonders of spectral analysis, is a position nobody dares to
                    impugn.</p>
                <p>Material and intellectual development being satisfactorily settled, we touch upon
                    the vexed question of moral progress. Mr Wallace says—“While civilized
                    communities have increased vastly beyond the savage state in intellectual
                    achievements, we have not advanced equally in morals.” It may be said with equal
                    truth that this progress has been immense, and that it has been ridiculously
                    small,—immense, if we consider that there is an infinite distance between
                    nothing and something; very small indeed, if we gauge the precise amount of that
                    something. But that actual something will appear larger if we trace it to its
                    original state, of which we do not find the like among the present savages.
                    Their abject condition, abject as it has been depicted, is yet vastly superior
                    to that of the supposed primeval man. Everything tends to prove that mankind,
                    far from being born with a vivid sense of right and wrong’ as the common
                    doctrine will have it, had to evolve a moral sense by a long process. Through
                    ages man must have collected sensations of a peculiar sort, which at first were
                    slightly perceptible, and which, when accumulated, became that positive
                    perception, the most to be cared for of our inherited abilities. “The world is
                    very young,” said Mrs Mill, “and has only just begun to cast off injustice.” And
                    we hold to be survivals of antecedent ages the instances which show among
                    civilized and uncivilized an utter absence of morality, the lack of all fairness
                    and generosity. But in our times these instances are exceptions. On the average,
                    we know better than the Bechwana, who, being asked what it meant “to be good,”
                    was much puzzled, but finally answered, “To be good it is to possess a wife and
                    cows, and to steal one neighbour’s wife and cows;” or than the Pawnee, who said,
                    “He is a good man who is a hunter sly, crafty as a fox, daring and strong as a
                    wolf.”</p>
                <p>A last question arises—If moral progress be a positive fact, how could it be
                    denied by intelligent observers! First, progress is far from being always
                    evident. Its course runs not incessantly onwards in a straight line at a uniform
                    speed; it proceeds by irregular motions and sometimes by curved, by broken, or
                    even by spiral lines. Then we are apt to underrate a progress which has become a
                    habit. Tbe pleasure which an improvement gives us does not last longer than its
                    novelty. Very soon we become used to it—and then we become conscious that some
                    evil, which we had till then borne patiently, has grown insufferable, and must
                    be quickly done away with. We feel to the quick injustices and iniquities which
                    ages ago we would have submitted to without complaint,—of which we would have
                    been participants. Till mankind reaches some goal yet unknown to us, its motto
                    seems to be, Never to rest, never to be thankful.</p>
                <p>Thus ethnology may be considered as the science which builds up tbe history of
                    material and intellectual progress, which retraces the evolution of that
                    attribute, precious and delicate, of which Dr Maudsley has finely said,
                    “Morality, the last acquired faculty of man, is the first which he is liable to
                    lose.” *</p>
                <p>XI. The <hi rend="italic">Bibliography</hi> of ethnology may be regarded either
                    as very extensive or unimportant, according as we include all books in which
                    ethnological subjects are treated, or as we exclude all books which have not
                    ethnology for their primary object. Although possessed of immense territories in
                    copartnership with the sister sciences, ethnology holds but a limited province
                    of its own. This remark disposes of the largest mass of ethnographical
                    bibliography, in a work which contains bibliographies of other sciences.</p>
                <p>Works which take up the new science as a whole, and bring its various problems
                    together, cannot as yet be very numerous, especially if the demarcation between
                    ethnology and anthropology is maintained. In the preceding pages the titles of
                    most current books which are acknowledged as authoritative have been mentioned,
                    and for brevity’s sake will not be repeated. One of the most important
                    publications, the object of which is to set the science on a solid foundation,
                    is in progress. The <hi rend="italic">Descriptive Sociology</hi> commenced in
                    1867 by Mr Herbert Spencer, devised, classified, and arranged by him, is
                    compiled and abstracted by Messrs James Collier, Richard Scheppig, and David
                    Duncan. “The digests of materials, thus brought together, will supply the
                    student of social science with data, standing towards his conclusions in a
                    relation like that of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n647/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0647-0626"/> which accounts of the structures and functions of
                    different types of animals stand to the conclusion of the biologist. Until there
                    had been such systematic descriptions of different kinds of organisms as made it
                    possible to compare the connexions and forms and actions and modes of origin of
                    their parts, the science of life could make no progress; and in like manner,
                    before there can be reached in sociology generalizations worthy to be called
                    scientific, there must be definite accounts of the institutions and activities
                    of societies, of various types and in various stages of evolution, so arranged
                    as to furnish the means of ascertaining what social phenomena are habitually
                    associated.”</p>
                <p>In the three volumes of Adolf Bastian, <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mensch in</hi><hi rend="italic">der Geschichte,</hi> we have
                    already a kind of ethnological encyclopaedia, a mine of interesting facts,
                    collected from the most various sources. The author is a man of great reading,
                    and has himself travelled over the known world. But in 1860, when the book was
                    written, ethnology had not come of age, and instead of allowing the facts to
                    speak for themselves, he marshalled them in ungainly array to make them support
                    metaphysical theses.</p>
                <p>Amongst other important books relating to general ethnology are to be
                    named—Klemn’s <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Culturgesehichte</hi><hi rend="italic">der Menschheit;</hi> Caspari’s <hi

                    rend="italic">Ethnographie.</hi> Mr H. Bancroft’s <hi rend="italic">Native Races
                    of America</hi> and Meinike’s <hi rend="italic">Polynesia</hi> cover only parts
                    of our ground, but deserve exceptional record here, from the amount of
                    information which they afford.</p>
                <p>Ethnographical maps have been published by Berghaus, Schafarik, Fuchs, Czoernig,
                    Waitz, and others. In Germany, Denmark, and Sweden “maps of the finds” are in
                    progress. Dupont has given out important <hi rend="italic">Synoptic
                    Tables.</hi></p>
                <p>An ethnological feat, accomplished with the resources·of a national budget, that
                    of Austria, is the <hi rend="italic">Novara Expedition,</hi> which continues the
                    series of the great scientific travels, such as those of the “Beagle” and the
                    “Astrolabe,” and those accomplished by Cook, Forster, and Bougainville. The
                    relations given by travellers of what they have seen in foreign parts compose an
                    immense collection, which ethnographers have now to classify, and to sift
                    carefully in order to extract from it all that is useful. Modern descriptions
                    have their peculiar merits, but the value of earlier writers increases in
                    proportion as civilization, which is gradually imported everywhere, destroys the
                    old order of things, and gives an uniform tinge to the intellects and the
                    institutions of all races. Narrations of the mediaeval travellers, such as Marco
                    Polo and Ibn Batutah, were never found so interesting as they are now. We peruse
                    again the stories of the <hi rend="italic">Conquistadores,</hi> the barbarous
                    heroes of modem culture, and those of their twin brothers, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conquerors of Faith,</hi> the missionaries of the third Christian period,
                    Franciscans, Dominicans, Jesuits, whose work among the Indians of North and
                    South America, among the races of Africa, the Chinese, and the Japanese, is
                    related in the celebrated collection of the <hi rend="italic">Lettres
                    Édifiantes.</hi> Acosta, Lafitau, Charlevoix, Duhalde, Dobrizhoffer, have given
                    to the world much information, as have also the modern missionaries, chiefly
                    Protestants, among whom we may cite Williams, Ellis, Isenberg, Krapf, Moffat,
                    Callaway, Casalis, Hue, Eitel, Metz, and, above all, Livingstone.</p>
                <p>Although ethnology be a new science, it must not be considered as a new
                    invention. Thirty years ago nota few books were written in France and Germany,
                    which, expounding the “philosophy of history” then in vogue, would now-a-days
                    have expounded the “progress of culture.” The most antiquated, inspired by the
                    schools of Hegel and Schelling, contain less of history than of so-called
                    philosophy; the best, inspired rather by Herder and Vico, contain more of facts
                    than of metaphysics. Some of their authors were already ethnologists without
                    knowing it,—among them, Buckle, whose <hi rend="italic">Civilization in
                    England</hi> may be considered as one of the works which open the new period of
                    history, as modified by ethnology.</p>
                <p>The bibliography of a science giving its history in a condensed form, it must be
                    said that the corner-stones of any ethnographer’s library are the works of the
                    great historians Herodotus and Tacitus, and that the first expounder of the
                    modern principles of ethnology is the poet Lucretius.</p>
                <p>In contrast with the paucity of the publications which profess to give the
                    synthesis of ethnology, one may notice the superabundance of books, memoirs,
                    essays, and lesser works which discuss all kinds of ethnologic matters and
                    points of detail. Ethnology being in great favour with the public, there appear
                    in reviews and magazines, and even in the weekly and daily press, articles which
                    an ethnographer should diligently collect. A list of these various publications
                    appears every year in the Brunswick <hi rend="italic">Archiv</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fur</hi><hi rend="italic">Anthropologie.</hi> It is not, and could
                    not be, complete, but, such as it is, it meets most wants.</p>
                <p>The learned societies scattered throughout the civilized world act in scientific
                    matters as the lakes and reservoirs of the high lands do in the hydrographic
                    system; they collect and purify the waters of torrents and rivulets, they
                    regulate their outlet. In all European capitals, and in some other cities, as
                    Washington, Toronto, Rio Janeiro, Calcutta, Yeddo, Tiflis, Melbourne, Cairo,
                    savants and scientists meet in Academies, and, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi> of their diverse sections, ethnology comes in for a part of
                    their attention. Societies of anthropology and ethnology have constituted
                    themselves as separate bodies in London, Paris, Rome, Florence, Madrid, Vienna,
                    Berlin, Dantzig, Leipsic, Dresden, Munich, and Stuttgart.</p>
                <p>From their influence and the date of their foundation, the societies of Loudon
                    and Paris are to be ranked first. To the impulse given by the Société
                    Anthropologique are often ascribed the great strides recently made by
                    anthropology. This association was founded by men who mostly went to work with a
                    precision which originated in the methods of anatomy, physiology, archaeology,
                    palaeontology, and philology, the lights from which they projected
                    simultaneously on their favourite science. The vastness of Great Britain’s
                    colonial empire, the diversity of its climes, races, and creeds, the magnitude
                    of England’s commercial navy, which has become the general carrier of the world,
                    the facility with which Englishmen emigrate or travel abroad, have given to
                    ethnographic matters in this country an interest and an importance which they
                    have not elsewhere. Hence the directness and the variety of the communications
                    which are transmitted to the Anthropological Institute in London. The character
                    of the two societies reflects itself in their publications; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Revue d'</hi><hi rend="italic">Anthropologie,</hi> as edited by Dr
                    Paul Broca, has a preference for biology, and the <hi rend="italic">Journal of
                    the Institute,</hi> as edited by Mr John Evans and Major-General Lane Fox—the
                    best authorities on flints and on primitive weapons and implements—has a marked
                    preference for archaeology and the domestic arts. In almost every considerable
                    town of Germany there is some society affiliated to the large Deutsche
                    Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie, und Urgeschichte, which numbers
                    about 2000 members, and issues the <hi rend="italic">Archiv für
                    Anthropologie</hi> already named, edited by Dr Virchow, Eck, Lindenschmidt, with
                    many collaborateurs, mostly physicians and naturalists.</p>
                <p>Another publication, more ethnological in character, is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie,</hi> edited by the great traveller and most learned
                    man, Adolf Bastian. In the Scandinavian countries, and in Hungary, patriotism
                    fosters the prehistoric studies by the hope of throwing some light on the misty
                    figures of gigantic ancestors. Since the discovery of the lake-dwellings, by
                    which a sudden interest was awakened in archaeological pursuits, ethnology has
                    been a favourite study in Switzerland. Italy, which also had lakedwellings as
                    well as terramare, whole cities buried in the soil, &amp;c., and which teems
                    with precious remains of Roman, Greek, Etruscan, and Oriental origin, addicts
                    herself with some zeal to these researches, the results being given forth
                    especially in the <hi rend="italic">Archivio dell' Anlropologia e
                    Etrwlogia,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Paleo-ctnologia Italiana.</hi></p>
                <p>Not to be omitted are the <hi rend="italic">Tour du Monde,</hi> which has been
                    translated perhaps in every civilized language, and even into Japanese; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Globus</hi> of Hen <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> Karl Andree; the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ausland</hi> of Fr. von Hellwald; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Matériaux pour servir à l'histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">primitive</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et naturelle de l'homme</hi> of Cartailhac and Fontdouce. Many
                    publications which give occasionally valuable ethnographic information, but
                    which bestow on geography, history, and philology the largest share of their
                    attention, must be passed over. (E. RE.)</p>
