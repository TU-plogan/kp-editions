                    (1800-1882), chemist, was born on July 31, 1800, in Eschersheim, near
                    Frankfort-on-the Main. While attending the village school of Rödelheim, he
                    received valuable additional instruction from his father, a man of more than
                    ordinary acquirements. In 1812 the family removed to Frankfort, where he entered
                    the gymnasium, and by the kindness of a scientific friend, Dr Buch, was
                    introduced to the study of mineralogy, chemistry, and physics. He afterwards
                    studied medicine at Marburg and Heidelberg, graduating in that faculty at the
                    latter university. Having, on the advice of Leopold Gmelin, decided upon
                    devoting himself henceforth to chemistry, he completed his chemical education at
                    Stockholm, under Berzelius, in whose laboratory he worked for a considerable
                    time, and with whom, during his subsequent life, he maintained the most friendly
                    relations. While in Sweden he took part in a scientific expedition through
                    Norway, which made him acquainted with the brothers Brongniart and with Humphrey
                    Davy.</p>
                <p>After his return from Sweden in 1825, he accepted a call to Berlin as teacher of
                    chemistry in the then newly-erected “gewerbschule,” and remained there until
                    1832, when family affairs caused him to take up his abode in Cassel. In 1836
                    Wohler became professor of chemistry in the medical faculty of the university of
                    Göttingen, which office, in his case, was combined with that of
                    inspector-general of pharmacy for Hanover. He held his chair till his death,
                    which occurred, after a short illness, on the 23rd September 1882.</p>
                <p>Wohler’s career as a chemist extends over two generations. Some sixty years ago,
                    when the elementary nature of chlorine had just been established, and the
                    isolation of cyanogen was still a novelty, young Wohler already worked as an
                    investigator, the same Wohler who rejoiced with the chemists of to-day over the
                    synthesis of indigo. Of the world of chemical discoveries that lie between he
                    <hi rend="italic">magna</hi><hi rend="italic">pars</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fuit.</hi> Within the limits of the present article, however, it is impossible
                    to do more than indicate briefly the nature of some of his greater achievements.
                    Amongst these his discovery of cyanic acid, and what it led him to, occupy a
                    prominent place. From these investigations of his the science of organic
                    chemistry may be said to date.</p>
                <p>When, in 1828, Wohler prepared the ammonia salt of his acid, he was astonished to
                    find that the salt, although made by what appeared to be a straightforward
                    double decomposition, did not exhibit the character of an ammonia salt at all,
                    but turned out to be identical· with urea, a substance which heretofore had been
                    known only as one of the <hi rend="italic">organic</hi> components of urine.
                    Prior to this discovery a wide and impassable gulf had in the minds of chemists
                    separated the mineral from the organic kingdom. Inorganic bodies all appeared to
                    be derivable from their elements by a succession of acts of binary combination;
                    the full analysis of such a body contained in itself the full instruction for
                    its synthetical production in the laboratory. Organic substances, on the other
                    hand, were supposed to be things of an entirely different order: in them the few
                    elements which they all consist of were assumed to be united with one another,
                    each with each, in a mysterious manner, which could be brought about only by the
                    agency of “vital force.” Vital force, it was now seen, had nothing to do with
                    the formation of urea at any rate. The gulf was bridged over, and a great and
                    new morning full of the highest promise dawned over chemistry. If the promise
                    was more than fulfilled, if organic chemistry from a mere possibility developed
                    into a reality, we owe this chiefly to the great researches which were carried
                    out conjointly by Wohler and Liebig.</p>
                <p>One of the first, if not the first, of these was an investigation on the
                    oxygenated acids of cyanogen, which they published in 1830. In their research
                    they proved, both analytically and synthetically, that cyanic and cyanuric acid,
                    although distinct bodies, have the same elementary composition, and that the
                    former, when simply kept in a sealed-up tube, gradually passes wholly into a
                    porcelainlike neutral solid, cyamelide, which is widely different from either.
                    By these discoveries, and by Wohler’s synthesis of urea, the fact of isomerism
                    was firmly established. Compared with this great conquest their joint work on
                    mellitic acid (1830) and on sulphovinic acid (1831) appears small; it sinks into
                    insignificance when viewed in the light of their immortal researches on
                    bitter-almond oil and on uric acid.</p>
                <p>In 1832 bitter-almond oil was supposed to be to bitter almonds what a hundred and
                    one other essential oils are to their vegetable sources. Of its chemistry
                    nothing was known except the fact that it contains loosely combined prussic
                    acid, and that, when kept for a long time, it is liable to deposit a crystalline
                    solid, as various other essential oils do. Liebig and Wohler, being struck by
                    the absence from even powdered bitter almonds of the intense smell
                    characteristic of the oil, set about tracing the latter to its origin, and soon
                    solved the question. In 1830 Robiquet and Boutron-Charlard had succeeded in
                    extracting from bitter almonds a crystalline nitrogenous solid, soluble without
                    decomposition in alcohol and in water, whjch they called amygdaline. What Liebig
                    and Wohler found was that, when bitter-almond meal is mashed up with water, this
                    amygdaline, by the action of the water and a ferment (common to both sweet and
                    bitter almonds), breaks up into sugar, prussic acid, and bitter-almond oil. They
                    also succeeded in separating the prussic acid from the distilled oil, and found
                    the thus purified oil to be a non-poisonous liquid of the composition C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 7</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> O. This liquid, when
                    exposed to the air, readily takes up oxygen and assumes the form of a solid,
                    which is identical at the same time with the quasi-stearoptene of the oil and
                    with Scheele’s benzoic acid, C <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. When treated with
                    chlorine, the purified oil yields a chloride, C <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> H
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> O.C1,—the chlorine of which, by treatment with the

                    rend="subscript"> a</hi>. Water converts it into hydrochloric and benzoic acids.
                    In all these reactions the group C <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi> O holds together; it moves forwards and backwards as if
                    it were a compound element,—a common-place enough fact in the eyes of the
                    chemical student of 1882, but a most wonderful revelation to the chemist of
                    1832. Berzelius, who certainly was not much given to dealing in superlatives,
                    greeted the discovery in his <hi rend="italic">Jahresbericht</hi> as opening up
                    a new era in organic chemistry, and, rejecting the prosaic name of benzoyl which
                    Wohler and Liebig had given to their radical, proposed to name it proine, from
                    πpωt, early in the day, or orthrine, from <hi rend="italic">oρθρos,</hi> the
                    dawn.</p>
                <p>Equally important in a scientific sense, but greater as a piece of experimental
                    work, was their joint research on <hi rend="smallcaps">Uric Acid</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">{q.v∙').</hi> After their uric acid research the ways of Wohler

                    organic research; the former turned his attention more to inorganic
                    subjects,—not exclusively, however, as the well-known research on narcotine
                    (which was carried out in his laboratory, partly by himself partly by Blyth, and
                    published in 1848) is alone sufficient to prove.</p>
                <p>Amongst Wohler’s inorganic publications, a short notice on the improvements in
                    the preparation of potassium is significant as forming the small beginning of a
                    brilliant series of researches on the isolation of elementary substances and on
                    their properties, a subject for which he evidently had a great love, as he
                    always comes back to it in the intervals of other work. In 1827 he for the first
                    time succeeded in isolating aluminium, the metal of clay, by means of a method
                    which was soon found to be more generally applicable. Alumina, like many other
                    metallic oxides, is not reducible by electrolysis or by the action of charcoal
                    at any temperature. But, when heated with charcoal in chlorine gas, it passes
                    into the state of a volatile chloride. What Wohler found was that this chloride,
                    when heated with potassium or sodium, readily gives up its chlorine and assumes
                    the elementary form. The aluminium which Wohler thus obtained was a grey powder;
                    but in 1845 he succeeded in producing the metal in the shape of well-fused,
                    fully metallic globules. Wohler, on this second occasion, correctly ascertained
                    all the properties which everybody now knows to be characteristic of this metal;
                    and it is as well to add that where Wohler’s aluminium differed from what now
                    occurs in commerce under this name it differed to its own advantage. That Wohler
                    should not have seen the practical importance of his discovery is not to be
                    credited; if he never suggested an attempt to manufacture the metal
                    industrially, that is only the natural consequence of the circumstances in which
                    he was placed.</p>
                <p>The earlier aluminium research was followed in 1828 by the isolation of beryllium
                    and yttrium. These earlier metal reductions fall into the Berlin period. While
                    in Cassel he worked out processes for the manfacture of nickel free from
                    arsenic, and this laid the foundation for what is now a flourishing chemical
                    industry in Germany. The several methods for the analysis of nickel and cobalt
                    ores which he describes in his <hi rend="italic">Mineral-Analyse.</hi> appear to
                    be an incidental outcome of this work. This subject was one of his favourite
                    topics; as late as 1877 we see him coming back to it in the publication of a
                    short process for the separation of nickel and cobalt from arsenic and iron.</p>
                <p>In 1849 metallic titanium arrested his attention. Since the days of Wollaston
                    those beautiful copper-like cubes which are occasionally met with in blown-out
                    blast furnaces had been supposed to be metallic titanium pure and simple. Wohler
                    observed that the reputed metal, when fused with caustic alkali, emitted
                    torrents of ammonia, and on further inquiry ascertained the crystals to be a
                    ternary compound, containing the elements of a nitride and of a cyanide of the
                    metal. In pursuance of this research Wohler taught us how to prepare real
                    titanium and really pure titanic acid.</p>
                <p>In 1854 Deville’s energetic attempts to produce aluminium industrially caused
                    Wohler to turn his attention again to this early and almost forgotten child of
                    his genius. His first incentive, no doubt, was the natural and just desire to
                    claim his right as the real discoverer of what Deville, in his ignorance of
                    foreign scientific work, quite honestly thought he had been the first to find
                    out. This dispute came to a very satisfactory issue: Deville, after a little
                    pardonable hesitation, fully acknowledged Wohler’s priority, and the two
                    henceforth were friends, and worked together.</p>
                <p>The first fruit of this happy union was a memorable joint research (published in
                    1856 and 1857), which led to their discovery of an adamantine and of a
                    graphitoidal (in addition to the long known amorphous) modification of boron.
                    This graphitoidal species subsequently, in their own hands, proved to be a
                    mistake; but the adamantine modification lives to this day as a true analogue of
                    ordinary (carbon) diamond.</p>
                <p>From boron to silicon is an easy transition, so we need not wonder at finding
                    Wohler, in 1857, engaged (conjointly with the physicist Buff) in a research on
                    new compounds of silicon. On electrolysing a solution of common salt with
                    silicon-containing aluminium as a positive electrode, they obtained a
                    self-inflammable gas which they recognized as hydrogen contaminated with the
                    previously unknown hydride of silicon, SiH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, which
                    body Wohler subsequently, with the co-operation of Martius, obtained in a state
                    of greater purity. Wohler and Buff also obtained, though in an impure state,
                    what were subsequently recognized by Friedel and Ladenburg as silicon-chloroform
                    and as silicon-formic anhydride.</p>
                <p>Space does not allow of more than a mere reference to Wohler’s researches on
                    metallic or semimetallic nitrides. What we know of this as yet little understood
                    class of bodies, with barely an exception, came out of his laboratory, if it was
                    not done by himself in the strict sense of the word. And only a reference can be
                    made to the numerous processes which Wohler, in the course of his long
                    laboratory practice, has worked out for the preparation of pure chemicals, and
                    for the execution of exact analytical separations. He had better work to do than
                    to take up analytical problems for their own sake; but what he did in this
                    direction incidentally amounts to a great deal. The analysis of meteorites was
                    one of his favourite specialties,—one of his results being the discovery of
                    organic matter in a meteorite which he examined in 1864.</p>
                <p>As a teacher Wohler ranks with Liebig and Berzelius. In a sense he was the
                    greatest of the three. Berzelius never had the opportunity to teach large
                    numbers of students in his laboratory; and. Liebig lacked the many-sidedness so
                    characteristic of the Göttingen laboratory as long as it really was under
                    Wohler’s personal direction. One student might wish to work on organic
                    chemistry, another on minerals, a third on metallurgy, a fourth on rare
                    elements; let them all go to Wohler, and all, as well as the fifth or sixth,
                    would find themselves in the right place. That Wohler in these circumstances was
                    able to do much literary work is truly marvellous. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grundriss der Chemie,</hi> which he published anonymously at first, has passed
                    through many editions, and been translated into various foreign
                    languages,—‘never, unfortunately, into English. A more valuable teaching book
                    still, and more unique in its character, is his excellent <hi rend="italic"

                    translations. To a man like him the compilation of either book probably gave
                    little trouble; what must have taken up a very large portion of his valuable
                    time are his translations of Berzelius’s <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch der
                    Chemie,</hi> and of all the successive volumes of Berzelius’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jahresbericht,</hi> which only thus became really available to the scientific
                    world at large. From 1838, too, Wohler was one of the editors of Liebig’s <hi
