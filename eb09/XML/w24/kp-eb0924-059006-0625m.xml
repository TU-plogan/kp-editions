                    the Bengal establishment of the East India Company. Instead of entering the
                    regular medical service, however, his knowledge of chemistry and the practical
                    analysis of metals caused him to be attached to the mint at Calcutta, where he
                    was for a time associated with John Leyden, the Scottish poet and Orientalist.
                    It was not long before he himself became deeply interested in the ancient
                    language and literature of India, and attracted the attention of Henry T.
                    Colebrooke, the famous Sanskrit scholar, on whose recommendation he was in 1811
                    appointed secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. In 1813 he published the
                    Sanskrit text —with a graceful, if somewhat free, translation in English rhymed
                    verse—of Kalidasa’s charming lyrical poem, the <hi rend="italic">Meghadüta,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Cloud-Messenger</hi> (2d ed. 1843, 3d ed. 1867). He then
                    undertook the arduous task of preparing the first <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sanskrit-English Dictionary</hi> from materials compiled by native scholars for
                    the college of Fort William, supplemented by his own researches. The work
                    appeared in 1819, prefaced with an excellent general survey of Sanskrit
                    lexicology. A second, much enlarged, edition, but without the introduction, was
                    published in 1832, and has recently been reprinted at Calcutta. The appearance
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> at once placed Wilson in the first rank
                    of Sanskrit scholars; and, while patiently pursuing his study of the writings
                    and institutions of ancient India, he became one of the most valuable
                    contributors to the <hi rend="italic">Asiatic Researches</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Calcutta Quarterly.</hi> Among his more important <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0626-0591"/> contributions to these journals may be mentioned
                    essays on the “Medical and Surgical Sciences, of the Hindus” (1823); the “Hindu
                    History of Kashmir” (1824); “Hindu Fiction” (1825); and his masterly “Account of
                    the Religious Sects of the Hindus, their History, Doctrines, and Practices”
                    (1828-32). In 1827 he published <hi rend="italic">Select Specimens of the
                    Theatre of the Hindus,</hi> in 3 vols., in which, besides a very full and highly
                    appreciative survey of Indian dramaturgy, which still remains the standard
                    authority on the subject, he offered elegant translations of six complete plays
                    and short accounts of twenty-three others. This work was reprinted in London in
                    1835, in 2 vols., and again in Wilson’s <hi rend="italic">Collected Works</hi>
                    (vols. xi. and xii.). Of considerable importance, alike to Sanskrit and
                    vernacular students, and to Eastern antiquarians generally, was his next
                    publication, the <hi rend="italic">Mackenzie Collection</hi> (2 vols., 1828; 2d
                    ed. in one vol., 1882), being a descriptive catalogue of the extensive
                    collection of Oriental, especially South Indian, MSS. and antiquities made by
                    Col. Colin Mackenzie, and purchased from his widow by the Indian Government, now
                    deposited partly in the India Office, London, and partly at Madras. Neither his
                    extensive literary researches, however, nor the official duties of an assay
                    master and mint secretary, at any time prevented Wilson from taking a prominent
                    part in all social amusements of the Anglo-Indian community of Calcutta,
                    especially in musical and theatrical entertainments. His interest in political
                    and economic affairs in India is shown by his <hi rend="italic">Historical
                    Sketch of the First Burmese War, with Documents, Political and Geographical</hi>
                    (1827, reprinted in London), and his <hi rend="italic">Review of the External
                    Commerce of Bengal from 1813 to 1828</hi> (1830), as well as by his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of British India from 1805 to 1835,</hi> in continuation
                    of Mill’s <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> 3 vols. (1844-48), and largely based
                    on his personal impressions and recollections. He also acted for many years as
                    secretary to the committee of public instruction. As such, he not only organized
                    and superintended the studies of the Hindu College from the time of its
                    establishment, but took a leading part in the promotion of public education
                    among the natives, and the introduction of the English language and European
                    science, although, as one of the staunchest opponents, on grounds of expediency
                    and feasibleness, of the proposal that English should be made the sole medium of
                    instruction in native schools, he became for a time the object of bitter
                    attacks. Long, however, before this controversy came to an end he had been
                    called away to a different sphere of scholarly activity. In 1832 the university
                    of Oxford, in recognition of his services to Oriental scholarship, selected Dr
                    Wilson to be the first occupant of the newly founded Boden chair of Sanskrit.
                    Shortly after his return to England he was also appointed librarian to the East
                    India Company. He now found himself in a position singularly favourable to
                    learned research and literary pursuits; and the long record of his subsequent
                    work shows that he made the best of his opportunities. He immediately joined the
                    Royal Asiatic Society, and, succeeding Colebrooke as director (in 1837), he was
                    the very soul of the society up to the time of his death, scarcely a number of
                    its journal appearing without some interesting contribution from his pen. His
                    death took place at London on 8th May 1860.</p>
                <p>Of these contributions we need only mention here his <hi rend="superscript">
                    ,,</hi> Historical Sketch of the Kingdom of Pãndya” (1836), based on documents
                    contained in the Mackenzie collection; the continuation of his “Analysis of the
                    Puränas” (1836), begun in the <hi rend="italic">Bengal Society's Journal</hi>
                    (1832); “Civil and Religious Institutions of the Sikhs” and “Religious Festivals
                    of the Hindus” (1848); “Analysis and Revised Translation of the Rock
                    Inscriptions of Kapur di Giri” (1850); and his popular lecture “On the Present
                    State of the Cultivation of Oriental Literature” (1852). Hardly less numerous,
                    and certainly not less valuable, are his separate publications during this
                    period, by which important light was thrown on many departments of Eastern
                    inquiry. The most noteworthy of these works are the text of, and commentary on,
                    the Sãnkhyakãrikã (1837), being a very popular summary of the Sãnkhya
                    philosophy, with a translation (of the text by Colebrooke, and the commentary by
                    Wilson); translation of the <hi rend="italic">Vishnu Parana</hi> (1840, 2d
                    annotated ed. by F. E. Hall; <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> vols. vi. -x. ); <hi
                    rend="italic">Ariana Antiqua,</hi><hi rend="italic">Antiquities and Coins of
                    Afghanistan</hi> (1841); edition of <hi rend="italic">Basakumãraeharita</hi>
                    (1846); <hi rend="italic">Glossary of Indian Revenue, Judicial, &lt;kc.,
                    Terms</hi> (1855); <hi rend="italic">Translation of the First Four Ashtakas</hi>
                    (rather more than one-half) <hi rend="italic">of the Sacred Hymns of the
                    Rigveda,</hi> 3 vols., 1850-57; <hi rend="italic">Grammar of the Sanskrit
                    Language,</hi> in several editions; and two lectures on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Religious Practices and Opinions of the Hindus,</hi> delivered at Oxford in
                    1840. In the <hi rend="italic">Collected Works</hi> (12 vols.) the more valuable
                    of his papers and lectures form three volumes of essays on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sanskrit Literature</hi> and two volumes of essays on <hi rend="italic">The
                    Religion of the Hindus,</hi> edited by Dr R. Rost. While in point of accurate
                    scholarship Wilson was perhaps scarcely the equal of Colebrooke, any deficiency
                    in this respect is far more than counterbalanced by the many-sidedness of his
                    genius, by literary powers of a very high order, by his admirable artistic
                    taste, and by broad human sympathies, which enabled him fully to appreciate and
                    enjoy the merits and beauties of the ancient Indian literature. A considerable
                    number of Sanskrit MSS. (540 vols.) collected by Wilson in India are now in the
                    Bodleian.</p>
