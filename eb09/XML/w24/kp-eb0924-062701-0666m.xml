                    (1434-1519), an able painter of the school of Franconia, of which Nuremberg,
                    where he was born in 1434, was the chief artistic centre. Little is known of his
                    private life beyond the fact that in 1472 he married the widow of the painter
                    Hans Pleyden-wurff, whose son Wilhelm worked as an assistant to his stepfather.
                    The importance of Wohlgemuth as an artist rests, not only on his own individual
                    paintings, but also on the fact that he was the head of a large workshop, in
                    which many different branches of the fine arts were carried on by a great number
                    of pupil-assistants, including Albert Dürer (see vol. vii. pp. 555-56). In this
                    <hi rend="italic">atelier</hi> not only large altar-pieces and other sacred
                    paintings were executed, but also elaborate retables in carved wood, consisting
                    of crowded subjects in high relief, richly decorated with gold and colour, such
                    as pleased the rather doubtful Teutonic taste of that time (see p. 648 <hi
                    rend="italic">infra).</hi> Wood-engraving was also carried on in the same
                    workshop, the blocks being cut from Wohlgemuth’s designs, many of which are
                    remarkable for their vigour and clever adaptation to the special necessities of
                    the technique of woodcutting. Two large and copiously illustrated books have
                    woodcuts supplied by Wohlgemuth and his stepson Wilhelm Pleydenwurff. The first
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Schatzkammer</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">wahren</hi><hi rend="italic">Reichthümer des Heils,</hi> printed
                    by Koberger in 1491; the other is the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mundi,</hi> by Schedel, 1493-94, a sort of encyclopaedia, usually
                    known as the <hi rend="italic">Nuremberg Chronicle,</hi> which attained a very
                    high degree of popularity at the time, and is now highly valued, not for the
                    text, but· for its remarkable collection of spirited engravings.</p>
                <p>Among the paintings ascribed to Wohlgemuth a large number are clearly the work of
                    less able assistants, but those by the hand of the master himself possess merit
                    of a very high order, in their rich colour, powerful drawing, and refined
                    delicacy of finish. The earliest known work by Wohlgemuth is a retable
                    consisting of four panels, dated 1465, now in the Munich gallery, a decorative
                    work of much beauty. In 1479 he painted the retable of the high altar in the
                    church of St Mary at Zwickau, which still exists, receiving for it the large sum
                    of 1400 gulden. One of his finest and largest works is the great retable painted
                    for the church of the Austin friars at Nuremberg, now moved into the museum; it
                    consists of a great many panels, with figures of those saints whose worship was
                    specially popular at Nuremberg. In 1501 Wohlgemuth was employed to decorate the
                    town-hall at Goslar with a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0667-0628"/> large series of paintings; some on the ceiling
                    are on panel, and others on the walls are painted thinly in tempera on canvas.
                    As a portrait-painter he enjoyed much repute, and some of his works of this
                    class are very admirable for their realistic vigour and minute finish. Outside
                    Germany Wohlgemuth’s paintings are scarce: the Royal Institution at Liverpool
                    possesses two good examples,—Pilate Washing his Hands, and the Deposition from
                    the Cross, parts probably of a large altarpiece. During the last ten years of
                    his life Wohlgemuth appears to have produced little by his own hand. One of his
                    latest paintings is the retable at Schwabach, executed in 1508, the contract for
                    which still exists. He died at Nuremberg in 1519.</p>
