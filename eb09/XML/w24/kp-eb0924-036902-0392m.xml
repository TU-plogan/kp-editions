                    uncles Horace and James Smith, which was followed soon afterwards by designs to
                    some of the papers of Washington Irving. In 1830 he gained the silver palette of
                    the Society of Arts; and in 1835, aided by Wilkie and Chantrey, he entered the
                    schools of the Royal Academy, having in the previous year contributed to its
                    exhibition his portrait of Mr O. Smith, the comedian, in his character of Don
                    Quixote. In 1836 he went to Rome, where in 1838 he gained a silver medal from
                    the Academy of St Luke for his Cimabue and Giotto, which in the following year
                    was exhibited at the Royal Academy. The young artist now turned his thoughts to
                    fresco-painting, which he studied under Cornelius at Munich. In 1843 he
                    forwarded his Boadicea Animating the Britons previous to the Last Battle against
                    the Romans to the competition for the decoration of the Houses of Parliament,—a
                    work upon which he was afterwards engaged, having in 1853 been directed by the
                    fine art commissioners to execute eight subjects in the corridor of the House of
                    Commons. The success of his Dr Johnson in Lord Chesterfield’s Ante-Room—now in
                    the National Gallery, along with the Disgrace of Lord Clarendon (the smaller
                    picture) (1846), the South Sea Bubble (1847), and James II. receiving the News
                    of the Landing of the Prince of Orange (1850)—secured his election as an
                    associate of the Royal Academy in 1847, and in 1855 he gained full academic
                    honours. Among the more important of his other works may be named Charlotte
                    Corday Led to Execution (1852), the Last Sleep of Argyll (1854), the Emperor of
                    the French Receiving the Order of the Garter (1859), painted for the queen, the
                    Antechamber at Whitehall during the Dying Moments of Charles II. (1861), Dr
                    Johnson’s First Interview with John Wilkes (1865), and the Royal Family of
                    France in the Temple, painted in 1851, and usually considered the artist’s
                    masterpiece. For several years before his death Ward suffered from ill-health
                    and mental depression, which led to temporary aberration of intellect. He died
                    at Windsor, on January 15, 1879.</p>
                <p>Ward’s pictures have been extremely popular, and the engravings which reproduce
                    so many of them have had a wide circulation. His works are generally interesting
                    in subject; they tell their story with point and clearness, are correct and
                    learned in costume, and full of observation and character. In purely technical
                    qualities, in lighting, tone, colour, and draughtsmanship, they are more
                    frequently open to exception.</p>
