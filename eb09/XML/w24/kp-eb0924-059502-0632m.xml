                    westsouth-west of London. The feature of the town is the ancient minster. As it
                    now stands, it is a fine cruciform structure of various styles from Early Norman
                    to Perpendicular, and consists of a central lantern tower, nave and choir with
                    aisles, transepts without aisles, western or bell tower, north and south
                    porches, crypt, and vestry or sacristy, with the library over it. Its maximum
                    length is 182 feet, and its maximum breadth 102. The interior was restored in
