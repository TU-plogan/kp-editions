                    type="authorial"><p>The origin of the name is disputed, though the once popular
                    derivation from “Wirth am Berg” is universally rejected. Some authorities derive
                    it from an old proper name Wirnto or Wirtino, others from a Celtic place-name
                    Virodunum or Verdunum. Wirten-berc, Wirtenberg, Wirtemberc are early forms.
                    Wirtemberg was long current, and in the latter half of the 16th century
                    Würtemberg and Württemberg appear. The last was adopted in 1806 as the official
                    spelling, though Würtemberg, the ordinary English spelling, is also common, and
                    occurs sometimes in official documents and even on coins issued after that
                    date.</p></note> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Württemberg,</hi> a European kingdom,
                    forms a tolerably compact mass in the south-west angle of the German empire, of
                    which it is the third factor in point of area and the fourth in point of
                    population. In the south it is cleft by the long narrow territory of
                    Hohenzollern, belonging to Prussia; and it encloses six small enclaves of Baden
                    and Hohenzollern, while it owns seven small exclaves within the limits of these
                    two states. It lies between 47° 34' 48" and 49° 35' 17" N. lat., and between 8°
                    15' and 10° 30' E. long. Its greatest length from north to south is 140 miles;
                    its greatest breadth is 100 miles; its boundaries, almost entirely arbitrary,
                    have a circuit of 1116 miles; and its total area is 7531 square miles, or about
                    one twentyeighth of the entire empire. It is bounded on the E. by Bavaria, and
                    on the other three sides by Baden, with the exception of a short distance on the
                    S., where it touches Hohenzollern and the Lake of Constance. For administrative
                    purposes the country is divided into the four circles (“kreise”) of the Neckar
                    in the north-west, the Jagst in the north-east, the Black Forest in the
                    southwest, and the Danube in the south-east.</p>
                <p>Wurtemberg forms part of the South-German tableland, and is hilly rather than
                    mountainous. In fact the undulating fertile terraces of Upper and Lower Swabia
                    may be taken as the characteristic parts of this agricultural country. The usual
                    estimates return one-fourth of the entire surface as “plain,” less than
                    one-third as “mountainous,” and nearly one-half as “hilly.” The average
                    elevation above the sea-level is 1640 feet; the lowest point is at Böttingen
                    (410 feet), where the Neckar quits the country; the highest is the Katzenkopf
                    (3775 feet), on the Hornisgrinde, on the western border.</p>
                <p>The chief mountains are the Black Forest on the west, the Swabian Jura or Rauhe
                    Alb, stretching across the middle of the country from south-west to north-east,
                    and the Adelegg Mountains in the extreme south-east, adjoining the Algau Alps in
                    Bavaria. The Rauhe Alb or Alp slopes gradually down into the plate.iu on its
                    south side, but on the north it is sometimes rugged and steep, and has its line
                    broken by isolated projecting hills. The highest summits are in the south-west,
                    viz., the Lemberg (3326 feet), Ober-Hohenberg (3312 feet), and Plettenberg (3293
                    feet). In a narrower sense the name Rauhe Alb is reserved for the eastern
                    portion only of the Swabian Jura, lying between Hohenzollern and Bavaria; in the
                    narrowest sense of all it is applied to a single group near Reutlingen. Most of
                    the isolated summits above referred to (none of which are over 2630 feet)
                    project from this eastern section; among them are the hills of Hohenstaufen,
                    Teck, Mossingen, and Hohenzollern.</p>
                <p>The Black Forest (Germ. <hi rend="italic">Schwarzwald),</hi> a mountain group or
                    system deriving its name from the dark foliage of its pine forests, lies partly
                    in Würtemberg and partly in Baden. Its general shape is that of a triangle, its
                    base resting on the Rhine between the Lake of Constance and Basel, and its apex
                    pointing north. It stretches along the east bank of the Rhine from Basel to
                    Durlach, at a distance varying from 4 to 15 miles from the river, and parallel
                    to the Vosges range on the west bank. The south, west, and north faces of the
                    group are rugged and steep, but on the east it loses its mountainous character,
                    and melts so gradually into the bounding plateau that it is difficult to assign
                    it definite limits on that side. The total length of the Black Forest range is
                    93 miles, its breadth varies from 46 to 13 miles, and its area is 1913 square
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n741/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0741-0700"/> miles. The average elevation decreases from south
                    to north from 3280 feet to 2296 feet. The hills do not rise in peaks but in
                    rounded summits and plateau-like masses and combs, separated from each other by
                    the deep ravines of the streams.</p>
                <p>The south part of the Black Forest was called <hi rend="italic">Mons</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Abnoba</hi> by the Romans, and the whole was known to them from
                    the 3rd century as <hi rend="italic">Silva</hi><hi rend="italic">Marciana.</hi>
                    The name <hi rend="italic">Silva Nigra</hi> appears in mediaeval Latin. This
                    retired district, always somewhat overshadowed by the majestic beauties of the
                    neighbouring Swiss Alps, was long unvisited and almost unheard of. Within
                    comparatively recent years, however, it has become a favourite resort for summer
                    visitors and tourists. Though not boasting any very striking mountain scenery,
                    the Black Forest includes romantic and wild vales as well as smiling and
                    picturesque valleys; and the beauty of its streams and waterfalls, its fragrant
                    and shady forests, the quaintness of its sequestered villages, and the primitive
                    simplicity of its inhabitants, who still retain their peculiar costume, are all
                    objects of interest.</p>
                <p>About two-thirds of the Black Forest belongs to Baden and the remaining third to
                    Wiirtemberg; but it is convenient to disregard the political boundaries, and to
                    consider it as formed of the Southern or Upper and the Northern or Lower Black
                    Forest, separated from each other by the deep and romantic gorge of the Kinzig.
                    The principal rocks are stratified gneiss and eruptive granite, though some of
                    the summits are porphyritic. In the north and east those rocks are covered with
                    a tolerably thick layer of variegated and red sandstone, which also appears,
                    though not so abundantly, in the south and west. The kernel of the Southern
                    Black Forest is the Feldberg (4803 feet), the highest point in the range, round
                    which the other summits and masses are grouped. Among the chief summits are the
                    Belchen (4640 feet), the Erz-kasten (4218 feet), the Hochkopf (4150 feet), and
                    the Kandelberg (4077 feet). The average height of the crest in this division of
                    the forest is about 3300 feet. The chief streams are the Wutach, Alb, Wehra,
                    Wiese, Neumagen, and Dreisam, all tributaries of the Rhine, and the Brege and
                    Bregach, regarded as the head-waters of the Danube. On the eastern slopes lie
                    the Feldsee, Titisee, Schuchsee, and numerous other small lakes, most of them in
                    bleak and solitary situations among the extensive moors. The waterfall on the
                    Gutach, at Triberg, is 170 feet high. The central height of the Northern Black
                    Forest is the Hornisgrinde (3825 feet), on the border between Wiirtemberg and
                    Baden. Other heights are the Hohe Ochenskopf (3460 feet), the Hohloh (3225
                    feet), and the Kniebishohen (3180 feet), with the Kniebis Pass. The average
                    height of the crest is 2470 feet. The principal streams are the Kinzig and Murg,
                    which join the Rhine, and the Glatt, Enz, and Nagold, which fall into the
                    Neckar. The eastern slopes of this division also are sprinkled with lakes, the
                    chief of which are the gloomy Mummelsee and the Wildesee.</p>
                <p>As the name implies, the Schwarzwald is largely covered with forests, chiefly of
                    pines and firs. Oaks, beeches, &amp;c., also flourish, especially in the valleys
                    and towards the west. The timber trade and. its cognate industries are thus the
                    chief resources of the inhabitants. The felled timber is floated in the form of
                    rafts down the numerous streams to the Neckar or Rhine, where larger rafts are
                    formed, sometimes requiring a crew of several hundred men, for the voyage to
                    Holland, the principal market. The increase of railways has, however,
                    considerably diminished the quantity of wood thus exported by water; and
                    numerous sawmills within the limits of the forest are engaged in cutting timber
                    into planks for export by rail. Perhaps, however, the most characteristic
                    industry of the Blick Forest is the manufacture of wooden clocks (often spoken
                    of as “Dutch clocks”). This industry has long flourished in the district, and
                    has recently been organized and extended, while considerable factories have been
                    established at Furtwangen, Triberg, and other chief centres. Clocks to the value
                    of about £2,000,000 are said to be annually produced, and 1400 persons are
                    engaged in their manufacture. Musical-boxes are also extensively made here.
                    Straw-plaiting occupies a large number of girls and women, especially in winter;
                    and glass-blowing, charcoal-burning, and potash-boiling are also carried on.
                    Agriculture is of no great importance, as the soil is poor, and the crops
                    scanty. Cattle are kept in considerable numbers; they are driven up to the
                    mountains in summer, and return to the valleys in autumn. The mining industry is
                    quite insignificant; coal is worked to a small extent in <hi rend="superscript">
                    a</hi> P, , <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    Rotliegenden. In spite of their industrial resources, aided by the wealth
                    introduced by tourists and visitors to the numerous mineral springs, the
                    population of the Black Forest is too numerous to find supportat home, and large
                    numbers go abroad as pedlars, merchants, servants, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The climate of the Schwarzwald is severe, but healthy. The forests cease at 4250
                    feet, and are succeeded by scanty grass and herbs. On many of the summits snow
                    lies for ten months in the year, yet m some of the valleys vines, almonds, and
                    chestnuts ripen. Wild boars, deer, hares, foxes, and various kinds of game are
                    found, lhe carnage-roads follow the valleys, but innumerable footpaths ⅛ad in
                    all directions through the magnificent woods. The Black Forest railway, opened
                    in 1873, ascends the picturesque valleys of the Kinzig and Gutach by means of
                    bridges, viaducts, and tunnels, often of the boldest construction.</p>
                <p>To the south of the Rauhe Alb the plateau of Upper Swabia stretches to the Lake
                    of Constance and eastwards across the Iller into Bavaria. Between the Alb and
                    the Black Forest in the north-west are the fertile terraces of Lower Swabia,
                    continued on the north-east by those of Franconia.</p>
                <p>About 70 per cent, of Wiirtemberg belongs to the basin of the Rhine, and about 30
                    per cent, to that of the Danube. The principal river is the Neckar, which flows
                    northward for 186 miles through the country to join the Rhine, and with its
                    tributaries drains 57 per cent, of the kingdom. On the west it receives the Enz,
                    swelled by the Nagold, and on the east the Fils, Rems, Murr, Kocher, and Jagst.
                    The Danube flows from east to west across the south half of Wiirtemberg, a
                    distance of 65 miles, a small section of which is in Hohenzollern. Just above
                    Ulm it is joined by the Iller, which forms the boundary between Bavaria and M
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> urtemberg for about 35 miles. The Tauber in the
                    north-east joins the Main; the Argen and Schüssen in the south enter the Lake of
                    Constance. The lakes of Wiirtemberg, with the exception of those in the Black
                    Forest, all lie south of the Danube. The largest is the Federsee (640 acres)
                    near Buchau. About one-fifth of the Lake of Constance is reckoned to belong to
                    Wiirtemberg. Mineral springs are abundant; the most famous spa is Wildbad, in
                    the Black Forest.</p>
                <p>The climate is temperate,—colder among the mountains in the south than in the
                    north. The mean temperature varies at different points from 43° to 50° F. The
                    abundant forests induce much rain, most of which falls in summer. The soil is on
                    the whole fertile and well-cultivated; and for many centuries agriculture was
                    almost the only resource of the inhabitants. Middle and Lower Swabia are the
                    most fertile districts. The removal of burdens and restrictions in 1848 and
                    1849, and intelligent state-aid, combined with the formation of agricultural
                    societies, have encouraged farming, but the practice of parcelling the land in
                    minute patches among the members of the communities still retards progress.
                    According to returns made in 1878, 45·2 per cent, of the land was under
                    agriculture, 30 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 under forest, 19 <hi

                    unproductive. Grain is produced in excess of the home demand.</p>

                <p>Pease, maize, rape, hemp, flax, hops, and chicory are also produced in
                    considerable quantity; tobacco is grown in the valley of the Neckar. Wiirtemberg
                    is very rich in fruit trees of various kinds, and market-gardening flourishes
                    near the larger towns and in the Remsthal. In 1880 there were 35,000 acres under
                    vegetables. The cultivation of the vine is a highly important industry iu the
                    valleys of the Neckar and some of the other streams. In the period 1827-1882 the
                    average annual area under vines was 63,327 acres, yielding 5,701,454 gallons of
                    wine, worth £411,700. The best year was 1835, when 22,303,006 gallons were
                    produced, the worst was 1854, with 1,696,376 gallons. Among the best Wiirtemberg
                    wines are those known as Rothenberger, Türkheimer, Lämmler, Brodwasser,
                    Käsberger, Elpinger, Schalksteiner, Weinsberger, Markelsheimer, Verrenberger,
                    and Lindelberger. About one-third of the entire country is under forest, the
                    greater proportion of which consist of deciduous trees (oaks, beeches, &amp;c.).
                    Coniferous trees are most numerous in the Black Forest, in Upper Swabia, and in
                    the circle of Jagst. Most of the forests belong to the state or to public
                    companies, and are carefully and skilfully managed. Large tracts in the Black
                    Forest are in the hands of the “Schiflergesellschaft,” a very ancient guild of
                    timber merchants.</p>
                <p>In 1883 Wiirtemberg contained 96,885 horses, 904,139 cattle, 550,104 sheep,
                    292,206 swine, and 54,876 goats. The breeding of <pb break="no"

                    Government, which maintains several stud-farms. Cattle, bred for export, are
                    reared mainly in the Jagst and Danube divisions, sheep on and near the Alb.</p>
                <p>Salt and iron are the only minerals of industrial importance found in Würtemberg,
                    and both are worked almost entirely by Government. There are five Government
                    salt-works (the chief of which are Friedriehshall and Wilhelmsglück), employing
                    together 425 hands. In 1879-80 970,084 tons of salt were produced·, two-thirds
                    by mining. The salt industry only began to be of importance at the beginning of
                    the present century. The iron industry on the other hand is of great antiquity,
                    though it is much hampered by the entire absence of coal mines in Würtemberg.
                    The chief fuel used in smelting the iron is wood or charcoal. Iron is mined at
                    Neuenbürg, Freudenstetten, and, to a very limited extent, in the Black Forest.
                    In 1877-80 15,546 tons of ore λvere raised by 110 miners, yielding about 33 per
                    cent, of raw metal. Cement, gypsum, grindstones, millstones, building-stones,
                    &amp;c., are also found. The annual value of the minerals of all kinds raised in
                    Würtemberg has been roughly estimated at about £350,000.</p>
                <p>Until the close of the Napoleonic wars, Würtemberg was almost exclusively an
                    agricultural and bucolic country; but since that period it has turned its
                    attention to trade and manufactures, and perhaps now stands second only to
                    Saxony among the German states iu commercial and industrial activity. The want
                    of coal is naturally a serious drawback, but it is to a certain extent
                    compensated by the abundant water-power. The textile industry is carried on in
                    most of its branches. Wool, from both domestic and foreign sources, is woven at
                    Esslingen, Göppingen, and other towns in Lower Swabia; cotton is manufactured in
                    Göppingen and Esslingen, and linen in Upper Swabia. Lace-making also flourishes
                    in the last-named district, as a rural house-industry. The silk industry of
                    Würtemberg, which employs about 1100 hands, though not very extensive in itself,
                    is the most important silk industry in Germany. Ravensburg claims to have
                    possessed the earliest paper-mill in Germany; paper-making is still important in
                    that town and at Heidenheim, Heilbronn, Göppingen, and other places in Lower
                    Swabia. Government owns six iron foundries and puddling works, the most
                    important of which is at Wasseralfingen, where over 1000 hands are employed. The
                    locomotive engines of Esslingen enjoy a wide reputation; and agricultural and
                    other machinery, boilers, and tools of various kinds are also manufactured and
                    exported by various towns. The organs of Ludwigsburg are well known;
                    bell-founding is carried on at Stuttgart, Reutlingen, and Cannstatt; beetroot
                    sugar and beer are considerable items in the 1ist of annual produce;—wine has
                    been already mentioned. The manufacture of chemicals at Stuttgart, Heilbronn,
                    &amp;c., is important.</p>
                <p>Trade has prospered since Würtemberg joined the North German Customs Union in
                    1834. The leading trading towns are Heilbronn, Stuttgart, Ulm, and
                    Friedrichshafen. Cattle, horses, sheep, agricultural produce, timber, salt, and
                    various manufactured goods are the chief exports; coal, hops, steel goods of
                    various kinds, eggs, and poultry are among the chief imports. The booktrade of
                    Stuttgart is very extensive; that town has been called the Leipsic of southern
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>In 1887 991 miles of railway were open for traffic in Würtemberg. With the
                    insignificant exception of two private lines, together no more than 31 miles
                    long, all the railways are in the hands of the state. The Neckar, the Schüssen,
                    and the Lake of Constance are all navigable fòr boats; the Danube begins to be
                    navigable at Ulm. The roads of Würtemberg are fairly good; the oldest are Roman.
                    Würtemberg, like Bavaria, retained the control of its own postal and telegraph
                    system on the foundation of the new German empire. In 1885 there were 1750 miles
                    of telegraph wires in the kingdom.</p>
                <p>1n 1885 the population of Würtemberg was 1,995,168, or one twenty-third of the
                    total population of Germany on one twentyeighth of its area. The average per
                    square mile is 264 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9. The following table shows
                    the distribution of the population among the administrative districts, and their
                    religion. The Neckar division contains most large towns.</p>

                <p>The people of the north-west belong to the Alemannic stock, those of the
                    north-east to the Franconian, and those of the centre and south to the Swabian.
                    According to the occupation census of 1882, the following were the numbers of
                    those (including their families and dependants) engaged in the various
                    departments of work:—in agriculture, forestry, &amp;c., 942,924; in mining and
                    industrial pursuits, 674,081; in trade and commerce, 143,258; in domestic and
                    other service, 11,254; in professions, 95,712; “no returns,” 90,240. In 1886
                    there were 3717 emigrants; in 1881 there were 11,470.</p>
                <p>In 1885 there were 15 towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants, viz., Stuttgart
                    (125,906), Ulm (33,610), Heilbronn (27,758), Esslingen (20,864), Cannstatt or
                    Canstatt (18,031), Reutlingen (17,319), Ludwigsburg (16,201), Gmünd (15,321),
                    Tübingen (12,551), Göppingen (12,102), and Ravensburg (11,482).</p>
                <p>About two-thirds of the population are Protestant. In 1880, when the total
                    population was 1,971,118, there were 1,364,580 Protestants, 590,290 Roman
                    Catholics, 13,331 Jews, 2817 of other Christian sects, and 98 “others.” The
                    Protestant church is controlled (under the minister of religion and education)
                    by a consistory and a synod,—the latter being made up of the consistory and six
                    general superintendents or “prelates” from six principal towns. But no laws are
                    made or altered without the consent of a representative council, including both
                    lay and clerical members. The Roman Catholic church is subject to the bishop of
                    Rottenburg, in the archdiocese of Freiburg. Politically it is under a Roman
                    Catholic council, appointed by Government. The Jews also since 1828 have been
                    subject to a state-appointed council.</p>
                <p>Würtemberg is one of the best educated countries of Europe. School attendance is
                    compulsory on children from seven to fourteen years of age, and young people
                    from fourteen to eighteen must either attend the schools on Sunday or some other
                    educational establishment. Every community of at least 30 families must have a
                    school. The different churches attend to the schools of their own confession.
                    There is a university at Tübingen, and a polytechnic school at Stuttgart.
                    Technical schools of various kinds are established in many of the towns, in
                    addition to a thorough equipment of gymnasia, commercial schools, seminaries,
                    &amp;c. The conservatory of music at Stuttgart enjoys a high reputation.</p>
                <p>Würtemberg is a constitutional monarchy and a member of the German empire, with 4
                    votes in the federal council and 17 in the imperial diet. The constitution rests
                    on a law of 1819, amended in 1868 and 1874. The crown is hereditary, and conveys
                    the simple title of king of Würtemberg. The king receives a civil list of
                    £90,670, and the “apanages” of the crown amount to £14,900 more. The legislature
                    is bi-cameral. The upper chamber (Standesherren) is composed of adult princes of
                    the blood, heads of noble families from the rank of count (Graf) upwards,
                    representatives of territories (Standesherrschaften) which possessed votes in
                    the old German diet, and of life members nominated by the king. The number of
                    this last class must not exceed one-third of the house. The lower house
                    (Abgeordneten-Haus) has 93 members, viz., 13 noble landowners, elected by their
                    peers (Ritterschaft), the 6 Protestant “prelates,” the Roman Catholic bishop,
                    and 2 other official Roman Catholic members, the chancellor of the university of
                    Tübingen, 7 representatives from the chief towns, and 63 representatives from
                    country districts. The king appoints the president of the upper chamber; since
                    1874 the lower chamber has elected its own chairman. Members are elected for six
                    years by ballot; the suffrage is enjoyed by all male citizens. With the
                    exception of the royal princes and the life-members of the upper house that
                    reside in Stuttgart, the members of both houses receive a daily payment of 9m.
                    41ρf. (9s. 5d.) each.</p>
                <p>The highest executive is in the hands of a ministry of state (Staatsministerium),
                    consisting of six ministers and the privy council, the members of which are
                    nominated by the king. There are ministers of justice, war, finance, home
                    affairs, religion and education, and foreign affairs, railways, and the royal
                    household. The legal system is framed in imitation of that of the German empire.
                    The judges of the supreme court for impeachments of ministers, &amp;c., named
                    the Staatsgerichtshof, are partly elected by the chambers and partly appointed
                    by the king. The country is divided into four administrative “circles,”
                    subdivided into 64 “Oberämter,” each of which is under an “Oberamtmann,”
                    assisted by an “Amtsversammlung” or local council. At the head of each of the
                    four large divisions is a “Regierung.”</p>
                <p>The official finance period of Würtemberg embraces two years. For 1885-87 the
                    budget showed an annual income of £2,811,921, balanced by the expenditure, which
                    included a payment of £2500 to a reserve fund. The chief sources of income were
                    taxes (£1,392,893, including £691,773 of direct taxes), and public domains and
                    monopolies (£1,095,336, including £662,385 from railways and £72,741 from post
                    and telegraphs). The chief expenditure was on the interest (£875,525) and
                    sinking fund (£122,873) of the public debt. This debt amounted in 1887 to
                    £21,202,570, of which by far the greater proportion (£18,966,700) was incurred
                    for constructing and buying railways. Most of it bears interest at 4 per
                    cent.</p>
                <p>In terms of the convention of 1870 the troops of Würtemberg form the 13th army
                    corps in the imperial German army. They include 8 regiments of infantry, 4 of
                    cavalry, and 2 of field artillery, &amp;c. By the army law of March 11, 1887,
                    the peace strength of the army was fixed at 773 officers, 18,815 men, and 64
                    cannon. The town of U1m is one of the strongest fortresses in Germany.</p>

                <p>The earliest known inhabitants of the country now called Wurtemberg seem to have
                    been Suevi. The Romans, who appeared first about 15 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> added the south part of the land to the province of Gaul in 84 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and defended their positions there by a wall or
                    rampart. About the beginning of the 3d century the Alemanni drove the Romans
                    beyond the Rhine and the Danube; but they in their turn were conquered by the
                    Franks under Clovis (496), and the land was divided between Rhenish Franconia
                    and the duchy of Alemannia. The latter, however, disappears about 760, and its
                    territories were administered for the Frankish monarchs by “grafs” or counts,
                    until they were finally absorbed in the duchy of Swabia. The last duke of Swabia
                    died in 1268, and a large share of his power and possessions fell into the hands
                    of the ‘ ‘ grafs” of Würtemberg, whose ancestral castle crowned a hill between
                    Esslingen and Cannstatt. Tradition mentions a Conradus de Wirtemberc in 1090,
                    but the earliest authentic count seems to have been Ulrich (1241-1265), who had
                    large possessions in the valleys of the Neckar and the Rems. The power of this
                    family grew steadily under successive counts; and in 1482 their possessions were
                    declared indivisible. This early adoption of the principle of primogeniture
                    saved Wurtemberg from the wasting effects of those family feuds and jealousies
                    which interfered so seriously with the development of some of the other German
                    states. Eberhard V., surnamed “im Bart” (1482-1496), was one of the most
                    energetic and illustrious rulers that Wurtemberg ever had, and in 1495 his
                    possessions were raised by the emperor to the dignity of an immediate imperial
                    duchy. The reign of Ulrich I. (1498-1550), who succeeded to the duchy while
                    still a child, was a most eventful period for the country, and many stories and
                    traditions cluster round the name of this gifted and vigorous but unscrupulous
                    and ambitious man. The extortions by which he sought to raise money for his
                    extravagant pleasures excited a rising known as the “arme Konrad” (poor
                    Conrad)—not unlike [the rising of Wat Tyler in England; and by the treaty of
                    Tübingen in 1514 his people undertook to pay his debts in exchange for various
                    political privileges, which in effect laid the foundation of the constitutional
                    liberties of the country. A few years later, however, Ulrich quarrelled with the
                    Swabian league of imperial towns, and their army headed by the duke of Bavaria,
                    who was incensed by Ulrich’s ill-treatment of his wife, a Bavarian princess,
                    invaded Wurtemberg, expelled the duke, and in 1520 sold the duchy to Austria for
                    220,000 florins. Ulrich, however, found his opportunity in the discontent caused
                    in Wurtemberg by the military and religious oppression of Austria, and in the
                    disturbed state of the empire during the Peasants’ War, and the commotions
                    excited by the Reformation. Aided by Philip of Hesse and other Protestant
                    princes, he fought a victorious battle at Lauffen in 1534; and by the treaty of
                    Kadan he was recognized once more as duke, though forced to acknowledge his
                    duchy a fief of Austria. One of his first acts was to introduce the Reformation,
                    and to endow Protestant churches and schools throughout his land. His connexion
                    with the Schmalkaldian League once more cost him a temporary expulsion from his
                    throne, but Charles V. reinstated him in 1547, though under severe conditions.
                    Ulrich’s son Christopher (1550-1568) introduced systems of law and church
                    government (Grosse Kirchenordnung) which have endured in part to the present
                    day. The establishment In this reign of a kind of standing committee to
                    superintend the finances was the beginning of popular representation in the
                    government, though its members belonged exclusively, of course, to the higher
                    ranks. Frederick I. (1593-1608), an energetic and ambitious prince, induced the
                    emperor Rudolph II. in 1599 to raise the duchy o∣nce more to the dignity of an
                    immediate fief of the empire. In the reign of his successor, John Frederick
                    (1608-1628), Wurtemberg suffered severely from the Thirty Years’ War, though the
                    duke took no active share in that struggle. His son and successor, however,
                    Eberhard III. (1628-1674), eagerly joined in it, but with disastrous effects.
                    Wurtemberg was occupied by imperial troops, the duke was driven into exile, and
                    when the peace of Westphalia once more reinstated him he found but 50,000
                    subjects where he had left 400,000. In the reign of Eberhard IV. (1677-1733),
                    who was but one year old when his father William died, Wurtemberg made
                    acquaintance with another destructive enemy. In 1688, 1692, 1703, and 1707 the
                    French entered the country with fire and sword, annihilating whole villages in
                    their ruthless brutality, and leaving deserts in their track. The depopulated
                    country eagerly afforded a welcome and a home to the Waldensians, who had been
                    driven from their valleys by the duke of Savoy in 1699. Charles n <hi

                    minister was the unscrupulous Jew Süss Oppenheimer, lhe duke, instigated by his
                    minister, was believed to aim at the suppression of the diet, and at the
                    introduction of the Romish faith, but Charless sudden death in 1737 put an
                    abrupt end to these plans, buss Oppenheimer was hanged by the regent, before the
                    next duke, Charles Eugene (1737-1793) came of age in 1744. 1 he prince was
                    gifted but vicious, and he soon fell into the hands of unworthy favourites. His
                    whole reign was disturbed by dissensions betwixt the ruler and the ruled, in
                    which the intervention of foreign powers (Prussia and England) was invoked,
                    though in vain, by the unhappy people. Alarmed by the gathering discontent,
                    Charles made a few concessions in his old age. Frederick Eugene (1795-1797), a
                    brother of Charles Eugene, had been brought up at the court of Frederick the
                    Great, whose niece he married. His children were, through this influence,
                    educated as Protestants, and the royal family of Würtemberg have been
                    Protestants since his death.</p>
                <p>Frederick II. (1797-1816) resembled the first of his name in becoming embroiled
                    with the diet. He declared war against France in defiance of the wishes of his
                    people, and when the French invaded the country he retired to Erlangen, till
                    after the peace of Lunéville (1801). By a private treaty at the same date, he
                    exchanged Montbéliard (which had belonged to Würtemberg since 1418) and his
                    Alsatian possessions for nine imperial towns and other territories, amounting in
                    all to 850 square miles, with 124,000 inhabitants. He accepted also the title of
                    elector from Napoleon. The newly acquired districts were not incorporated with
                    his former possessions, but remained separate under the name “New Würtemberg.”
                    The new district had no diet. This was the first of a series of transactions
                    with the national enemy, which swelled Frederick’s territory, though they added
                    but little to his credit. In 1805 Würtemberg took up arms on the side of France,
                    and the elector was rewarded at the peace of Pressburg by various Austrian
                    possessions in Swabia, and the title of king. On January 1, 1806, Frederick
                    assumed the royal style, abrogated the constitution, and united old and new
                    Würtemberg. He subsequently united church and state, and proclaimed religious
                    equality. In 1806 King Frederick I. joined the Confederation of the Rhine, and
                    received fresh territories, with 160,000 inhabitants; and the peace of Vienna
                    brought 110,000 new subjects under his sceptre. But he had to perform his part
                    of the bargain by joining Napoleon in his campaigns against Prussia, Austria,
                    and Russia. Of 16,000 Würtembergers who marched to Moscow, only a few hundred
                    returned. When fortune turned, Frederick with ready adroitness changed sides,
                    and managed to preserve his royal title and most of his new-won lands by joining
                    the allies immediately after the battle of Leipsic.</p>
                <p>Würtemberg had been promised a constitution by Frederick before he died in 1816,
                    but a good deal of discussion took place before it was granted in 1819 by
                    William I. (1816-1864). A period of quiet now set in, and the educational
                    condition of the kingdom, its agriculture, and its trade and manufactures began
                    to receive earnest attention. The desire for political freedom had by no means
                    been satisfied by the constitution of 1819, and a “liberal opposition” began to
                    make itself felt about 1830. The agitation of 1848 did not leave Würtemberg
                    undisturbed, though no scenes of actual violence took place in the kingdom. The
                    conservative ministry granted freedom of the press and other privileges, too
                    late, however, to avert their fall. The king was compelled to call the liberals
                    to power in March 1848, and a new liberal constitution was granted. But as soon
                    as the stress was over the “March ministry” was dismissed, and the reactionary
                    party were again in the ascendant. By a high-handed interference with recently
                    granted popular rights on the part of the king and his ministers a servile diet
                    was assembled in 1851, which yielded up without hesitation all that had been
                    gained since 1848. The constitution of 1819 was reinstituted, and it has
                    remained, with only a few modifications, ever since. In 1864 Charles ascended
                    the throne. In the duel between Prussia and Austria for supremacy in Germany,
                    the sympathies of the rulers of Würtemberg were always on the side of the
                    latter, although the country entered the Customs Union under Prussia’s
                    protection in 1864. In 1866 Würtemberg took up arms on behalf of Austria; but
                    the Würtemberg troops were defeated at Tauberbischofsheim, three weeks after
                    Sadowa, and its ministers sued for peace. Prussia exacted an indemnity of 8
                    million florins, and Würtemberg struck a secret offensive and defensive treaty
                    with its conqueror. In 1870 this kingdom shared in the national enthusiasm which
                    swept over Germany when France declared war; and its troops had a creditable
                    share in the memorable campaign of 1870-71. Since the foundation of the present
                    German empire, the separate history of Würtemberg has been of almost exclusively
                    focal interest. The tendency of legislation has been, on the whole, liberal.</p>
