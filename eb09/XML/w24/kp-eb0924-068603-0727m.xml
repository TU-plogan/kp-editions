                <p><label type="entry">WRECK</label> (in Low Latin <hi rend="italic">wreccum</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">warectum mams)</hi> is a ship or goods cast on land by the sea
                    in tidal waters. While still at sea such ship or goods do not constitute wreck
                    but derelict, which includes flotsam, jetsam, and lagan (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Flotsam).</hi> In Roman law wreck was restored to the owner if
                    he claimed it before a judicial tribunal within a year and a day, the <hi
                    rend="italic">fiscus</hi> waiving its claim after a constitution attributed to
                    either Marcus Aurelius or Constantine. Theft from a wreck was regarded as
                    aggravated by the helpless position of the owner, and the thief was liable for
                    fourfold the loss if an action was brought against him within a year, after that
                    time for the loss simply. Plunderers of wreck and exhibitors of false lights
                    were also punished criminally. Most of the Roman law on the subject is contained
                    in <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> xlvii. 9, <hi rend="italic">Code</hi> xi. 5.
                    The Leonine Constitutions, c. 64, made a concealer of wreck liable to the
                    fourfold penalty. In France it was provided by the laws of Oléron (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sea Laws)</hi> that succour was to be afforded to shipwrecked
                    persons, and their property returned to them. Wreck afterwards became a right of
                    the crown (a right limited to one-third of the value by an ordinance of Francis
                    I.), but was often granted to feudal seigneurs under the name of <hi

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0728-0687"/><hi rend="italic">bris.</hi> In England the rule
                    seems in the time of Bracton (the reign of Henry III.) to have been the same as
                    that of the Roman law, that wreck only belonged to the king if no claimant
                    appeared within a year and a day. It would perhaps be more accurate to say that
                    it vested in the crown, subject to be divested on proof of ownership within the
                    period limited. The reason for this rule of law appears to be the necessity of
                    enabling persons in authority to protect wreck from the pillage which it was
                    otherwise certain to have undergone at a time when wreck was looked upon as
                    legitimate prey of the wrecker. In Bracton (120, 5) it is said that even if a
                    dog escaped, or if any certain mark were put upon the goods, it was no wreck.
                    The Statute of Westminster the First (3 Edw. I. c. 4) is merely declaratory of
                    the common law as it is found in Bracton. It enacts that, where a man, a dog, or
                    a cat escaped alive out of a ship, such ship should not be adjudged wreck, but
                    the goods should be saved and kept by view of the sheriff, coroner, or king’s
                    bailiff, and delivered into the hands of such as were of the town where the
                    goods were found, so that if any sued for the goods, and proved that they were
                    his or perished in his keeping within a year and a day, they should be restored
                    to him without delay; if not, they should remain to the king, and where wreck
                    belonged to another than the king he should have it in 1ike manner. In both
                    Bracton and the statute the escape of a living thing appears to be used rather
                    as an example of a means of proof than as the sole means of proof. The latter,
                    however, became the doctrine of the courts for centuries; it was wreck unless a
                    living thing escaped, and as such part of the hereditary revenue of the crown,
                    and expressly recognized by the Statute <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Praerogativa</hi><hi rend="italic">Regis</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Prerogative). To</hi> hold inquests of wreck was by the Statute
                    <hi rend="italic">De Ofiicio</hi><hi rend="italic">Coronatoris</hi> (4 Edw. I.
                    c. 2) one of the duties of the coroner, of which he has only recently been
                    relieved by the Coroners Act, 1887, repealing the Act of Edward I. In 1771 a
                    return was made by Lord Mansfield to the older and more reasonable view of the
                    common law as it stood in Bracton. That distinguished judge considered that the
                    rule that it was wreck unless a living thing came to shore was contrary to
                    principles of law, justice, and humanity, and that the escape of an animal was
                    simply a medium of proof. It was the proof and not the escape that was the
                    important fact.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hamilton

                    2733.</p><p/></note> Claims to wreck were, by Ric. II. c. 3, not cognizable in
                    the Admiralty Court as was derelict, for that was in and upon the sea, while
                    wreck must have touched the land before it became wreck. Unclaimed derelict was,
                    like unclaimed wreck, a right of the crown, but in a different way. It was not a
                    direct right <hi rend="italic">jure coronas,</hi> but claimed by the king in his
                    office of Admiralty as an admiralty droit. As wreck in the last resort became
                    crown property, it was never subject to forfeiture as a <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Deodand</hi><hi rend="italic">{g.vf)</hi> where lives were lost. Wreck was
                    frequently granted to subjects as a franchise, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> to
                    lords of manors and to various maritime cities and boroughs, among others to the
                    Cinque Ports. Within the Cinque Ports the serjeants of the Admiralty of the
                    Cinque Ports still act as receivers of wreck (17 and 18 Vict. c. 120).</p>
                <p>So stood the common law as affected by early legislation. It is now of
                    comparatively small importance, as the law now depends chiefly on the Merchant
                    Shipping Act, 1854, part viii., and the amendments introduced by later Acts.</p>
                <p>The definition of wreck for the purposes of the Merchant Shipping Acts (which is
                    in effect for all practical purposes) is considerably extended beyond its common
                    law meaning. By s. 2 of the Act of 1854, it includes jetsam, flotsam, lagan, and
                    derelict. By the Sea Fisheries Act, 1883, it is still further extended to
                    include all fishing boats, all their small boats, all rigging gear or other
                    appurtenances of fishing boats, all nets, lines, buoys, floats, or other fishing
                    implements whatsoever found or picked up at sea whether marked or unmarked. The
                    principal provisions of the Act of 1854 are as follows. ∣The general
                    superintendence throughout the United Kingdom of all matters relating to wreck
                    is committed to the Board of Trade. No person exercising Admiralty jurisdiction
                    is to interfere with wreck. Whenever any ship or boat is stranded or in distress
                    at any place on the shore of the sea, or of any tidal water, the receiver of
                    wreck of the district is to proceed thither and take command, and issue such
                    directions as he may think fit with a view to the preservation of the ship. All
                    cargo and other articles washed ashore, or lost or taken from the ship, are to
                    be delivered to the receiver. In the absence of the receiver, customs officers,
                    justices of the peace, and others have the power of the receiver. The receiver
                    is as soon as possible to examine on oath any person who may be able to give any
                    account of a ship in distress or her cargo or stores, and forward the result of
                    his examination to the Board of Trade (where it is deposited in the wreck
                    register) and to Lloyd’s. On proof of title of a lord of the manor or other
                    person entitled to unclaimed wreck, the receiver is to hold it on behalf of such
                    person. The receiver is aided and protected by numerous provisions making it
                    punishable to refuse men or vehicles on his demand, to secrete or fail to give
                    notice of wreck, to obstruct the receiver or any other person on his way to the
                    wreck, &amp;c. In case of suspected concealment of wreck, he may obtain a search
                    warrant (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Warrant)</hi> from a justice of the peace.
                    Whenever any wreck is saved by any person other than a receiver, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Salvage</hi> (g ’.u) is payable. In case of no claim being made
                    within a year by the owner, and in the absence of any private right of a lord of
                    a manor or other person, the receiver is to sell the wreck, and pay the
                    proceeds, after deducting expenses and salvage, to the exchequer, to become part
                    of the consolidated fund. The Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice
                    has jurisdiction to decide upon all claims of salvage, whether the wreck is
                    found at sea or cast upon the land, or partly in the sea and partly on land.
                    Wreck, if foreign goods, is liable to customs duties. Goods saved from a ship
                    wrecked on its homeward voyage are to be forwarded to the port of its original
                    destination. A seaman is entitled to wages up to the time of a vessel being
                    wrecked, unless he has not exerted himself to the utmost to save the ship,
                    cargo, and stores. Receivers’ districts under the Act of 1854 were formed by a
                    Board of Trade order of October 7, 1856. The Merchant Shipping Act, 1862,
                    provides, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> that the receiver may appoint a
                    valuer in salvage cases, that the delivery of week by the receiver to any person
                    is not to prejudice the right of third parties, and that the payment of proceeds
                    of wreck claimed by the crown is to be made to the consolidated fund or the
                    revenues of the duchies of Cornwall or Lancaster according to circumstances.
                    Instructions to receivers were issued by the Board of Trade in 1865 and 1886. In
                    1876 a new tribunal for the investigation of shipping casualties was created by
                    the Merchant Shipping Act, 1876, which has in most cases superseded the
                    procedure provided by the Act of 1854. The Act enabled the lord chancellor to
                    appoint a wreck commissioner, or wreck commissioners not exceeding three, and
                    gave the commissioner or commissioners power to act with or without skilled
                    assessors, and in certain cases which were not within the purview of the Act of
                    1854, viz., where a ship on the coast of the United Kingdom or a British ship
                    elsewhere has been stranded or damaged and any witness is found at any place in
                    the United Kingdom, and where a British ship has been lost or is supposed to
                    have been lost, and any evidence can be obtained in the United Kingdom as to the
                    circumstances under which she proceeded to sea or was last heard of. In addition
                    to the Acts mentioned, there are several others which affect the subject of
                    wreck more or less directly. By 6 Geo. IV. c. 87 consuls in foreign ports are to
                    have credit for disbursements on behalf of shipwrecked persons. Where a foreign
                    ship is wrecked, the consul-general or other consular officer is by 18 and 19
                    Vict. c. 91 to be deemed the owner. . Removal of wrecks is provided for in
                    dockyards by 28 and 29 Vict. c. 125, in most other cases by the Harbours Clauses
                    Act, 1847, and the Removal of Wrecks Act, 1877, giving powers of removal to the
                    harbour or general lighthouse authorities. Provision is made by special Acts for
                    raising wreck in the Thames, Mersey, Humber, Clyde, and other rivers. Burial of
                    bodies washed ashore from wrecks is regulated by 48 Geo. III. c. 75 and 49 Vict.
                    c. 20. The criminal law relating to wreck has been the subject of a considerable
                    mass of legislation. The protection of the receiver in his duties by the Act of
                    1854 has been already mentioned. The Act further provides against wrongfully
                    carrying off or removing wreck, impeding or hindering the saving of wreck, and
                    secreting wreck or obliterating or defacing any marks thereon. Taking wreck into
                    a foreign port and there disposing of it is made felony, punishable with ten
                    years’ penal servitude. Other provisions are made by the Criminal Law
                    Consolidation Acts of 1861. To plunder or steal any part of a wrecked ship or
                    vessel, or any goods belonging to such vessel, is a felony, punishable with
                    fourteeen years’ penal servitude. Any person in possession of such goods, and
                    not giving a satisfactory account of how he came by them, may be committed to
                    prison on summary <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n729/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0729-0688"/> conviction, and such goods, if exposed for sale,
                    may be seized and carried before a justice of the peace, and the vendor called
                    upon to satisfy the justice that he came lawfully by them, 24 and 25 Vict. c.
                    96, ss. 64-66. Destruction of and injury to ships or wrecks, and masking,
                    alteration, or removal of lights or exhibition of false lights, and injury to or
                    concealment of buoys and other marks of navigation, are all punishable by 24 and
                    25 Vict. c. 97, ss. 42-49, penal servitude for life being the maximum penalty.
                    To impede a shipwrecked person or any person in his endeavour to save him, and
                    to assault any magistrate, officer, or other person in the exercise of his duty
                    in the preservation of wreck, are crimes by 24 and 25 Vict. c. 100, ss. 17, 37.
                    In the case of plunder, damage, or destruction of any ship or boat stranded or
                    in distress on the shore of the sea or tidal water, or of any part of its cargo
                    or apparel, by persons riotously and tumultuously assembled, either ashore or
                    afloat, the owner has a right to compensation against the police authority of
                    the district under the Riot (Damages) Act, 1886.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> As in England, unclaimed wreck was a right of
                    the crown, often granted to subjects, generally under the style of “wrak, waith,
                    and ware," the last two words signifying, derelict and seaweed. It was so
                    granted to the earl of Orkney in 1581. It was occasionally dealt with by the
                    Scottish Parliament. Thus by 1426, c. 15, ships wrecked on the coast of Scotland
                    were to be escheat to the king if they belonged to a country observing a similar
                    law, otherwise to have the favour shown to ships of Scotland. Compensation for
                    destruction of wreck by a riotous assembly is to be made by the inhabitants of
                    the nearest county, city, or borough under the Riot Act of George I. (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Riot),</hi> the Act of 1886 not applying to Scotland.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> The State legislation as to disposition of
                    wrecked property is generally in favour of the owner on his claim being made
                    within a limited time. As to the Acts of Congress on the subject, the secretary
                    of the treasury is empowered to make contracts and provisions for the
                    preservation, sale, or collection of wrecked property, <hi rend="italic">Revised

                    the United States and purchased and repaired by a citizen of the United States,
                    § 4136. Special provisions are made as to wreck in Florida, §§ 4239-4241.
                    Plundering wreck, or impeding the escape of a shipwrecked person, or showing
                    false or extinguishing true lights in order to cause wreck are punishable
                    offences, § 5358. Wreck is not confined as in England to loss on tidal waters,
                    but extends to that happening on the great freshwater lakes and rivers. Wreck
                    commissioners and wreck masters are generally appointed, with powers and duties
                    similar to those of the receiver in the United Kingdom. (J. W+. )</p>
