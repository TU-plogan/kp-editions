                    modification of the Scandinavian <hi rend="italic">vallross</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">hνalrοs</hi> (“whale-horse”), the latter an adaptation of the
                    Russian name for the animal.</p></note> In the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi> (vol. XV. p. 442) it was shown that the existing members of the
                    Pinniped division of the order <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> are divided into
                    three very distinct groups, the true seals <hi rend="italic">(Phocidae),</hi>
                    the sea-bears or eared seals <hi rend="italic">(Otariidae),</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Trichechidae,</hi> containing the walrus alone, in some respects
                    intermediate between the other two, but also possessing, especially in its
                    greatly modified dentition, peculiar characters of its own.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trichechus</hi> is the almost universally accepted generic name
                    by which the walrus is known to zoologists, but lately some confusion has been
                    introduced into literature by the revival of the nearly obsolete terms <hi
                    rend="italic">Rosmarus</hi> by some authors and <hi rend="italic">Odobaenus</hi>
                    by others. <hi rend="italic">T. rosmarus</hi> is the name of the species met
                    with in the Arctic seas; that of the North Pacific, if distinct, is <hi
                    rend="italic">T. obesus.</hi> The following description will apply equally to
                    both. A full-grown male walrus measures from ten to eleven feet from the nose to
                    the end of the very short tail, and is a heavy, bulky animal, especially thick
                    about the shoulders. The head is rounded, the eyes rather small, and there are
                    no external ears. The muzzle is short and broad, with, on each side, a group of
                    very stiff, bristly whiskers, which become stouter and shorter in old animals.
                    The tail scarcely projects beyond the skin. The fore-limbs are free only from
                    the elbow; the hand is broad, flat, and webbed, the five fingers being of nearly
                    equal length, the first slightly the longest. Each finger has a small, flattened
                    nail, situated on the dorsal surface at a considerable distance from the end.
                    The hind-limbs are enclosed in the skin of the body almost to the heel. The free
                    portion, when expanded, is fan-shaped, the two outer toes (first and fifth)
                    being the longest, especially the latter. Cutaneous flaps project considerably
                    beyond the bones of the toes. The nails of the first and fifth toes are minute
                    and flattened; those of the second, third, and fourth elongated, sub-compressed,
                    and pointed. The soles of both fore and hind feet are bare, rough, and warty.
                    The surface of the skin generally is covered with short, adpressed hair of a
                    light, yellowish-brown colour, which, on the under parts of the body and base of
                    the flippers, passes into dark reddish-brown or chestnut. In old animals the
                    hair becomes more scanty, sometimes almost entirely disappearing, and the skin
                    shows ample evidence of the rough life and pugnacious habits of the animal in
                    the innumerable scars with which it is usually covered. It is everywhere more or
                    less wrinkled, especially over the shoulders, where it is thrown into deep and
                    heavy folds.</p>
                <p>One of the most striking external characteristics of the walrus is the pair of
                    tusks which descend almost directly downwards from the upper jaw, sometimes
                    attaining a length, in old animals, of 20 inches, or even more. In the female
                    they are as long or sometimes longer than in the male, but less massive. In the
                    young of the first year they are not visible. These tusks correspond to the
                    upper canine teeth of other mammals. All the other teeth, including the lower
                    canines, are much alike—small, simple, and one-rooted, and with crowns, rounded
                    at first, but wearing to a flat or concave surface. The complete dentition
                    appears to be <hi rend="italic">i</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">/</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">,

                    Many of these teeth are, however, lost early, or remain through life in a
                    rudimentary state concealed beneath the gum. The teeth which are usually
                    functionally developed are <hi rend="italic">i</hi><hi rend="superscript">

                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, total 18. The tusks are formidable weapons of defence,
                    but their principal use seems to be scraping and digging among the sand and
                    shingle for the molluscs and crustaceans on which the walrus feeds. They are
                    said also to aid in climbing up the slippery rocks and ledges of ice on which so
                    much of the animal’s life is passed. Although this function of the tusks is
                    affirmed by numerous authors, some of whom appear to have had opportunities of
                    actual observation, it is explicitly denied by Malmgren.</p>
                <p>Walruses are more or less gregarious in their habits, being met with generally in
                    companies or herds of various sizes. They are only found near the coast or on
                    large masses of floating ice, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n361/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0361-0338"/> rarely far out in the open sea; and, though often
                    moving from one part of their feeding ground to another, they have no regular
                    seasonal migrations. Their young are born between the months of April aud June,
                    usually but one at a time, never more than two. Their strong affection for their
                    young, and their sympathy for each other in times of danger, have been
                    particularly noticed by all who have had the opportunity of observing them in
                    their native haunts. When one of their number is wounded, the whole herd usually
                    join in a concerted and intelligent defence. Although harmless and inoffensive
                    when not molested, they exhibit considerable fierceness when attacked, using
                    their great tusks with tremendous effect either on human enemies who come into
                    too close quarters or on polar bears, the only other adversary they can meet
                    with in their own natural territory. Their voice is a loud roaring, and can be
                    heard at a great distance; it is described by Dr Kane as “something between the
                    mooing of a cow and the deepest baying of a mastiff <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi>, very round and full, with its bark or detached notes repeated rather
                    quickly seven or nine times in succession.”</p>
                <p>The principal food of the walrus consists of bivalved molluscs, especially <hi
                    rend="italic">Mya truncata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Saxicava rugosa,</hi> two
                    species very abundant in the Arctic regions, which it digs up from the mud and
                    sand in which they lie buried at the bottom of the sea by means of its tusks. It
                    crushes and removes the shells by the aid of its grinding teeth and tongue, and
                    swallows only the soft part of the animal. It also feeds on other molluscs,
                    sand-worms, starfishes, and shrimps. Portions of various kinds of algae or
                    sea-weeds have been found in its stomach, but whether swallowed intentionally or
                    not is still doubtful.</p>
                <p>The commercial products of the walrus are its oil, hide (used to manufacture
                    harness and sole-leather and twisted into tiller ropes), and tusks. The ivory of
                    the latter is, however, inferior in quality to that of the elephant. Its flesh
                    forms an important article of food to the Eskimo and Tchuktchis. Of the coast
                    tribes of the last-named people the walrus forms the chief means of support.
                    “The flesh supplies them with food, the ivory tusks are made into implements
                    used in the chase and for other domestic purposes, as well as affording a
                    valuable article of barter, and the skin furnishes the material for covering
                    their summer habitations, harness for their dog-teams, and lines for their
                    fishing gear” (Scammon).</p>
                <p>Geographically the walrus is confined to the northern circumpolar regions of the
                    globe, extending apparently as far north as explorers have penetrated, but its
                    southern range has been much restricted of late in consequence of the
                    persecutions of man. On the Atlantic coast of America it was met with in the
                    16th century as low as the southern coast of Nova Scotia and in the last century
                    was common in the Gulf of St Lawrence and on the shores of Labrador. It still
                    inhabits the coast round Hudson’s Bay, Davis Straits, and Greenland, where,
                    however, its numbers are daily decreasing. It is not found on the Arctic coast
                    of America between the 97th and 158th meridians. In Europe, occasional
                    stragglers have reached the British Isles, and it was formerly abundant on the
                    coasts of Finmark. It is rare in Iceland, but Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, and the
                    western part of the north coast of Siberia are still constant places of resort,
                    in all of which a regular war of extermination is carried on. The North Pacific,
                    including both sides of Behring’s Strait, northern Kamchatka, Alaska, and the
                    Pribyloff Islands are also the haunts of numerous walruses, which are isolated
                    from those of the North Atlantic by the long stretches of coast, both of Siberia
                    and North America, in which they do not occur. The Pacific walrus appears to be
                    as large as, if not larger than, that of the Atlantic; its tusks are longer and
                    more slender, and curved inwards; the whiskers are smaller, and the muzzle
                    relatively deeper and broader. These and certain other minor differences have
                    induced some naturalists to consider it specifically distinct under the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Trichechus obesus.</hi> Its habits appear to be quite similar
                    to those of the Atlantic form. Though formerly found in immense herds, it is
                    rapidly becoming scarce, as the methods of destruction used by the American
                    whalers, who have systematically entered upon its pursuit, are far more certain
                    and deadly than those of the native Tchuktchis, to whom, as mentioned before,
                    the walrus long afforded the principal means of subsistence.</p>
                <p>Fossil remains of walruses and closely allied animals have been found in the
                    United States, and in England, Belgium, and France, in deposits of Quaternary
                    and late Tertiary age.</p>
                <p>An exhaustive account of this animal, with references to all the authors who have
                    written upon it, will be found in Allen’s <hi rend="italic">History of North
                    American Pinnipeds,</hi> 1880. (W. H. F.)</p>
