                    Hervey, the half-brother of the peer who wrote the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    the Court of George the Second,</hi> has been called his father. This parentage
                    has been assigned to him partly through the circumstance that the first wife of
                    Sir Robert Walpole lived for some time estranged from her husband and on terms
                    of friendship with Carr, Lord Hervey, not the least clever or unprincipled
                    member of a family notorious for ability and for laxity of morals, and partly
                    through the antagonism of the qualities shown by Horace Walpole to those of the
                    prime minister, and through their affinity with the talents of the Herveys. If
                    this rumour be correct, no such suspicion ever entered into the mind of Horace
                    Walpole. To his mother he erected a monument, with an inscription couched in
                    terms of sincere affection, in the chapel of Henry VII. in Westminster Abbey,
                    and from the beginning to the end of his life his sarcasms never spared the
                    Newcastles and the Hardwickes, who had shown, as he thought, lukewarmness in
                    support of his father’s ministry. About 1728 he was sent to Eton, and in 1735
                    matriculated at King’s College, Cambridge. Two years (1739-41) were spent in the
                    recognized grand tour of France and Italy, in company with Gray the poet, whose
                    acquaintance had been made amid the classic groves of Eton and Cambridge. They
                    stopped a few weeks in Paris, and lingered for three months under the shadow of
                    the magnificent portals of the cathedral of Rheims, on the pretence of learning
                    the French language. Henry Seymour Conway, whose mother was a sister of Lady
                    Walpole, shared their society in the French city, and retained Horace Walpole’s
                    warm friendship during life. The other two members of this little circle next
                    proceeded to Florence, where Walpole rested for more than a year in the villa of
                    Horace Mann, the British envoy-extraordinary for forty-six <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n357/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0357-0334"/> years to the court of Tuscany. Mann’s family had
                    long been on terms of the closest intimacy with his guests, as Robert Mann was
                    concerned in the contract for which Sir Robert Walpole was expelled from the
                    House of Commons in 1712, and the envoy continued the correspondent of Walpole
                    until 1786, for as they never met again their friendship remained unbroken. At
                    Reggio Walpole and Gray parted in resentment. The latter was shy in manners and
                    absorbed in literature, while his more opulent companion lived in society, and
                    only dabbled in antiquities for pleasure’s sake. Walpole in after years took the
                    blame of these differences on himself, and it is generally believed that the
                    quarrel arose from his laying too much stress on his superiority in position. In
                    1744 the two friends were nominally reconciled, but the breach was not
                    cemented.</p>
                <p>During Walpole’s absence he was returned to parliament in 1741 for the Cornish
                    borough of Callington, over which his elder brother, through his marriage with
                    the heiress of the Rolles, exercised supreme influence. He represented three
                    constituencies in succession, Callington 1741-54, the family borough of Castle
                    Rising from 1754 to 1757, and the more important constituency of King’s Lynn,
                    for which his father had long sat in parliament, from the latter date until
                    1768. In that year he retired, probably because his success in political life
                    had not equalled his expectations, but he continued until the end of his days to
                    follow and to chronicle the acts and the speeches of both Houses of Parliament.
                    Through his father’s influence he had obtained three lucrative sinecures
                    producing at least £5000 a year, and for many years (1745-84) he enjoyed a
                    share, estimated at about £1500 a year, of a second family perquisite, the
                    collectorship of customs. The possession of these ample endowments and of a
                    leasehold house in Arlington Street, which was left to him by his father,
                    enabled him, a bachelor all his days, to gratify every expensive luxury and
                    every costly taste. He purchased in 1747 the charmingly situated villa of
                    Strawberry Hill, near Twickenham, on the banks of the Thames, and six years
                    later began a series of alterations in the Gothic style, not completed for
                    nearly a quarter of a century later, under which the original cottage became
                    transformed into a building without parallel in Europe. Some years after this
                    purchase he established a printing-press there for the gratification of his
                    literary tastes, and many of the first editions of his own works were struck off
                    within its walls. At this press were produced in 1753 the clever, if eccentric,
                    designs of Richard Bentley (the youngest child of the great doctor, and for some
                    time a protegé of Horace Walpole) for the poems of Gray; and among the reprints
                    of Strawberry Hill were the <hi rend="italic">Life of Lord Herbert of Cherbury,
                    Memoirs of Grammont,</hi> Hentzner’s <hi rend="italic">Journey into
                    England,</hi> and Lord Whitworth’s <hi rend="italic">Account of Russia.</hi> The
                    rooms of this whimsical edifice were crowded with curiosities of every
                    description, and the house and its contents were shown, by tickets to admit four
                    persons, between 12 and 3 from May to October, but only one party was admitted
                    on each day, and the owner, although enamoured of notoriety, simulated
                    discontent at this limited intrusion into his privacy. His nephew, the reckless
                    third earl, died in 1791, and Horace succeeded to the peerage, but he never took
                    his place in the House of Lords, and sometimes signed his name as “the uncle of
                    the late earl of Orford.” All his life long he was the victim of the gout, but
                    he lived to extreme old age, and died unmarried, in Berkeley Square, London,
                    March 2, 1797, when his body was buried privately at Houghton. The ancient
                    estate of the family descended to the earl of Cholmondeley, whose ancestor had
                    married Horace Walpole’s younger sister. All Walpole’s printed books and
                    manuscripts were left to Robert Berry and his two daughters, Mary and Agnes;
                    their friendship had been very dear to the declining days of Walpole, who, it
                    has even been said, wished to marry Mary Berry. By his will each of the ladies
                    obtained a pecuniary legacy of £4000, and for their lives the house and garden,
                    formerly the abode of Kitty Clive, which adjoined Strawberry Hill. Strawberry
                    Hill went to Mrs Anne Damer, daughter of his lifelong friend General Conway, for
                    her life, but it was entailed on the countess dowager of Waldegrave and her
                    heirs. Walpole died worth £91,000 in the three per cents, and gave the whole of
                    it away, the chief legacy being £10,000 for his niece the duchess of Gloucester.
                    The collections of Strawberry Hill, which he had spent nearly fifty years in
                    amassing, were dispersed under the hammer of George Robins in 1842. They are
                    described in a catalogue of that date, and in a series of articles in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</hi> for that year.</p>
                <p>The pen was ever in Horace Walpole’s hands, and his entire compositions would
                    fill many volumes. His two works of imagination, the romance of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Castle of Otranto</hi> and the tragedy of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mysterious Mother,</hi> are now all but forgotten. The former, which purported
                    to be a story translated by William Marshal, gent., from the original Italian of
                    Onuphrio Muralto, canon of the church of St Nicholas at Otranto, was often
                    reprinted in England, and was translated into both French and Italian. By Sir
                    Walter Scott it was lauded to the skies for its power in raising the passions of
                    fear and pity; from Hazlitt it met with intense condemnation. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Mysterious Mother,</hi> a tragedy too horrible for representation
                    on any stage, was never intended for performance in public, and only fifty
                    copies of it were printed at Strawberry Hill. By Byron, who, like Horace
                    Walpole, affected extreme liberalism, and like him never forgot that he was born
                    within the purple, this tragedy was pronounced “of the highest order.” Several
                    of Walpole’s antiquarian works merit high praise. The volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign of King Richard the
                    Third,</hi> one of the earliest attempts to rehabilitate a character previously
                    stamped with infamy, showed acuteness and research. These doubts provoked
                    several answers, which are criticized in a supplement edited by Dr Hawtrey for
                    the Philobiblon Society. A work of more lasting reputation, which has retained
                    its vitality for more than a century, is entitled <hi rend="italic">Anecdotes of
                    Painting in England, with some Account of the Principal Artists; collected by
                    George Vertue, and now digested and published from his original manuscripts by
                    Horace Walpole</hi> (4 vols., 1762-71). Its value to art students and to
                    admirers of biographical literature demanded its frequent reproduction, and it
                    had the good fortune to be re-edited with additions by the Rev. James Dallaway
                    in five volumes (1826-28), and then again was revised and edited by R. N. Wornum
                    in 1849. A cognate volume, also based on the materials of Vertue, is entitled
                    the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Engravers Bom and Resident in England,</hi>
                    which, like its more famous predecessor, often passed through the press. On the
                    <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors of England</hi> Walpole,
                    whose professed liberalism only stopped short of the principles of
                    republicanism, spent many hours of toilsome research. The best edition is that
                    which appeared in five volumes, in 1806, under the competent editorship of
                    Thomas Park, who carefully verified and diligently augmented the labours of the
                    original author. As a senator himself, or as a private person following at a
                    distance the combats at St Stephen’s, Walpole recorded in a diary the chief
                    incidents in English politics. For twenty-seven years he studied, a silent
                    spectator for the most part, the characters of the chief personages who trod the
                    stage of politics, and when he quitted the scene he retained the acquaintance of
                    many of the chief actors. If he was sometimes prejudiced, he rarely distorted
                    the acts of those whom he disliked; and his prejudices, which lie on the
                    surface, were mainly against those whom he considered the traitors of his
                    father. These diaries extend from 1750 to 1783, and cover a period of momentous
                    importance in the annals of the national history. The <hi rend="italic">Memoirs
                    of the Last Ten Years of the Reign of George IT.</hi> was edited by Lord
                    Holland; its successor, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of King George
                    III.</hi>, was published under the editorial care of Sir Denis Le Marchant, who
                    poured into his annotations a vast store of information; the last volumes of the
                    series, <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Reign of George III. from 1771 to
                    1783,</hi> were edited and illustrated by Doran; aud to these works should be
                    added the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi> which Walpole wrote in 1788 for
                    the gratification of the Misses Berry. These labours would in themselves have
                    rendered the name of Horace Walpole famous for all time, but his delightful <hi
                    rend="italic">Letters</hi> are the crowning glory of his life. His
                    correspondents were numerous and widespread, but the chief of them were Cole the
                    clerical antiquary of Milton, Robert Jephson, an obscure play-writer in Ireland,
                    Mason the poet, Lord Hertford during his embassy in Paris, the countess of
                    Ossory, Lord Harcourt<pb break="no"

                    Conway, and Sir Horace Mann. With most of these friends he quarrelled, but the
                    friendship of the last two, in the former case through genuine liking, and in
                    the latter through his fortunate absence from England, was never interrupted.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> were published at different dates, but the
                    standard collection is that by Peter Cunningham (9 vols., 1857-59), and to it
                    should be added the volumes of the letters addressed to Walpole by his old
                    friend Madame du Deffand (1810, 4 vols.), and the publication of Dr Doran, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mann and Manners at the Court of Florence,</hi> which is founded
                    on the epistles sent in return to Walpole by the envoy-extraordinary. A handsome
                    little volume, <hi rend="italic">Horace Walpole and his World,</hi> consisting
                    of select passages from his letters, extracted and strung together in a simple
                    narrative by Mr L. B. Seeley, was issued in 1884. Walpole has been called “the
                    best letter-writer in the English language”; and few indeed are the names,
                    possibly none save Swift and Cowper, which can compare with his. In these
                    compositions his very foibles are penned for our amusement, and his love of
                    trifles—for, in the words of another Horace, he was ever “nescio quid meditans
                    nugarum et totus in illis”—minister to our instruction. To these friends he
                    communicated every fashionable scandal, every social event, and the details of
                    every political struggle in English life. The politicians and the courtiers of
                    his day were more akin to his character than were the chief authors of his age,
                    and the weakness of his intellectual perceptions stands out most prominently in
                    his estimates of such writers as Johnson and Goldsmith, Gibbon and Hume. On many
                    occasions he displayed great liberality of disposition, and he bitterly deplored
                    for the rest of his days his neglect of the unhappy Chatterton.</p>
                <p>Abundant information about Horace Walpole will be found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs</hi> of him and of his contemporaries edited by Eliot Warburton,

                    extracts from the journals and correspondence of Miss Berry; and it would be
                    unpardonable to omit mention of Macaulay’s sketch of Walpole's life and
