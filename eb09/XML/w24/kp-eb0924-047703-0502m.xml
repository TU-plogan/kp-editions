                    rostrum, and this gives the antennae the appearance of emerging half-way along
                    the rostrum. The mouth appendages are small; the mandibles, however, are stout.
                    The palps are very short and conical as a rule. The body is usually small; in
                    shape it varies very much. The elytra are very hard, and in some cases fused
                    with one another, rendering flight impossible. The larvae are white, fleshy,
                    apodal grubs, with a series of tubercles along each side of the body; the head
                    is round, and bears strong jaws, and sometimes rudimentary ocelli. They are
                    exclusively phytophagous. The <hi rend="italic">Rhyncophora</hi> embrace three
                    families,—(1) the <hi rend="italic">Curculionidae,</hi> or true weevils, (2) the
                    <hi rend="italic">Brenthidae,</hi> and (3) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bruchidae.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Curculionidae</hi> form one of the largest families amongst
                    the <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera,</hi> the number of species described exceeding
                    10,000, arranged in 1150 genera. The antennae are elbowed, and clavate, with the
                    basal portion inserted in a groove. The third tarsal joint is generally bilobed.
                    Over 400 species exist in Great Britain, few of which exceed half an inch in
                    length. The genera <hi rend="italic">Phyllobius</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polydrosus</hi> include some of the most beautiful insects found in
                    Britain,—their brilliancy, like that of the <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera,</hi>
                    being due to the presence of microscopic scales. The diamond beetle of South
                    America, <hi rend="italic">Entimus imperialis,</hi> is another singularly
                    beautiful weevil; its colour is black, studded with spangles of golden green.
                    The immense family of the <hi rend="italic">Curculionidae</hi> includes members
                    which differ greatly from one another in size, colour, and appearance; even the
                    rostrum, the most striking common characteristic, varies greatly. The form of
                    the body is very various: some are rounded or oval, others elongated, almost
                    linear; some are covered with warty protuberances, whilst others are smooth and
                    shining, often with a metallic lustre.</p>
                <p>One of the commonest members of this family in Great Britain is the Nut Weevil,
                    <hi rend="italic">Balaninus nucum.</hi> It is of a brownish colour, varied with
                    yellow, the legs reddish. Its rostrum is unusually long, being five-sixths of
                    the body length in the female, and slightly shorter in the male. The antennae
                    are 7-jointed. The first three joints are much longer than thick; the four
                    following are shorter, and the seventh not longer than thick. The larva is very
                    common in hazel nuts and filberts. When the nuts are about half-grown, the
                    female bores, with its rostrum, a minute hole in the still comparatively soft
                    nut shell, and deposits an egg within the nut. The <hi rend="italic">egg</hi> is
                    said to be pushed in by means of the long rostrum. As the nut grows the slight
                    puncture becomes almost obliterated, so that it is unnoticed by all but the most
                    observant eye. The larva is a thick white grub with a brownish head, bearing
                    fleshy tubercles along its side. It feeds upon the substance of the nut. The
                    nuts which are infested by this insect are usually the first to fall to the
                    ground; the larva then bores a round hole through the nut shell, by means of its
                    jaws, and creeps out. It hides itself in the ground during the winter, and in
                    the spring it passes into the pupa stage, from which it emerges about August as
                    the full-grown insect. A nearly allied form, <hi rend="italic">Balaninus
                    glandium,</hi> attacks both hazel nuts and acorns.</p>
                <p>In an unobtrusive way weevils do immense harm to vegetation. This is effected not
                    so much by their numbers and their powers of consumption, as amongst
                    caterpillars, but by their habits of attacking the essential parts of a plant,
                    and causing by their injuries the death of the plant affected. They destroy the
                    young buds, shoots, and fruits, and attack the young plants in their most
                    delicate organs. Many of them devour seed, as the Corn Weevils, <hi
                    rend="italic">Calandra granaria</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Wheat)</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">C. oryzae,</hi> and in this way vegetation is severely
                    injured, and its spread seriously checked. Others cause much damage in forests,
                    by boring under the bark and through the wood of trees, whilst some even burrow
                    in the tissue of the leaves.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Brenthidae</hi> are by some authorities included in the
                    family <hi rend="italic">Curculionidae.</hi> They include some 275 species, and
                    are almost exclusively tropical. Their antennae are 11-jointed, not elbowed. The
                    rostrum is straight and very long. The shape of the body is very long and
                    narrow, the first and second abdominal segment being very long. Allied to these
                    is the sub-family <hi rend="italic">Attelabides.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bruchidae</hi> form a somewhat larger family than the
                    foregoing, containing over 400 species. The antennae are straight, and inserted
                    upon the head just in front of the eyes; they are 11-jointed, and serrated or
                    toothed in the inside. The rostrum is short. <hi rend="italic">Bruchus pisi</hi>
                    causes considerable damage to pease; during the spring the beetle lays its eggs
                    in the young pea, which is devoured by the larva which hatches out in it. (A. E.
