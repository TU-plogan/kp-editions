                <p><label type="entry">WILLIAM IV</label>. (1765-1837), king of England, was the
                    third son of George III. He was born at Windsor, 21st August 1765. When he was
                    fourteen years old he was sent to sea as a midshipman under Admiral Digby. Next
                    year he sailed under Rodney and took part in the action off Cape St Vincent
                    (16th January 1780). During the rest of the war the young prince saw plenty of
                    service, for which he imbibed a strong liking, and so laid the foundation of his
                    popularity. On the conclusion of the war he travelled in Germany, visiting
                    Hanover and Berlin, where he was entertained by Frederick the Great. In 1785 he
                    passed for lieutenant; next year he was made captain and stationed in the West
                    Indies. Shortly after 1787, being tired of his station, he sailed home without
                    orders, and was punished for his insubordination by being obliged to stay at
                    Plymouth till his ship was refitted, when he again sailed for the West
                    Indies.</p>
                <p>In 1789 he was made duke of Clarence. When war was declared against the French
                    republic in 1793, he strongly supported it and was anxious for active
                    employment; but, though he was made rear-admiral of the red, he could obtain no
                    command. Thus condemned to inactivity, he amused or revenged himself by joining
                    the prince of Wales and the duke of York in their opposition <pb break="no"

                    dissipations of society, and his hearty geniality and bluff, sailor-like manners
                    gained him popularity, though they did not secure him respect. He took his seat
                    in the House of Lords, where he defended the extravagancies of the prince of
                    Wales, spoke on the Divorce Bill, vehemently opposed the emancipation of slaves,
                    and defended slavery on the ground of his experience in the West Indies.
                    Meanwhile he formed a connexion with Mrs Jordan, the actress, with whom he lived
                    on terms of mutual affection and fidelity for nearly twenty years, and the union
                    was only broken off eventually for political reasons. During all this period the
                    prince had lived in comparative obscurity. The death of Princess Charlotte in
                    1817 brought him forward as in the line of succession to the crown. In 1818 he
                    married Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, a lady half his age, without special
                    attractions, but of a strong, self-willed nature, which enabled her subsequently
                    to obtain great influence over her husband. On the death of the duke of York in
                    1827 the duke of Clarence became heir to the throne, and in the same year he was
                    appointed lord high admiral. 1n discharging the functions of that office he
                    endeavoured to assume independent control of naval affairs, although his patent
                    precluded him from acting without the advice of two members of his council. This
                    involved him in a quarrel with Sir George Cockburn, in which he had to give way.
                    As he still continued to act in defiance of rules, the king was at length
                    obliged to call upon him to resign.</p>
                <p>On 28th June 1830 the death of George IV. placed him on the throne. During the
                    first two years of his reign England underwent an agitation more violent than
                    any from which it had suffered since 1688. William IV. was well-meaning and
                    conscientious; but his timidity and irresolution drove ministers to despair,
                    while his anxiety to avoid extremes and his want of insight into affairs
                    prolonged a dangerous crisis and brought the country to the verge of revolution.
                    Immediately after his accession the revolution of July broke out in France and
                    gave a great impulse to the reform movement in England. The king, though he
                    called himself an “old Whig,” did not dismiss the Tory ministry which had
                    governed the country during the last two years of his brother’s reign; but the
                    elections for the new parliament placed them in a minority. Within a fortnight
                    of the opening of parliament they were beaten on a motion for the reform of the
                    civil list, and resigned. Lord Grey undertook to form a ministry, with the
                    avowed intention of bringing in a large measure of reform. This was not in
                    itself displeasing to the king, who had liberal tendencies, and a few years
                    before had supported Catholic emancipation. But, when the struggle in parliament
                    began, his disinclination to take up a decided attitude soon exposed the
                    Government to difficulties. The first Reform Bill was introduced on 1st March
                    1831; the second reading was carried on 21st March by a majority of one. Shortly
                    afterwards the Government were beaten in committee, and offered to resign. The
                    king declined to accept their resignation, but at the same time was unwilling to
                    dissolve, although it was obvious that in the existing parliament a ministry
                    pledged to reform could not retain office. From this dilemma William was rescued
                    by the conduct of the opposition, which, anxious to bring on a change of
                    ministry, moved an address against dissolution. Regarding this as an attack on
                    his prerogative, William at once dissolved parliament (April 1831). The
                    elections gave the ministry an overwhelming majority. The second Reform Bill was
                    brought in in June, and passed its third reading (21st September) by a majority
                    of 109. A fortnight later (8th October) the Lords threw out the Bill by a
                    majority of 4L For an account of the subsequent stages of the struggle, see <hi

                <p>During the rest of his reign William ΓV. had not much opportunity of active
                    political interference, but on one other occasion he made an unjustifiable use
                    of his prerogative. Two years after the passing of the Reform Bill the ministry
                    of Lord Grey had become unpopular. In July 1834 Lord Grey himself retired and
                    Lord Melbourne took the lead. There were divergences of opinion in the cabinet,
                    and the king strongly objected to the ministerial policy respecting the Irish
                    Church. On the shallow pretext that Lord Al thorp’s removal to the Upper House
                    would weaken the ministry in the House of Commons, where, however, they still
                    had a majority, he suddenly dismissed them and summoned Sir Robert Peel (14th
                    November). Peel’s ministry, containing many members who had been in the
                    government on the king’s accession, was called from its short duration “the
                    ministry of the hundred days.” Its formation clearly indicated that the Whig
                    proclivities of the king, which had never been more than partial or lukewarm,
                    had wholly disappeared. The step was regarded with general disapprobation. It
                    was immediately followed by a dissolution, and the ministry soon found
                    themselves in a minority. Beaten on Lord John Russell’s motion respecting the
                    Irish Church (3d April 1835), Peel resigned and Melbourne again came into power.
                    Under him the Whigs retained the lead during the remainder of the reign. This
                    <hi rend="italic">coup d’êtat</hi> of November 1834 was the last occasion on
                    which the English sovereign has attempted to impose an unpopular ministry on the
                    majority in parliament.</p>
                <p>In May 1837 the king began to show signs of debility, and died from an affection
                    of the heart on the 20th of June, leaving behind him the memory of a genial,
                    frank, warmhearted man, but a blundering, though well-intentioned prince. He w
