                    rend="italic">trump</hi> (corrupted from “triumph ”) was commonly played in
                    England. A game called <hi rend="italic">trwnfi</hi> is mentioned as early as
                    1526, and <hi rend="italic">triumphus Hispanicus</hi> in 1541. <hi rend="italic"
                    >La triomphe</hi> occurs in the list of games played by Gargantua (Rabelais,
                    first half of 16th century). In Florio’s <hi rend="italic">Worlds of Wordes</hi>
                    (1598) <hi rend="italic">trionfo</hi> is defined as “the play called trump or
                    ruff.” It is probable that the game referred to by the writers quoted is <hi
                    rend="italic">la triomphe</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> qì</hi> the early
                    editions of the <hi rend="italic">Academie des Jeux.</hi> It is important to
                    note that this game, called by Cotton “French ruff,” is similar to écarté.
                    “English ruff-and-honours,” also described by Cotton, is similar to whist. If we
                    admit that ruff and trump are convertible terms, of which there is scarcely a
                    doubt, the game of trump was the precursor of whist. A purely English origin
                    may, therefore, be claimed for trump (not <hi rend="italic">la triomphe).</hi>
                    No record is known to exist of the invention of this game, nor of the mode of
                    its growth into ruff-and-honours, and finally into whist. The earliest reference
                    to trump in English is believed to occur in a sermon by Latimer, “On the Card,”
                    preached at Cambridge, in Advent, about the year 1529. He says, “The game that
                    we play at shall be the triumph. . . . Now turn up your trump,. . . and cast
                    your trump, your heart, on this card.” The game of trump is frequently mentioned
                    in the second half of the 16 th century. In <hi rend="italic">Gammer Gurton</hi>
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">s Needle</hi> (1575) Dame Chat says, “We be fast set at
                    trumpe.” Eliot <hi rend="italic">(Fruits for the French,</hi> 1593) calls trump
                    “a verie common ale-house game.” Rice <hi rend="italic">(Invective against
                    Vices,</hi> printed before 1600) observes that “renouncing the trompe and
                    comming in againe” <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> revoking intentionally) is a
                    common sharper’s trick. Decker <hi rend="italic">(Belmaη of London,</hi> 1608)
                    speaks of the deceits practised at “tromp and such like games.” Trump also
                    occurs in <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> (written about 1607), with
                    other punning allusions to card-playing—</p>
                <p>“She, Eros, has</p>
                <p>Packed cards with Caesar, and false-played my glory Unto an enemy’s triumph.”—Act
                    iv. sc. 12.</p>
                <p>Ruff-and-honours, if not the same game as trump, was probably the same with the
                    addition of a score for the four highest cards of the trump suit. A description
                    of the game is first met with in <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Compleat</hi><hi rend="italic">Gamester</hi> (1674) by Charles Cotton. He
                    states that ruff-and-honours <hi rend="italic">(alias</hi> slamm) and whist are
                    games very commonly known in England. It was played by four players with
                    partners, and it was compulsory to follow suit when able. The cards ranked as at
                    whist, and honours were scored as now. Twelve cards were dealt to each player,
                    four being left in the stock. The top card of the stock was turned up for
                    trumps. The holder of the ace of trumps was allowed to <hi rend="italic">ruff,
                    i.e.,</hi> to take in the stock and to put out four cards from his hand. The
                    game was played nine up; and at the point of eight honours could be called, as
                    at long whist. Cotton adds that at whist there was no stock. The deuces were put
                    out and the bottom card was turned up for trumps.</p>
                <p>It is believed that the earliest mention of whist is by Taylor, the Water Poet
                    <hi rend="italic">(Motto,</hi> 1621). He spells the word “whisk.” The earliest
                    known use of the present spelling is in <hi rend="italic">Hudibras, the Second
                    Part</hi> (spurious), 1663. The word is then spelt indifferently whisk or whist
                    for about half a century. Cotton (1674) spells it both ways. Seymour <hi
                    rend="italic">(Court Gamester,</hi> 1734) has “whist, vulgarly called whisk.”
                    While whist was undergoing this change of name, there was associated with it the
                    additional title of <hi rend="italic">swabbers</hi> (probably allied to sweep,
                    or sweepstakes). Fielding <hi rend="italic">(History of Mr Jonathan Wild)</hi>
                    says that whisk-and-swab-bers was “the game then [1682] in chief vogue.” Grose
                    <hi rend="italic">(Dictionary</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Vulgar Tongxιe,</hi>
                    1785) states that swabbers are “the ace of hearts, knave of clubs, ace and duce
                    of trumps at whist.” The true function of the swabbers is not positively known;
                    it is probable that the holders of these cards were entitled to receive a
                    certain stake from the other players. Swabbers dropped out of general use during
                    the 18th century. The points of the game rose from nine to ten (“nine in all,”
                    Cotton, 1725; “ten in all,” Seymour, 1734, “rectified according to the present
                    standard of play”). Simultaneously with this alteration, or closely following
                    it, the entire pack of fifty-two cards was used, the deuces being no longer
                    discarded. This improvement introduces the odd trick, an element of great
                    interest in modern whist. Early in the 18th century whist was not a fashionable
                    game. The Hon. Daines Barrington <hi rend="italic">(Archaeologia,</hi> vol.
                    viii.) says it was the game of the servants’ hall. Contemporary writers refer to
                    it in a disparaging way, as being only fit for hunting men and country squires,
                    and not for fine ladies or people of quality. According to Barrington, whist was
                    first played on scientific principles by a party of gentlemen who frequented the
                    Crown Coffee House in Bedford Row, London, about 1728. They laid down the
                    following rules :—“Lead from the strong suit; study your partner’s hand; and
                    attend to the score.” Shortly after the celebrated Edmond <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hoyle</hi><hi rend="italic">(g.vf)</hi> published his <hi rend="italic">Short
                    Treatise</hi> (1743). It has been surmised by some that Hoyle belonged to the
                    Crown Coffee House party. This, however, is only a conjecture. There is abundant
                    evidence to show that, in the middle of the 18th century, whist was regularly
                    played at the coffee houses of London and in fashionable society. And it is
                    notorious that, ever since the time of Hoyle, the game has continued to increase
                    in public estimation.</p>
                <p>It will be of interest to mark the successive stages through which whist has
                    passed from the time of Cotton to the present day. The only suggestions as to
                    play in Cotton are that, “though you have but mean cards in your own hand, yet
                    you may play them so suitable to those in your partner’s hand that he may either
                    trump them or play the best of that suit;” also that “you ought to have a
                    special eye to what cards are play’d out, that you may know by that means either
                    what to play if you lead or how to trump securely and advantagiously.” It
                    appears from this that the main ideas were to make trumps by ruffing, to make
                    winning cards, and to watch the fall of the cards with these objects. In the
                    rules laid down by the Crown Coffee House school a distinct advance is to be
                    noticed. Their first rule, “Lead from the strong suit,” shows a knowledge of the
                    game only to be acquired by cafeful study, together with a long train of
                    reasoning. The arguments in favour of the original strong-suit lead would be out
                    of place here; they are to be found in any modern manual. Their second rule,
                    “Study your partner’s hand,” though sound, is rather vague, and savours somewhat
                    of a repetition of Cotton. Their third rule, “Attend to the score,” if amended
                    into “Play to the score,” is most valuable. From the Crown Coffee House school
                    to Hoyle is rather a wide jump; but there is no intervening record. Whether or
                    not Hoyle derived at least a part of his inspiration from <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n579/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0579-0544"/> that school, certain it is that in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Short Treatise</hi> he endorsed and illustrated their rules. He
                    also brought the doctrine of probabilities to bear on the game, and gave a
                    number of cases which show a remarkable insight into the play. Two examples will
                    suffice. He distinguishes between the lead of king from king, queen, knave, and
                    one small card and of knave from king, queen, knave, and more than one small
                    card. He also directs the third hand holding queen, ten, nine, and a small card
                    to play the nine, not the small one, to his partner’s lead of ace. This whist is
                    so good, and so advanced, that even now, a hundred and fifty years later, only
                    the very best players can be depended on to observe and profit by it.</p>
                <p>About 1770 was published Payne’s <hi rend="italic">Maxims for Playing the Game of
                    Whist.</hi> The advance in this book is decided. Leading from five trumps, in
                    the hope of bringing in your own or your partner’s long suit, is made into a
                    general rule. And here, for the first time, the rule with respect to returned
                    leads is printed, viz., “In returning your partner’s lead play the best you
                    have, when you hold but three originally.” This rule, of all elementary ones,
                    is, according to Clay, “the most important for the observance of whist-players.”
                    Hoyle does not give any such rule for returned leads, whence it may be inferred
                    that no settled practice prevailed in his day. Matthews’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Advice to the Young Whist-Player</hi> (anon., 1804) repeats the “maxims of the
                    old school,” with “observations on those he thinks erroneous” and “with several
                    new ones.” Matthews’s book was a valuable contribution to whist literature, but
                    some of the maxims which he thinks erroneous are now generally allowed to be
                    correct. Thus, he prefers leading a single card to opening a long weak suit, the
                    modern practice being just the contrary. He rejects leads from suits of three
                    cards, except when the leader has reason to think it is his partner’s suit; then
                    he should “play off the highest, though the king or queen,” and he adds, <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ii</hi><hi rend="italic">N.B.—</hi> This is contrary
                    to the general practice, but undoubtedly right.” Assuming his statement to be
                    true, the general practice was evidently wrong. Matthews is sometimes credited
                    with the discovery of the modern principle with regard to discarding. The old
                    rule was always to discard from the weakest suit. The modern rule is to discard
                    from the best protected suit when the opponents have the command of trumps. What
                    Matthews does say is, “If weak in trumps, keep guard to your adversaries’ suits;
                    if strong, throw away from them.” This advice, though good, does not amount to
                    anything like a principle of play.</p>
                <p>Soon after Matthews wrote, the points of the game were cut down from ten to five.
                    Clay’s account of this change is that, about the beginning of the 19th century,
                    Lord Peterborough having lost a large sum of money, the players proposed to make
                    the game five up, in order to give the loser a chance of recovering his loss.
                    The new game, short whist, was found to be so lively that it soon became
                    general, and eventually superseded the long game. This produced in 1835 <hi
                    rend="italic">Short Whist</hi> by “Major A.” “Major A.” is only Matthews done
                    into short whist by a literary hack, who substituted “five” for “ten,” and so on
                    throughout. The book would not call for notice here, but that Major A. was
                    regarded as the authority on whist for a considerable time, probably because it
                    was erroneously supposed that the author was the well-known Major Aubrey, one of
                    the best players of his day. Similarly “Coelebs” <hi rend="italic">(Laws and
                    Practice of Whist,</hi> 1851), who mainly repeats former writers, only calls for
                    mention because he first printed in his second edition (1856) an explanation of
                    the call for trumps. Calling for trumps was first recognized as part of the game
                    by the players at Graham’s Club about 1840. Long whist may be said to have died
                    about the same time that Major A.’s book was published.</p>
                <p>The new game necessarily caused a change in the style of play, as recorded by
                    James Clay in <hi rend="italic">The Laws of Short Whist, and a Treatise on the
                    Game</hi> (1864). That distinguished player says that, when he first remembered
                    whist, its celebrities were for the most part those who had been educated at
                    long whist. In his judgment the old school was very accurate and careful, but
                    was wanting in the dash and brilliancy of the best modern players, and sinned by
                    playing what is now called a backward game.</p>
                <p>Whist then travelled, and about 1830 some of the best French whist-players, with
                    Deschapelles at their head, modified and improved the old-fashioned system. They
                    were but little influenced by the traditions of long whist, and were not content
                    merely to imitate the English. The French game was the scorn and horror of the
                    old school, who vehemently condemned its rash trump leads. Those who adopted the
                    practice of the new school were, however, found to be winning players. By way of
                    example, the English player of the old school never thought of playing to win
                    the game before it was saved; the French player never thought of saving the game
                    until he saw he could not win it. As between the two systems, Clay preferred the
                    rash attack to the cautious defence, and recommended a middle course, leaning
                    more to the new than to the old doctrine.</p>
                <p>Dr Pole <hi rend="italic">(Philosophy of Whist,</hi> 1883) remarks that the long
                    experience of adepts had led to the introduction of many improvements in detail
                    since the time of Hoyle, but that nothing had been done to reduce the various
                    rules of the game to a systematic form until between 1850 and 1860, when a knot
                    of young men proceeded to a thorough investigation of whist, and in 1862 one of
                    the members of this “little whist school” brought out a work, under the
                    pseudonym of “Cavendish,” which “gave for the first time the rules which
                    constitute the art of whist-playing according to the most modern form of the
                    game.” The little school was first brought prominently into notice by an article
                    on whist in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> of January 1871. On the
                    appearance of this article it was fiercely debated by the press whether the
                    “little school” did anything extraordinary, whether they elaborated anything, or
                    compassed anything, or advanced a science, or whether they drew their
                    inspiration from external sources, and merely gave a systematic arrangement to
                    what was well known and procurable before. It was finally allowed that the
                    little school did originate something, as they were the first to give, logically
                    and completely, the reasoning on which the principles of play are based. Whist
                    had previously been treated as though the “art” of the game depended on the
                    practice of a number of arbitrary conventions. But the fact is that all rules of
                    whist-play depend upon and are referable to general principles. Hence, as soon
                    as these general principles were stated, and the reasons for their adoption were
                    argued, players began to discuss and to propose innovations on the previously
                    established rules of play.</p>
                <p>A critical examination of the more important proposals made since 1862 may here
                    be appropriately introduced. The older authorities laid down the rule, Discard
                    from the "weakest suit. It was shrewdly noticed that, when command of trumps was
                    shown by the adversaries, the rule was more honoured in the breach than in the
                    observance, the reason being that, when the attack was adverse, the instinct of
                    the player prompted him to guard his weak suits. Hence the rule was modified,
                    and it became the practice to discard from the best protected suit when the
                    command of trumps is with the opponents. There can be no doubt as to the
                    soundness of this modern rule of play, and it has been generally accepted. It
                    was suddenly discovered that Matthews advanced a similar doctrine.</p>

                <p>His pretensions to this distinction have already been examined. Soon after this
                    (1872) followed the echo of the call for trumps. Calling for trumps, as all
                    whist-players know, is effected by throwing away an unnecessarily high card.
                    When the lower card is subsequently played, a royal invitation is given to the
                    partner to abandon his own game and to lead trumps, there being greatstrength in
                    the caller’s hand. In practice it was found for various reasons (for which
                    manuals must be consulted) to be highly advantageous for the caller’s partner to
                    be able to indicate whether he also had numerical strength in trumps <hi
                    rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> a minimum of four). The rule was eventually adopted
                    that the caller’s partner with at least four trumps should, if he had an
                    opportunity, call in response, or <hi rend="italic">echo,</hi> by also throwing
                    away an unnecessarily high card; of course, if he had the opportunity, and
                    refrained from echoing, he had less than four trumps. This rule of play was not
                    appreciated at the time; but now (1888) it has the adherence of all thoughtful
                    players.</p>
                <p>Contemporaneously with the echo, the lead of the penultimate card from suits of
                    five or more cards was strenuously advocated in some quarters, and as
                    strenuously opposed in others. Up to this date it had been the general practice,
                    when leading a low card from a strong suit, to prefer the lowest card of the
                    suit, irrespective of the number held. But some acute players departed from this
                    rule when they held an intermediate sequence of three cards. Thus, with king,
                    ten, nine, eight, two (intermediate sequence of ten, nine, eight), they would
                    lead the eight in preference to the two, as a card of protection, in case the
                    partner should happen to be very weak in the suit, when the eight must force an
                    honour, whereas the two might enable the opponent to win the first trick with a
                    six or a seven. Equally acute partners soon observed that, when a strong-suit
                    player began with, say, an eight, and afterwards played a small card, the card
                    must have been from a suit of at least five cards. As soon as this inference was
                    established, the acute leader argued that, if he could show number in his strong
                    suit (an important exhibition in modern whist), he need not confine this
                    exhibition to those suits only in which he held an intermediate sequence. He
                    contended that the right play is to lead the lowest but one (or the penultimate)
                    from all suits containing five or more cards, with which the less advanced
                    player would begin by leading the lowest. Then ensued the grand battle of the
                    penultimate. The old players regarded it with the same “horror” as they had
                    formerly displayed with respect to the French school, and even went so far as to
                    stigmatize it as a private understanding and as cheating. The next stock
                    objection raised was that it was an innovation. These feeble arguments were soon
                    disposed of. The method was accessible to every one through the medium of the
                    press; and, as Clay <hi rend="italic">{Short Whist,</hi> 1864) rightly observes,
                    “It is fair to give your partner any intimation which could be given, if the
                    cards were placed on the table, each exactly in the same manner as the others,
                    by a machine, the players being out of sight and hearing each of the others.”
                    The more genuine strictures were that penultimate leads complicate the game,
                    that they give no advantage to the players, and that they simulate leads from
                    weak suits (from which the highest is led). It is very doubtful whether
                    penultimate leads do complicate the game. But, admitting for the sake of
                    argument that they do, it is no objection to an intellectual pastime that it
                    exercises the brains of the players. The question whether those who practise
                    penultimate leads reap any advantage therefrom is one which can only be
                    determined by experience. The best test is the habit of those who play for a
                    stake. They all hope to win; they are not likely to persist obstinately in a
                    practice by which they find they gain nothing; and at the present moment (1888)
                    there is scarcely a player of any ability who deliberately rejects the
                    penultimate lead when he has a partner capable of understanding it. Hence it may
                    be inferred that the experience of some sixteen years has resulted in a decided
                    feeling that penultimate leads are on the whole advantageous to those who
                    practise them. The simulation of a lead from a weak suit has no <hi
                    rend="italic">locus standi</hi> if it is borne in mind that original leads are
                    contemplated, and that the original lead of all good players is from a strong
                    suit. James Clay, the greatest player of his day, was at first opposed to
                    penultimate leads. When he had considered the full arguments for and against
                    them, he “put them to the test of his individual experience, acknowledged their
                    value, and did not hesitate to give his adhesion to them.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The consideration of the proper card to lead from five-card suits naturally led
                    to that of the correct lead from more than five cards, in the case of suits
                    opened with a small card. General Drayson <hi rend="italic">{Art of Practical
                    Whist,</hi> 1879) was the first to lay down that six of a suit can be shown by
                    leading the antepenultimate card. Thus, from queen, nine, seven, four, three,
                    two of a suit he advised the lead of the four. General Drayson’s proposal did
                    not find favour with many players, though it distinctly follows •where the
                    penultimate from five is admitted.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, leads from high cards, having regard to the number held in the suit,
                    had not escaped attention. Thus, from suits headed by ace, queen, knave it had
                    always been the custom to lead ace, then queen, irrespective of number. The
                    third hand, holding king and small ones, was expected to pass the queen. But, if
                    the lead was from five cards or more, and the third hand held king and two small
                    ones, this play often resulted in blocking the leader’s strong suit. It was
                    therefore held, after some discussion and tentative play, that with more than
                    four of the suit the leader should proceed with knave after ace, in order to
                    invite his partner to put on king, if it remained singly guarded. From this it
                    follows that a similar distinction should be drawn as to the second lead from
                    queen, knave, ten, according to the number of accompanying small cards. If the
                    lead is from four cards only, queen should be led, then knave; if from more than
                    four, queen, then ten. These innovations were introduced about 1874-75. It will
                    be observed that the original idea in choosing a penultimate or antepenultimate
                    card was to protect the suit, and that the original idea in choosing the higher
                    or lower of two high indifferent cards was to give the partner the option of
                    unblocking. Behind this there was seen to lie the collateral advantage of
                    showing number. Hence these rules of play were frequently resorted to merely for
                    the purpose of telling whether four or more than four cards of the suit selected
                    to lead from were present in the hand of the original leader.</p>
                <p>So far the indicated method, sound enough in itself, amounted only to the
                    enunciation of modified rules of play. It yet remained for some one to propound
                    a constant method of treating all leads, and to classify the isolated rules so
                    as to render it possible to lay down general principles. This was accomplished
                    in 1883-84 by Nicholas Browse Trist of New Orleans, U.S.A.; and hence the method
                    of leading reduced to form by him is known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >American leads.</hi> American leads propose a systematic course of play when
                    opening and continuing the lead from the strong suit. First, with regard to a
                    low card led. When you open a strong suit with a low card, lead your fourth
                    best. When opening a four-card suit with a low card, the lowest, which is the
                    fourth best, is the card selected. When opening a five-card suit with <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n581/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0581-0546"/> a low card, the penultimate card is selected.
                    Instead of calling it the penultimate, call it the fourth best. So with a
                    six-card suit; but, instead of antepenultimate, say fourth best. And so on with
                    suits of more than six cards: disregard all the small cards and lead the fourth
                    best. Secondly, with regard to a high card led, followed by a low card. When you
                    open a strong suit with a high card and next lead a low card, lead your original
                    fourth best. The former rule was to proceed with the lowest. Thus, from ace,
                    knave, nine, eight, seven, two the leader was expected to open with the ace, and
                    then to lead the two. An American leader would lead ace, then eight. Thirdly,
                    with regard to a high card led, followed by a high card. When you remain with
                    two high indifferent cards, lead the higher if you opened a suit of four, the
                    lower if you opened a suit of five or more. Examples have already been given of
                    the cases of ace, queen, knave, &amp;c., and of queen, knave, ten, &amp;c. On
                    the promulgation of these general principles another pitched battle followed,
                    which raged with great fury. The objections urged against American leads are
                    much the same as those against the penultimate, viz.,—(1) that they complicate
                    the game, (2) that they seldom affect the result, (3) that the information
                    afforded may be of more use to the opponents than to the leader’s partner. The
                    complication argument has but little foundation in fact. All an American leader
                    asks his partner to observe is that, when he originally leads a low card, he
                    holds exactly three cards higher than the one led; when he originally leads a
                    high card, and next a low one, he still holds exactly two cards higher than the
                    second card led; and when he originally leads a high card, and follows it with a
                    high card, he indicates in many cases, to those who know the analysis of leads
                    (as laid down in whist books), whether the strong suit consisted originally of
                    four or of more than four cards. It cannot be denied that moderate players may
                    lack the quick perception which will enable them to take full advantage of the
                    information afforded; but that is no reason why better players should be
                    deprived of the advantage, and it is no reason why the moderate player should
                    not learn to speak the language of whist intelligibly, for the benefit of
                    partners who do understand it. The answer to the effect-on-the-result argument
                    is that American leads add but little which is new to the game. They only aim at
                    consolidating the received practice, and at extending a law of uniformity to
                    cases not previously provided for. The who-gets-the-best-of-the-information
                    argument is more difficult to meet. Under other whist conditions experience
                    tells that it is advantageous in the long run to convey information of strength,
                    notwithstanding its publication to the whole table. It is most improbable,
                    therefore, that a player will be at a disadvantage by publishing too much and
                    too precise information as to his strength. But it must be admitted that this is
                    not necessarily a <hi rend="italic">sequitur</hi>; long experience can only
                    decide on which side the balance of advantage lies. Five years’ experience is
                    hardly enough. But it may be remarked that no instances are known of players
                    who, having once adopted these leads, have voluntarily relinquished them.</p>
                <p>The introduction of American leads rendered it necessary thoroughly to overhaul
                    the received play of the second and third hands,—of the second hand, in
                    consequence of the information given, as to when he should cover or pass the
                    card led; of the third hand, for the same reason, when he should play to unblock
                    his partner’s long suit. A discussion of these refinements would be out of place
                    here. It is to be found in <hi rend="italic">Whist Developments,</hi> by
                    “Cavendish” (1885).</p>
                <p>A printed existence was first given to the laws of whist by Hoyle in 1743. The
                    fourteen laws then issued were subsequently increased to twenty-four. These laws
                    were the authority until 1760, when the members of White’s and Saunders’s
                    Chocolate Houses revised them. The revised laws (nearly all Hoyle) were accepted
                    by whist players for over a century, notwithstanding that they were very
                    incomplete. In 1863 the Turf Club undertook to frame a more comprehensive code,
                    and to solicit the co-operation of the Portland Club. The laws of short whist,
                    approved by these two clubs, were brought out in 1864. They were at once adopted
                    by numerous other clubs, and are now (1888) the standard by which all disputed
                    points are decided.</p>

                    cards of equal value, unless such cards are the two highest, cut again; should
                    they be the two lowest, a fresh cut is necessary to decide which of those two
                    deals.</p>
                <p>19. Three players cutting cards of equal value cut again. Should the fourth (or
                    remaining) card be the highest, the two lowest of the new cut are partners, the
                    lower of those two the dealer. Should the fourth card be the lowest, the two
                    highest are partners, the original lowest the dealer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cutting Out.—20.</hi> At the end of a rubber, should admission
                    be claimed by any one or by two candidates, he who has, or they who have, played
                    a greater number of consecutive rubbers than the others is, or are, out. But,
                    when all have played the same number, they must cut to decide upon the
                    out-goers; the highest are out.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Entry and Re-entry.—</hi> 21. A candidate wishing to enter a
                    table must declare such intention prior to any of the players having cut a card,
                    either for the purpose of commencing a fresh rubber or of cutting out.</p>
                <p>22. In the formation of fresh tables those candidates who have neither belonged
                    to, nor played at, any other table have the prior right of entry; the others
                    decide their right of admission by cutting.</p>
                <p>23. Any one quitting a table prior to the conclusion of a rubber may, with
                    consent of the other three players, appoint a substitute in his absence during
                    that rubber.</p>
                <p>24. A player cutting into one table whilst belonging to another loses his right
                    of re-entry into that latter, and takes his chance of cutting in as if he were a
                    fresh candidate.</p>
                <p>25. If any one break up a table, the remaining players have the prior right to
                    him of entry into any other; and, should there not be sufficient vacancies at
                    such other table to admit all those candidates, they settle their precedence by
                    cutting.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shuffling.—</hi> 26. The pack must neither be shuffled below
                    the table nor so that the face of any card be seen.</p>
                <p>27. The pack must not be shuffled during the play of the hand.</p>
                <p>28. A pack, having been played with, must neither be shuffled by dealing it into
                    packets nor across the table.</p>
                <p>29. Each player has a right to shuffle, once only, except as provided by rule 32,
                    prior to a deal, after a false cut, or when a new deal has occurred.</p>
                <p>30. The dealer’s partner must collect the cards for the ensuing deal, and has the
                    first right to shuffle that pack.</p>
                <p>31. Each player after shuffling must place the cards, properly collected and face
                    downwards, to the left of the player about to deal.</p>
                <p>32. The dealer has always the right to shuffle last; but, should a card or cards
                    be seen during his shuffling or whilst giving the pack to be cut, he may be
                    compelled to re-shuffle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Deal.—33.</hi> Each player deals in his turn. The right of
                    dealing goes to the left.</p>
                <p>34. The player on the dealer’s right cuts the pack, and in dividing it must not
                    leave fewer than four cards in either packet. If in cutting or in replacing one
                    of the two packets on the other a card be exposed, or if there be any confusion
                    of the cards, or a doubt as to the exact place in which the pack was divided,
                    there must be a fresh cut.</p>
                <p>35. When a player, whose duty it is to cut, has once separated the pack, he
                    cannot alter his intention: he can neither re-shuffle nor re-cut the cards.</p>
                <p>36. When the pack is cut, should the dealer shuffle the cards, he loses his
                    deal.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">A New Deal.—37.</hi> There must be a new deal—(i.) if during a
                    deal or during the play of a hand the pack be proved incorrect or imperfect;
                    (ii.) if any card, excepting the last, be faced in the pack.</p>
                <p>38. If whilst dealing a card be exposed by the dealer or his partner, should
                    neither of the adversaries have touched the cards, the latter can claim a new
                    deal. A card exposed by either adversary gives that claim to the dealer,
                    provided that his partner has not touched a card. If a new deal does not take
                    place, the exposed card cannot be called.</p>
                <p>39. If during dealing a player touch any of his cards, the adversaries may do the
                    same, without losing their privilege of claiming a new deal, should chance give
                    them such option.</p>
                <p>40. If in dealing one of the last cards be exposed, and the dealer turn up the
                    trump before there is reasonable time for his adversaries to decide as to a
                    fresh deal, they do not thereby lose their privilege.</p>
                <p>41. If a player whilst dealing look at the trump card, his adversaries have a
                    right to see it, and may exact a new deal.</p>
                <p>42. If a player take into the hand dealt to him a card belonging to the other
                    pack, the adversaries, on discovery of the error, may decide whether they will
                    have a fresh deal or not.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A Misdeal.—</hi> 43. A misdeal loses the deal.</p>
                <p>44. It is a misdeal—(i.) unless the cards are dealt into four packets, one at a
                    time in regular rotation, beginning with the player to the dealer’s left; (ii.)
                    should the dealer place the last (i.e., the trump) card face downwards on his
                    own or any other pack; (iii.) should the trump card not come in its regular
                    order to the dealer; but he does not lose his deal if the pack be proved
                    imperfect; (iv.) should a player have fourteen cards and either of the other
                    three less than thirteen; (v.) should the dealer, under an impression that he
                    has made a mistake, count either the cards on the table or the remainder of the
                    pack; (vi.) should the dealer deal two cards at once or two cards to the same
                    hand, and then deal a third; but if, prior to dealing that third card, the
                    dealer can, by altering the position of one card only, rectify such error, he
                    may do so, except as provided by the second paragraph of this law; (vii.) should
                    the dealer omit to have the pack cut to him, and the adversaries discover the
                    error prior to the trump card· being turned up, and before looking at their
                    cards, but not after having done so.</p>
                <p>45. A misdeal does not lose the deal if during the dealing either of the
                    adversaries touch the cards prior to the dealer’s partner having done so; but,
                    should the latter have first interfered with the cards, notwithstanding [that]
                    either or both of the adversaries have subsequently done the same, the deal is
                    lost.</p>
                <p>46. Should three players have their right number of cards, the fourth have less
                    than thirteen, and not discover such deficiency until he has played any of his
                    cards, the deal stands good. Should he have played, he is as answerable for any
                    revoke he may have made as if the missing card or cards had been in his hand; he
                    may search the other pack for it or them.</p>
                <p>47. If a pack during or after a rubber be proved incorrect or imperfect, such
                    proof does not alter any past score, game, or rubber. That hand in which the
                    imperfection was detected is null and void. The dealer deals again.</p>
                <p>48. Any one dealing out of turn, or with the adversary’s cards, may be stopped
                    before the trump card is turned up, after which the game must proceed as if no
                    mistake had been made.</p>
                <p>49. A player can neither shuffle, cut, nor deal for his partner, without the
                    permission of his opponents.</p>
                <p>50. If the adversaries interrupt a dealer whilst dealing, either by questioning
                    the score or asserting that it is not his deal, and fail to establish such
                    claim, should a misdeal occur, he may deal again.</p>
                <p>51. Should a player take his partner’s deal and misdeal, the latter is liable to
                    the usual penalty, and the adversary next in rotation to the player who ought to
                    have dealt then deals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Trump Card.—</hi> 52. The dealer, when it is his turn to
                    play to the first trick, should take the trump card into his hand. If left on
                    the table after the first trick be turned and quitted, it is liable to be
                    called. His partner may at any time remind him of the liability.</p>
                <p>53. After the dealer has taken the trump card into his hand it cannot be asked
                    for. A player naming it at any time during the play of that hand is liable to
                    have his highest or lowest trump called.</p>
                <p>54. If the dealer take the trump card into his hand before it is his turn to
                    play, he may be desired to lay it on the table. Should he show a wrong card,
                    this card may be called, as also a second, a third, &amp;c., until the trump
                    card be produced.</p>
                <p>55. If the dealer declare himself unable to recollect the trump card, his highest
                    or lowest trump may be called at any time during that hand, and, unless it cause
                    him to revoke, must be played. The call may be repeated, but not changed, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> from highest to lowest, or <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa,</hi> until such card is played.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cards Liable to be Called.—</hi> 56. All exposed cards are
                    liable to be called, and must be left on the table; but a card is not an exposed
                    card when dropped on the floor, or elsewhere below the table. The following are
                    exposed cards :—(i.) two or more cards played at once; (ii.) any card dropped
                    with its face upwards, or in any way exposed on or above the table, even though
                    snatched up so quickly that no one can name it.</p>
                <p>57. If any one play to an imperfect trick the best card on the table, or lead one
                    which is a winning card as against his adversaries, and then lead again, or play
                    several such winning cards one after the other, without waiting for his partner
                    to play, the latter may be called on to win, if he can, the first or any other
                    of those tricks, and the other cards thus improperly played are exposed
                    cards.</p>
                <p>58. If a player or players, under the impression that the game is lost or won, or
                    for other reasons, throw his or their cards on the table face upwards, such
                    cards are exposed, and liable to be called, each player’s by the adversary; but,
                    should one player alone retain his hand, he cannot be forced to abandon it.</p>
                <p>59. If all four players throw their cards on the table face upwards, the hands
                    are abandoned, and no one can again take up his cards. Should this general
                    exhibition show that the game might have been saved, or won, neither claim can
                    be entertained, unless a revoke be established. The revoking players are then
                    liable to the following penalties: they cannot under any circumstances win the
                    game by the result of that hand, and the adversaries may add three to their
                    score, or deduct three from that of the revoking players.</p>
                <p>60. A card detached from the rest of the hand so as to be named is liable to be
                    called; but, should the adversary name a wrong card, he is liable to have a suit
                    called when he-or his partner have the lead.</p>
                <p>61. If a player, who has rendered himself liable to have the highest or lowest of
                    a suit called, fail to play as desired, or if, when called on to lead one suit,
                    [he] lead another, having in his hand one or more cards of that suit demanded,
                    he incurs the penalty of a revoke.</p>
                <p>62. If any player lead out of turn, his adversaries may either call the card
                    erroneously led, or may call a suit from him or his partner when it is next the
                    turn of either of them to lead.</p>
                <p>63. If any player lead out of turn, and the other three have followed him, the
                    trick is complete, and the error cannot be rectified. But, if only the second or
                    the second and third have played to the false lead, their cards, on discovery of
                    the mistake, are taken back; there is no penalty against any one, excepting the
                    original offender, whose caι∙d may be called, or he or his partner, when either
                    of them has next the lead, may be compelled to play any suit demanded by the
                    adversaries.</p>
                <p>64. In no case can a player be compelled to play a card which would oblige him to
                    revoke.</p>
                <p>65. The call of a card may be repeated until such card has been played.</p>
                <p>66. If a player called on to lead a suit have none of it, the penalty is
                    paid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cards Played in Error, or not Played to a Trick.—</hi> 67. If
                    the third hand play before the second, the fourth hand may play before his
                    partner.</p>
                <p>68. Should the third hand not have played, and the fourth play before his
                    partner, the latter may be called on to win or not to win the trick.</p>
                <p>69. If any one omit playing to a former trick, and such error be not discovered
                    until he has played to the next, the adversaries may claim a new deal. Should
                    they decide that the deal stand good, the surplus card at the end of the hand is
                    considered to have been played to the imperfect trick, but does not constitute a
                    revoke therein.</p>
                <p>70. If any one play two cards to the same trick, or mix his trump, or other card,
                    with a trick to which it does not properly belong, and the mistake be not
                    discovered until the hand is played out, he is answerable for all consequent
                    revokes he may have made. If during the play of the hand the error he detected,
                    the tricks may be counted face downwards, in order to ascertain whether there be
                    among them a card too many. Should this be the case, they may be searched, and
                    the card restored; the player is, however, liable for all revokes which he may
                    have meanwhile made.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Revoke.—</hi> 71. [This] is when a player, holding one or
                    more cards of the suit led, plays a card of a different suit.</p>
                <p>72. The penalty for a revoke—(i.) is at the option of the adversaries, who at the
                    end of the hand may either take three tricks from the revoking player, or deduct
                    three points from his score, or add three to their own score; (ιi.) can be
                    claimed for as many revokes as occur during the hand; (iii.) is applicable only
                    to the score of the game in which it occurs; (iv.) cannot be divided, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a player cannot add one or two to his own score and
                    deduct one or two from the revoking player; (v.) takes precedence of every other

                    nothing—the former add three to their score, and thereby win a treble game, even
                    should the latter have made thirteen tricks and held four honours.</p>
                <p>73. A revoke is established, if the trick in which it occur be turned and
                    quitted, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the hand removed from that trick after it
                    has been turned face downwards on the table, or if either the revoking player or
                    his partner, whether in his right turn or otherwise, lead or play to the
                    following trick.</p>
                <p>74. A player may ask his partner whether he has not a card of the suit which he
                    has renounced. Should the question be asked before the trick is turned and
                    quitted, subsequent turning and quitting does not establish the revoke, and the
                    error may be corrected, unless the question be answered in the negative, or
                    unless the revoking player or his partner have led or played to the following
                    trick.</p>
                <p>75. At the end of the hand, the claimants of a revoke may search all the
                    tricks.</p>
                <p>76. If a player discover his mistake in time to save a revoke, the adversaries,
                    whenever they think fit, may call the card thus played in error, or may require
                    him to play his highest or lowest card to that trick in which he has renounced.
                    Any player or players who have played after him may withdraw their cards and
                    substitute others. The cards withdrawn are not liable to be called.</p>
                <p>77. If a revoke be claimed, and the accused player or his partner mix the cards
                    before they have been sufficiently examined by the adversaries, the revoke is
                    established. The mixing of the cards only renders the proof of a revoke
                    difficult, but does not prevent the claim, and possible establishment, of the
                    penalty.</p>
                <p>78. A revoke cannot be claimed after the cards have been cut for the following
                    deal.</p>
                <p>79. The revoking player and his partner may, under all circumstances, require the
                    hand in which the revoke has been detected to be played out.</p>
                <p>80. If a revoke occur, be claimed, and proved, bets on the odd trick or on amount
                    of score must be decided by the actual state of the latter after the penalty is
                    paid.</p>
                <p>81. Should the players on both sides subject themselves to the penalty of one or
                    more revokes, neither can win the game; each is punished at the discretion of
                    his adversary.</p>
                <p>82. In whatever way the penalty be enforced, under no circumstances can a player
                    win the game by the result of the hand during which he has revoked; he cannot
                    score more than four. <hi rend="italic">(Vide</hi> rule 61.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Calling for New Cards.—</hi> 83. Any player (on paying for
                    them) before, but not after, the pack be cut for the deal may call for fresh
                    cards. He must call for two new packs, of which the dealer takes his choice.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Rules.—</hi> 84. Where a player and his partner have an
                    option of exacting from their adversaries one of two penalties, they should
                    agree who is to make the election, but must not consult with one another which
                    of the two penalties it is advisable to exact. If they do so consult, they lose
                    their right; and if either of them, with or without consent of his partner,
                    demand a penalty to which he is entitled, such decision is final. This rule does
                    not apply in exacting the penalties for a revoke; partners have then a right to
                    consult.</p>
                <p>85. Any one during the play of a trick, or after the four cards are played, and
                    before, but not after, they are touched for the purpose of gathering them
                    together, may demand that the cards be placed before their respective
                    players.</p>
                <p>86. If any one, prior to his partner playing, should call attention to the
                    trick—either by saying that it is his, or by naming his card, or, without being
                    required so to do, by drawing it towards him—the’adversaries may require that
                    opponent’s partner to play the highest or lowest of the suit then led, or to win
                    or lose the trick.</p>
                <p>87. In all cases where a penalty has been incurred, the offender is bound to give
                    reasonable time for the decision of his adversaries.</p>
                <p>88. If a bystander make any remark which calls the attention of a player or
                    players to an oversight affecting the score, he is liable to be called on, by
                    the players only, to pay the stakes and all bets on that game or rubber.</p>
                <p>89. A bystander by agreement among the players may decide any question.</p>
                <p>90. A card or cards torn or marked must be either replaced by agreement, or new
                    cards called at the expense of the table.</p>
                <p>91. Any player may demand to see the last trick turned, and no more. Under no
                    circumstances can more than eight cards be seen during the play of the hand,
                    viz., the four cards on the table which have not been turned and quitted, and
                    the last trick turned.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Etiquette of Whist.</hi></p>
                <p>The following rules belong to the established etiquette of whist. They are not
                    called laws, as it is difficult, in some cases impossible, to apply any penalty
                    to their infraction, and the only remedy is to cease to play with players who
                    habitually disregard them.</p>
                <p>Two packs of cards are invariably used at clubs; if possible this should be
                    adhered to.</p>
                <p>Any one having the lead, an&lt;l several winning cards to play, should not draw a
                    second card out of his hand until his partner has played to the first trick,
                    such act being a distinct intimation that the former has played a winning
                    card.</p>
                <p>No intimation whatever by word or gesture should be given by a player as to the
                    state of his hand or of the game.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n583/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0583-0548"/>
                <p>A player who desires the cards to be placed, or who demands to see the last
                    trick, should do it for his own information only, and not in order to invite the
                    attention of his partner. ... , , . . .</p>
                <p>No player should object to refer to a bystander who professes himself
                    uninterested in the game, and able to decide any disputed question of facts,—as
                    to who played any particular card, whether honours were claimed though not
                    scored, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> &amp;c. , . . . ..</p>
                <p>It is unfair to revoke purposely: having made a revoke, a player is not justified
                    in making a second in order to conceal the first.</p>
                <p>Until the players have made such bets as they wish, bets should not be made with
                    bystanders.</p>
                <p>Bystanders should make no remark, neither should they by word or gesture give any
                    intimation of the state of the game until concluded and scored, nor should they
                    walk round the table to look at the different hands.</p>
                <p>No one should look over the hand of a player against whom he is betting.</p>
                <p>Dummy.</p>
                <p>Dummy is played by three players. One hand, called dummy’s, lies exposed on the
                    table. The laws are the same as those of whist, with the following exceptions
                    (i.) dummy deals at the commencement of each rubber; (ii.) dummy is not liable
                    to the penalty for a revoke, as his adversaries see his cards; should he revoke
                    and the error not be discovered until the trick is turned and quitted, it stands
                    good; (iii.) dummy being blind and deaf, his partner is not liable to any
                    penalty for an error whence he can gain no advantage: thus, he may expose some
                    or all of his cards, or may declare that he has the game or trick, &amp;c.,
                    without incurring any penalty; if, however, he lead from dummy’s hand when he
                    should lead from his own, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> a suit may be
                    called from the hand which ought to have led.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Double Dummy.—</hi> [This] is played by two players, each
                    having a dummy or exposed hand for his partner. The laws of the game do not
                    differ from dummy whist, except in the following special law there is no
                    misdeal, as the deal is a disadvantage. (H∙ J∙)</p>
