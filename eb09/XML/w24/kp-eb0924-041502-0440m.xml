                    processes of modern mathematics have been employed,—so that this sketch, in
                    which it is desired that as little as possible of higher mathematics should be
                    employed, must be confined mainly to the statement of results. And the effects
                    of viscosity, though very important, cannot be treated.</p>
                <p>There are few branches of physics which do not present us with some forms of
                    wave, so that the subject is a very extensive one :—tides, rollers, ripples,
                    bores, breakers, sounds, radiations (whether luminous or obscure), telegraphic
                    and telephonic signalling, earthquakes, the propagation of changes of
                    surface-temperature into the earth’s crust—all are forms of wave-motion. Several
                    of these phenomena have been treated in other parts of this work, and will now
                    be but briefly referred to; others require more detailed notice.</p>
                <p>When a medium is in stable equilibrium, it has no kinetic energy, and its
                    potential energy is a minimum. Any local disturbance, therefore, in general
                    involves a communication of energy to part of the medium, and it is usually by
                    some form of wave-motion that this energy spreads to other parts of the medium.
                    The mere withdrawal of a quantity of matter (as by lifting a floating body out
                    of still water), local condensation of vapour in the air, the crushing of a
                    hollow shell by external pressure, the change of volume resulting from an
                    explosion, or from the sudden vaporization of a liquid—are known to all as
                    common sources of violent wave-disturbance.</p>
                <p>Waves may be <hi rend="italic">free</hi> or <hi rend="italic">forced.</hi> In the
                    former class the disturbance is produced once for all, and is then propagated
                    according to the nature of the medium and the form of the disturbance. Or the
                    disturbance may be continued, provided the waves travel faster than does the
                    centre of disturbance. In forced waves, on the other hand, the disturbing force
                    continues to act so as to modify the propagation of the waves already produced.
                    Thus, while a gale is blowing, the character of the water-waves is continually
                    being modified; when it subsides, we have regular oscillatory waves, or rollers,
                    for the longer ones not only outstrip the shorter but are less speedily worn
                    down by fluid friction. The huge mass of water which some steamers raise,
                    especially when running at a high speed, is an excellent example of a forced
                    wave. The ocean-tide is mainly a forced wave, depending on the continued action
                    of the moon and sun; but the tide-wave in an estuary or a tidal river is
                    practically free,—being almost independent of moon and sun, and depending mainly
                    upon the configuration of the channel, the rate of the current, and the tidal
                    disturbance at the mouth.</p>
                <p>In what follows we commence with a special case of extreme simplicity, where an
                    <hi rend="italic">exact</hi> solution is possible. This will be treated fully,
                    partly on account of its own interest, partly because its results will be of
                    material assistance in some of the less simple, and sometimes apparently quite
                    different, cases which will afterwards come up for consideration.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Transverse Waves on a Stretched Wire.—</hi> In the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanics,</hi> § 265, it has been proved by the most
                    elementary considerations that an inextensible but flexible rope, under uniform
                    tension, when moving at a certain definite rate through a smooth tube of any
                    form, exerts no pressure on the interior of the tube. In fact, the rope must
                    press with a force T/ <hi rend="italic">r</hi> (where T is the tension and <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> the radius of curvature) on the unit of length in
                    consequence of its tension, and with a force - <hi rend="italic">μv</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="italic">r</hi> (where <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi> is the speed, and μ the mass of unit length) in consequence of its
                    inertia. That there may be no pressure on the tube, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    that it may be dispensed with, we must therefore have T- <hi rend="italic"
                    >μv</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = 0, or <hi rend="italic">ν = √</hi> T∕μ.
                    From this it follows that a disturbance of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> form (of
                    course with continuous curvature) runs along a stretched rope at this definite
                    rate, and is unchanged during its progress. In the proof, the influence of
                    gravity was left out of consideration, and this result may therefore be applied
                    to the motion of a transverse disturbance along a stretched wire, such as that
                    of a pianoforte, where the tension is very great in comparison with the weight
                    of the wire. But the italicized word <hi rend="italic">any,</hi> above, gives an
                    excellent example of one of the most difficult parts of the whole subject, viz.,
                    the possibility of a <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> wave. This is a question
                    upon which we cannot here enter.</p>
                <p>If we restrict ourselves to slight disturbances only, theory points out and trial
                    verifies that they are superposable. In fact, in the great majority of
                    investigations which have been made with regard to waves, the disturbances have
                    been assumed to be slight, so that we can avail ourselves of the principle of
                    <hi rend="italic">superposition of small motions</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Mechanics,</hi> § 73), which is merely an application of the mathematical
                    principle of “neglecting the second order of small quantities.” The verification
                    by <hi rend="italic">trial</hi> is given at once by watching how the
                    ring-ripples produced by two stones thrown into a pool pass through one another
                    without any alteration; that by <hi rend="italic">observation</hi> is evident to
                    any one who sees an object in sunlight, when the whole intervening space is full
                    of intense wave-motion.</p>
                <p>Returning to our wire, let us confine ourselves to a small transverse
                    disturbance, in one plane, and try to discover what happens when the disturbance
                    reaches one of the fixed ends of the wire. Whether a point of the wire be fixed
                    or not does not matter, provided it <hi rend="italic">do not move.</hi> In the
                    figure below, two disturbances are shown, moving in opposite directions (and of
                    course with equal speed). Of these, either is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >perversion,</hi> as well as the inversion, of the other. When any part of the
                    one reaches O, the point halfway between them, so as to displace it upwards, the
                    other contributes an exactly equal displacement downwards. Thus O remains
                    permanently at rest, while the two waves pass through it without affecting one
                    another; and we may therefore assert that the wave A when it reaches the end of
                    the wire is reflected as B, or rather that each part of A when it reaches O goes
                    back as the corresponding part of B. B, in the same way, is seen to be reflected
                    from O as A.</p>
                <p>Now we can see what happens with a pianoforte wire. Any disturbance A is
                    reflected from one end O as B, and at the other end is reflected as A again.
                    Hence the state of the wire, whatever it may be, recurs <hi rend="italic"
                    >exactly</hi> after such an interval as is required for the disturbance to
                    travel, twice over, the length of the string.</p>
                <p>Remembering that the displacements are supposed to be very small, our fundamental
                    result may now be expressed by saying that the force acting on unit length of
                    the disturbed wire, to restore it to its undisturbed position, is T/ <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> or <hi rend="italic">μ,v</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    ∕ <hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Thus the <hi rend="italic">ratio of the acceleration
                    of each element to its curvature is the square of the rate of propagation of the
                    wave.</hi> It will be shown below that this is the immediate interpretation of
                    the differential equation of the wave-motion.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n442/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0442-0417"/>
                <p>Let us express the position of a point of the wire, when undisturbed, by <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> its distance (say) from one end. Let <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> represent its transverse displacement at time <hi rend="italic">t.</hi>
                    Then, bearing in mind that the disturbance travels with a constant speed <hi
                    rend="italic">v,</hi> the nature of the motion, so far as we have yet limited
                    it, will be expressed by saying that the value of <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> at
                    <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> at time <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> will be the value of
                    <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> at <hi rend="italic">x + vτ,</hi> at time <hi
                    rend="italic">t + τ;</hi> or, simply, <hi rend="italic">y</hi> = <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> (<hi rend="italic">vt</hi>- <hi rend="italic">x</hi>).</p>
                <p>For this expression, whatever be the function <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> is
                    unchanged in value, if <hi rend="italic">t + τ</hi> be put for <hi rend="italic"
                    >t,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x + ντ</hi> for <hi rend="italic">x</hi>; and no
                    other expression possesses this special property. If there be a disturbance
                    running the opposite way along the wire, we easily see that it will be
                    represented by an expression of the form</p>
                <p>F(<hi rend="italic">vt</hi> + <hi rend="italic">x).</hi></p>
                <p>These disturbances are superposable, so that <hi rend="italic">y=f(vt-x</hi>) +
                    F(<hi rend="italic">vt</hi> + <hi rend="italic">x</hi>) (1)</p>
                <p>expresses the most general state of disturbance which the wire can suffer under
                    the limitations we have imposed. Before going farther we may use this to
                    reproduce the results given above.</p>
                <p>Now <hi rend="italic">x</hi> =0 is one end of the wire, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >there y</hi> is necessarily always zero. Hence <hi rend="italic">0=f(vt)</hi> +
                    F(<hi rend="italic">vt</hi>), so that the functions <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and
                    F differ only in sign. This condition, inserted in (1), gives us at once the
                    state of matters indicated by the cut above.</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">x = l</hi> be the other end of the wire, we have the new
                    condition 0= <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (<hi rend="italic">vt</hi>- <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi>) - <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (<hi rend="italic">vt</hi> +
                    <hi rend="italic">l</hi>).</p>
                <p>The meaning of this is simply that the disturbance is periodic, the period being
                    2 <hi rend="italic">l/v</hi>, the other result already obtained.</p>
                <p>Fourier’s theorem (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Harmonic Analysis,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mechanics,</hi> § 67) now shows that the expression <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> may be broken up into one definite series of sines and
                    cosines, whence the usual results as to the various simple sounds which can be
                    produced, together or separately, from a free stretched string.</p>
                <p>It may be asked, and very naturally, How can this explanation of the nature of
                    all possible transverse motions of a harp or pianoforte wire, as the result of
                    sets of equal disturbances <hi rend="italic">running along it</hi> with constant
                    speed, be consistent with the appearance which it often presents of vibrating as
                    a whole, or as a number of equal parts separated from one another by <hi
                    rend="italic">nodes</hi> which remain apparently at rest in spite of the
                    disturbances to which, if the explanation be correct, they are constantly
                    subjected? The answer is given at once by a consideration of the expression <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> = sin <hi rend="italic">(i</hi> π/ <hi rend="italic"
                    >l)</hi> (<hi rend="italic">vt-x) -</hi> sin (<hi rend="italic">i</hi> π/ <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi>)(<hi rend="italic">vt</hi> + <hi rend="italic">x)</hi></p>
                <p>(where <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is any integer), which is a particular case of
                    the general expression (1), limited to the circumstances of a wire of length <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi>. This indicates, as we have seen, two exactly similar and
                    equal sets of simple harmonic waves running simultaneously, with equal speed, in
                    opposite directions along the wire. By elementary trigonometry we can put the
                    expression in the form <hi rend="italic">y=</hi>- 2 sin(<hi rend="italic"
                    >iπx</hi> / <hi rend="italic">l</hi>) cos(<hi rend="italic">iπvt/l</hi>) <hi
                    rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>This indicates— <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> that the points of the string where
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> has the values</p>
                <p>0, <hi rend="italic">l∣i, 2l∕i, . . .,l</hi> remain constantly at rest (these are
                    the ends, and the <hi rend="italic">i-1</hi> equidistant nodes by which the wire
                    is divided into <hi rend="italic">i</hi> practically independent parts); <hi
                    rend="italic">second,</hi> that the form of the wire, at any instant, is a curve
                    of sines, and that the ordinates of this curve increase and diminish
                    simultaneously with a simple harmonic motion,—the wire resuming its undisturbed
                    form at intervals of time <hi rend="italic">l∕iν.</hi></p>
                <p>This discussion has been entered into for the purpose of showing, from as simple
                    a point of view as possible, the production of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >stationary</hi> or <hi rend="italic">standing</hi> wave. The same principle
                    applies to more complex cases, so that we need not revert to the question.</p>
                <p>Recurring to the general expression for <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in (1), it is
                    clear that if we differentiate it twice with respect to <hi rend="italic"
                    >t,</hi> and again twice with respect to <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> the results
                    will differ only by the factor <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> which occurs in each term of the first. Thus <hi rend="italic">d2y/dt2 =
                    (v2)(d2y</hi> is merely another way of writing (1). But in this new form it
                    admits of the immediate interpretation given above in italics. d <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> y .</p>
                <p>For (d <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> y)/(dt <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) is
                    the acceleration, and the curvature.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Longitudinal Waves in a Wire or Pod.—</hi> If the
                    displacements of the various parts of the wire be longitudinal instead of
                    transverse, we may still suppose them to be represented graphically by the
                    figure above—by laying off the longitudinal displacement of each point in a line
                    through that point, in a definite plane, and perpendicular to the wire. In the
                    figure a displacement to the right is represented by an upward line, and a
                    displacement to the left by a downward line. The extremities of these lines
                    will, in general, form a curve of continued curvature. And it is easy to see
                    that the tangent of the inclination of the curve to the axis <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> its steepness at any point) represents the elongation of unit
                    length of the wire at that point, while the curvature measures the rate at which
                    this elongation increases per unit of length. The force required to produce the
                    elongation bears to the elongation itself the ratio E, viz., Young’s modulus.
                    The acceleration of unit length is the <hi rend="italic">change</hi> of this
                    force per unit length, divided by μ Hence, by the italicized statement in (1),
                    we have <hi rend="italic">v =</hi> √E∕p, <hi rend="smallcaps">(Mechanics,</hi> §
                    270). All the investigations above given apply to this case also, and their
                    interpretations, with the necessary change of a word or two, remain as
                    before.</p>
                <p>Thus, according to our new interpretation of the figure, the front part of A
                    indicates a wave of compression, its hind part one of elongation, of the
                    wire,—the displacement of every point, however, being to the right. B is an
                    equal and similar wave, its front being also a compression, and its rear an
                    elongation, but in it the displacement of each point of the wire is to the
                    left.</p>
                <p>Hence the displacements of O continually compensate one another; and thus a wave
                    of compression is reflected from the fixed end of the wire as a wave of
                    compression, but positive displacements are reflected as negative.</p>
                <p>If we now consider a free rod, set into longitudinal vibration by friction, we
                    are led to a particular case of reflection of a wave from a <hi rend="italic"
                    >free</hi> end. The condition is obviously that, at such a point, there can be
                    neither compression nor elongation. To represent the reflected wave we must
                    therefore take B of such a form that each part of it, when it meets at O the
                    corresponding part of A, shall just annul the compression. On account of the
                    smallness of the displacements, this amounts to saying that the successive parts
                    of B must be equally inclined to the axis with the corresponding parts of A, but
                    <hi rend="italic">they must slope the other way.</hi> Thus the proper figure for
                    this case is and the interpretation is that a wave of compression is reflected
                    from a free end as an equal and similar wave of elongation; but the disturbance
                    at each point of the wire in the reflected wave is to the same side of its
                    equilibrium position as in the incident wave.</p>
                <p>This enables us to understand the nature of reflexion of a wave of sound from the
                    end of an open organ pipe, as the former illustration suited the corresponding
                    phenomenon in a closed one.</p>

                    the wire above spoken of to be massless, or at least so thin, and of such
                    materials, that the whole mass of it may be neglected in comparison with the
                    masses of a system of equal pellets, which we now suppose to be attached to the
                    wire at equal distances from one another. The weights of these pellets may be
                    supported by a set of very long vertical strings, one attached to each, so that

                    stretched, as before, with a definite tension which is not affected by small
                    transverse disturbances. We will take the case of transverse disturbances only,

                    the reader that there must be a limit to the frequency of the oscillations which
                    can be transmitted along a system like this, though there was none such with the

                <p>The result is that, if <hi rend="italic">v</hi> be the speed of propagation of a
                    disturbance in a uniform wire with the same tension and same mass, the period of

                <p>Instead of pellets on a tended wire, we might have a series of equal bar magnets,
                    supported horizontally at proper distances from one another, in a line. The
                    magnetic forces here take the place of the tension; and by arranging the magnets
                    with their like poles together, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, by inverting the
                    alternate ones, we can produce the equivalent of pressure instead of tension
                    along the series. If the magnets have each bifilar suspension, their masses will
                    come in, as well as their moments of inertia, in the treatment of transverse
                    disturbances.</p>
                <p>This question is closely connected with Stokes’s explanation of fluorescence (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Light,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 602), for the effect of a
                    disturbing force, of a shorter period than the limit given above, applied
                    continuously to one of the pellets, would be to accumulate energy mainly in the
                    immediate neighbourhood; and this, if we suppose the disturbing force to cease,
                    would be transmitted along the system in waves of periods equal at least to the
                    limit. These would correspond to light of lower refrangibility than the
                    incident, but having as characteristic a definite upper limit of
                    refrangibility.</p>
                <p>Such investigations, with their results, prepare us to expect that the usual mode
                    of investigating the propagation of sound, to which we proceed, cannot be
                    correct in the case of exceedingly high notes if the medium consist of discrete
                    particles.</p>
                <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Waves of Compression and Dilatation in a Fluid; Sound;
                    Explosions.—</hi> Consider the case of plane waves, where each layer of the
                    medium moves perpendicularly to itself, and therefore may suffer dilatation or
                    compression. The case is practically the same as that treated in (2) above, and
                    can be represented by the same graphic method. For we may obviously consider
                    only the matter contained in a <hi rend="italic">rigid</hi> cylinder of unit
                    sectional area, whose axis is parallel to the displacements. The only point of
                    difference is in the law connecting pressure and consequent compression, and
                    that, of course, depends upon the properties of the medium considered.</p>
                <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) If the medium be a liquid, such as water, for
                    instance, the compression may be taken as proportional to the pressure. Thus the
                    acceleration on unit length of the column, multiplied by its mass (which in this
                    case is simply the density of the medium), is equal to the increase of pressure
                    per unit length, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to the increase of condensation
                    per unit length, multiplied by the resistance to compression, R. Thus the speed
                    of the wave is <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi> ∕R∕p, which is exactly analogous to
                    the forms of (1) and (2). The density, <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> of water is
                    62⋅3 lb per cubic foot, and for it R is about 20,000 atmospheres at 0° C., so
                    that the speed of sound at that temperature is about 4700 feet per second.</p>
                <p>That even intense differences of pressure take time to adjust themselves over
                    very short distances in water was well shown by the damage sustained by the <hi
                    rend="italic">open</hi> copper cases of those of the “Challenger” thermometers
                    which were crushed by pressure in the deep sea. When a strong glass shell
                    (containing air only) is enclosed in a stout open iron tube whose length is two
                    or three of its diameters, and is crushed by water pressure, the tube is
                    flattened by excess of external pressure before the relief can reach the
                    outside.</p>
                <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) In the case of a gas, such as air, we must take the
                    adiabatic relation between pressure and density. The pressure increases faster
                    than, instead of at the same rate with, the density, as it would do if the gas
                    followed Boyle’s law. Thus the changes of pressure, instead of being equal to
                    the changes of compression (multiplied by the modulus), exceed them in the
                    proportion of the specific heat at constant pressure (K) to that at constant
                    volume (N). Thus the speed of sound is <hi rend="italic subscript"> f</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fKjN.p∕p,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the pressure and
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> the density in the undisturbed air. The ratio of the
                    two latter quantities, as we know, is very approximately proportional to the
                    absolute temperature.</p>
                <p>The questions of the gradual change of type or the dying away even of plane waves
                    of sound, whether by reason of their form, by fluid friction, or by loss of
                    energy due to radiation, are much too complex to be treated here.</p>
                <p>In all ordinary simple sounds even of very high pitch the displacements are
                    extremely small compared with the wave length, so that the approximate solution
                    gives the speed with considerable accuracy. And a very refined experimental test
                    that this speed is independent of the pitch consists in listening to a rapid
                    movement played by a good band at a great distance. But there seems to be little
                    doubt that, under certain conditions at least, very loud sounds travel a great
                    deal faster than ordinary sounds.</p>
                <p>The above investigation gives the speed of sound relatively to the air.
                    Relatively to the earth’s surface, it has to be compounded with the motion of
                    the air itself. But, as the speed of wind usually increases from the surface
                    upwards, at least for a considerable height, the front of a sound-wave, moving
                    <hi rend="italic">with</hi> the wind, leans forward, and the sound (being
                    propagated perpendicularly to the front) moves downwards; if <hi rend="italic"
                    >against</hi> the wind, upwards.</p>
                <p>In the case of a disturbance in air due to a very sudden explosion, as of
                    dynamite or as by the passage of a flash of lightning, it is probable that for
                    some distance from the source the motion is of a projectile character; <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n444/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0444-0419"/> and that part at least of the flash is due to the
                    heat developed by practically instantaneous and very great compression of each
                    layer of air to which this violent motion extends.</p>
                <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Gravitation and Surface-Tension Waves in Liquids.</hi>
                    —Leaving out of consideration, as already sufficiently treated in a special
                    article, the whole subject of <hi rend="smallcaps">Tides,</hi> whether in oceans
                    or in tidal rivers, there remain many different forms of water-waves all alike
                    interesting and important. The most usual division of the free waves is into
                    long waves, oscillatory waves, and ripples. The first two classes run by
                    gravity, the third mainly by surfacetension (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Capillary
                    Action).</hi> But, while the long waves agitate the water to nearly the same
                    amount at all depths, the chief disturbance due to oscillatory waves or to
                    ripples is confined to the upper layers of the water, from which it dies away
                    with great rapidity in successive layers below. We will treat of these three
                    forms in the order named.</p>
                <p>(6) <hi rend="italic">Long Waves.—</hi> The first careful study of these waves
                    was made by Scott <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi>
                    in the course of an inquiry into traffic on canals. He arrived at the remarkable
                    result that there is a definite speed, depending on the depth of the water, at
                    which a horse can draw a canal-boat more easily than at any other speed, whether
                    less or greater. And he pointed out that, when the boat moves at this speed, it
                    agitates the water less, and therefore damages the banks less, than at any
                    lower. This particular speed is thus, in fact, that of free propagation of the
                    wave raised by the boat; and, when the boat rides, as it were, on this wave, its
                    speed is maintained with but little exertion on the part of the horse. If the
                    boat be made to move slower, it leaves behind it an everlengthening procession
                    of waves, of course at the expense of additional labour on the part of the
                    horse.</p>
                <p>The theory of the motion of such a wave is based on the hypothesis that all
                    particles in a transverse section of the canal have, at the same instant, the
                    same horizontal speed. However great this horizontal motion may be, the vertical
                    motion of the water may be very small, for it depends on the change of
                    horizontal speed from section to section only. In the investigation which
                    follows, the energy of this vertical motion will be neglected (even at the
                    surface, where it is greatest) in comparison with that of the horizontal motion.
                    The hypothesis is proved to be well grounded by the actual observation of the
                    motion of the water when a long wave of slight elevation or depression passes. A
                    long box, with parallel sides of glass, partly filled with water, represents the
                    canal; and the wave is produced by slowly and slightly tilting the box, and at
                    once restoring it to the horizontal position. The nature of the motion of the
                    water is shown by particles of bran suspended in it. Such an apparatus may be
                    usefully employed in verifying the theoretical result below, as to the connexion
                    between the speed of the wave and the depth of the water,—observations of the
                    passage of the crest being made with great exactness by means of a ray of light
                    reflected from the surface of the water in a vertical plane parallel to the
                    length of the canal. It may also be employed, by tilting it about an inclined
                    position, for the study of the changes which take place in the wave as it passes
                    from deeper to shallower water, or the reverse.</p>
                <p>The statement of (1) above is immediately applicable to this question. For, if
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> be the (undisturbed) depth of the water, ρ its density,
                    <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> ' the elevations in two
                    successive transverse sections at unit distance from one another, the difference
                    of pressures (at the same level) in the two sections is <hi rend="italic">gp(f —
                    y).</hi> The acceleration of a horizontal cylinder of unit section is the
                    difference of pressures divided by <hi rend="italic">ρ.</hi> But the whole depth
                    is increased at each point in proportion as the thickness of a transverse slice
                    is diminished. Hence, by the reasoning in (2) above, sτ&gt;(√-y) <hi
                    rend="italic">p'-p ..tf-y</hi> z — <hi rend="superscript"> υ</hi> λ *</p>
                <p>PP« or <hi rend="italic">υ-≈gh;</hi> and the speed of propagation of the wave is
                    that which a stone would acquire by falling through half the depth of the water.
                    That the speed ought to be independent of the density of the liquid is clear
                    from the fact that it is the weight of the disturbed portion which causes the
                    motion, and that this (for equal waves in different liquids) changes
                    proportionally to the mass to be moved.</p>
                <p>Since we have made no hypothesis as to the form of the wave, our only assumptions
                    being that the vertical motion is not only small in comparison with the depth,
                    but inconsiderable in comparison with the horizontal motion, while the latter is
                    the same at all depths in any one transverse section, it is clear that, under
                    the same limitations, a wave of depression will run at the same speed as does a
                    wave of elevation.</p>
                <p>A solitary wave of elevation obviously carries across any fixed transverse plane
                    a quantity of water equal to that which lies above the undisturbed level. If H
                    be the mean height of this raised water, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the breadth of
                    the canal (supposed rectangular), and λ the length of the wave, the volume of
                    this water is <hi rend="italic">b</hi> λH. But all particles in the transverse
                    section behave alike; and, when the wave has passed, the particles in <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> transverse sections have been treated alike. Hence the
                    final result of the passage of the wave is that the whole of the water of the
                    canal has been translated, in the direction of the wave’s motion, through the
                    space <hi rend="italic">b</hi> λH∕ <hi rend="italic">bh</hi>, or λH∕ <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi>. If the wave had been one of depression, the translation of
                    the water would have been in the opposite direction to that of the wave’s
                    motion. Hence, when the wave consists of an elevation followed by a depression
                    of equal volume, it leaves the water as it found it. Thus any permanent
                    displacement of the water is due to inequality of troughs and crests.</p>
                <p>A hint, though a very imperfect one, as to the formation of breakers on a gently
                    sloping beach, is given by considering that in shallow water the front and rear
                    of an ordinary surface-wave must move at different rates, the front being in
                    shallower water than the rear and therefore allowing the rear to gain upon
                    it.</p>
                <p>(7) <hi rend="italic">Oscillatory Waves.—</hi> The typical example of these waves
                    is found in what is called a “swell,” or the regular rolling waves which
                    continue to run in deep water after a storm. Their character is essentially
                    periodic, and this feature at once enables us to select from the general
                    integrals of the equations of non-rotatory fluid-motion the special forms which
                    we require. The investigation may, without sensible loss of completeness for
                    application, be still further simplified by the assumption that the disturbance

                <p>Each surface-particle is at the highest point of its circular path, and moving
                    forwards, when the crest of the wave passes it. When the trough passes, it is at
                    the lowest point of its circle and moving backwards. The radii of the circles
                    diminish in geometrical progression at depths increasing in arithmetical

                <p>From the investigation above we see that Atlantic rollers, of a wave-length of
                    (say) 300 feet, travel at the rate of about 40 feet per second, or 27 miles an
                    hour. But, even if they be of 40 feet height from trough to crest (which is
                    probably an exaggerated estimate), the utmost disturbance of a water particle at
                    a depth of 300 feet is not quite half an inch from its mean position. This
                    shows, in a very striking manner, what a mere surface-effect is in this way due
                    to winds, and how the depths of the ocean are practically undisturbed by such
                    causes.</p>
                <p>This investigation has been carried to a second, and even to a third,
                    approximation by Stokes, with the result that the form of a section of the
                    surface is no longer the curve of sines, in which the crests and troughs are
                    equal. The crests are steeper and higher, and the troughs wider and shallower,
                    than the first approximation shows. Also the forward horizontal motion of each
                    particle under the crest is no longer quite compensated for by its backward
                    motion under the trough, so that what sailors call the “heave of the sea” is
                    explained. The water is permanently displaced forwards by each succeeding wave.
                    But this effect, like the whole disturbance, is greatest in the surface-layer
                    and diminishes rapidly for each lower layer. The third approximation shows that
                    the speed of the waves is greater than that above assigned, by a term depending
                    on the square of the ratio of the height to the length of a wave.</p>
                <p>(6) When the depth of the water is limited, we cannot make the simplification
                    adopted in the last investigation.</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">h</hi> be the depth of the water, our condition is that the
                    vertical motion vanishes at that depth, and the relation between <hi

                <p>If, on the other hand, <hi rend="italic">h</hi> be small compared with the
                    wave-length, the equation approximates to <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi

                    formula for long waves again. Thus the expression above includes both
                    extremes,—though, so far as long waves go, it limits them to harmonic forms of
                    section.</p>
                <p>The surface-section is still the curve of sines, but the paths of the individual
                    particles are now ellipses whose major axes are horizontal. Both axes decrease
                    with great rapidity for particles considered at gradually increasing depths; but
                    the minor axes diminish faster than the major, so that the particles at the
                    bottom oscillate in horizontal lines.</p>
                <p>(8) <hi rend="italic">Ripples.—</hi> Stokes in 1848 pointed out that the

                    at the free surface, but this seems not to have been done till 1871, when W.

                <p>Thus the speed is, in all cases, increased by the surface-tension; and the more
                    so the shorter is the wave-length. Hence, as the speed increases indefinitely
                    with increase of wave-length when gravity alone acts, and also increases
                    indefinitely the shorter the wave when surface-tension alone acts, there must be

                    en</p>
                <p>λ = λ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> = 2τr√T∕gf∕&gt;, and that the corresponding
                    value of <hi rend="italic">υ</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> is <hi
                    rend="italic">2∖∕gΥ∣p.</hi></p>
                <p>In the case of water the value of λ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> is about 0⋅68
                    inch, and <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi> is 0⋅76 in
                    feet-seconds, nearly.</p>
                <p>This slowest-moving oscillatory wave may therefore be regarded as the limit
                    between waves proper and ripples. That ripples run faster the shorter they are
                    is easily seen by watching the apparently rigid pattern of them which precedes a
                    body moving uniformly through still water. The more rapid the motion the closer
                    do the ripple-ridges approach one another. Excellent examples of ripples are
                    produced by applying the stem of a vibrating tuning-fork to one side of a large
                    rectangular box full of liquid. From the pitch of the note, and the wave-length
                    of the ripples, we can make (by the use of the above formula) an approximate
                    determination of surface-tension, a quantity somewhat difficult to measure by
                    statical processes.</p>

                    independent of one another, the effect of superposition is merely a kinematical
                    question, and, as such, has been very fully treated under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mechanics</hi> (§§ 56-G7). See also <hi rend="smallcaps">Acoustics, Light,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Wave Theory.</hi> Thus ripplepatterns, ordinary beats
                    of musical sounds, composition of lunar and solar ocean tides, diffraction,
                    phenomena of polarized light in crystals or in transparent bodies in the
                    magnetic field, &amp;c., are all, in <hi rend="italic">principle</hi> at least,
                    simple kinematical consequences of superposition. But the phenomena called
                    Tartini’s beats, breakers, a bore, a jabble, and (generally) cases in which a
                    sufficient approximation cannot be obtained by omitting powers of the
                    displacements higher than the first, are not of this simple character.</p>
                <p>As a single illustration, take one case of the first of these phenomena. The <hi
                    rend="italic">fact</hi> to be explained is that when two pure musical sounds, of
                    frequencies 2 and 3 (say), that is, forming a “perfect fifth,” are sounded
                    together, we hear in addition to them a graver note, viz., that of which the
                    first sound is the octave and the second the twelfth. When a resonator,
                    carefully tuned to this graver note, is applied to the ear the note is usually
                    not heard. Hence Helmholtz attributes its production to the fact that the drum
                    of the ear (in consequence of the attachments of the ossicles) has different
                    elastic properties for inward and for outward displacements.</p>
                <p>The force tending to restore the drum from a displacement <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> may therefore be represented approximately by <hi rend="italic">-
                    p</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">x + qx</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus, when the drum is exposed to the two sounds above mentioned, its equation of
                    motion is <hi rend="italic">Cl/“X</hi><hi rend="italic">-^</hi><hi rend="italic

                    “difference-tone” referred to. This, of course, is communicated to the internal
                    ear.</p>
                <p>Helmholtz points out, however, that such sounds may be produced objectively,
                    provided the interfering disturbances are sufficiently great. No one seems yet
                    to have obtained any really accurate notion of the smallness of the disturbances
                    of air which can be heard as sound. That they are excessively small has long
                    been shown by many processes, but even more perfectly by the comparatively
                    recent invention of the telephone.</p>

                    produced by periodic sources of various characters. It is sufficient to call
                    attention here to the form of the equation for the linear motion of heat (which
