                    part of the original building of Harold, although others assign its date to the
                    time of Henry I. Only the western supports of the ancient tower now remain. A
                    tower corresponding with the present size of the church was erected in 1556 and
                    restored in 1798. On the south side of the church is a lady chapel of about the
                    end of the reign of Edward II. or beginning of that of Edward III., containing
                    some good decorated work. Bishop Hall became curate of Waltham in 1612, and
                    Thomas Fuller was curate from 1648 to 1658. At Waltham Cross on the great
                    northern road, about a mile west of Waltham, is the beautiful cross erected
                    (1291-94) by Edward I. at one of the resting-places of the corpse of Queen
                    Eleanor on its way to burial in Westminster Abbey. It is of Caen stone and is
                    supposed to have been designed by Pietro Cavalini, a Roman sculptor. It is
                    hexagonal in plan, and consists of three stages, decreasing towards the top,
                    which is finished by a crocheted spirelet aud cross. The lower stage is divided
                    into compartments enclosing the arms of England, Castile and Leon, and Ponthieu.
                    It underwent restoration in 1833, and a scheme for the same object was started
                    in 1885. The old Elizabeth market-house that formerly stood in the market-square
                    of Waltham was taken down in 1852. The town is the seat of a county court for
                    Epping division of Essex, and possesses a court house erected in 1849. The royal
                    gunpowder factory is in the immediate vicinity; and the town possesses
                    gun-cotton and percussion-cap factories, flour-mills, malt kilns, and breweries.
                    Watercresses are largely grown in the neighbourhood, and there are extensive
                    market-gardens and nurseries, including Paul’s famous rose nursery. The area of
                    the urban sanitary district of Waltham Holy Cross, which is identical with the
                    parish of Waltham Abbey and is in the civil county of Essex and registration
                    county of Middlesex, is 11,017 acres. the population being 5197 in 1871 and 5368
                    in 1881.</p>
                <p>Waltham appears first in history as the hunting seat of the Danish thane Tovi or
                    Tofi, the royal standard-bearer at whose wedding feast Hardicanute died. The
                    great forest on the edge of which it was built was long known as the forest of
                    Waltham, but the only portion of it now remaining is called Epping forest. A
                    wonderful cross which had been found in Tovi’s land at Montacute, Somerset, was
                    brought to Waltham, and Tovi built a church for its reception, which was named
                    the Church of the Holy Cross. When the estate after being confiscated to the
                    crown came into the possession of Harold, he pulled down Tovi’s church and built
                    a new one of great magnificence, which was consecrated in 1060. He also founded
                    a great secular college, which, though usually referred to as an abbey, did not,
                    as is pointed out by Mr Freeman, become a religious house till the reign of
                    Henry II. Shortly before the fatal battle of Hastings, Harold made a pilgrimage
                    to Waltham, bringing with him many gifts. His body, which was first buried under
                    a cairn at Hastings, was subsequently brought to Waltham and buried in the place
                    of honour by the high altar. The tomb was destroyed about 1540. The site and
                    property of the abbey were given by Henry VIII. to Sir Anthony Denny, whose
                    grandson, Sir Edward Denny, was created by James I. baron of Waltham, and by
                    Charles I. earl of Norwich. The town obtained a grant of a market from Henry
                    III.</p>
