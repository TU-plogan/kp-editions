                    and sisters.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    youngest brother was James Wilson “of Woodville” (1795- 1856), who became a

                    been rather irregularly educated in his earlier days,—the best of his physical
                    and sporting, if not of his scholastic, training being received at the manse of
                    the village of Mearns, of which constant notices appear in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essays.</hi> He was only twelve when he was first entered at the university of
                    Glasgow, and he continued to attend various classes in that university for six
                    years, being for the most part domiciled with and under the tutorship of Prof.
                    Jardine. His father’s death had immediately preceded his first entry at Glasgow.
                    In these six years Wilson “made himself” in all ways, acquiring not
                    inconsiderable scholarship, perfecting himself in all sports and exercises, and
                    falling in love with a certain “Margaret,” who was the object of his affections
                    for several years. The most curious literary memorial of these early years is a
                    letter to Words- ∙worth, written in 1802 without any personal acquaintance or
                    introduction, and betraying not a little priggishness, as we should now count
                    it, but in that respect only showing the difference of contemporary manners, and
                    interesting as being the first evidence of what was nearly a lifelong connexion
                    of admiring though sometimes recalcitrant criticism.</p>
                <p>In June 1803 Wilson was entered as a gentleman commoner at Magdalen College,
                    Oxford. Men have seldom felt more than Wilson the charm which Oxford exercises
                    on all but a very few, and generally (with some noteworthy exceptions, such as
                    Gibbon and Jeffrey) very worthless, sons; and in much of his later work, notably
                    in the essay called “Old North and Young North,” he has expressed his feeling.
                    But it does not appear that his Magdalen days were altogether happy, though he
                    perfected himself in “bruising,” pedestrianism, and other sports, and read so as
                    to obtain a brilliant first class. His love affairs with “Margaret” did not go
                    happily, and he seems to have made no intimate friends at his own college and
                    few in the university. He took his degree in 1807 and found himself at
                    twenty-two his own master; and he had a good <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0627-0592"/> income, no father or guardian to control him, no
                    property requiring management, and apparently was not under the influence of the
                    etiquette which in similar circumstances generally makes it necessary for a
                    young man to adopt some profession, if only in name. His profession was an
                    estate on Windermere called Elleray, and ever since imperishably connected with
                    his name. Here he built, boated, wrestled, shot, fished, walked (he was always
                    an astonishing pedestrian), and otherwise diverted himself for four years,
                    besides composing or collecting from previous compositions a considerable volume
                    of poems. But Wilson was too genuine a man to be happy without a wife, and in
                    1810 the place of “Margaret” was taken by Jane Penny, a Liverpool girl of some
                    family and fortune, whom he married on 11th May 1811. <hi rend="italic">The Isle
                    of Palms,</hi> his first published volume, consisting of poems, was issued not
                    long after this. Four years of married life at Elleray succeeded, which, except
                    as being happier and therefore less historied, do not seem to have differed much
                    from the earlier four. Then came the event which definitely made a working man
                    of letters of Wilson, and without which he would probably have produced a few
                    volumes of verse and nothing more. His whole fortune, or at least the major part
                    of it, was lost by the dishonest speculation of an uncle in whose hands, with no
                    doubt rather culpable carelessness, Wilson had left it. At the same time this
                    hard fate was by no means unqualified in its hardness. His mother had a house in
                    Edinburgh, in which slιe was able and willing to receive her son and his family;
                    nor had he even to give up Elleray, though henceforward he was not able
                    constantly to reside in it. He read law and was called to the Scotch bar, taking
                    plentiful sporting and pedestrian excursions, on some of which his wife
                    accompanied him, publishing in 1816 a second volume of poems <hi rend="italic"
                    >(The City of the Plague),</hi> and generally leading a very pleasant life, if
                    not such an entirely independent one as formerly. The year 1817 was the turning
                    point in Wilson’s life. The famous Cevallos article, which resulted in the
                    secession of Scott and other Tories from the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Review</hi> and the establishment of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly,</hi> was
                    years earlier; but there had still been no formal declaration that the “Blue and
                    Yellow” was for Whigs only. Wilson was a Tory and the son of Tories (“If you
                    turn Whig, John,” said his mother to him, “this house will not hold you and me
                    ”), but he was glad to accept Jeffrey’s invitation to contribute. Almost at the
                    same time, however, a far more suitable chance appeared. Wilson was not patient
                    of being edited, and his reckless humour as well as his political bias wou!d in
                    the long run have pretty certainly disqualified him for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh.</hi> The growth of <hi rend="italic">Blackwood's Magazine,</hi> and
                    its sudden transformation from a colourless or Whiggish monthly rival to
                    Constable’s <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> into an organ at once of the most
                    red-hot Toryism in politics and of the wildest irreverence towards received
                    notions in literature and other matters, took place in the same year. The petard
                    of the “Chaldee Manuscript,” nominally due to Hogg, but with most of the
                    gunpowder put in by Wilson and Lockhart, determined the character of the new
                    periodical, and Wilson’s career was fixed. He was never exactly editor, for the
                    powers of “Christopher North” in that respect were a fantastic imagination; and
                    we have definite and authoritative assertions, not only that he never received
                    any stipend for editing, but that the publishers always retained a certain
                    supervision even over Wilson’s own contributions. The famous series of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Noctes</hi><hi rend="italic">Ambrosianae</hi> is said to have been
                    of Maginn’s invention, and for nearly ten years was so very partially
                    representative of Wi1son’s own work and thought that none of its numbers during
                    that time have been included by his son-in-law in the authorized, but by no
                    means complete, edition. Lockhart, a somewhat less genial but far more
                    concentrated and deliberate writer, was, until his departure for London to take
                    charge of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly,</hi> at least as potent in the
                    management as Wilson; and, although the facts are not known with absolute
                    certainty, there is no doubt that it was a daring “alarum and excursion” of
                    Lockhart’s, under the alias (one of many) of Baron von Lauerwinkel, which caused
                    Jeffrey, nominally because of an attack on Prof. Playfair, but obviously for
                    other reasons, to inform Wilson, almost in so many words, that his further
                    contributions were not desired for the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh.</hi> Wilson
                    had also some share—though, if internal evidence may be trusted, not much—in
                    Lockhart’s <hi rend="italic">Peter's Letters,</hi> which, harmless as they seem
                    nowadays, infuriated the Whig society of the Scottish capital.</p>
                <p>The first result of this new business on Wilson’s general mode of life was that
                    he left his mother’s house and established himself (1819) in Ann Street,
                    Edinburgh, on his own account with his wife and family of five children. The
                    second was much more unlooked for: it was his candidature for and election to
                    the chair of moral philosophy in the university of Edinburgh (1820). To speak
                    honestly, his qualifications for the post were almost <hi rend="italic"
                    >nil,</hi> even if the fact that the best qualified man in Great Britain, Sir
                    William Hamilton, was also a candidate, be left out of the question. But,
                    luckily for Wilson and for letters, the matter was made a political one; the
                    Tories still had a majority in the town council; he was powerfully backed up by
                    friends, Scott at their head; and his adversaries played into his hands by
                    attacking, not his competence (which, as has been said, was very vulnerable),
                    but his moral character, which was not open to any fair reproach. Yet he made a
                    very excellent professor, never perhaps attaining to any great scientific
                    knowledge in his subject or power of expounding it, but acting on generation
                    after generation of students with a stimulating force that is far more valuable
                    than the most exhaustive knowledge of a particular topic. His duties left him
                    plenty of time for magazine work, and for many years his contributions to <hi
                    rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> were extraordinarily voluminous. Most of the best
                    and best-known of them appeared between 1825 and 1835, that is, between the
                    departure of Lockhart for London in the former year and the death of Blackwood
                    the publisher and of Mrs Wilson in the latter.</p>
                <p>The domestic events of Wilson’s life in the last thirty years of it may be very
                    briefly told. He oscillated between Edinburgh and Elleray, with plentiful
                    excursions and summer residences elsewhere, a sea trip on board the Experimental
                    Squadron in the Channel during the summer of 1832, and a few other unimportant
                    diversions. The death of his wife was an exceedingly severe blow to him,
                    especially as it coincided very nearly with that of his friend Blackwood. For
                    many years after it (though he never up to the date of his death gave up
                    writing) his literary work was intermittent, and, with some exceptions, not up
                    to the level of the earlier. Late in 1850 his health showed definite signs of
                    breaking up; and in the next year a civil list pension of £300 a year was
                    conferred on him. He died at Edinburgh on 3d April 1854.</p>
                <p>But a very small part of Wilson’s extensive work was published in a collected and
                    generally accessible form during his lifetime, the chief and almost sole
                    exceptions being the two volumes of poems above referred to, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life</hi> (prose tales and
                    sketches), and the <hi rend="italic">Recreations of Christopher North,</hi> a
                    selection, mostly limited to sporting and descriptive pieces, of his magazine
                    articles. These volumes, with a selected edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Noctes</hi><hi rend="italic">Ambrosianae</hi> in four volumes, and of further
                    essays, critical and imaginative, also in four volumes, were collected and
                    re-issued uniformly after his death by his son-in-law, Prof. Ferrier. The
                    collection is very far from exhaustive; and, though it undoubtedly contains most
                    of his best work and comparatively little that is not good, it has been
                    complained, with some justice, that the characteristic, if rather immature,
                    productions of his first eight years on <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> are
                    almost entirely omitted, that the <hi rend="italic">Noctes</hi> are <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n630/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0630-0593"/> given but in part, if in their best part, and
                    that at least three long, important, and interesting series of papers, less
                    desultory than is his wont, on “Spenser,” on “British Critics,” and the set
                    called “Dies Boreales,” have been left out altogether. Wilson’s characteristics
                    are, however, uniform enough, and the standard edition exhibits them
                    sufficiently, if not exhaustively. His poems may be dismissed at once as little
                    more than interesting. They would probably not have been written at all if he
                    had not been a young man in the time of the full flood of influence of
                    Coleridge, Wordsworth, Byron, and Scott. His prose tales have in some estimates
                    stood higher, but will hardly survive the tests of universal criticism. It is as
                    an essayist and critic of the most abounding geniality, if not genius, of great
                    acuteness, of extraordinary eloquence, and of a fervid and manifold sympathy, in
                    which he has hardly an equal, that “Christopher North” lives and will live. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Noctes Ambrosianae,</hi> a series of convivial table-talk,
                    giving occasion to wonderfully various digressions of criticism, description,
                    and miscellaneous writing, have been of late years ranked far below their real
                    value. From their origin it necessarily followed that there was much that is
                    ephemeral, a certain amount that is purely local, and something that is purely
                    trivial in them. But their dramatic force, their incessant flashes of happy
                    thought and happy expression, their almost incomparable fulness of life, and
                    their magnificent humour give them all but the highest place among genial and
                    recreative literature. It is often thought, and sometimes said, that no one but
                    a Scotchman can relish them—an utter mistake, against which it is desirable most
                    energetically to testify in the name of lovers of them who have not a drop of
                    Scottish blood in their veins. The same qualities, together with a greater share
                    of purely literary and critical power (to the display of which the form of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Noctes</hi> was inimical), and of a sometimes abused but very
                    admirable faculty of word-painting, appear in the miscellaneous essays. Wilson’s
                    defects lay in the directions of measure and of taste properly so called, that
                    is to say, of the modification of capricious likes and dislikes by reason and
                    principle. He is constantly exaggerated, boisterous, wanting in refinement. But
                    these are the almost necessary defects of his qualities of enthusiasm,
                    eloquence, and generous feeling. The well-known adaptation of phrase in which he
                    not recanted but made up for numerous earlier attacks on Leigh Hunt, “the
                    Animosities are mortal, but the Humanities live for ever,” shows him as a writer
                    at his very best, but not without a little characteristic touch of grandiosity
                    and emphasis. As a literary critic, as a sportsman, as a lover of nature, and as
                    a convivial humorist, he is not to be shown at equal advantage in miniature; but
                    almost any volume of his miscellaneous works will exhibit him at full length in
                    either capacity or in all.</p>
                <p>The chief, if not the sole, authentic source of information for Wilson’s life is
                    the memoir by his daughter, Mrs Gordon (Edinburgh, 1862). (G. SA.)</p>
