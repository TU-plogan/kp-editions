                <p><label type="entry">WOMEN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Law relating to</hi></label>. The
                    law as it relates to women has been gradual in its operation, but its tendency
                    has been almost uniformly in one direction. Disabilities of women, married or
                    unmarried, have been one after another removed, until at the present day, in
                    most civilized countries, the legal position of women differs little from that
                    of men as far as regards private rights. Politically and professionally the
                    sexes are still not upon an equality, but even in this aspect women have
                    considerably greater rights than they once possessed, and the old theory of
                    their intellectual and moral inferiority is virtually exploded. Those who defend
                    their exclusion must now do so on other grounds. Much of the law relating to
                    married women has been already dealt with under the heads of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Adultery, Bigamy, Divorce, Marriage, Husband and Wife,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Settlement,</hi> the last two especially dealing with their
                    rights of property.</p>
                <p>The dependent position of women in early law is proved by the evidence of most
                    ancient systems which have in whole or in part descended to us. In the Mosaic
                    law divorce was a privilege of the husband only,<note anchored="true"

                    there was much legislation dealing with, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi>
                    offences against chastity, and marriage of a man with a captive heathen woman or
                    with a purchased slave. So far from second marriages being restrained, as they
                    were by Christian legislation, it was the duty of a childless widow to marry her
                    deceased husband’s brother. In India subjection was a cardinal principle. “Day
                    and night must women be held by their protectors in a state of dependence,” says
                    Manu.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ch. ix. § 2 (Sir

                    That birth of a child gave the mother certain legal rights in a primitive stage

                    to the suttee, for both the family of the widow and the Brahmans had an interest
                    in getting the life estate of a woman out of the way.<note anchored="true"

                    rights of inheritance, and were disqualified as witnesses. In Roman law a woman
                    was even in historic times completely dependent. If married she and her property
                    passed into the power of her husband; if unmarried she was (unless a vestal
                    virgin) under the perpetual tutelage of her father during his life, and after
                    his death of her agnates, that is, those of her kinsmen by blood or adoption who
                    would have been under the power of the common ancestor had he lived. Failing
                    agnates, the tutelage probably passed to the <hi rend="italic">gens.</hi> The
                    wife was the purchased property of her husband, and, like a slave, acquired only
                    for his benefit. A woman could not exercise any civil or public office. In the
                    words of Ulpian, “feminae ab omnibus officiis civilibus vel publicis remotae
                    sunt.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dig.,</hi> i. 16, 195.</p></note> A woman could not continue a family, for she
                    was “caput et finis familiae suae,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p></note> could not be a
                    witness, surety, tutor, or curator; she could not adopt or be adopted, or make a

                    rend="italic">intestato</hi> as an agnate, if further removed than a sister. A
                    daughter might be disinherited by a general clause, a son only by name. On the
                    other hand, a woman was privileged in some matters, but rather from a feeling of
                    pity for her bodily weakness and presumed mental incapacity<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Imbeeülitasis</hi> the term
                    used more than once in the texts of Roman law.</p></note> than for any more
                    worthy reason. Thus she could plead ignorance of law as a ground for dissolving
                    an obligation, which a man could not as a rule do; she could accuse only in
                    cases of treason and witchcraft; and she was in certain cases exempt from
                    torture. In succession <hi rend="italic">ab intestato</hi> to immovable property
                    Roman law did not, as does English, recognize any privilege of males over
                    females. Legal disabilities were gradually mitigated by the influence of
                    fictions, the praetorian equity, and legislation. An example of the first was
                    the mode by which a woman freed herself from the authority of her tutor by
                    fictitious cession into the authority of a tutor nominated by herself, or by
                    sale of herself into the power of a nominal husband on the understanding that he
                    was at once to emancipate her to another person, who then manumitted her. The
                    action of equity is illustrated by the recognition by the praetor of cognatic or
                    natural as distinguished from agnatic or artificial relationship, and of a
                    widow’s claim to succeed on the death of her husband intestate and without
                    relations. Legislation, beginning as early as the Twelve Tables, which forbade
                    excessive mourning for the dead by female mourners, did not progress uniformly
                    towards enfranchisement of women. For instance, the Lex Voconia (about 169 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> called by St Augustine the most unjust of all laws,
                    provided that a woman could not be instituted heir to a man who was registered
                    as owner of a fortune of 100,000 asses.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The way in which this law was evaded was by non-enrolment of
                    the testator in the census (see Montesquieu, <hi rend="italic">Esprit des
                    Lois,</hi> bk. xxvii. ). Another way was by leaving her the inheritance by <hi
                    rend="italic">fideicommissum</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Trust).</hi></p></note> A constitution of Valentinian I. forbade bequests by
                    women to ecclesiastics. But the tendency of legislation was undoubtedly in the
                    direction indicated. Adoption of women was allowed by Diocletian and Maximian in
                    291. The tutelage of women of full age was removed by Claudius, and, though
                    afterwards in part revived, has disappeared by the time of Justinian. This
                    implied full testamentary and contractual liberty. In regard to the separate
                    property of the married woman, the period of <hi rend="italic">dos</hi> had by
                    the time of Justinian long superseded the period of <hi rend="italic">manus</hi>
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Settlement).</hi> The result was that, in spite of a
                    few remaining disabilities, such as the general incapacity to be surety or
                    witness to a will or contract, of a wife to make a gift to her husband, of a
                    widow to marry within a year of her husband’s death, the position of women had
                    become, in the words of Sir H. Maine, “one of great personal and proprietary
                    independence.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ancient Law,</hi> ch. v. Hence the necessity of such laws as the
                    Lex Oppia (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sumptuary Laws).</hi></p></note> For this
                    improvement in their position they were largely indebted to the legislation of
                    the Christian emperors, especially of Justinian, who prided himself on being a
                    protector of women. The following are a few of the matters in which Christianity
                    appears to have made alterations, generally but perhaps not always improvements,
                    in the law. As a rule the influence of the church was exercised in favour of the
                    abolition of the disabilities imposed by the older law upon celibacy and
                    childlessness, of increased facilities for entering a professed religious
                    life,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A remarkable
                    example of this tendency was the provision that an actress might leave the stage
                    and break her contract of service with impunity in order to become a nun (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Theatre).</hi> Even under the pagan emperors a constitution
                    of Diocletian and Maximian in 285 had enacted that no one was to be compelled to
                    marry <hi rend="italic">(Cod.,</hi> v. 4, 14).</p></note> and of due provision
                    for the wife. The church also supported the political power of those who were
                    her best friends. The government of Pulcheria or Irene would hardly have been
                    endured in the days of the pagan empire. Other cases in which Christianity
                    probably exercised influence may be briefly stated. (1) All differences in the
                    law of succession <hi rend="italic">ab intestato</hi> of males and females were
                    abolished by Justinian. (2) The appointment of mothers and grandmothers as
                    tutors was sanctioned by the same emperor. (3) He extended to all cases the
                    principle established by the Senatus Consultum Tertullianum (158), enabling the
                    mother of three (if a freed woman four) children to succeed to the property of
                    her children who died intestate, and gave increased rights of succession to a
                    widow. (4) Thδ restrictions on the marriage of senators and other men of high
                    rank with women of low rank were extended by Constantine, but almost entirely
                    removed by Justinian. (5) Second marriages were discouraged (especially by
                    making it legal to impose a condition that a widow’s right to property should
                    cease on re-marriage), and the Leonine Constitutions at the end of the 9th
                    century made third marriages punishable. (6) The same constitutions made the
                    benediction of a priest a necessary part of the ceremony of marriage.<note

                    some points of interest. Adultery was punished with death by Constantine, but
                    the penalty was reduced by Justinian to relegation to a convent. A woman
                    condemned for adultery could not re-marry. A marriage between a Christian and a
                    Jew <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n678/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0678-0639"/> rendered the parties guilty of adultery. Severe
                    laws w ere enacted against offences of unchastity, especially procurement and
                    incest. It was a capital crime to carry off or offer violence to a nun. A wife
                    could not commit <hi rend="italic">furtum</hi> of her husband’s goods, but he
                    had a'special action <hi rend="italic">rerum</hi><hi rend="italic">amotarum</hi>
                    against her. By several sumptuary constitutions, contained in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Code,</hi> bk. xi., women as well as men were subject to penalties
                    for wearing dress or ornaments (except rings) imitating those reserved for the
                    emperor and his family. Actresses and women of bad fame were not to wear the
                    dress of virgins dedicated to Heaven. If a consul had a wife or mother living
                    with him, he was allowed to incur greater expense than if he lived alone. The
                    interests of working women were protected by enactments for the regulation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">gynaecia,</hi> or workshops for spinning, dyeing,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The canon law, looking with disfavour on the female independence prevailing in
                    the later Roman law, tended rather in the opposite direction. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Decretum</hi> specially inculcated subjection of the wife to the
                    husband, and obedience to his will in all things.<note anchored="true"

                    16.</p></note> The chief differences between canon and Roman law were in the law
                    of marriage, especially in the introduction of publicity and of the formalities
                    of the ring and the kiss. The benediction of a priest was made a necessary part
                    of the ceremony, as indeed it had been made by the civil power, as has been
                    already stated, in the post-Justinian period of Roman law. But in practice this
                    rule appears to have fallen into disuse until it was again revived by the
                    council of Trent. It was, however, the rule of the English common law after the
                    Reformation. The ceremony was not to be performed during Lent. The woman was to
                    be veiled during the ceremony. A promise of marriage was so sacred that it made
                    a subsequent marriage with another person void. Spiritual cognation was a bar to
                    marriage. The sentence of the church was made necessary for divorce. As to women
                    in general the law does not say very much. Women, even relatives, were not to
                    live with priests unless in case of necessity. They were not to approach the
                    altar or fill any public office of the church; nor might they lend money on
                    usury. Baptism might be valid although administered by a woman. Women who had
                    professed religion could not be forced to give evidence as witnesses. In some
                    cases the evidence of women was not receivable (see <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>The early law of the northern parts of Europe is interesting from the different
                    ways in which it treated women. In the words of Sir H. Maine<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Early Law
                    and Custom,</hi> ch. v.</p></note> —“The position of women in these barbarous
                    systems of inheritance varies very greatly. Sometimes they inherit, either as
                    individuals or as classes, only when males of the same generation have failed.
                    Sometimes they do not inherit, but transmit a right of inheritance to their male
                    issue. Sometimes they succeed to one kind of property, for the most part movable
                    property, which they probably took a great share in producing by their household
                    labour; for example, in the real Salic law (not in the imaginary code) there is
                    a set of rules of succession which, in my opinion, clearly admit women and their
                    descendants to a share in the inheritance of movable property, but confine land
                    exclusively to males and the descendants of males. . . . The idea is that the
                    proper mode of providing for a woman is by giving her a marriage portion; but,
                    when she is once married into a separate community consisting of strangers in
                    blood, neither she nor her children are deemed to have any further claim on the
                    parent group.” Among the Scandinavian races women were under perpetual tutelage,
                    whether married or unmarried. The first to obtain freedom were the widows.<note

                    was in the same direction. Its original meaning was, however, different. It was

                    from the ordinary course of the law. They could distrain or contract only in
                    certain named cases, and distress upon their property was regulated by special
                    rules. In the pre-Conquest codes in England severe laws were denounced against
                    unchastity, and by a law of Canute a woman was to lose nose and ears for
                    adultery. The laws of Athelstan contained the peculiarly brutal provision for
                    the punishment of a female slave convicted of theft by her being burned alive by
                    eighty other female slaves. Other laws were directed against the practice of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Witchcraft</hi><hi rend="italic">(g.v.)</hi> by women. Monogamy
                    was enforced both by the civil and ecclesiastical law; and second and third
                    marriages involved penance. A glimpse of cruelty in the household is afforded by
                    the provision, occurring no less than three times in the ecclesiastical
                    legislation, that if a woman scourged her female slave to death she must do
                    penance. Traces of wife-purchase are seen in the law of Ethelbert, enacting that
                    if a man carry off a freeman’s wife he must at his own expense procure the
                    husband another wife. The codes contain few provisions as to the property of
                    married women, but those few appear to prove that she was in a better position
                    than at a later period. The laws of Ine gave her a third of her husband’s
                    property; the laws of Edmund as to betrothal allowed this to be increased to
                    half by antenuptial contract, to the whole if she had children and did not
                    re-marry after her husband’s death. No doubt the dower <hi rend="italic">ad
                    ostium</hi><hi rend="italic">ecclesiae</hi> favoured by the church generally
                    superseded the legal rights where the property was large—in fact this is
                    specially provided by Magna Charta, c. 7—just as at present rights under a
                    marriage settlement take the place of those given by. statute. “Provisio hominis
                    tollit provisionem legis.” The legal rights of a married woman apart from
                    contract were gradually limited, until by the time of Glanvill her person and
                    property had become during her husband’s lifetime entirely at his disposal, and
                    after his death limited to her dower and her <hi rend="italic">pars</hi><hi

                <p>A few of the more interesting matters in which the old common and statute law of
                    England placed women in a special position may be noticed. A woman was exempt
                    from legal duties more particularly attaching to men and not performable by
                    deputy. She could apparently originally not hold a proper feud, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> one of which the tenure was by military service.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is remarkable that the
                    great fiefs of France except the Isle of France, the special apanage of the

                    Laboulaye’s <hi rend="italic">Recherches.</hi></p><p/></note> The same principle
                    appears in the rule that she could not be endowed of a castle maintained for the
                    defence of the realm and not for the private use of the owner. She could receive
                    homage, but not render it in the form used by men, and she was privileged from
                    suit and service at the sheriff’s tourn. She was not sworn to the law by the

                    constable, either of a castle or a vill, but not sheriff, unless in the one case
                    of Westmorland, an hereditary office, exercised in person in the 17th century by
                    the famous Anne, countess of Dorset, Pembroke, and Montgomery. In certain cases
                    a woman could transmit rights which she could not enjoy. On such a power of
                    transmission, as Sir H. Maine shows,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Early Law and Custom,</hi> ch.

                    <hi rend="italic">through</hi> a woman was not a breach of the French
                    constitutional law, which rejected the claim <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a woman.
                    The jealousy of a woman’s political influence is strikingly shown by the case of
                    Alice Perrers, the mistress of Edward III. She was accused of breaking an
                    ordinance by which women had been forbidden to do business for hire and by way
                    of maintenance in the king’s court.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>By Magna Charta a woman could not appeal any one for murder except that of her
                    husband. This disability no doubt arose from the fact that in trial by battle
                    she naturally did not appear in person but by a champion. She was not admitted
                    as a witness to prove the status of a man on the question arising whether he
                    were free or a villein. She could not appoint a testamentary guardian, and could
                    only be a guardian even of her own children to a limited extent. Her will was
                    revoked by marriage, that of a man only by marriage and the subsequent birth of
                    a child (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Will).</hi> By 31 Hen. VI. c. 9 the king’s
                    writ out of chancery was granted to a woman alleging that she had become bound
                    by an obligation through force or fraud. By 39 Hen. VI. c. 2 a woman might have
                    livery of land as heiress at fourteen. Benefit of clergy was first allowed to
                    women partially by 21 Jac. I. c. 6, fully by 3 Will, and M. c. 9 and 4 and 5
                    Will, and M. c. 24. Public whipping was not abolished until 57 Geo. III. c. 75,
                    whipping in all cases until 1 Geo. IV. c. 57. Burning was the punishment
                    specially appropriated to women convicted of treason or witchcraft. A case of
                    sentence to execution by burning for petit treason occurred as lately as 1784.
                    In some old statutes very curious sumptuary regulations as to women’s dress
                    occur. By the sumptuary laws of Edward III. in 1363 (37 Edw. III. cc. 8-14)
                    women were in general to be dressed according to the position of their fathers
                    or husbands. Wives and daughters of servants were not to wear veils above twelve
                    pence in value. Handicraftsmen’s and yeomen’s wives were not to wear silk veils.
                    The use of fur was confined to the ladies of knights with a rental above 200
                    marks a year. Careful observance of difference of rank in the dress was also
                    inculcated by 3 Edw. IV. c. 5. The wife or daughter of a knight was not to wear
                    cloth of gold or sable fur, of a knight-bachelor not velvet, of an esquire or
                    gentleman not velvet, satin, or ermine, of a labourer not clothes beyond a
                    certain price or a girdle garnished with silver. By 22 Edw. IV. c. 1, cloth of
                    gold and purple silk were confined to women of the royal family. It is worthy of
                    notice that at the times of passing these sumptuary laws the trade interests of
                    women were protected by the legislature. By 37 Edw. III. c. 6, handicraftsmen
                    were to use only one mystery, but women might work as they had been accustomed.
                    3 Edw. IV. c. 3 forbade importation of silk and lace by Lombards and other alien
                    strangers, imagining to destroy the craft of the silk spinsters and all such
                    virtuous occupations for women. In some cases the wives and daughters of
                    tradesmen were allowed to assist in the trades of their husbands and fathers;
                    see, for instance, the Act concerning tanners, 1 Jac. I. c. 22. Some trading
                    corporations, such as the East India Company, recognized no distinction of sex
                    in their members. The disabilities imposed on women by substantive law are
                    sometimes traceable in the early law of procedure. For instance, by the Statute
                    of Essoins (12 Edw. II. st. 2), essoin <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">servitio regis</hi> did not lie where the party was a woman; that
                    is, a woman (with a few exceptions) could not excuse her absence from court by
                    alleging that she was on public duty. The influence of the church is very
                    clearly traceable in some of the earlier criminal legislation. Thus by 13 Edw.
                    I. st. 1, c. 34, it was punishable with three years’ imprisonment to carry away
                    a nun, even with her consent. The Six Articles, 31 Hen. VIII. c. 14, forbade
                    marriage and concubinage of priests and sanctioned vows of chastity by
                    women.</p>
                <p>The present position of women in English law may be treated, for purposes of
                    convenience, under several heads. Sex alone, as will appear, does not determine
                    the law: sex and marriage together must often be taken into consideration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Political Rights.—</hi> This branch of the law is full of
                    singular anomalies. A woman may fill some of the highest positions in the state.
                    She may be a queen, a regent, or a peeress in her own right.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Most peeresses are those who
                    have succeeded to ancient peerages by writ. Modern peerages are almost always
                    limited to heirs-male.</p></note> A queen regnant has, by 1 Mary, sess. 3, c. 1,
                    as full rights as a king. A peeress is entitled, by 20 Hen. VI. c. 9, to be
                    tried like a peer by the House of Lords or the court of the lord high steward
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Trial),</hi> and has a seat in the House of Lords, but
                    .no right of speaking or voting. Other public offices which a woman can fill are
                    those of overseer, guardian of the poor, churchwarden, and sexton. She may also,
                    if married, be one of a jury of matrons empanelled to determine the question of
                    pregnancy of a widow on a writ <hi rend="italic">de ventre</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >inspiciendo</hi> or of a female prisoner, but she cannot serve on an ordinary
                    jury. If unmarried or a widow she can vote in municipal, school board, local
                    government, poor law, and other elections of a local character (such as polls of
                    ratepayers under the Free Libraries and Borough Funds Acts), and can be a member
                    (whether married or not) of a school board, but apparently not an overseer or
                    guardian if maπ∙ied and living with her husband. She cannot be registered as a
                    voter or vote at a parliamentary election or be elected a member of parliament.
                    It was decided in 1868 that the words of Lord Brougham’s Act (13 and 14 Vict. c.
                    21, § 4), by which in all Acts words importing the masculine gender are to be
                    taken to include females unless the contrary is expressly provided, did not
                    bring a woman within the word “man” in the Representation of the People Act,

                    under the Representation of the People Act, 1884. The question of granting the
                    parliamentary franchise to women was first brought before the House of Commons
                    by John Stuart Mill in 1867, as an amendment to the Representation of the People
                    Bill of that year, and has uniformly been rejected on that and several
                    subsequent occasions. At present the Isle of Man is the only part of the United
                    Kingdom where such a right exists. It was there conceded in 1882 to unmarried
                    women with sufficient property qualification. For the precedence of women, see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Precedence.</hi> The national status of married women and

                    professions open to women is the medical. Such rights as may be possessed by the
                    Society of Apothecaries and the College of Surgeons to admit women to their
                    respective qualifications are specially saved by 37 and 38 Vict. c. 34 and 38
                    and 39 Vict. c. 43. By an Act of 1876 (39 and 40 Vict. c. 41) medical
                    qualifications may be granted, irrespective of sex, by any body empowered to
                    grant such qualifications. As a matter of fact the College of Surgeons does not
                    at present allow women to qualify, but the Society of Apothecaries and the
                    College of Surgeons of Ireland and the King’s and Queen’s College of Physicians
                    in Ireland follow the more liberal course. Admission to degrees, medical and
                    others, in the universities is only allowed to a limited extent. Oxford and
                    Cambridge admit women to examinations, but not to degrees. London, under its
                    supplemental charter of 1878, admits to all degrees. The University Education
                    (Ireland) Act, 1879, contains a section empowering the Royal University of
                    Ireland to examine women for degrees and certificates of proficiency. The
                    Endowed Schools Act, 1869, provides for extending to girls the benefits of
                    educational endowments. A similar provision is included in the City of London
                    Parochial Charities Act, 1883. Under the powers of these Acts, as well as by
                    private munificence, a considerable sum of money has been during the last few
                    years provided for the purposes of female education. Special regulations are
                    made by the Factories and Mines Acts as to the employment of women and girls in
                    factories and mines. Under no circumstances is a woman allowed to work
                    underground. The Shop Hours Regulation Act, 1886 (a temporary provision),
                    forbids the employment in shops of girls under eighteen for more than <pb

                    been employed to a greater extent than formerly in Government departments,
                    especially in the post-office. A married woman may, since the Married Women’s
                    Property Act, 1882, carry on a trade separately from her husband, and in such a
                    case is liable to be made a bankrupt. She may apparently be a partner of her
                    husband, and may lend him money, but in this case her claim to a dividend on his
                    bankruptcy is postponed to that of other creditors.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Family Rights.—</hi> The age at which a girl can contract a
                    valid marriage is, following Roman law, twelve; she is thus two years in advance
                    of a boy, who must be fourteen. Under the Infants Settlement Act (see <hi

                    seventeen with the approval of the court, the age for a man being twenty. An
                    unmarried woman is liable for the support of illegitimate children till they
                    attain the age of sixteen. She is generally assisted, in the absence of
                    agreement, by an affiliation order granted by magistrates. A married woman
                    having separate property is, under the Married Women’s Property Act, liable for
                    the support of her husband, children, and grandchildren becoming chargeable to
                    any union or parish. At common law the father was entitled as against the mother
                    to the custody of a legitimate child up to the age of sixteen, and could only
                    forfeit such right by misconduct. But the Court of Chancery, wherever there was
                    trust property and the infant could be made a ward of court, took a less rigid
                    view of the paternal rights and looked more to the interest of the child, and
                    consequently in some cases to the extension of the mother’s rights at common
                    law. Legislation has tended in the same direction. By 36 Vict. c. 12 the Court
                    of Chancery was empowered to enforce a provision in a separation deed, giving up
                    the custody or control of a child to the mother. The Judicature Act, 1873, § 25
                    (10), enacted that in questions relating to the custody and education of infants
                    the rules of equity should prevail. The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1886,
                    largely extended the mother’s powers of appointing and acting as a guardian, and
                    gave the court a discretion to regard the mother’s wishes as to the custody of
                    the children. The children of women convicted of crime or frequenting the
                    company of prostitutes may be sent to an industrial school. The principal
                    disabilities under which women are now placed may perhaps be classed under the
                    head of family rights, viz., exclusion of female heirs from intestate succession
                    to real estate, unless in absence of a male heir (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Inheritance, Primogeniture),</hi> and the obtaining of <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Rights of Property.—</hi> Unmarried women and widows have
                    practically equal rights with men. Since the date of the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Husband and Wife</hi> the Married Women’s Property Act, 1882,
                    has extended the change in the law attempted to a limited degree by the previous
                    Acts of 1870 and 1874. The most important provisions of the Act (45 and 46 Vict.
                    c. 75) falling under this head are the following. A married woman is capable of
                    acquiring, holding, and disposing by will or otherwise of any real and personal
                    property as her separate property, in the same manner as if she were a <hi
                    rend="italic">feme sole,</hi> without the intervention of any trustee. Every
                    contract entered into by a married woman is to be deemed to bind her separate
                    property, unless the contrary be shown. Property of a woman married after the
                    commencement of the Act, whether belonging to her at the time of marriage or
                    acquired after marriage, is to be held by her as a <hi rend="italic">feme
                    sole.</hi> The same is the case with property acquired after the commencement of
                    the Act by a woman married before the Act. After marriage a woman remains liable
                    for antenuptial debts and liabilities, and as between her and her husband, in
                    the absence of contract to the contrary, her separate property is to be deemed
                    primarily liable. The husband is only liable to the extent of property acquired
                    from or through his wife. The Act also contains provisions as to stock,
                    investment, insurance, evidence (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Witness),</hi> and
                    other matters. The effect of the Act is to render obsolete the old law as to
                    what creates a separate use or a reduction into possession of choses in action
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Personal Estate),</hi> as to equity to a settlement,
                    as to fraud on the husband’s marital rights,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This was a rale of law, confirmed, though not for the first
                    time established, by the well-known decision of Lord Thurlow in Countess of

                    engagement or betrothal. The only other instance in English law in which
                    betrothal gives any rights appears to be the action for breach of promise of
                    marriage. In the Mosaic law betrothal was, for the purposes of punishment of
                    adultery, equivalent to marriage (see Deut, xxii 23). In some modem systems
                    betrothal is a matter of more importance than it is in England. In Germany, for
                    instance, it is publicly advertised.</p></note> and as to the inability of one
                    of two married persons to give a gift to the other. Also, in the case of a gift
                    to a husband and wife in terms which would make them joint-tenants if unmarried,
                    they no longer take as one person but as two. The construction of the Act by the
                    courts has been in one or two cases perhaps somewhat narrow; still there is no
                    doubt that it has affected the proprietary rights of married women to an immense
                    extent. Its effect has been principally to improve the position of wives of the
                    humbler class unprotected by marriage settlement. There is a special saving in
                    the Act of existing and future settlement. A settlement is still necessary where
                    it is desired to secure only the enjoyment of the income to the wife and to
                    provide for children. The Act by itself would enable the wife, without regard to
                    family claims, instantly to part with the whole of any property which might come
                    to her. Restraint on anticipation, a means of protecting a married woman’s
                    property from her husband’s influence, is also preserved by the Act, subject to
                    the liability of such property for antenuptial debts, and to the power given to
                    the court by the Conveyancing Act, 1881, to bind a married woman’s interest
                    notwithstanding a clause of restraint. This possibility of being restrained from
                    anticipation is now one of the principal points of difference between the
                    proprietary rights of men and women. Formerly remaining unmarried could be
                    attached as a condition of the enjoyment of property by a widow only, but it has
                    been recently decided that such a condition may be imposed upon a widower as
                    well. In one case, however, the widow has still an advantage over the widower.
                    Limitations contained in her marriage settlement in favour of her children by a
                    former marriage are not treated as voluntary, while similar limitations in the
                    settlement of a widower are regarded as voluntary, and therefore void as against
                    a subsequent mortgagee of the settled property.<note anchored="true"

                    Rules of the Supreme Court and the Married Women’s Property Act contain various
                    provisions for the bringing and defending of actions by married women. The main
                    provision is § 1 (2) of the Act, enabling a married woman to sue and be sued,
                    either in contract or in tort or otherwise, in all respects as if she were a <hi
                    rend="italic">feme sole.</hi> Her position, however, is not, owing to the
                    judicial interpretation of the Act, as completely independent as the words of
                    the Act would at first sight appear to imply. It has been held, for instance,
                    that she cannot since the Act, any more than before it, be next friend or
                    guardian <hi rend="italic">ad litem</hi> of an infant. The husband and wife too
                    may still be sued jointly for a tort committed by the wife after marriage. Apart
                    from proceedings for divorce or judicial separation, a husband cannot sue his
                    wife for a tort committed during the coverture, nor a wife her husband, unless
                    for the protection and security of her separate property. She can, however,
                    cause him to be bound over in recognizances to keep the peace towards her in
                    case of violence on his part. The Married Women’s Property Act contains a useful
                    section enabling questions between husband and wife as to property to be decided
                    in a summary way. A judgment against a married woman under the Act is limited to
                    execution against her separate property; she cannot like an ordinary debtor be
                    committed to prison under the Debtors Act for default in payment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Criminal Law.—</hi> There are some offences which can be
                    committed only by women, others which can be committed only against them. Among
                    the former are concealment of birth (in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred), the
                    now obsolete offence of being a common scold, and prostitution and kindred
                    offences. Many offences of the latter kind were up to a recent date dealt with
                    under the Contagious Diseases Acts, which were repealed in 1886. Where a married
                    woman commits a crime in company with her husband, she is generally presumed to
                    have acted by his coercion, and so to be entitled to acquittal. This
                    presumption, however, was never made in witchcraft cases, and is not now made in
                    cases of treason, murder, and other grave crimes, or in crimes in which the
                    principal part must necessarily be taken by the wife, such as keeping a brothel.
                    In fact, the exceptions to the old presumption are now perhaps more numerous
                    than those falling within it. The doctrine of coercion and the practice of
                    separate acknowledgment of deeds by married women (necessary before the Married
                    Women’s Property Act) seem to be vestiges of the period when women, besides
                    being chattels, were treated as chattels.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It was certainly laid down by the Court of Chancery, in more
                    than one case, that the reason for enforcing acknowledgment of deeds by a
                    married woman apart from her husband was the presumption that in matters of
                    property she was sure to be coerced by him. If such were the truth, the separate
                    acknowledgment —a matter of a few minutes’ conversation—was but a poor
                    safeguard. The doctrine of coercion in felonies is attributed by Mr Justice
                    Stephen to the wish to give women, while they had not benefit of clergy, the
                    same chance of escape as men (see his <hi rend="italic">Digest of the Criminal
                    Law,</hi> App., note 1).</p><p/></note> Formerly a w ife could not steal her
                    husband’s property, but since the Married Women’s Property Act this has become
                    possible. The evidence of a wife is not usually receivable for or against her
                    husband (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Witness).</hi> She does not become an
                    accessory after the fact by receiving and harbouring her husband after he has
                    committed a felony; the husband, however, is not equally privileged if the
                    offence be committed by the wife. Adultery is now no crime, England being almost
                    the only country where such is the case. It was punished by fine in the
                    ecclesiastical courtsup to the 17th century, and was made criminal for a short
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n681/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0681-0642"/> time by an ordinance of the Long Parliament. The
                    offences which can be committed only against women are chiefly those against
                    decency, such as rape, procurement, and similar crimes, in which a considerable
                    change in the law in the direction of increased protection to women was made by
                    the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885. Another offence is abduction, which needs
                    to be separately mentioned, as it appears in law to be an offence partly against
                    the person, partly against property, for a difference is made between the
                    abduction of a woman with property and of one without property. As to offences
                    committed against a wife, recent legislation has made some considerable changes.
                    By the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1878, if a husband be convicted of an aggravated
                    assault upon his wife, the court before which he is tried may order (subject to
                    an appeal to the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of the High Court)
                    that the wife be no longer bound to cohabit with him, such order to have the
                    effect of a judicial separation on the ground of cruelty. The order may also
                    provide for payment of a weekly allowance by the husband to the wife and for the
                    custody of the children of the marriage. That of the children under ten may be
                    given to the wife. The Married Women’s Property Act gives a married woman
                    criminal remedies against all persons (including her husband) for the protection
                    of her separate property, with a proviso that no such criminal proceeding shall
                    be taken against a husband while they are living together, nor while they are
                    living apart, concerning any act done while they were living together, unless
                    the wife’s property have been wrongfully taken by the husband on desertion of
                    his wife. The section just cited extends the common law, under which the wife’s
                    redress for injuries committed by her husband was confined to injuries to the
                    person. But it extends it only to injuries to the separate property, and it has
                    recently been held that a wife cannot, under the terms of the section, proceed
                    against her husband criminally for a libel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    make an order for her support. Before the Act the wife’s only course was to
                    become chargeable to the parish, allowing the guardians to seek to recover from
                    the husband the cost of her maintenance. The punishment of a woman may still be

                    reasonable extent, would now certainly constitute an assault. The husband’s
                    rights are limited to restraining the wife’s liberty in case of her

                    Numerous ancient laws dealt with trade and sumptuary matters. By the <hi

                    a penalty of fourpence. The same laws also provided that a married woman
                    committing a trespass without her husband’s knowledge might be chastised like a
                    child under age. The <hi rend="italic">Statuta</hi><hi rend="italic">Gilde</hi>
                    of the 13th century enacted that a married woman might not buy wool in the
                    streets or buy more than a limited amount of oats. The same code also ensured a
                    provision for the daughter of one of the guild-brethren unable to provide for
                    herself through poverty, either by marrying her or putting her in a convent. By
                    the Act 1429, c. 9, wives were to be arrayed after the estate of their husbands.
                    By 1457, c. 13, no woman was to go to church with her face covered so that she
                    could not be known. 1581, c. 18, was conceived in a more liberal spirit, and
                    allowed women to wear any head-dress to which they had been accustomed. 1621, c.
                    25, permitted servants to wear their mistress’s cast-off clothes. 1681, c. 80,
                    contained the remarkable provision that not more than two changes of raiment
                    were to be made by a bride at her wedding. In its more modern aspect the law is

                    succession to Scottish peerages is different from that regulating the succession
                    to English peerages by writ. In case of the death of a peer leaving several
                    daughters and no son, the English peerage would fall into abeyance among the
                    daughters, but the eldest daughter would succeed to the Scottish peerage. In the
                    peerage law of Scotland there was no presumption that a peerage was limited to
                    males, and the more ancient peerages were often held by females or their
                    husbands in their right.</p></note> In the old law she could not do homage, but
                    only fealty, and she could not be arbiter, cautioner, or witness. A married
                    woman could be warrantor of heritables only where her husband was under age and
                    she was of full age. All disabilities of women as witnesses were removed by 31
                    and 32 Vict. c. 101, § 139. A woman is still not receivable as cautioner for an
                    executor-dative. Nor can she be tutor-at-law, but she may be appointed tutor by
                    testament or by the court. While tests existed women were exempt from the test
                    oath (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Test Acts).</hi> The Court of Session decided in
                    1868 that the parliamentary suffrage was confined to males.<note anchored="true"

                    England, women possess votes in elections to school boards and to municipal and
                    local bodies, the latter specially conferred by the Municipal Elections
                    Amendment Act, 1881, and the General Police and Improvement Act, 1882. The right
                    of married women to vote at school-board elections under the Education Act,
                    1872, appears to have caused some difficulty, and to have been differently
                    decided in different counties. Women are not admitted to degrees by the Scottish
                    universities, though several attempts have been made to confer upon them this
                    privilege. At one time, indeed, they seem to have practised medicine without
                    qualification, for in 1641, in a ratification of the privileges of the Edinburgh
                    chirurgeons, a complaint was recited that women practised chirurgy without
                    having learned the art. In 1873 the Court of Session decided that female
                    students could not graduate in medicine at Edinburgh.<note anchored="true"

                    have recently been exercised in favour of women by the Colleges of Physicians
                    and of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of
                    Glasgow. By the Educational Endowments Act, 1882, the benefits of endowments are
                    to be extended as far as possible to both sexes. In 1881 the Married Women’s
                    Property Act (44 and 45 Vict. c. 21) made important extensions of the rights
                    given to married women by the Act of 1877, for which see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Husband and Wife.</hi> A wife married after the date of the Act has a separate
                    estate in movable and heritable property. A husband has the same rights in the
                    movable estate of his deceased wife as a widow had before the Act in the estate
                    of her deceased husband. Children have a right of legitim in their mother’s
                    movable estate. The criminal law differs slightly from that of England. At one
                    time drowning was a punishment specially reserved for women. Incest or an
                    attempt to commit incest is still punishable as a crime, and has been so
                    punished within the last few years. Adultery and fornication are still nominally
                    crimes under old Acts, but criminal proceedings in these cases have fallen into
                    desuetude. The age of testamentary capacity is still twelve, not twenty-one, as
                    in England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> The Acts of Congress contain little
                    affecting the subject. Any woman married to a citizen of the United States who
                    might herself be lawfully naturalized is to be deemed a citizen. Women are
                    allowed as clerks in Government departments, and may be employed as nurses and
                    hospital matrons in the army. The right of voting for Congress or for the State
                    legislatures is still denied in the country as a whole, in spite of the strong
                    attempts which have been made by the advocates of female suffrage. The right,
                    however, exists to a limited extent. In the Territories of Washington, Wyoming,
                    and Utah women vote, and in the constitutions of some States, such as Colorado
                    and Wisconsin, it is provided that the right of suffrage may be extended to
                    women by a majority of electors at a general election. The constitutions of most
                    States confine the parliamentary franchise to male electors. The admission of
                    women to the school franchise is, however, largely increasing, and had in 1887
                    been adopted by fourteen States. In a limited number of States the professions
                    (except the military) are open to women. Where the legal profession is not so
                    open, a refusal by a State court to grant a licence to practise law is no breach
                    of the Federal constitution (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Privilege).</hi> In most
                    States the policy adopted in England by the Married Women’s Property Act is the
                    rule, and there is in general no distinction of sex in succession to real
                    estate. For the testamentary rights of married women see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Will.</hi> In some of the State universities women are admitted to full
                    privileges of instruction and graduation. In others, such as the university of
                    Pennsylvania, they are admitted to instruction and examination, but not to
                    graduation. The law in some cases gives women remedies for tort which are
                    unknown in England. For instance, by the law of some States a woman may bring an
                    action of <hi rend="smallcaps">Seduction</hi> (q.v.) in her own name, and may
                    recover damages for slander imputing unchastity, without proof of special
                    damage, which cannot be done in England. The criminal law is also more
                    extensive. In the New England and some of the other States mere fornication is
                    punishable as a crime. Adultery is criminal by the law of most States.</p>

                    rend="italic">—</hi> The action for breach of promise of marriage is in some of
                    its incidents peculiar to English law. In Roman law, betrothal <hi rend="italic"
                    >(sponsalia}</hi> imposed a duty on the betrothed to become husband and wife
                    within a reasonable time, subject to the termination of the obligation by death,
                    repudiation by the words <hi rend="italic">conditione</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tua</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic">utor,</hi> or lapse of
                    time, the time fixed being two years. No action lay for breach of promise to
                    marry unless <hi rend="italic">arrhae sponsalitiae</hi> had been given, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> earnest of the bargain, to be forfeited by the party
                    refusing to carry it out. The <hi rend="italic">αrrha</hi> might also be given
                    by a parent, and was equally liable to forfeiture. A provincial governor, or one
                    of his relations or household, could not recover any <hi rend="italic"
                    >arrha</hi> that might have been given, it being supposed that he was in a
                    position of authority and able to exercise influence in forcing consent to a
                    betrothal.</p>
                <p>In the canon law breach of the promise made by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sponsalia,</hi> whether <hi rend="italic">de praesenti</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">futuro,</hi> a division unknown to Roman
                    law, does not without more appear to have sufficed to found an action for its
                    breach, except so far as it fell under ecclesiastical cognizance as <hi
                    rend="italic">laesio</hi><hi rend="italic">fidei,</hi> but it had the more
                    serious legal effect of avoiding as a canonical disability the subsequent
                    marriage, while the original <hi rend="italic">sponsalia</hi> continued, of a
                    betrothed person to any other than the one to whom he or she was originally
                    betrothed. The <hi rend="italic">sponsalia</hi> became inoperative, either by
                    mutual consent or by certain supervening impediments, such as ordination or a
                    vow of chastity. The canonical disability of pre-contract was removed in England
                    by 32 Hen. VIII. c. 38, re-established in the reign of Edward VI., and finally
                    abolished in 1753.</p>
                <p>In England the duty of the parties is the same as in Roman law, viz., to carry
                    out the contract within a reasonable time, if no time be specially fixed.
                    Formerly a contract to marry could be specifically enforced by the
                    ecclesiastical court compelling a celebration of the marriage <hi rend="italic"
                    >in facie ecclesiae.</hi> The last instance of a suit for this purpose was in
                    1752, and the right to bring it was abolished in 1753 by Lord Hardwicke’s Act
                    (26 Geo. II. c. 33). The action for breach of promise may be brought by a man or
                    a woman, though the former case has been of rare occurrence, and a male
                    plaintiff has still more rarely been rewarded with anything more than nominal
                    damages. It may be brought by but not against an infant, and not against an
                    adult if he or she has merely ratified a promise made during infancy; it may be
                    brought against but not by a married man or woman (in spite of the inherent
                    incapacity of such a person to have married the plaintiff), and neither by nor
                    against the personal representatives of a deceased party to the promise (unless
                    where special damage has accrued to the personal estate of the deceased). The
                    promise need not be in writing. The parties to an action are by 32 and 33 Vict.
                    c. 68 competent witnesses; the plaintiff cannot, however, recover a verdict
                    without his or her testimony being corroborated by other material evidence. The
                    measure of damages is to a greater extent than in most actions at the discretion
                    of the jury; they may take into consideration the injury to the plaintiff’s
                    feelings, especially if the breach of promise be aggravated by seduction. Either
                    party has a right to trial by jury under the rules of the Supreme Court, 1883.
                    The action cannot be tried in a county court, unless by consent, or unless
                    remitted for trial there by the High Court. Unchastity of the plaintiff unknown
                    to the defendant when the promise was made and dissolution of the contract by
                    mutual consent are the principal defences which are usually raised to the
                    action. Bodily infirmity of the defendant is no defence to the action, though it
                    may justify the other party in refusing to marry the person thus affected. Where
                    the betrothed are within prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity, there
                    can be no valid promise at all, and so no action for its breach.</p>
                <p>In Scotland a promise in the nature of <hi rend="italic">sponsalia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">futuro</hi> not followed by consummation
                    may be resiled from, subject to the liability of the party in fault to an action
                    for the breach, which by 6 Geo. IV. c. 120, s. 28, is a proper cause for trial
                    by jury. If, however, the <hi rend="italic">sponsalia</hi> be <hi rend="italic"
                    >de praesenti,</hi> and, according to the more probable opinion, if they be <hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">futuro</hi> followed by consum mation, a
                    pre-contract is constituted, giving a right to a decree of declarator of
                    marriage and equivalent to marriage, unless declared void during the lifetime of
                    the parties.</p>
                <p>In the United States the law is in general accordance with that of England. The
                    statute law of California and Dakota provides that the unchastity of one party
                    of which the other is ignorant is a good defence, but it is no defence if both
                    participate therein. (J. W+.)</p>
