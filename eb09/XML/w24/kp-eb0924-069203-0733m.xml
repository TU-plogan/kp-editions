                <p><label type="entry">WRIT</label>, in law, is a formal commission from the crown
                    or other supreme executive officer to an inferior executive officer or to a
                    private person, enjoining some act or omission. The word represents the Latin
                    <hi rend="italic">brevis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">breve</hi> (both forms are
                    found, the latter more commonly), so called, according to Bracton, from its
                    shortly expressing the intention of the framer, “quia breviter et paucis verbis
                    intentionem proferentis exponit.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    >intentio</hi> is here used in its ordinary sense or in the technical
                    signification which it bore as a part of the Roman <hi rend="italic"
                    >formula</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Roman Law,</hi> vol. XX. p.
                    707-8).</p></note> The <hi rend="italic">breve</hi> can be traced back as far as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Theodosianus</hi> (438 A.D.),
                    where one of its meanings is that of an official report or letter. It bears a
                    similar meaning in some of the capitularies of the Frankish kings. The <hi
                    rend="italic">interdictum</hi> of Roman law sometimes represents the writ of
                    English law; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> there is considerable likeness between
                    the Roman <hi rend="italic">interdictum</hi><hi rend="italic">de libero</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">homine exhibendo</hi> and the English writs of <hi rend="italic"

                    >homine</hi><hi rend="italic">replegiando.</hi> From Roman law the <hi

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0734-0693"/> both in a sense differing from that at present
                    borne by the writ of English law. The <hi rend="italic">breve testatum,</hi> of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Liber Feudorum</hi> was an instrument in writing made on
                    the land at the time of giving seisin by the lord to the tenant, and attested by
                    the seals of the lord and the <hi rend="italic">pares curiae</hi> or other
                    witnesses. In England such witnesses were part of the inquest, and joined in the
                    verdict in case of disputed right until 12 Edw. II. st. 1, c. 2. The <hi
                    rend="italic">breve testatum</hi> in England developed into the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Feoffment (&lt;∕.u),</hi> later into the deed of grant (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Real Estate)</hi>; in Scotland into the charter, and later into
                    the disposition. In canon law <hi rend="italic">breve</hi> denoted a letter
                    under the pope’s seal. In old English ecclesiastical law a brief meant letters
                    patent issued out of Chancery to churchwardens or other officers for the
                    collection of money for church purposes. Such briefs were regulated by 4 Anne c.
                    14, but are now obsolete, although they are still to be found named in one of
                    the rubrics in the communion service of the Book of Common Prayer. In English
                    legal practice brief now denotes the written instructions put into the hands of
                    counsel to form the basis of his case. It was probably so called from its at
                    first being only a copy of the original writ. Such a brief is in Scotland called
                    a memorial.</p>
                <p>The writ in English law still occupies a very important position, which can
                    scarcely be understood without a sketch of its history. To a certain extent this
                    history has already been given under <hi rend="smallcaps">Pleading,</hi> for the
                    whole theory of pleading depends in the last resort upon the writ. Writ or <hi
                    rend="italic">breve</hi> was at first used in a less technical sense than that
                    which it afterwards assumed: thus in the <hi rend="italic">Leges Henrici</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Primi</hi> it simply means a letter from the king, and in the
                    Assize of Clarendon (1166) <hi rend="italic">imbreviari</hi> means to be
                    registered. It became formalized by the reign of Henry II., and precedents are
                    given by Glanvill. The writ process was at that date the foundation of all civil
                    justice in the king’s court, and of much in the lower courts, and was a
                    profitable source of revenue to the exchequer. Every writ had to be purchased
                    <hi rend="italic">{breνe</hi><hi rend="italic">perquirere</hi> was the technical
                    term). This purchase developed in later times into the payment of a fine to the
                    king where the damages were laid above £40. The usual scale was 6s. 8d. for
                    every 100 marks claimed. In suing out a writ of covenant, the basis of the
                    proceedings in levying a fine (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Entail),</hi> the king
                    was entitled to his <hi rend="italic">primer fine, i.e.,</hi> one-tenth of the
                    annual value of the land concerned. The sale of writs was forbidden by Magna
                    Charta and other statutes in certain cases, especially that of the writ <hi
                    rend="italic">de odio</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">atia</hi>
                    in favour of the liberty of the subject. A solicitor was so called because his
                    original duty was to solicit or sue out a writ and take the due proceedings by
                    paying the proper fine. The costs of a writ purchased were first allowed to a
                    successful demandant by the Statute of Gloucester, 6 Edw. I. c. 1. Through the
                    Norman period the prerogative of issuing writs seems to have been undisputed.
                    Glanvill’s precedents did not exhaust all possible forms, for in the time of
                    Bracton, in the 13th century, it was still possible to frame new writs at the
                    pleasure of the crown. The Provisions of Oxford in 1258 put an end to this by
                    enacting that the chancellor should not seal anything out of course <hi
                    rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> any writ for which there was no precedent) by the will
                    of the king, but that he should do it by the council. In 1285 the Statute of
                    Westminster the Second, 13 Edw. I. st. 1, c. 24, re established the power of the
                    crown within certain limits, that is, in causes of action in a similar case
                    falling under the same law <hi rend="italic">{in</hi><hi rend="italic">consimili
                    casu cadente</hi><hi rend="italic">sub</hi><hi rend="italic">eodem</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">jure)</hi> as those for which precedents of Writs already existed
                    in the Chancery (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Trespass, Trover).</hi> These
                    precedents were at an early date recorded in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Registrum</hi><hi rend="italic">Brevium,</hi> called by Sir Edward Coke the
                    oldest book in the common law. Apart from the powers given by the statute, new
                    writs could only be issued by the authority of parliament, and writs are
                    sometimes found set out in statutes, especially in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Statutum</hi><hi rend="italic">Walliae,</hi> 12 Edw. I. c. 7, where precedents
                    of the most usual writs will be found. The Statute of Westminster the Second
                    itself contained precedents of the writ of formedon and of many others. The
                    original flexibility of the writ was thus limited within comparatively narrow
                    bounds. The right to the issue of the writ determined the right of action. So
                    essential was the writ that it was a legal axiom in Bracton that no one could
                    sue at law without a writ, and it was called by Coke, in his introduction to
                    Littleton, “the heartstrings of the common law.” As such it occupied an
                    important place in some of the leading statutes dealing with constitutional
                    rights. The Statute of Marlbridge, 52 Hen. III. c. 22, forbade a lord to
                    distrain his freeholders to answer for their freeholds, or for anything touching
                    their freeholds, without the king’s writ. By 25 Edw. III. st. 5, c. 4, it was
                    accorded, asserted, and stablished that none should be taken by petition or
                    suggestion made to the king or his council unless by indictment or presentment
                    in due manner or by process made by writ original at the common law. 42 Edw.
                    III. c. 3 provided that no man should be put to answer without presentment
                    before justices, or matter of record, or by due process and writ original
                    according to the old law of the land. Both these statutes were recited and the
                    general principle confirmed by 16 Car. I. c. 10. Uniformity of procedure was
                    secured by 27 Hen. VIII. c. 24, by which all writs were to be in the king’s name
                    in a county palatine or liberty, but tested by those who had the county palatine
                    or liberty. It was not until 1731 that, by virtue of 4 Geo. II. c. 26, writs
                    were framed in the English language. They had previously been in Latin; this
                    accounts for the Latin names by which a large number are still known. The writ
                    was issued from the common law side of the Chancery, and was in the special
                    charge of the manager and petty bag offices. Though issuing from the king’s
                    Chancery, it did not necessarily direct the trial of the question in the king’s
                    court. In whatever court it was returnable, it called in the aid of the sheriff
                    as executive officer. It was either addressed to him or, if addressed to the
                    party alleged to be in default, it concluded with a threat of constraint by the
                    sheriff in the event of disobedience, generally in those terms, “et, nisi
                    feceris, vicecomes de N. faciat ne amplius clamorem audiam pro defectu
                    justitiae.” If the writ was returnable in the county court or the lord’s court,
                    the sheriff or the lord sat as the deputy of the king, not by virtue of his
                    inherent jurisdiction. The writ was not necessary for the initiation of
                    proceedings in these courts or before the justices in eyre (who sat as judges of
                    the county court),<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    distinction between the royal and local courts was not perhaps at all times very
                    strictly drawn. Thus in the <hi rend="italic">Leges Ηenriei</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Primi,</hi> c. 31, the county court is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >curia</hi><hi rend="italic">regis.</hi></p></note> but a custom seems to have
                    grown up of suing out a writ from the king where the claim was above 40s. Cases
                    were transferred from the lord’s court to the county court by writ of <hi
                    rend="italic">tolt</hi> (so called because it removed, <hi rend="italic"
                    >tollit,</hi> the case), from the latter to the king’s court by writ of <hi
                    rend="italic">pone</hi> (so called from its first word). By Magna Charta the
                    power of bringing a suit in the king’s court in the first instance by writ of
                    <hi rend="italic">praecipe</hi> was taken away, and the writ was thenceforth
                    only returnable in the king’s court where the tenant held of the king ⅛ <hi
                    rend="italic">capite,</hi> or where the lord had no court or abandoned his
                    right. Hence it became a common form in the writ of right to allege that the
                    lord had renounced his court <hi rend="italic">{dominus remisit</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">curiam)</hi> so as to secure trial in the king’s court. Besides
                    being used for the trial of disputes, writs addressed to sheriffs, mayors,
                    commissioners, or others were in constant use for financial <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n735/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0735-0694"/> and political purposes, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> for the collection of fifteenths, scutage, tallage, àc., for summons
                    to the council and later to parliament, and for recalling a parliament, the last
                    by means of the rarely occurring writ <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >revocatione</hi><hi rend="italic">parliamenti.</hi></p>
                <p>There were several divisions of writs (excluding those purely financial and
                    political), the most important being that into original and judicial, the former
                    (tested in the name of the king) issued to bring a suit before the proper court,
                    the latter (tested in the name of a judge) issued during the progress of a suit
                    or to enforce judgment. Original were either optional, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> giving an option of doing a certain act or of showing cause why it
                    was not done, beginning with the words <hi rend="italic">praecipe quod</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">reddat,</hi> the principal example being the writ on which
                    proceedings in a common recovery (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Entail)</hi> were
                    based, or peremptory, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> calling on a person to do a
                    certain act, beginning with the words <hi rend="italic">si</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >A fecerit te securum.</hi> Original were also either <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">cursu</hi> or <hi rend="italic">magistralia,</hi> the
                    former those fixed in form and depending on precedent, the latter those framed
                    by the masters in Chancery under the powers of the Statute of Westminster the
                    Second. They were also either general or special, the latter setting forth the
                    grounds of the demand with greater particularity than the former. By 5 Geo. II.
                    c. 27 special writs were confined to causes of action amounting to £10 or
                    upwards. There was also a division of writs into writs of right <hi
                    rend="italic">(ex</hi><hi rend="italic">debito</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >justitiae),</hi> such as <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus,</hi> and prerogative
                    writs <hi rend="italic">(ex gratia),</hi> such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >mandamus</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Prerogative).</hi> Coke and other
                    authorities mention numerous other divisions, but those which have been named
                    appear to be the principal.</p>
                <p>The most interesting form of writ from the historical point of view was the writ
                    of right <hi rend="italic">(breve de recto),</hi> called by Blackstone “the
                    highest writ in the law,” used at first for debt and other personal claims,
                    afterwards confined to the recovery of real estate as the writ of right <hi
                    rend="italic">par excellence.</hi> It was so called from the words <hi
                    rend="italic">plenum rectum</hi> contained in it, and was the remedy for
                    obtaining justice for ouster from or privation of the freehold. By it property
                    as well as possession could be recovered. It generally lay in the king’s court,
                    as has been said, by virtue of a fictitious allegation. In that case it was
                    addressed to the sheriff and was called a writ of right close. It was also a
                    writ of right close where the lands in dispute were held in antient demesne.
                    When addressed to the lord and tried in his court, it was generally a writ of
                    right patent. After the appearance of the tenant the demandant in a writ of
                    right counted, that is, claimed against the tenant according to the writ, but in
                    more precise terms, the writ being as it were the embryo of the future count.
                    The trial was originally by battle (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Trial),</hi> but in
                    the reign of Henry II. an alternative procedure was introduced, interesting as
                    the earliest example of the substitution of something like the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Jury</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> system for the judicial
                    combat. A writ <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">magna assisa
                    eligenda</hi> was directed to the sheriff commanding him to return four knights
                    of the county and vicinage to the court, there to return twelve other knights of
                    the vicinage to try upon oath the question contained in the writ of right
                    (technically called the <hi rend="italic">mise).</hi> This mode of trial was
                    known as trial by the grand assize. Generally the whole of the sixteen knights
                    were sworn, though twelve was a sufficient number. The last occasion of trial by
                    the grand assize was in 1835. But long before that date possessory had from
                    their greater convenience tended to supersede proprietary remedies, and in most
                    cases the title was sufficiently determined by the assizes of other kinds,
                    especially that of novel disseisin and later by proceedings in ejectment (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Possession).</hi> The oath of the champion on proceedings
                    in a writ of right where the alternative of the judicial combat was accepted was
                    regulated by statute, 3 Edw. I. c. 4L The writ of right is also interesting as
                    being the basis of the law of <hi rend="smallcaps">Limitation</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> By the Statute of Merton, 20 Hen. III. c. 8, no
                    seisin could be alleged by the demandant but from the time of Henry II. By 3
                    Edw. I. c. 39 the time was fixed at the reign of Richard I., by 32 Hen. VIII. c.
                    2 at sixty years at the most. There were other writs of right with special
                    names, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the writ of right by the custom of London
                    for land in London, the writ of right of advowson, brought by the patron to
                    recover his right of presentation to a benefice, and the writs of right of dower
                    and <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">rationabili</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >parte,</hi> the latter brought by coparceners or brothers in gavelkind. There
                    were also writs in the nature of a writ of right, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    formedon, brought by a reversioner on discontinuance by a tenant in tail and
                    given by the Statute <hi rend="italic">De Donis</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Entail)</hi>; escheat, brought by the lord where the tenant died without an
                    heir; <hi rend="italic">ne injuste</hi><hi rend="italic">vexes,</hi> to prohibit
                    the lord from exacting services or rents beyond his due; <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">nativo habendo,</hi> to recover the inheritance in a
                    villein; and the little writ of right close according to the custom of the
                    manor, to try in the lord’s court the right of the king’s tenants in antient
                    demesne.</p>
                <p>Up to 1832 an action was (except as against certain privileged persons, such as
                    attorneys) commenced by original writ, and writ practically became the
                    equivalent of action, and is so used in old books of practice, such as Booth on
                    <hi rend="italic">Real Actions.</hi> The law was gradually altered by
                    legislation and still more by the introduction of fictitious proceedings in the
                    common law courts, to be described later, by which the issue of the original
                    writ was suspended, except in real actions, which were of comparatively rare
                    occurrence. The original writ is no longer in use in civil procedure, an action
                    being now in all cases commenced by the writ of summons, a judicial writ, a
                    procedure first introduced in 1832 by 2 Will. IV. c. 39. In the following year
                    an immense number of the old writs were abolished by 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 27. An
                    exception was made in favour of the writ of right of dower, writ of dower <hi
                    rend="italic">unde nihil</hi><hi rend="italic">habet,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    >Ejectment</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> and of the plaints for free bench
                    and dower in the nature of writs of right. Ejectment was remodelled by the
                    Common Law Procedure Act, 1852; the other writs and plaints remained up to the
                    Common Law Procedure Act, 1860, by which they were abolished. Other writs which
                    have been superseded by simpler proceedings, generally by ordinary actions, are
                    those of the four assizes of novel disseisin, <hi rend="italic">juris</hi><hi

                    them is almost impossible, but a few of those of more special interest which
                    have become obsolete may be shortly mentioned. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Admeηsuratio</hi> lay against persons usurping more than their share of
                    property. It was either <hi rend="italic">dotis</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pasturae,</hi> the latter, like the Scotch “souming and rouming,” being the
                    remedy for surcharge of common. <hi rend="italic">Alias</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">pluries</hi> writs were issued when a previous writ had been
                    disobeyed. <hi rend="italic">Attaint</hi> lay to inquire by a jury of
                    twenty-four whether a jury of twelve had given a false verdict. It was
                    superseded in the 16th century by the practice of setting aside a verdict or
                    granting a new trial, and was finally abolished by 6 Geo. IV. c. 50. <hi
                    rend="italic">Audita querela</hi> was a means of relieving a defendant by a
                    matter of discharge occurring after judgment. After having been long practically
                    superseded by stay of execution it was finally abolished by the rules made under
                    the Judicature <pb break="no"

                    latitat,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quominus</hi> are interesting as showing the
                    extraordinary mass of fictitious allegation in the old procedure of the common
                    law courts before 1832. By <hi rend="italic">capias ad respondendum</hi>
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pluries</hi> the
                    Court of Common Pleas was enabled to take cognizance of an action without the
                    actual issue of an original writ. The <hi rend="italic">capias</hi> was a
                    judicial writ issued to follow an original writ of trespass <hi rend="italic"
                    >quia clausum</hi><hi rend="italic">fregit.</hi> The issue of the original writ
                    and after a time the issue of the <hi rend="italic">capias</hi> became mere
                    fictions, and proceedings commenced with the issue of another writ called <hi
                    rend="italic">capias testatum.</hi> On return of the writ the plaintiff elected
                    to proceed with a cause of action other than trespass, and the real merits of
                    the case were eventually reached in this tortuous manner. After being served
                    with the <hi rend="italic">capias</hi> the defendant was bound to put in common
                    or special bail, the former being sufficient in all but exceptional cases. Here
                    again there was a fiction, for his common bail were John Doe and Richard Roe.
                    The same fictitious pair also appeared on the side of the plaintiff as his
                    pledges for the due prosecution of his action. By <hi rend="italic">latitat</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">quominus</hi> the Courts of King’s Bench and Exchequer
                    respectively assumed jurisdiction by a further series of fictions over ordinary
                    civil actions. The writ of <hi rend="italic">latitat,</hi> following the bill of
                    Middlesex, itself in later times generally a fiction, alleged that the defendant
                    was in hiding out of Middlesex, after committing a trespass <hi rend="italic"
                    >quia clausum,</hi><hi rend="italic">fregit,</hi> for which he was in the
                    custody of the king’s marshal in the Marshalsea prison. The real cause of action
                    was then stated in what was called the <hi rend="italic">αc</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">etiam</hi> clause. Writs filed in the King’s Bench and Common
                    Pleas were in the custody of an officer of each court called the <hi
                    rend="italic">custos brevium.</hi> The writ of <hi rend="italic">quominus</hi>
                    alleged that the plaintiff was the king’s debtor and that through the
                    defendant’s default he was unable to discharge the debt. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deceit</hi> or <hi rend="italic">disceit</hi> lay for the redress of anything
                    done deceitfully in the name of another, but was especially used to reverse a
                    judgment in a real action obtained by collusion. <hi rend="italic">Distraint of
                    knighthood</hi> was a mode of obtaining money for the crown by the exercise of
                    the prerogative of forcing every one who held a knight’s fee under the crown to
                    be knighted or to pay a fine. The earliest extant writ was issued in 1278. It
                    was abolished by 16 Car. L c. 20. <hi rend="italic">Entry</hi> was a possessory
                    remedy against one alleged to hold land unlawfully. It was divided into a large
                    number of kinds, and was the subject of much of the old real property learning.
                    The ones most commonly occurring were the writs of entry in the <hi
                    rend="italic">per</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">post,</hi> the former
                    alleging, the latter not, the title of the heir from the original disseisor.
                    When writ had come to be equivalent in meaning to action, one of the divisions
                    of possessory actions was into writs of entry and writs of assize. A special
                    writ of entry for dower was given by 6 Edw. I. c. 7. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Excommunicato capiendo</hi> was the authority for arresting an excommunicated
                    person and detaining him until he was reconciled to the church, when he was
                    liberated by the writ <hi rend="italic">de excommunicato</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >deliberando.</hi> These proceedings were abolished and the writ <hi
                    rend="italic">de contumace</hi><hi rend="italic">capiendo</hi> substituted by 57
                    Geo. III. c. 127 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Excommunication).</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Haeretico</hi><hi rend="italic">comburendo</hi> was issued on
                    certificate of conviction for heresy by the ecclesiastical court. A case of
                    burning two Arians under this writ occurred as lately as the reign of James I.
                    It was abolished by 29 Car. II. c. 9. <hi rend="italic">Homine replegiando,</hi>
                    mainprize, and <hi rend="italic">odio</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">atia</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">bono et malo)</hi> were all
                    ancient means of securing the liberty of the subject, long superseded by the
                    more effective procedure of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus.</hi> The last of
                    the three enjoined the sheriff to inquire whether a committal on suspicion of
                    murder was on just cause or from malice and ill-will. It was regulated by Magna
                    Charta and the Statute of Westminster the Second, but, having been abused to the
                    advantage of sheriffs, it was taken away by 28 Edw. III. c. 9. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nisi</hi><hi rend="italic">prius</hi> was given by the Statute of Westminster
                    the Second, 13 Edw. I. c. 30. Its place is now taken by the commission of <hi

                    before the present Book of Common Prayer, enjoined public prayers for the high
                    court of parliament. <hi rend="italic">Privilege</hi> commanded the release of a
                    prisoner entitled to privilege of parliament. <hi rend="italic">Protection</hi>
                    was given for enabling a man to be quit of suits brought against him while
                    absent beyond seas. It was dealt with by a large number of old statutes, but
                    none has been issued since 1692. <hi rend="italic">Rebellion</hi> was a means of
                    enforcing obedience to the process of the Court of Chancery. In modern procedure
                    attachment takes its place. <hi rend="italic">Rege inconsulto</hi> commanded
                    judges of a court not to proceed in a case which might prejudice the king until
                    his pleasure should be known. <hi rend="italic">Replevin</hi> was a survival of
                    the most archaic law. The procedure consisted of writ on writ to an almost
                    unlimited extent. It originally began by the issue of a writ of replevin or <hi
                    rend="italic">replegiarifacias.</hi> The case might be removed from the county
                    court to a superior court by writ of <hi rend="italic">recordari</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">facias</hi><hi rend="italic">loquelam.</hi> If the distrainor
                    claimed a property in the goods distrained, the question of property or no
                    property was determined by a writ <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >proprietate</hi><hi rend="italic">probanda,</hi> and, if decided in favour of
                    the distrainor, the distress was to be returned to him by writ <hi rend="italic"
                    >de retomo</hi><hi rend="italic">habendo.</hi> If the goods were removed or
                    concealed, a writ of <hi rend="italic">capias in withernam</hi> enabled the
                    sheriff, after due issue of <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >pluries</hi> writs, to take a second distress in place of the one removed. It
                    is said that the question whether goods taken in <hi rend="italic"
                    >ινithernam</hi> could be replevied was the only one which the Admirable
                    Crichton found himself unable to answer. For the modern practice, see <hi

                    illustrative of ancient manners. It lay where two parsons contended for a
                    church, and one of them entered with a great number of laymen and kept out the
                    other by force. As lately as 1867 an application for the issue of the writ was
                    made to the Chancery Court of the Bermuda Islands, but refused on the ground
                    that the writ was obsolete, and that the same relief could be obtained by
                    injunction. On appeal this refusal was sustained by the privy council.</p>

                    having been made by the Great Seal (Officers) Act, 1874, and the Judicature
                    (Officers) Act, 1879, for the transfer on the next vacancy of the duties of the
                    clerk of the petty bag to those officers. By the latter Act the record and writ
                    clerks, previously officers of the Chancery Division, were abolished. By 40 and
                    41 Vict. c. 41 the wafer great seal or the wafer privy seal may be attached to
                    writs instead of the impression of the great or privy seal. The judicial writs
                    issue chiefly, if not entirely, from the central office, with which tlíe old
                    crown office was incorporated by the Act of 1879. The crown office had charge of
                    writs occurring in crown practice, such as <hi rend="italic">quo warranto</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">certiorari.</hi></p>
                <p>In local civil courts, other than county courts, writs are usually issued out of
                    the office of the registrar, or an officer of similar jurisdiction. By 35 and 36
                    Vict. c. 86 writs of execution from such courts for sums under £20 may be
                    stamped or sealed as of course by the registrar of a county court, and executed
                    as if they had issued from the county court. In county court practice the <pb

                    >(q.v.)</hi> corresponds generally to the writ of the Supreme Court. Most of the
                    present law on the subject of writs is contained in the Rules of the Supreme
                    Court, 1883, Ord. xlii.-xliv., and in the Crown Office Rules, 1886. Both sets of
                    rules contain numerous precedents in their schedules. By Ord. ii. r. 8 of the
                    rules of 1883 all writs (with certain exceptions) are to be tested in the name
                    of the lord chancellor, or, if that office be vacant, in the name of the lord
                    chief justice. The main exceptions are those which occur in crown practice,
                    which are tested by the lord chief justice. The writ of error bears the tests of
                    the king or queen, “witness ourselves.” Before the issue of most writs a <hi
                    rend="italic">praecipe,</hi> or authority to the proper offices to issue the
                    writ, is necessary. This is of course not to be confounded with the old original
                    writ of <hi rend="italic">praecipe.</hi> Writs affecting land must generally be
                    registered in order to bind the land (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Registration).</hi> A writ cannot as a rule be served on Sunday (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sunday).</hi> Some of the more important modern writs (other
                    than those of an extrajudicial nature) may be shortly noticed. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Habeas Corpus, Mandamus,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Prohibition</hi> (yg ’.u.) have been already treated. Writs are generally,
                    unless where the contrary is stated, addressed to the sheriff. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abatement</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nocumento amovendo</hi> enjoins the removal
                    of a nuisance iu pursuance of a judgment to that effect. <hi rend="italic">Ad
                    quod damnum</hi> is for the purpose of inquiring whether a proposed crown grant
                    will be to the damage of the crown or others. It is still in use, and recent
                    examples will be found in the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette.</hi> If the
                    inquiry be determined in favour of the subject, a reasonable fine is payable to
                    the exchequer by 27 Edw. I. st. 2. <hi rend="italic">Attachment</hi> is issued
                    as a means of supporting the dignity of the court by punishment for contempt of
                    its orders (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Contempt of Court).</hi> Since the
                    Judicature Acts a uniform practice has been followed in all the branches of the
                    High Court, and a writ of attachment can now only be issued by leave of the
                    court or a judge after notice to the party against whom it is to be issued. <hi
                    rend="italic">Capias</hi>: the old writs of <hi rend="italic">capias ad

                    used, but their importance has been much diminished since the alterations made
                    in the law by the Debtors Act, 1869, and the abolition of civil outlawry (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Outlaw).</hi><hi rend="italic">Certiorari</hi> is a writ in
                    very frequent use, by which the proceedings of an inferior court are brought up
                    for review by the High Court. In general it lies for excess of jurisdiction as
                    <hi rend="italic">mandamus</hi> does for defect. The Summary Jurisdiction Act,
                    1879, makes the writ no longer necessary where a special case has been stated by
                    a court of quarter sessions. <hi rend="italic">Delivery</hi> enforces a judgment
                    for the delivery of property without giving the defendant (unless at the option
                    of the plaintiff) power to retain it on payment of the assessed value. <hi
                    rend="italic">Distringas</hi> lay to distrain a person for a crown debt or for
                    his appearance on a certain day. Its operation has been much curtailed by the
                    substitution of other proceedings by 28 and 29 Vict. c. 104, and the rules of
                    the Supreme Court. It now seems to lie only against inhabitants for non-repair
                    of a highway. <hi rend="italic">Distringas</hi><hi rend="italic">nuper</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vicecomitem</hi> is a writ calling on an ex-sheriff to account for
                    the proceeds of goods taken in execution. <hi rend="italic">Elegit</hi> is
                    founded on the Statute of Westminster the Second, and is so named from the words
                    of the writ, that the plaintiff has chosen <hi rend="italic">(elegit)</hi> this
                    particular mode of satisfaction. It originally ordered the sheriff to seize a
                    moiety of the debtor’s land and all his goods, save his oxen and beasts of the
                    plough. By 1 and 2 Vict. c. 110 the <hi rend="italic">elegit</hi> was extended
                    to include the whole of the lands, and copyholds as well as freeholds. By the
                    Bankruptcy Act, 1883, an <hi rend="italic">elegit</hi> no longer applies to
                    goods. <hi rend="italic">Error,</hi> the only example of an original writ
                    remaining, was at one time largely used in both civil and criminal proceedings.
                    It was abolished in civil procedure by the Common Law Procedure Act, 1852, and
                    proceedings in error by the rules made under the Judicature Act, 1875. A writ of
                    error to the Queen’s Bench Division still lies in criminal cases, though it is
                    rarely brought, for it only lies for mistakes appearing on the record, and
                    recent legislation has given large powers of amending such mistakes. The fiat of
                    the attorney-general is necessary before it can be sued out. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>t depends on several statutes, commencing in 1344, and is specially mentioned in
                    the Statute of Provisors of Edward III., 25 Edw. III. st. 6. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Extent</hi> is the writ of execution issued by the crown for a crown debt of
                    record. The sale of chattels seized under an extent takes place under a writ of
                    <hi rend="italic">venditioni exponas.</hi> A crown debtor is entitled to an <hi
                    rend="italic">extent in aid</hi> against a person indebted to him. Where a crown
                    debtor has died a writ reciting his death, and so called <hi rend="italic"
                    >diem</hi><hi rend="italic">clausit</hi><hi rend="italic">extremum,</hi> issues
                    against his property. <hi rend="italic">Fieri facias</hi> is.the ordinary writ
                    of execution on a judgment commanding the sheriff to levy the sum, interest, and
                    costs on the personal property of the party. Where the sheriff has not sold the
                    goods, <hi rend="italic">venditioni exponas</hi> issues to compel him to do so.
                    Where the party is a beneficed clergyman, the writ is one of <hi rend="italic"
                    >fieri facias de bonis</hi><hi rend="italic">ecclesiasticis</hi> or of <hi
                    rend="italic">sequestrari</hi><hi rend="italic">facias</hi> (addressed to the
                    bishop). The latter writ also issues in other cases of an exceptional nature, as
                    against a corporation and to seize a pension. It is addressed to commissioners,
                    not to the sheriff. <hi rend="italic">Habere facias possessionem</hi> is given
                    to the owner of a tithe or rent charge, enabling him to have possession of the
                    lands chargeable therewith until arrears due to him are paid (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tithes).</hi><hi rend="italic">Indicavit</hi> is still
                    nominally grantable under the Statute <hi rend="italic">De Conjunctim

                    the patron of an advowson. <hi rend="italic">Inquiry</hi> issues for the
                    assessment of damages by the sheriff or his deputy. It represents to some extent
                    the old writ of <hi rend="italic">justicies,</hi> and the later writ of trial
                    allowed by 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 42, but is narrower in its operation, for under
                    the last-named writs the whole case or issues under it could be tried. Before an
                    inquiry the liability has been already established. <hi rend="italic">Levari
                    facias</hi> is the means of levying execution for forfeited recognizances (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Recognizanct).</hi> The Bankruptcy Act, 1883, abolished it
                    in civil proceedings. <hi rend="italic">Ne</hi><hi rend="italic">exeat
                    regno</hi> was at one time issued by virtue of the prerogative to prevent any
                    person from leaving the realm, a form of restraint of liberty recognized by
                    parliament in 5 Rie. II. c. 2. It has now become a means of preventing a debtor
                    from quitting the kingdom, and so withdrawing himself from the jurisdiction of
                    the court with out giving security for the debt. There is some doubt whether it
                    has not been impliedly superseded by the powers given by Ord. lxix. of the Rules
                    of the Supreme Court. <hi rend="italic">Non omittas</hi> is for executing
                    process by the sheriff in a liberty or franchise, where the proper officer has
                    neglected to do so. It rested originally chiefly upon the Statute of Westminster
                    the Second, c. 39, and is now regulated by the Sheriffs Act, 1887, which repeals
                    the previous enactment. <hi rend="italic">Possession</hi> (also called <hi
                    rend="italic">assistance)</hi> enjoins the sheriff to give possession of land to
                    the party entitled thereto under a judgment for such possession. In admiralty,
                    where the judgment is for possession of a ship, the writ is addressed to the
                    marshal. <hi rend="italic">Procedendo</hi> is the converse of prohibition. It
                    directs the lower court to proceed with the case. It also lies to restore the
                    authority of commissioners suspended by <hi rend="italic">supersedeas.
                    Restitution</hi> restores property, either real or personal, after the right to
                    it has been judicially declared. Thus it lies on behalf of the owner of real
                    property under the statutes of forcible entry and of personal property under the
                    Larceny Act, 1861. <hi rend="italic">Significavit,</hi> once a writ, appears
                    since 57 Geo. III. c. 127 to be merely a notice. It is a part of the proceedings
                    against a person disobeying the order of an ecclesiastical court, and consists
                    in a notification to the crown in Chancery of the disobedience. Thereupon a writ
                    <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">contumace</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >capiendo</hi> issues for his arrest. On his subsequent obedience or
                    satisfaction, a writ of <hi rend="italic">deliverance</hi> is granted.
                    Precedents of these writs are given in the Act named. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Subpaena</hi> is the ordinary means of securing the presence of a witness in
                    court, and is addressed to the person whose attendance is required. It is so
                    called from its containing the words “and this you are not to omit under the
                    penalty of £100,” &amp;c. The <hi rend="italic">subpaena</hi> may be either <hi
                    rend="italic">ad testificandum,</hi> to give evidence, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >duces tecum,</hi> to produce documents, &amp;c., or both combined. By special
                    order of a judge under 17 and 18 Vict. c. 23 a <hi rend="italic">subpaena</hi>
                    may be issued from any court in England, Scotland, or Ireland to compel the
                    attendance of a witness out of the juris» diction. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Summons</hi> is the universal means of commencing an action in the High Court.
                    It is addressed to the defendant, and may be either generally or specially
                    indorsed with a statement of the nature of the claim made. The latter form of
                    indorsement is allowed in certain cases of debt or liquidated demand, and gives
                    the plaintiff the great advantage of entitling him to final judgment in default
                    of appearance by the defendant, and even in spite of appearance unless the
                    defendant can satisfy a judge that he has a defence or ought to be allowed to
                    defend. No statement of claim is necessary in case of a specially indorsed writ,
                    the indorsement being deemed to be the statement. The writ may be issued out of
                    the central office or out of a district registry, and the plaintiff may name on
                    his writ the division of the High Court in which he proposes to have the case
                    tried. There are special rules governing the issue of writs in probate and
                    admiralty actions. The writ remains in force for twelve months, but may be
                    renewed for good cause after the expiration of that time. Service must be
                    personal, unless where substituted service is allowed, and in special cases,
                    such as actions to recover land and admiralty actions. Service out of the
                    jurisdiction of a writ or notice of a writ is allowed only by leave of the court
                    or a judge. Notice of the issue of a writ, and not the writ itself, is served on
                    a defendant who is neither a British subject nor in British dominions. The law
                    is contained in the Rules of the Supreme Court, especially Ord. ii,-xi. and xiv.
                    <hi rend="italic">Supersedeas</hi> commands the stay of proceedings on another
                    writ. It is often combined with <hi rend="italic">procedendo,</hi> where on a
                    <hi rend="italic">certiorari</hi> the High Court has decided in favour of the
                    jurisdiction of the inferior court. It is also used for removing from the
                    commission of the peace, and for putting an end to the authority of, any persons
                    acting under commission from the crown. <hi rend="italic">Venire facias</hi> is
                    the first proceeding in outlawry, calling upon the party to appear. Under the
                    old practice a <hi rend="italic">venire facias de novo</hi> was the means of
                    obtaining a new trial. <hi rend="italic">Ventre</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >inspiciendo</hi> appears still to be competent, and is a curious relic of
                    antiquity. It issues on the application of an heir presumptive in order to
                    determine by a jury of matrons whether the widow of a deceased owner of lands be
                    with child or not. Almost exactly the same proceeding was known in Roman law
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">interdictum</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">inspiciendo</hi><hi rend="italic">ventre,</hi> the praetor sending

                <p>The principal writs of a non-judicial nature relate to parliament or some of its
                    constituent elements. Parliament is summoned by the king’s writ issued out of
                    Chancery by advice of the privy council. The period of forty days once necessary
                    between the writ and the assembling is now by 15 and 16 Vict. c. 23 reduced to
                    thirty-five days. Writs of summons are issued to the lords spiritual and
                    temporal before every new parliament. Those to Irish representative peers are
                    regulated by the Act of Union, those to archbishops and bishops by 10 and 11
                    Vict. c. 108. New peerages are no longer created by writ, but the eldest son of
                    a peer is occasionally summoned to the House of Lords in the name of a barony of
                    his father’s. Earl Percy, the eldest son of the duke of Northumberland, was so
                    summoned in 1887, and sits as Baron Lovaine (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Peerage).</hi> With respect to election of members of the House of Commons, the
                    procedure differs as the election takes place after a dissolution or on a casual
                    vacancy. After a dissolution the writ is issued, as already stated, by order of
                    the crown in council. For a single election the warrant for a new writ is issued
                    during the session by the speaker after an order of the house made upon motion;
                    during the recess by the speaker’s authority alone, under the powers given by 24
                    Geo. III. sess. 2, c. 26, 21 and 22 Vict. c. 110, and 26 Vict. c. 20. The
                    warrant is addressed to the clerk of the crown in Chancery for Great Britain, to
                    the clerk of the crown and hanaper of Ireland. A <hi rend="italic"
                    >supersedeas</hi> to a writ has sometimes been ordered where the writ was
                    improvidently issued. The time allowed to elapse between the receipt of the writ
                    and the election is fixed by the Ballot Act, 1872, sched. 1, at nine days for a
                    county or a district borough, four days for any other borough. The writ is to be
                    returned by the returning officer to the clerk of the crown with the name of the
                    member elected endorsed on the writ. Sched. 2 gives a form of the writ, which is
                    tested, like the writ of error, by the queen herself. The returning officer is
                    the sheriff in counties and counties of cities (such as Chester), generally the
                    mayor in cities and boroughs, and the vice-chancellor in universities (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Parliament).</hi> Other writs for election are those for <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Convocation</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> which is by 25
                    Hen. VIII. c. 19 summoned by the archbishop of the province on receipt of the
                    king’s writ, and for election of coroners, verderers of royal forests, and some
                    other officers whose office is of great antiquity. The writ <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">coronatore eligendo,</hi> addressed to the sheriff, is
                    specially preserved by the Coroners Act, 1887.</p>
                <p>Offences relating to writs are dealt with by the Criminal Law Consolidation Acts
                    of 1861; larceny by 24 and 25 Vict. c. 96, s. 30; forgery by 24 and 25 Vict. c.
                    98, s. 27. The maximum penalty is seven years’ penal servitude.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> Writ is a more extensive term than in England.
                    Writs are either judicial or extrajudicial, the latter including deeds and other
                    instruments,—as, for instance, in 42 and 43 Vict. c. 44, and in the common use
                    of the phrase “oath or writ” as a means of proof. In the narrower English sense
                    both “writ” and “brieve” are used. The brieve was as indispensable a part of the
                    old procedure as it was in England, and many forms are given in <hi
                    rend="italic">Regiam Majestatem</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Quoniam</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Attachiamenta.</hi> It was a command issued in the king’s name,
                    addressed to a judge, and ordering trial of a question stated therein. Its
                    conclusion was the will of the summons (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Will,
                    Summons).</hi> In some cases proceedings which were by writ in England took
                    another form in Scotland. For instance, the writ of attaint was not known in
                    Scotland, but a similar end was reached by trial of the jury for wilful
                    error.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An example
                    occurring in the reign of James VI. will be found in Pitcairn’s <hi

                    writ of <hi rend="italic">ηe exeat regno</hi> is represented by the <hi
                    rend="italic">meditatio</hi><hi rend="italic">fugae</hi> warrant. Most
                    proceedings by brieve, being addressed to the sheriff, became obsolete after the
                    institution of the Court of Session, when the sheriffs lost much of that
                    judicial power which they had. enjoyed to a greater extent than the English
                    sheriff (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sheriff).</hi> The executive functions of the
                    English sheriff are performed by the messengers-at-arms. An English writ of
                    execution is represented in Scotland by diligence, chiefly by means by warrants
                    to messengers-at-arms under the authority of signet letters in the name of the
                    king. The brieve, however, has not wholly disappeared. Brieves of tutory, terce,
                    and division are still competent, but not in use. Other kinds of brieve have
                    been superseded by simpler procedure, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the brieve of
                    service of heirs by 10 and 11 Vict. c. 47, for which a petition to the sheriff
                    was substituted by that Act and 31 and 32 Vict. c. 101. The brieve of cognition
                    of insane persons is now the only one of practical importance. The old brieves
                    of furiosity and idiotey were abolished, and this new form was introduced by the
                    Act last named. Writs <hi rend="italic">eo nomine</hi> have been the subject of
                    much recent legislation. The writs of <hi rend="italic">capias, habeas,
                    certiorari,</hi> and extent were replaced by other proceedings by 19 and 20
                    Vict. c. 56. The writ of <hi rend="italic">clare</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >constat</hi> was introduced by 21 and 22 Vict. c. 76. It and the writs of
                    resignation and confirmation (whether granted by the crown or a subject
                    superior) were regulated by 31 and 32 Vict. c. 101. By the same Act crown writs
                    are to be in the English language, and registered in the regis ter of crown
                    writs. They need not be sealed unless at the instance of the party against whom
                    they are issued. Writs of progress (except crown writs, writs of <hi
                    rend="italic">clare</hi><hi rend="italic">constat,</hi> and writs of
                    acknowledgment) were abolished by 37 and 38 Vict. c. 94. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >clare constat</hi> writ is one granted by the crown or a subject superior for
                    the purpose of completing title of a vassal’s heirs to lands held by the
                    deceased vassal. Where the lands are leasehold the writ of acknowledgment under
                    20 and 21 Vict. c. 26 is used for the same purpose. By 40 and 41 Vict. c. 40 the
                    form of warrant of execution on certain extracts of registered writs is amended.
                    Extracts of registered writs are to be equivalent to the registered writs
                    themselves. Writs registered in the register of sasines for preservation only
                    may afterwards be registered for preservation and execution. By 22 Geo. II. c.
                    48, passed for the purpose of assimilating the practice of outlawry for treason
                    in Scotland to that in use in England, the court before which an indictment for
                    treason or misprision of treason is found, is entitled on proper cause to issue
                    writs of <hi rend="italic">capias,</hi> proclamation, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >exigent.</hi> Many writs are by the Stamp Act, 1870, chargeable with a duty of
                    five shillings. In some respects the proceedings in parliamentary elections
                    differ from those in use in England. Thus the writ in university elections is
                    directed to the vice-chancellors of Edinburgh and Glasgow respectively, but not
                    to those of St Andrews and Aberdeen, and there is an extension of the time for
                    the return in electionsr for Orkney and Shetland, and for the Wick burghs.
                    Representative peers of Scotland were by the Act of Union to be elected after
                    writ issued to the privy council of Scotland. On the abolition of the privy
                    council a proclamation under the great seal was substituted by 6 Anne, c.
                    23.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> Writs in United States courts are by Act
                    of Congress to be tested in the name of the chief justice of the United States.
                    By State laws writs are generally bound to be in the name of the people of the
                    State, in the English language, and tested in the name of a judge. Writs of
                    error have been the subject of much legislation by the United States and by the
                    States. In New York writs of error and of <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">exeat</hi> have been abolished. Writs as parts of real actions
                    have been generally superseded, but in Massachusetts a writ of entry on
                    disseisin is still a mode of trying title. Writs of dower and of estrepement are
                    still in use in some States. By the law of some States, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> New Jersey, writs of election are issued to supply casually
                    occurring vacancies in the legislature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Authorities.—</hi> The importance of the wτlt in procedure led
                    to the compilation of a great body of law and precedent at an early date. In
