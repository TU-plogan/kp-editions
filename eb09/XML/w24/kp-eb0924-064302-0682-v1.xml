                    antiquary, was the fourth son of Thomas Wood (1580-1643), B.C.L. of Oxford,
                    where Anthony was born 17th December 1632. He was sent to New College school in
                    that city in 1641, and at the age of twelve was removed to the free grammar
                    school at Thame, where his studies were interrupted by civil war skirmishes. He
                    was then placed under the tuition of his brother Edward (1627-55), of Trinity
                    College; “while he continued in this condition his mother would alwaies be
                    soliciting him to be an apprentice which he could never endure to heare of” <hi
                        rend="italic">{Life,</hi> 1848, p. 33). He was entered at Merton College in
                    1647, and made postmaster. In 1652 “he began to exercise his natural and
                    insatiable genie he had to musick” <hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> 53), and was
                    examined for the degree of B.A. He engaged a musicmaster, and obtained
                    permission to use the Bodleian, “which he took to be the happiness of his life.”
                    He was admitted M.A. in 1655, and in the following year published a volume of
                    sermons of his late brother Edward. Dugdale’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Warwickshire</hi> came into his hands, and he describes how “his tender
                    affections and insatiable desire of knowledge were ravished and melted downe by
                    the reading of that book. What by musick and rare books that he found in the
                    public library, his life, at this time and after, was a perfect Elysium” <hi
                        rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> p. 68). He now began systematically to copy
                    monumental inscriptions and to search for antiquities in the city and
                    neighbourhood. He went through the Christ Church registers, “at this time being
                    resolved to set himself to the study of antiquities.” Dr John Wallis, the
                    keeper, allowed him free access to the university registers in 1660; “here he
                    layd the foundation of that book which fourteen years afterwards he published,
                    viz., <hi rend="italic">Hist,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Antiq. Univ. OxonP</hi> He steadily investigated the muniments of all the
                    colleges, and in 1667 made his first journey to London, where he visited
                    Dugdale, who introduced him into the Cottonian library, and Prynne showed him
                    the same civility for the Tower records. On October 22, 1669, he was sent for by
                    the delegates of the press, “that whereas he had taken a great deal of paines in
                    writing the <hi rend="italic">Hist. and Antiq. of the Universitie of 0xon,</hi>
                    they would for his paines give him an 100 <hi rend="italic">li.</hi> for his
                    copie, conditionally, that he would suffer the book to be translated into
                    Latine” <hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> 167). He accepted the offer and set to
                    work to prepare his English MS. for the translators, Richard Peers and Richard
                    Reeve, both appointed by Dr Fell, dean of Christ Church, who undertook the
                    expense of printing. The translation was supervised by Fell, with whom and the
                    translators Wood has endless quarrels about alterations of his text. In 1674
                    appeared <hi rend="italic">Historia et Antiquitates Universitatis
                        Oxoniensis,</hi> handsomely printed “e Theatro Sheldoniano,” in two folio
                    volumes, the first devoted to the university in general and the second to the
                    colleges. Copies were widely distributed, and university and author received
                    much praise. On the other hand, Bishop Barlow told a correspondent that “not
                    only the Latine but the history itself is in many things ridiculously false” <hi
                        rend="italic">(Genuine Remains,</hi> 1693, p. 183). In 1678 the university
                    registers which had been in his custody for eighteen years were removed, as it
                    was feared that he would be implicated in the Popish Plot. To relieve himself
                    from suspicion he took the oaths of supremacy and allegiance. During this time
                    he had been gradually completing his great work, which was produced by a London
                    publisher in 1691-92, 2 vols, folio, <hi rend="italic">Athenae Oxonienses: an
                        Exact History of all the Writers and Bishops who have had their Education in
                        the University of Oxford from 1500 to 1690, to which are added the Fasti, or
                        Annals for the said time.</hi> On 29th July 1693 he was condemned in the
                    vice-chancellor’s court for certain libels against the late earl of Clarendon,
                    fined, banished from the university until he recanted, and the book burnt. The
                    proceedings were printed in a volume of <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi><pb

                    by Bishop Burnet in a <hi rend="italic">Letter to the Bishop of Lichfield and
                        Coventry,</hi> 1693, 4to, and defended by his nephew Dr Thomas Wood, in a
                        <hi rend="italic">Vindication of the Historiographer, to which is added the
                        Historiographer's Answer,</hi> 1693, 4to, reproduced in the subsequent
                    editions of the <hi rend="italic">Athenae.</hi> The nephew also defended his
                    uncle in <hi rend="italic">An Appendix to the Life of Bishop Seth Ward,</hi>
                    1697, 8vo. On 9th October 1695 Wood had an interview with the earl of Clarendon,
                    but was not able to get his fine remitted. After a short illness he died 28th
                    November 1695, in his sixty-third year, and was buried in the ante-chapel of St
                    John Baptist (Merton College), in Oxford, where he superintended the digging of
                    his own grave but a few days before.</p>
                <p>He is described as “a very strong lusty man,” of uncouth manners and appearance,
                    not so deaf as he pretended, of reserved and temperate habits, not avaricious,
                    and a despiser of honours. He received neither office nor reward from the
                    university which owed so much to his labours. He never married, and led a life
                    of self-denial, entirely devoted to antiquarian research. Bell-ringing and music
                    were his chief relaxations. His literary style is poor, and his taste and
                    judgment are frequently warped by prejudice, but his two great works and
                    unpublished collections form a priceless source of information on Oxford and her
                    worthies. He was always suspected of being a Boman Catholic, and invariably
                    treated Jacobites and Papists better than Dissenters in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Athenae,</hi> but he died in communion with the Church of England.</p>
                <p>Wood’s original manuscript (purchased by the Bodleian in 1846), was first
                    published by John Gutch, as <hi rend="italic">The History and Antiquities of the
                        Colleges and Halls in the University of Oxford, with a continuation,</hi>
                    1786-90, 2 vols. 4to, and <hi rend="italic">The History and Antiquities of the
                        University of Oxford,</hi> 1792-96, 3 vols. 4to, with portrait of Wood. To
                    these should be added <hi rend="italic">The Antient and Present State of the
                        City of Oxford, chiefly collected by A. a ÌVood, with additions by Sir J.
                        Peshall, VJ73,</hi> 4to. A new edition is in preparation by the Oxford
                    Historical Society. <hi rend="italic">Modius Salium,</hi><hi rend="italic">a
                        Collection of Pieces of Humour,</hi> chiefly ill-natured personal stories,
                    was published at Oxford in 1751,12mo. Some letters between Aubrey and Wood were
                    given in the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</hi> (3d ser., ix., x.,
                    xi.). Wood consulted Dr Hudson about getting a third volume of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Athenae</hi> printed in Holland, saying, “When this volume
                    comes out I’ll make you laugh” <hi rend="italic">(Reliq. Hearnianae,</hi> i,
                    59). This was included in a second edition of the <hi rend="italic">Athenae</hi>
                    published by Tonson in 1721, 2 vols, folio, “very much corrected and enlarged,
                    with the addition of above 500 new lives.” The third appeared as “a new edition,
                    with additions, and a continuation by Philip Bliss,” 1813-20, 4 vols. 4to. The
                    Ecclesiastical History Society proposed to bring out a fourth edition, which
                    stopped at the <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> ed. by Bliss, 1848, 8vo (see <hi
                        rend="italic">Gfeηt. Mag.,</hi> N.S., xxix. 135, 268). Dr Bliss's
                    interleaved copy is in the Bodleian, and Dr Griffiths announced in 1859 that a
                    new edition was contemplated by the Press, and asked for additional matter (see
                        <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries,</hi> 2d ser., vii. 514, and 6th ser.,
                    vi. 5, 51). Wood bequeathed his library (127 MSS. and 970 printed books) to the
                    Ashmolean Museum, and the keeper, William Huddesford, printed a catalogue of the
                    MSS. in 1761. In 1860 the whole collection was transferred to the Bodleian,
                    where 25 volumes of Wood’s MSS. had been since 1690. Many of the original papers
                    from which the <hi rend="italic">Athenae</hi> was written, as well as several
                    large volumes of Wood’s correspondence and all his diaries, are in the
                    Bodleian.</p>
                <p>The chief authority is the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of wood written by
