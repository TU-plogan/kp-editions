                    parliamentary borough, the capital of the above county, and a county of itself,
                    is situated on the eastern bank of the Severn, 120 miles from London by rail,
                    and a little over 26 from Birmingham.</p>
                <p>The principal building and chief glory of the city is the cathedral. The see was
                    founded by the advice of Archbishop Theodore in 673, though, owing to opposition
                    on the part of the bishop of Lichfield, it was not finally established till 780.
                    In its formation the tribal division was followed, and it contained the people
                    of the Hwiccas. The bishop’s church of St Peter’s, with its secular canons, was
                    absorbed by Bishop Oswald into the monastery of St Mary. The canons became
                    monks, and in 983 Oswald finished the building of a new monastic cathedral.
                    After the Norman Conquest the saintly bishop of Worcester, Wulfstan, was the
                    only English prelate who was left in possession of his see. He so far adopted
                    Norman customs as to undertake <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0708-0667"/> the building of a great church of stone according
                    to the Norman pattern. In 1088 an incursion of the Welsh stopped his labours for
                    a time, but in 1094 he held a synod in the crypt. Of the work of Wulfstan, the
                    outer walls of the nave, aisles, a part of the walls of the transepts, some
                    shafts, and the crypt remain. The crypt is apsidal, a style of which there are
                    only four examples in England—Winchester, 1079; Worcester, 1084; Gloucester,
                    1089; and Canterbury, 1096. Wulfstan’s building seems to have extended no
                    farther than the transepts, but the nave was continued, though much of it was
                    destroyed by the fall of the central tower in 1175. In 1203 Wulfstan was
                    canonized, and the monks, growing richer by the offerings at his shrine,
                    finished the cathedral in 1216. Soon after this date they built a lady chapel at
                    the east end, extending the building by 50 feet; then they were so satisfied
                    with their new work that the choir was rebuilt to match in the Early English
                    style. The nave was similarly remodelled in the 14th century, the north side in
                    the Decorated, the south side in the Perpendicular style. The building is
                    cruciform, and is without transept aisles, but has secondary transepts to the
                    choir. The tower is in the centre, and is 162 feet high. There is an interesting
                    chapter house of Late Norman architecture, a round building with its stone roof
                    supported on a central pillar. The refectory is a fine room of Decorated
                    architecture, and the cloisters are Perpendicular. The cathedral was very much
                    out of repair in 1857, when the restoration was undertaken by the cathedral
                    architect, Mr Perkins, in which most of the work of previous generations was
                    wholly swept away, and in some important particulars replaced by conjectural
                    work of Early English style. The cost was about £100,000, raised principally by
                    public subscription, though for four years the dean and chapter had provided the
                    funds required.</p>
                <p>In the cathedral are several good monuments and monumental effigies. That of King
                    John, in the choir, is the earliest sepulchral effigy of an English king in the
                    country. There is an altar tomb, in a chantry chapel, of Arthur, prince of
                    Wales, son of Henry VII., who died in 1503. There are also monuments of John
                    Gauden, the bishop who wrote <hi rend="italic">Icon Basilike,</hi> so often
                    attributed to Charles I., of Bishop Hough by Roubiliac, and of Mrs Digby by Chan
                    trey. There are many other monuments; and in the north alley of the cloister is
                    a stone on which is cut the sad and significant word “Miserrimus,” and nothing
                    more—a tragedy in a single word.</p>
                <p>There are eleven parish churches in the city :—St Helen’s, the oldest, was
                    rebuilt in 1820; St Albans, ancient, partiallyrestoredin 1850; All Saints, built
                    in 1740, which contains a peal of ten bells; St Andrew’s, repewed in 1850; St
                    Nicholas, begun in 1728 and finished in 1730; St Martin’s, erected in 1772; St
                    Swithin’s, in 1736; St Peter’s, dating from 1686, which has annexed to it the
                    chapelry of Whittington; St Michael’s, in Bedwardine, modern; St John’s,
                    Bedwardine, made a parish church in 1371; and St Clement’s, built in 1823. In
                    1874 a parish was formed out of Claines, named the Tything, and in 1876 the
                    church (St Mary Magdalene) was built; St Paul’s was built in 1837, and
                    constituted a'separate parish in 1844; St George’s, built by subscription in
                    1830, was made a parish out of Claines, in 1862; Holy Trinity, erected in 1865,
                    was formed a parish in 1866. There are also a Roman Catholic chapel and places
                    of worship for all descriptions of Dissenters.</p>
                <p>There are no remains of the old castle of Worcester; it adjoined the monastery so
                    closely that King John gave its yard to the monks, and after that time it ceased
                    to be a stronghold. The Commandery, founded by St Wulfstan in 1095, is one of
                    the “rarest specimens of early house architecture in existence.” The hall
                    contains an open timber roof of the time of Henry VII., “a good bay window, a
                    fine door, the projecting canopy of the dais, a music-screen and gallery, and
                    some fragments of stained glass.” The cathedral grammar school, founded by Henry
                    VIII. in 1541, occupies the refectory of the old monastery, which has just been
                    restored by Mr Christian, and has many interesting architectural features.</p>
                <p>The guild-hall, built in 1723, is an admirable building in the 1talian style; it
                    contains a portrait of George III., painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and
                    presented by the king to commemorate his visit to the city at the triennial
                    musical festival in 1788. The corporation possess some very interesting old
                    charters and manuscripts, and good municipal regalia. The shire-hall, erected in
                    1835 at a cost of £35,000, is a fine stone building in the Ionic style, with a
                    portico supported by six fluted columns. The county jail, built in 1809 at a
                    cost of £19,000, was entirely reconstructed on the separate principle in 1860,
                    at a further cost of £24,000. The infirmary was built in 1770, the dispensary in
                    1822, and the ophthalmic institution in 1866. There is a museum of natural
                    history; and a free library was opened in 1881. Worcester has long been famous
                    for several important branches of industry. The Clothiers’ Company possess a
                    charter granted by Queen Elizabeth; but the great industries are now the
                    manufacture of gloves and of porcelain. A company of glovers was incorporated in
                    1661; it· is principally occupied with the making of skin gloves, in which the
                    skins of deer, sheep, lambs, goats, and kids are used. The manufacture of
                    porcelain was introduced by Dr Wall, a Worcester physician, in 1751 (see vol.
                    xix. p. 642). The materials employed are china clay and china stone from
                    Cornwall, felspar from Sweden, fire-clay from Stourbridge and Broseley, marl,
                    flint, and calcined bones. Pickles and sauces are among the notable productions
                    of the city: and among its other trades are those of carriage making, rope and
                    twine spinning, boat and barge building, tanning, and the production of chemical
                    manures and of cider and perry.</p>
                <p>The charities of Worcester are numerous, and include St Oswald’s hospital, Nash’s
                    almshouses, Wyatt’s almshouses, the Berkeley hospital, Goulding hospital,
                    Shew-ring’s hospital, Inglethorpe’s almshouses, Waldgrave’s almshouses, Moore’s
                    blue-coat school, Queen Elizabeth’s charity, and others, which produce an annual
                    income of more than £10,000. The population of the city and municipal borough
                    (area 1263 acres) in 1871 was 33,226 and in 1881 it was 33,956. The population
                    of the parliamentary borough (area 3266 acres) in 1871 was 38,116 and in 1881 it
                    was 40,354.</p>
                <p>Among the charters still preserved in the guild-hall is one of Richard I. dated
                    November 12, 1189, which grants to the burgesses to hold of the king and his
                    heirs the town <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> of Worcester at a yearly rental of
                    £24. In the reign of Philip and Mary the town was raised to the dignity of -a
                    city, and this with other privileges was confirmed by Elizabeth in 1558; and in
                    1622 James I. granted a charter ordaining that the city shall be a free city of
                    itself, and a county separate from all other counties. From the time of Edward
                    I. until 1885 Worcester returned two members to parliament, but the number was
                    then reduced to one. Municipally the city is divided into five wards. The county
                    assizes are held in the city, as are also the quarter sessions, the county
                    court, the borough court, town and county petty sessions, and the ecclesiastical
                    and probate court.</p>
                <p>The Romans found a British settlement and held it as a military station, to which
                    they gave the name <hi rend="italic">Vigοrna,</hi> By the Saxons it was called
                    Wigorna-ceaster, whence we have the present name of Worcester. It rvas more than
                    once burnt and pillaged by the Danes, but at the date of the Conquest it was of
                    sufficient importance to have a mint. From its proximity to Wales, it frequently
                    suffered from the inroads of the Welsh. It was taken by the empress Maud, and
                    retaken by Stephen, after severe contests. The king kept the Easter week there
                    in 1139,—as it is recorded, with <pb break="no"

                    Whitsuntide festival in the city. Queen Elizabeth rested there in one of her
                    progresses; in 1687 James II. came, and touched for the king’s evih He attended
                    mass in the Catholic chapel; but the mayor and the corporation, though
                    accompanying him to the chapel door, firmly and patriotically declined to
                    enter.</p>
