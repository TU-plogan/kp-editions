                    Wilberfoss in the East Riding from the time of Henry II. till the middle of the
                    18th century. He was the only son of Robert Wilberforce, member of a commercial
                    house at Hull, by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Bird of Barton, Oxon,
                    and was born at Hull on 24th August 1759. It was from his mother that he
                    inherited both his feeble frame and his many rich mental endowments. He was not
                    a diligent scholar, but at the grammar school of Hull his skill in elocution
                    attracted the attention of the master. Before he had completed his tenth year he
                    lost his father and was transferred to the care of a paternal uncle in London;
                    but in his twelfth year he returned to Hull, and soon afterwards was placed
                    under the care of the master of the endowed school of Pocklington. Here his love
                    of social pleasure made him neglectful of his studies; but he entered St John’s
                    College, Cambridge, in October 1766. Left by the death of his grandfather and
                    uncle the possessor of an independent fortune under his mother’s sole
                    guardianship, he was somewhat idle at the university, though he acquitted
                    himself in the examinations with credit; but in his serious years he “could not
                    look back without unfeigned remorse” on the opportunities he had then neglected.
                    In 1780 he was elected to the House of Commons for his native town, his success
                    being due to his personal popularity and his lavish expenditure. He soon found
                    his way into the fast political society of London, and at the club at Goosetrees
                    renewed an acquaintance begun at Cambridge with Pitt, which ripened into a
                    friendship of the closest kind. In the autumn of 1783 he set out with Pitt on a
                    tour in France; and after his return his eloquence proved of great assistance to
                    Pitt in his struggle against the majority of the House of Commons. In 1784
                    Wilberforce was elected for both Hull and Yorkshire, and took his seat for the
                    latter constituency.</p>
                <p>A journey to Nice in the autumn of the same year with Dr Isaac Milner led to his
                    conversion to Evangelical Christianity and the adoption of more serious views of
                    life. The change had a marked effect on his public conduct. In the beginning of
                    1787 he busied himself with the establishment of a society for the reformation
                    of manners. About the same time he made the acquaintance of Thomas Clarkson, and
                    began the agitation against the slave trade. Pitt entered heartily into their
                    plans, and recommended Wilberforce to undertake the guidance of the project as a
                    subject suited to his character and talents. While Clarkson conducted the
                    agitation throughout the country, Wilberforce took every opportunity in the
                    House of Commons of exposing the evils and horrors of the trade. In 1788,
                    however, a failure of his digestive powers compelled him to retire for some
                    months from public life, and the introduction of the subject in parliament
                    therefore devolved on Pitt, whose representations were so far successful that an
                    Act was passed providing that the number of slaves carried in ships should be in
                    proportion to the tonnage. On 12th May of the following year Wilberforce, in
                    co-operation with Pitt, brought the subject of abolition again before the House
                    of Commons; but the friends of the planters succeeded in getting the matter
                    deferred. On 27th January following Wilberforce carried a motion for referring
                    to a special committee the further examination of witnesses, but after full
                    inquiry the motion for abolition in May 1791 was lost by 163 votes to 88. In the
                    following April he carried a motion for gradual abolition by 238 to 85 votes;
                    but in the House of Lords the discussion was finally postponed till the
                    following session. Notwithstanding his unremitting labours in educating public
                    opinion and annual motions in the House of Commons, it was not till 1807, the
                    year following Pitt’s death, that the first great step towards the abolition of
                    slavery was accomplished. When the anti-slavery society was formed in 1823,
                    Wilberforce and Clarkson became vice-presidents; but before their aim was
                    accomplished Wilberforce had retired from public life, and the Emancipation Bill
                    was not passed till August 1833, a month after his death.</p>
                <p>In 1797 Wilberforce published <hi rend="italic">A Practical View of the
                    Prevailing Religious System of Professed Christians in the Higher and Middle
                    Classes of this Country Contrasted with Real Christianity,</hi> which within
                    half a year went through five editions and was afterwards translated into
                    French, Italian, Dutch, and German. Shortly after the appearance of this work he
                    occupied himself with a plan for a religious periodical which should admit “a
                    moderate degree of political and common intelligence,” the result being the
                    appearance in January 1801 of the <hi rend="italic">Christian Observer.</hi> He
                    also interested himself in a variety of schemes for the advancement of the
                    social and religious welfare of the community, including the establishment of
                    the Association for the Better Observance of Sunday, the foundation, with Hannah
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">More</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    every, parish for the religious instruction of children, a plan for the
                    education of the children of the lower classes, a bill for securing better
                    salaries to curates, and a method for disseminating, by Government help,
                    Christianity in India. In parliament he was a supporter of parliamentary reform
                    and of Catholic emancipation. In 1812, on account of failing health, he
                    exchanged the representation of Yorkshire for that of a constituency which would
                    make less demands on his time, and was returned for Bramber. In 1825 he retired
                    from the House of Commons, and the following year settled at Highwood Hill,
                    “just beyond the disk of the metropolis.” He died at London on 29th July 1833,
                    and was buried in Westminster Abbey close to Pitt, Fox, and Canning. In
                    Westminster Abbey a statue was erected to his memory, and in Yorkshire a county
                    asylum for the blind was founded in his honour. A column was also erected to him
                    by his townsmen of Hull.</p>
