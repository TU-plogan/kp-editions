                <p><label type="entry">WEBSTER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Noah</hi></label> (1758-1843),
                    American lexicographer, was descended on the father’s side from John Webster of
                    Warwickshire, England, one of the original settlers at Hartford, and for a time
                    governor of Connecticut, and on the mother’s side from William Bradford, second
                    governor of Plymouth and one of the founders of that colony. He was the son of a
                    farmer, and was born in West Hartford, Connecticut, 16th October 1758. In his
                    early years he was engaged in agricultural work, but attended a district school
                    in the winter, and when fourteen years of age began the study of the classics
                    under the Rev. Nathan Perkins, D.D. He entered the freshman’s class at Yale
                    College in 1774, and while in his junior year there he took part as a volunteer
                    in the expedition against General Burgoyne. After graduating in 1778 he
                    supported himself by teaching while prosecuting the study of law. Having begun
                    at this time to note down every word whose meaning he did not properly
                    understand, he was first led to conceive the scheme of a new dictionary from his
                    frequent inability to find proper definitions of words in those in current use.
                    His experience as a teacher soon convinced him also of the need of better
                    instruction books in English, and this he endeavoured to supply by his <hi
                    rend="italic">Grammatical Institute of the English Language,</hi> the first part
                    of which appeared in 1783, and a second and third part in the following years.
                    It comprehended a spellingbook, English grammar, and compilation of English
                    reading, and very soon found a place in most of the schools of the United
                    States. In 1785 he prepared a course of lectures on the English language, which
                    he delivered in the principal American cities, and published in 1789 under the
                    title <hi rend="italic">Dissertations on the English Language.</hi> Meanwhile he
                    also continued to take a deep interest in all prominent political questions. In
                    his <hi rend="italic">Sketches of American Policy</hi> (1784) he made the first
                    distinct proposal for a new constitution for the United States, and when the
                    work of the commissioners was completed in 1787 he was asked by them to
                    recommend the new constitution to the American people, which he did in an <hi
                    rend="italic">Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal
                    Constitution.</hi> After his marriage in 1789 he established himself in the
                    practice of law at Hartford. In 1793 he was induced to found at New York a paper
                    called <hi rend="italic">Minerva,</hi> with which was connected the <hi
                    rend="italic">Herald,</hi> a semiweekly; the titles of the papers were
                    subsequently altered respectively to the <hi rend="italic">Commercial
                    Advertiser</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">New York Spectator.</hi> In 1795 he
                    contributed to his paper several articles, under the signature of Curtius, in
                    vindication of Jay’s treaty with Great Britain, which were reprinted and had
                    considerable effect in allaying opposition to it. In 1798 he removed to New
                    Haven, which town he was chosen soon afterwards to represent in the general
                    assembly of Connecticut. In 1802 appeared his well-known treatise on <hi
                    rend="italic">The Eights of Neutrals.</hi> Having removed in 1812 to Amherst, he
                    took there a leading part in the establishment of the academy and then of the
                    college, of which he was chosen the first president. He also represented Amherst
                    in the court of Massachusetts. In 1822 he returned to New Haven. Meanwhile his
                    lexicographical studies, though much interrupted by his professional and
                    political duties, had never been entirely suspended. In 1806 he published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Compendious Dictionary of the English Language,</hi> but this
                    was only preparatory to a larger work. In 1824 he sailed for Europe to complete
                    his researches, and after spending some time in Paris continued his labours in
                    the library at Cambridge, where he finished the dictionary. It was published in
                    1828, and a second edition with many additions appeared in 1841. He also
                    completed the revision of an appendix a few days before his death, which took
                    place 20th May 1843.</p>
                <p>In 1833 Webster published an edition of the Bible, “with amendments of the
                    language,” and again in 1839 an edition of the New Testament. In early life he
                    wrote a <hi rend="italic">History of the United States,</hi> of which a revised
                    edition appeared in 1839. He was also the author of <hi rend="italic">Historical
                    Notices of Banking Institutions and Insurance Companies</hi> (1802), and a <hi
                    rend="italic">Collection of Papers on Political and Literary Subjects</hi>
                    (1843). Since his death several revised and enlarged editions of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> have appeared. It was the result of much labour
                    and research, and on this account, as well as for the clearness and carefulness
                    of its definitions, it still holds a leading place among dictionaries of the
                    English language, especially in America. A biography of Webster, by C. A.
                    Goodrich, D.D., is prefixed to the quarto editions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary.</hi></p>
