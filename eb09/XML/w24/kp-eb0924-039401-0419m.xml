                    century (<hi rend="italic">ut tensio sic vis);</hi> this, however, is not
                    invariable.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1 shows the general arrangement of a watch or chronometer (both of which are
                    here considered together). The barrel and fusee will be recognized at once. The
                    fusee is a sort of grooved hollow-sided cone; the more rapid swell towards the
                    thick end is required, because one turn of the fusee, when the chain is at that
                    end, takes much more of it off the barrel than at the thin end; and on the
                    assumption that the force of the spring varies as its tension the radius of the
                    cone must increase more rapidly, in order to make the increase of leverage keep
                    pace with the decrease in the force of the spring as it unwinds with an
                    increasing velocity off the thick end of the fusee. The fusee itself is
                    connected with the great wheel by a ratchet and click and going ratchet (of
                    which the spring and click are strongly shown in the figure), just as described
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Clocks</hi> (vol. vi. p. 22). Something is also
                    required to prevent the watch from being overwound, or the chain strained so as
                    to break. This is done by means of a hooked lever, set on a hinge in the upper
                    frame-plate (which is taken off in this drawing); and when the watch is nearly
                    wound up the chain moving upwards reaches this lever, and moves it into such a
                    position that its hook catches hold of the long tooth projecting from the thin
                    end of the fusee; and thus the winding is stopped without any strain on the
                    chain by the sudden check.</p>
                <p>By far the greater number of watches now made both on the Continent and in
                    America have the mechanism known as the going barrel in substitution for the
                    chain and fusee. In the going barrel the mainspring is of great length, and only
                    a few coils of it are brought into action. To the going barrel itself the main
                    wheel is attached, and thus the force of the mainspring is transmitted direct to
                    the escapement. The general adoption of the going barrel mechanism is due to the
                    introduction of keyless winding, which can only be adapted to the fusee watches
                    with difficulty, and to the greater cheapness of the arrangement. Moreover, it
                    is found that for three or four coils of a long spring, at a certain degree of
                    winding up, the tension varies very little. The going barrel is not used in the
                    best English work, in which absolute uniformity of motion is aimed at; but for
                    ordinary purposes it is not of so much consequence that the same rate from hour
                    to hour should be maintained provided the daily rate is uniform.</p>
                <p>In watches without a fusee the apparatus for preventing overwinding is different
                    from that in the old form of watch; it goes by the name of the Geneva stop, and
                    the principle of it is simple. If two λvheels work together, of which one has
                    the spaces between some two or more adjacent teeth filled up, it is evident that
                    that wheel cannot be turned quite round. And it will be the same thing if one of
                    the wheels is only a cylinder with a single tooth in it, and the other has a
                    certain number of notches, not going all round, through which that tooth can
                    pass. If, therefore, a one-toothed wheel of this kind is fixed to the barrel
                    arbor, which is turned by the key, and works into a wheel with only 4 or 5
                    notches in it and a blank space through which the tooth cannot pass, it will
                    evidently allow the barrel to be wound up the 4 or 5 turns and no more; and as
                    it unwinds it turns the stopping wheel back again with it.</p>
                <p>The other parts of a watch do not differ from those of a clock, except in size,
                    and the position in which they are arranged, to bring them within the circle of
                    the dial, until we come to the escapement; and there a different state of things
                    arises, mainly from the fact that the balance of a watch revolves through
                    sometimes as much as 270°, while a clock pendulum only vibrates through 4° or
                    5°. The balance being common to all the watch escapements, it will be proper
                    first to describe that, and the conditions to which it is subject. The two equal
                    arms, with equal weights at each end, in fig. 3 of article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Clocks</hi> (vol. vi. p. 17) are really a balance just as much as the wheel
                    which is commonly used as the more convenient form. But in that figure there is
                    not to be seen that essential element of a modern balance—the thin spiral
                    spring, opening and closing itself at every vibration. The outer end of this
                    spring is attached to the frame by a cock R (fig. 2), and the inner to the
                    balance at S; and the time of vibration depends only on the strength of the
                    spring and the moment of inertia of the balance, and not at all upon the extent
                    or angle of the vibration. And, as the force of a spring varies (approximately)
                    inversely as its length, this suggests a ready method of regulating the watch;
                    for it is easy to make a pointer or index, or “regulator” PT, turning on a ring
                    fixed to the watch plate, concentric with the balance, and having two pins in it
                    at P, called <hi rend="italic">curb pins,</hi> just close enough together to
                    embrace the spring, so that, as the index is moved one way or the other, the
                    length of the spring which is free to vibrate may become shorter or longer. When
                    the regulator has been moved as far as it can go towards <hi rend="italic"
                    >fast,</hi> suppose, and the watch still loses, the spring has to be shortened
                    at the cock R into which its outer end is pinned; and, in order that the balance
                    may be capable of alteration, so as still to stand square with the escapement
                    when the spring is in its neutral state, the other end is not actually pinned to
                    the balance, but the cock S is on a small ring which is set on the axis or <hi
                    rend="italic">verge</hi> of the balance pretty tight by friction, but capable of
                    being turned by hand. An index-plate like that in fig. 2 enables one to see
                    smaller movements of the index than radial marks.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n420/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0420-0395"/>
                <p>It is almost impossible to move such a regulator little enough, and with
                    sufficient accuracy, for a very small variation of rate. One way of obtaining
                    greater accuracy, and probably the best, is to make the regulator movable by a
                    tangent screw acting on its end, and capable of being turned by the watch key.
                    Another mode of giving a small motion to the regulator is by putting a portion
                    of a wheel with teeth on it, and turning it by a small pinion with the index
                    attached to it, so that the motion of the index exceeds that of the regulator
                    itself as much as the radius of that wheel exceeds the radius of the pinion.
                    Chronometers are regulated in a different way altogether. It is not expedient to
                    alter the effective length of the spring after its length is once fixed. For it
                    has long been ascertained that a spring does not give isochronous vibrations at
                    all lengths, but only at certain intervals; and therefore it is necessary in an
                    accurate timekeeper to use only one of those lengths of the spring which are
                    found to be isochronous for different arcs of vibration; and, that being fixed,
                    the timing of the balance can only be done by altering its moment of inertia,
                    and this is done in chronometers by screws with heavy heads in the rim of the
                    balance, set farther in or out as it is wanted to go faster or slower. In marine
                    chronometers, where there is plenty of room for it, the balance-spring is
                    generally made in a cylindrical form, with the coils all of the same diameter,
                    instead of the flat spiral used in watches,—though it does not seem to be quite
                    clear that the cylindrical form is materially better than the other.</p>
                <p>The timing of a watch for position, as it is called, is a matter which requires
                    some attention. If the balance is not exactly poised on its axis, it will have a
                    tendency to take one position when the watch is carried vertically, as it always
                    is in the pocket; and the time of vibration will be affected by its disposition
                    thus to act as a pendulum. The watch ought therefore to be tried with XII, IX,
                    VI, and III successively upwards, and if it does not keep the same rate the
                    balance is not properly poised. Marine chronometers, indeed, being set in <hi
                    rend="italic">gimbals</hi> (a ring with the two pivots into the box at right
                    angles with the pivots which carry the chronometer), will remain horizontal,
                    though not without some degree of motion under the motion of the ship; and this
                    gives the balance the further advantage of having its weight resting only on the
                    end of the axis or verge, a position in which there is much less friction than
                    that of a watch carried in the pocket; but there it is not of so much
                    consequence, because the balance is so much lighter than a chronometer
                    balance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Compensated Balances.—</hi> A pendulum requires scarcely any
                    compensation except for its own elongation by heat; but a balance requires
                    compensation, not only for its own expansion, which increases its moment of
                    inertia just like the pendulum, but far more on account of the decrease in the
                    strength of the spring under increased heat. Dent, in a pamphlet on compensation
                    balances, gave the following results of some experiments with a glass balance,
                    which he used for the purpose on account of its less expansibility than a metal
                    one :—at 32° F., 3606 vibrations in an hour; at 66°, 3598⋅5; and at 100°, 3599.
                    If therefore it had been adjusted to go right (or 3600 times in an hour) at 32°,
                    it would have lost 7½ and 8½ seconds an hour, or more than three minutes a-day,
                    for each successive increase of 34°, which is about fifteen times as much as a
                    common wire pendulum would lose under the same increase of heat; and if a metal
                    balance had been used instead of a glass one the difference would have been
                    still greater.</p>
                <p>The necessity for this large amount of compensation having arisen from the
                    variation of the elasticity of the spring, the first attempts at correcting it
                    were by acting on the spring itself in the manner of a common regulator.
                    Harrison’s compensation consisted of a compound bar of brass and steel soldered
                    together, having one end fixed to the watch-frame and the other carrying two
                    curb pins which embraced the spring, as was described at fig. 2. As the brass
                    expands more than the steel, any increase of heat made the bar bend; and so, if
                    it was set the right way, it carried the pins along the spring, so as to shorten
                    it. This contrivance is called a <hi rend="italic">compensation curb</hi>; and
                    it has often been reinvented, or applied in a modified form. But there are two
                    objections to it: the motion of the curb pins does not correspond accurately
                    enough to the variations in the force of the spring, and it disturbs the
                    isochronism, which only subsists at certain definite lengths of the spring.</p>
                <p>The compensation which was next invented left the spring untouched, and provided
                    for the variations of temperature by the construction of the balance itself.
                    Fig. 3 shows the plan of the ordinary compensation balance. Each portion of the
                    rim of the balance is composed of an inner bar of steel with an outer one of
                    brass soldered upon it, and carrying the weights <hi rend="italic">b,b,</hi>
                    which are screwed to it. As the temperature increases, the brass expanding must
                    bend the steel inwards, and so carries the weights farther in, and diminishes
                    the moment of inertia of the balance. The metals are generally soldered together
                    by pouring melted brass round a solid steel disk, and the whole is afterwards
                    turned and filed away till it leaves only the crossbar in the middle lying flat
                    and the two portions of the rim standing edgeways. The first person who
                    practised this method of uniting them appears to have been Thomas Earnshaw, who
                    brought the chronometer to the state in which it has remained for the last
                    century, with scarcely any alteration except more complete compensation.</p>
                <p>The adjustment of a balance for compensation can only be done by trial, and
                    requires a good deal of time. It must be done independently of that for
                    time,—the former by shifting the weights, because the nearer they are to the
                    crossbar the less distance they will move over as the rim bends with them. The
                    timing is done by screws with heavy heads (<hi rend="italic">t,t,</hi> fig. 3),
                    which are just opposite to the ends of the crossbar, and consequently not
                    affected by the bending of the rim. The compensation may be done approximately
                    by the known results of previous experience with similar balances; and many
                    watches are sold with compensation balances which have never been tried or
                    adjusted, and sometimes with a mere sham compensation balance, not even cut
                    through.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Secondary Compensation.—</hi> When chronometers had been
                    brought to great perfection it was perceived that there was a residuary error,
                    which was due to changes of temperature, but which no adjustment of the
                    compensation would correct. For, if the compensation was adjusted for two
                    extreme temperatures, such as 32° and 100°, then the chronometer gained at mean
                    temperatures; and, if adjusted for any two mean temperatures, it would lose for
                    all beyond them. This error was observed, and attempts were made to correct it
                    before anybody had pointed out how it arose: this appears to have been first
                    done in a paper in the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Magazine</hi> by E. J. Dent in
                    1833; and he gave the following illustration of it. The variation of the force
                    of the spring proceeds uniformly in proportion to the temperature, and therefore
                    may be represented by a straight line inclined at some angle to another straight
                    line divided into degrees of temperature. But the inertia of a balance of the
                    common construction cannot be made to vary uniformly according to the
                    temperature, but will vary more rapidly in cold than heat; and consequently its
                    rate of variation can only be represented by a curve, and the curve can only be
                    made to coincide with the straight line representing the rate of variation of
                    the spring in two points,—either two extremes, or two means, or one extreme and
                    one mean point.</p>
                <p>The same thing may be shown mathematically, as follows. Let <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> be the distance of the compensation weights <hi rend="italic">b</hi>,
                    <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> in fig. 3 (which we may assume for convenience to be
                    the whole mass M of the balance) from the centre at some mean temperature, and
                    let <hi rend="italic">dr</hi> be their increase of distance due to a decrease of
                    some given number of degrees of heat, under the action of the compensation bars.
                    Then the new moment of inertia will be M <hi rend="italic">(r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">+2rdr+dr</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">),</hi> and the ratio of the new to the
                    old will be 1 + (2 <hi rend="italic">dr/r</hi>) + ( dr/r) <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 2</hi>; and the term (<hi rend="italic">dr/r</hi>) <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> is now too large to be disregarded, as it might be in pendulums, where
                    the compensation <hi rend="italic">dl/l</hi> is only required to be about <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 20</hi> th of the in a
                    balance. It is found that an equal increase of temperature will produce an equal
                    or rather a less motion ( - <hi rend="italic">dr)</hi> of the weights towards
                    the centre than from it at any given point; but, calling it only equal, the
                    ratio of the decreased moment of inertia to the original one will be 1 - (2 <hi
                    rend="italic">dr/r)</hi> + (<hi rend="italic">dr/r</hi>) <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>, so that the increase and the decrease from the mean amount differ by
                    twice (<hi rend="italic">dr/r)</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>; in other
                    words, the moment of inertia of the balance varies less in passing from mean to
                    hot temperature than from mean to cold; and consequently if it is adjusted for
                    mean and cold it will not have decreased enough at an equal increase from mean

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0421-0396"/> We shall give a short description of the
                    principal classes of inventions for this purpose.</p>
                <p>The first that was disclosed was Eiffe’s (sometimes called Molyneux’s),
                    communicated to the astronomer-royal in 1835. In one of several methods proposed
                    by him a compensation curb was used; and, though, for the reasons given before,
                    this will not answer for the primary compensation, it may for the secondary,
                    where the motion required is very much smaller. In another the primary
                    compensation bar, or a screw in it, was made to reach a spring set within it
                    with a small weight attached at some mean temperature, and, as it bent farther
                    in, it carried this secondary compensation weight along with it. The obvious
                    objection to this is that it is discontinuous; but the whole motion is so small,
                    not more than the thickness of a piece of paper, that this and other
                    compensations on the same principle appear to have been on some occasions quite
                    successful. Molyneux took a patent for a secondary compensation exactly the same
                    as this of Eiffe’s, then before the astronomer-royal.</p>
                <p>Another large class of balances, all more or less alike, may be represented by E.
                    J. Dent’s, which came next in order of time. He described several forms of his
                    invention; the following description applies to the one he thought the best. In
                    fig. 4 the flat crossbar <hi rend="italic">rr</hi> is itself a compensation bar
                    which bends upwards under increased heat; so that, if the weights <hi
                    rend="italic">v, v</hi> were merely set upon upright stems rising from the ends
                    of the crossbar, they would approach the axis when that bar bends upwards. But,
                    instead of the stems rising from the crossbar, they rise from the two secondary
                    compensation pieces <hi rend="italic">stu,</hi> in the form of staples, which
                    are set on the crossbar; and, as these secondary pieces themselves also bend
                    upwards, they make the weights approach the axis more rapidly as the heat
                    increases; and by a proper adjustment of the height of the weights on the stems
                    the moment of inertia of the balance can be made to vary in the proper ratio to
                    the variation of the intensity of the spring. The cylindrical spring stands
                    above the crossbar and between the staples.</p>
                <p>Fig. 5 represents Loseby’s mercurial compensation balance. Besides the weights D,
                    D, set near the end of the primary compensation bars B, B, there are small bent
                    tubes FE, FE with mercury in them, like a thermometer, the bulbs being at F, F.
                    As the heat increases, not only do the primary weights D, D and the bulbs F, F
                    approach the centre of the balance, but some of the mercury is driven along the
                    tube, thus carrying some more of the weight towards the centre, at a ratio
                    increasing more rapidly than the temperature. The tubes are sealed at the thin
                    end, with a little air included. The action is here equally continuous with
                    Dent’s, and the adjustments for primary and secondary compensation are
                    apparently more independent of each other; and this modification of Le Roy’s use
                    of mercury for compensated balances (which does not appear to have answered) is
                    certainly very elegant and ingenious. Nevertheless an analysis of the Greenwich
                    lists for seven years of Mr Loseby’s trials proved that the advantage of this
                    method over the others was more theoretical than practical; Dent’s compensation
                    was the most successful of all in three years out of the seven, and Loseby’s in
                    only one. Loseby’s method has never been adopted by any other chronometermaker,
                    whereas the principles both of Eiffe’s and of Dent’s methods have been adopted
                    by several other makers.</p>
                <p>A few chronometers have been made with glass balance-springs, which have the
                    advantage of requiring very little primary and no secondary compensation, on
                    account of the very small variation in their elasticity, compared with springs
                    of steel or any other metal.</p>
                <p>Dent also invented a very different method of effecting the primary and secondary
                    compensation at once, and without any additional appendage to the balance or
                    addition to the cost. He called it the <hi rend="italic">prismatic balance,</hi>
                    from the shape of the steel rim, of which the section is shown in fig. 6, BC
                    being the brass, and the dark triangle within it the section of the steel part
                    of the rim. A prism of cast-steel will bend more easily from the edge than the
                    other way, and consequently the motion is greater when it is being curved by
                    heat than when it is pulled straighter by cold, which is exactly what is wanted.
                    The difference is not quite so great as it ought to be for complete secondary
                    compensation for a very wide range of temperature, but it is enough to give the
                    requisite compensation for all ordinary variations of temperature, and
                    chronometers so compensated were found to be also more than usually steady in
                    their rate, for even in the best chrono-meters there appear every now and then
                    quite capricious variations.</p>
                <p>Several other forms of secondary compensation have been invented and found
                    successful, all on the same principle of so arranging the compound bars that the
                    weights move more under any given change of temperature in hot weather, or when
                    they are nearest to the axis of the balance, than in cold when they are farthest
                    off. Notices of these may be seen in various volumes of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Horological Journal.</hi></p>
                <p>The best chronometers, with all these improvements, cannot be relied on to keep a
                    rate equal to that of a good astronomical clock of the usual kind, though they
                    occasionally do so for a short time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Watch Escapements.—</hi> The escapements in practical use
                    are—(1) the old <hi rend="italic">vertical</hi> escapement, now almost disused;
                    (2) the <hi rend="italic">lever,</hi> very much the most common in English
                    watches; (3) the <hi rend="italic">horizontal</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >cylinder,</hi> which is equally common in foreign watches, though it was of
                    English invention; (4) the <hi rend="italic">duplex,</hi> which used to be more
                    in fashion for first-rate watches than it is now; and (5) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >detached</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chronometer</hi> escapement, so called
                    because it is always used in marine chronometers.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">vertical</hi> escapement is simply the original clock
                    escapement (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Clocks,</hi> fig. 3) adapted to the
                    position of the wheels in a watch and the balance, in the manner exhibited in
                    fig. 7. As it requires considerable thickness in the watch, it is inferior in
                    going to all the others, and no cheaper than the lever escapement can now be
                    made; and for these reasons it has gone out of use.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">lever</hi> escapement, as it is now universally made, was
                    invented late in the last century by Thomas Mudge. Fig. 8 shows its action. The
                    position of the lever with reference to the pallets is immaterial in principle,
                    and is only a question of convenience in the arrangement; but it is generally
                    such as we have given it. The principle is the same as in the dead-beat
                    escapement clock (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Clocks,</hi> fig. 5), with the
                    advantage that there is no friction on the dead faces of the pallets beyond what
                    is necessary for locking. The reason why this friction cannot be avoided with a
                    pendulum is that its arc of vibration is so small that the requisite depth of
                    intersection cannot be got between the two circles described by the end S of the
                    lever and any pin in the pendulum which would work into it; whereas, in a watch,
                    the pin P, which is set in a cylinder on the verge of the balance, does not
                    generally slip out of the nick in the end of the lever until the balance lias
                    got 15° past its middle position. The pallets are undercut a little, as it is
                    called, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the dead faces are so sloped as to give a
                    little recoil the wrong way, or slightly to resist the unlocking, because
                    otherwise there would be a risk that a shake of the watch would let a tooth
                    escape while the pin is disengaged from the lever. There is also a further
                    provision added for safety. In the cylinder which carries the impulse pin P
                    there is a notch just in front of P, into which the other pin S on the lever
                    fits as they pass; but when the notch has got past the cylinder it would prevent
                    the lever from returning, because the safety-pin S cannot pass except through
                    the notch, which is only in the position for letting it pass at the same time
                    that the impulse-pin is engaged in the lever. The pallets in a lever escapement
                    (except bad and cheap ones) are always jewelled, and the scape-wheel is of
                    brass. The staff of the lever also has jewelled pivot-holes in expensive
                    watches, and the scape-wheel has in all good ones. The holes for the
                    balancepivots are now always jewelled, if nothing else is. The scape-wheel in
                    this and most of the watch escapements generally beats five times in a second,
                    in large chronometers four times; and the wheel next to the scape-wheel carries
                    the seconds-hand. Macdowall’s single-pin escapement was adapted to watches
                    exactly as the dead escapement of clocks is turned into the lever escapement of
                    watches.</p>
                <p>Fig. 9 is a plan of the <hi rend="italic">horizontal</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >cylinder</hi> escapement, cutting through the cylinder, which is on the verge
                    of the balance, at the level of the tops of the teeth of the escape-wheel; for
                    the triangular pieces A, B are not flat projections in the same plane as the
                    teeth, but are raised on short stems above the plane of the wheel; and still
                    more of the cylinder than the portion shown at ACD is cut away where the wheel
                    itself has to pass. The author of this escapement was Graham, and it resembles
                    his dead escapement in clocks in principle more than the lever escapement does,
                    though much less in appearance, because in this escapement there is the dead
                    friction of the teeth against the cylinder, first on the outside, as here
                    represented, and then on the inside, as shown by the dotted lines, during the
                    whole vibration of the balance, except that portion which belongs to the
                    impulse. The impulse is given by the oblique outside edges A <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi>, B <hi rend="italic">b</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n422/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0422-0397"/> of the teeth against the edges A, D of the
                    cylinder alternately. The portion of the cylinder which is cut away at the point
                    of action is about 30° less than the semicircle. The cylinder itself is made
                    either of steel or ruby, and, from the small quantity of it which is left at the
                    level of the wheel, it is evidently a very delicate affair; and probably this
                    has been the main reason why, although it is an English invention, it has been
                    almost entirely abandoned by the English watchmakers in favour of the lever,
                    which was originally a French invention, though very much improved by Mudge, for
                    before his invention the lever had a rack or portion of a toothed wheel on its
                    end, working into a pinion on the balance verge, and consequently it was
                    affected by the dead friction, and that of this wheel and pinion besides. This
                    used to be called the rack lever, and Mudge’s the detached lever; but, the rack
                    lever being now quite obsolete, the word “detached” has become detached from the
                    lever escapement, and confined to the chronometer, to which it is more
                    appropriate, as will be seen presently. The Swiss watches have almost
                    universally the horizontal escapement. It is found that—for some reason which is
                    apparently unknown, as the rule certainly does not hold in cases seemingly
                    analogous—a steel scape-wheel acts better in this escapement than a brass one,
                    although in some other cases steel upon steel, or even upon a ruby, very soon
                    throws off a film of rast, unless they are kept well oiled, while brass and
                    steel, or stone, will act with scarcely any oil at all, and in some cases with
                    none.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">duplex</hi> escapement (fig. 10) is probably so called
                    because there is a double set of teeth in the scape-wheel,—the long ones (like
                    those of the lever escapement in shape) for locking only, and short ones (or
                    rather upright pins on the rim of the wheel) for giving the impulse to the
                    pallet P on the verge of the balance. It is a single-beat escapement; <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the balance only receives the impulse one way, or at
                    every alternate beat, as in the chronometer escapement, and in a few clock
                    escapements which have never come into use. When the balance is turning in the
                    direction marked by the arrow, and arrives at the position in which the dotted
                    tooth <hi rend="italic">b</hi> has its point against the triangular notch. V,
                    the tooth end slips into the notch, and, as the verge turns farther round, the
                    tooth goes on with it till at last it escapes when the tooth has got into the
                    position A; and by that time the long tooth or pallet which projects from the
                    verge has moved from <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to P, and just come in front of
                    the pin T, which stands on the rim of the scape-wheel, and which now begins to
                    push against P, and so gives the impulse until it also escapes when it has
                    arrived at <hi rend="italic">t</hi>; and the wheel is then stopped by the next
                    tooth B having got into the position <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> with its point
                    resting against the verge, and there is evidently what we have called dead
                    friction between them; but, as the verge is smaller than the cylinder of the
                    horizontal escapement, and is also made of a jewel, the friction does not
                    seriously affect the motion of the balance. The impulse is also given very
                    directly across the line of centres, and therefore with very little friction, as
                    in the three-legged dead escapement for clocks and in the chronometer
                    escapement. A little impulse is also received from the long teeth on the notch;
                    but the greatest part of that motion is wasted. As the balance turns back, the
                    nick V goes past the end of the tooth <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and in
                    consequence of its smallness, it passes without visibly affecting the motion of
                    the scape-wheel, though of course it does produce a very slight shake in
                    passing. It is evident that, if it did not pass, the tooth could not get into
                    the nick for the next escape. The objection to this escapement is that it
                    requires very great delicacy of adjustment, and the watch also requires to be
                    worn carefully; for, if by accident the balance is once stopped from swinging
                    back far enough to carry the nick V past the tooth end, it will stop altogether,
                    as it will lose still more of its vibration the next time from receiving no
                    impulse. The performance of this escapement, when well made, and its
                    independence of oil, are nearly equal to those of the detached escapement; but,
                    as lever watches are now made sufficiently good for all but astronomical
                    purposes, for which chronometers are used, and they are cheaper both to make and
                    to mend than duplex ones, the manufacture of duplex watches has almost
                    disappeared.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">chronometer</hi> or <hi rend="italic">detached</hi>
                    escapement is shown at fig. 11, in the form to which it was brought by Earnshaw
                    nearly a century ago, and in which it has remained ever since, with the very
                    slight difference that the pallet P, on which the impulse is given
                    (corresponding exactly to the pallet P in the duplex escapement), is now
                    generally set in a radial direction from the verge, whereas Earnshaw made it
                    sloped backward, or undercut, like the scape-wheel teeth. The early history of
                    escapements on this principle does not seem to be very clear. They appear to
                    have originated in France; but there is no doubt that they were considerably
                    improved by the first Arnold, who died in 1799. Earnshaw’s watches, however,
                    generally beat his in trials.</p>
                <p>In fig. 11 the small tooth or cam V, on the verge of the balance, is just on the
                    point of unlocking the detent DT from the tooth T of the scape-wheel; and the
                    tooth A will immediately begin to give the impulse on the pallet P, which, in
                    good chronometers, is always a jewel set in the cylinder; the tooth V is also a
                    jewel. This part of the action is so evident as to requir no further notice.
                    When the balance returns, the tooth V has to get past the end of the detent,
                    without disturbing it; for, as soon as it has been unlocked, it falls against
                    the bankingpin E, and is ready to receive the next tooth B, and must stay there
                    until it is again unlocked. It ends, or rather begins, in a stiffish spring,
                    which is screwed to the block D on the watch frame, so that it moves without any
                    friction of pivots, like a pendulum. The passing is done by means of another
                    spring TV, called the passing spring, which can be pushed away from the body of
                    the detent towards the left, but cannot be pushed the other way without carrying
                    the detent with it. In the back vibration, therefore, as in the duplex
                    escapement, the balance receives no impulse, and it has to overcome the slight
                    resistance of the passing spring besides; but it has no other friction, and is
                    entirely <hi rend="italic">detached</hi> from the scape-wheel the whole time,
                    except when receiving the impulse. That is also the case in the lever
                    escapement; but the impulse in that escapement is given obliquely, and
                    consequently with a good deal of friction; and, besides, the scapewheel only
                    acts on the balance through the intervention of the lever, which has the
                    friction of its own pivots and of the impulse pin. The locking-pallet T is
                    undercut a little for safety, and is also a jewel in the best chronometers; and
                    the passing spring is of gold, as steel will rast. In the duplex and detached
                    escapements, the timing of the action of the different parts requires great
                    care, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the adjusting them so that each may be ready
                    to act exactly at the right time; and it is curious that the arrangement which
                    would be geometrically correct, or suitable for a very slow motion of the
                    balance, will not do for the real motion. If the pallet P were really set so as
                    just to point to the tooth A in both escapements at the moment of unlocking (as
                    it has been drawn, because otherwise it would look as if it could not act at
                    all), it would run away some distance before the tooth could catch it, because
                    in the duplex escapement the scape-wheel is then only moving slowly, and in the
                    detached it is not moving at all, and has to start from rest. The pallet P is
                    therefore, in fact, set a little farther back, so that it may arrive at the
                    tooth A just at the time when A is ready for it, without wasting time and force
                    in running after it. This, however, seems now to be doubted in practice. The
                    detached escapement has also been made on the duplex plan of having long teeth
                    for the locking and short ones or pins nearer the centre for the impulse; but
                    the advantages do not appear to be worth the additional trouble, and the force
                    required for unlocking is not sensibly diminished by the arrangement, as the
                    spring D must in any case be pretty stiff, to provide against the watch being
                    carried in the position in which the weight of the detent helps to unlock
                    it.</p>
                <p>An escapement called the <hi rend="italic">lever chronometer</hi> has been
                    several times reinvented, which implies that it has never come into general use.
                    It is a combination of the lever as to the locking and the chronometer as to the
                    impulse. It involves a little drop and therefore waste of force as a tooth of
                    the wheel just escapes at the “passing” beat where no impulse is given. But it
                    should be understood (as it is not by some who write on clock-work) that a
                    single-beat escapement involves no more loss of force and the escape of no more
                    teeth than a double one, except the slight drop in the duplex and this lever
                    chronometer or others on the same principle.</p>
                <p>There have been several contrivances for <hi rend="italic">remontoire</hi>
                    escapements; but there are defects in all of them; and there is not the same
                    advantage to be obtained by giving the impulse to a watch-balance by means of
                    some other spring instead of the mainspring as there is in turret-clocks, where
                    the force of the train is liable to very much greater variations than in
                    chronometers or small clocks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tourbillon</hi> escapements, and a few other things not
                    necessary to notice here, are described in the 7th edition of Sir E. Beckett’s
                    (now Lord Grimthorpe) <hi rend="italic">Rudimentary Treatise on Clocks, Watches,
                    and Bells.</hi><hi rend="italic">Repeaters, Keyless Watches, &amp;c.—</hi>
                    Repeating-watches, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> watches which strike the hours
                    and quarters on pushing in the handle, are now scarcely ever made in England,
                    and with very good reason, for it is almost impossible to crowd into the space
                    of even a large-sized watch the quantity of wheels and other things required for
                    the repeating work without unduly interfering with the going part, and, besides
                    that, the striking work itself is very liable to get out of order.</p>
                <p>The winding of watches without a key is an object for which there have been
                    several inventions, and it possesses a considerable advantage, besides the mere
                    convenience of being independent of a key, for, as there is then no occasion to
                    open it, the case may be made to fit more closely, and the air is more
                    completely excluded.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n423/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0423-0398"/>
                <p>and consequently the watch will go longer without cleaning; and it also saves the
                    thickness and the cost of a double back to the case. The first plan of the kind
                    was that of pulling out the knob of the handle, which went into the watch, and
                    had a gathering click attached to it which wound up the fusee, or the barrel, by
                    means of a ratchet. But this was not found to answer: it was liable to get out
                    of order; and, moreover, at every time of winding fresh air was pumped into the
                    watch, which soon produced injurious effects. A far better plan is that of
                    combining the two objects of winding and setting the hands by means of the
                    handle, in the manner we shall now describe. In fig. 12 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    is a wheel on the barrel, with bevelled teeth, and there is another small
                    bevelled wheel on a spindle <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which ends in a milled
                    head <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> within the handle or pendant; these two wheels
                    cannot conveniently be arranged so as to work into each other without the
                    intervention of a third between them, which is marked <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    in the left-hand section.</p>
                <p>It is easy to see that turning the milled head will wind up the barrel. The same
                    arrangement might of course be applied to the fusee, though it would increase
                    the size; but in fact these watches are made without one, and the practice is
                    increasing. The winding wheel <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is also made with the
                    well-known contrivance of Breguet, known by the name of the “tipsy key” when
                    applied to a common winding key, which enables you to turn the handle the wrong
                    way without doing anything except moving a ratchet-wheel over its click, and
                    consequently without straining the watch in attempting to wind it the wrong way.
                    The same handle and wheels are also made use of to set the hands, thus :—there
                    is a small wheel <hi rend="italic">f</hi> which turns on a stud at the end of
                    the lever <hi rend="italic">fgh,</hi> and as the lever turns on a pivot at <hi
                    rend="italic">g,</hi> when its end <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> which just projects
                    through the rim of the watch, is pushed on one side, the wheel <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> will then be thrown into gear with the winding wheel <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> and the hour pinion in the middle of the watch; and consequently, if the
                    handle is then turned, it will alter the hands, just as they are usually altered
                    from the back by a key in foreign watches, so that the face need never be
                    opened. Of course, while this is doing, you do at the same time wind up the
                    watch a little if the hand has to be turned the way for winding; but that is of
                    no consequence, except that you cannot put the hands forward immediately after
                    you have completely wound up the watch. There are various other arrangements for
                    winding and setting by the handle substantially on the same principle. The ring
                    is difficult to fix firmly when flexible on a stud perforated for the winding
                    arbor, as no screw can go through it. The ring and the stud should be made in
                    one piece. There is no use in it being hinged, as usual.</p>
                <p>In the chronograph watch there is, in addition to the centre seconds-hand, an
                    independent seconds-hand which, when not in operation, stands at zero. Pressure
                    on the crown-piece acts successively (1) on a starting motion, (2) on a stopping
                    motion, and (3) on a motion whieh sends the hand back by the shortest path to
                    zero.</p>
                <p>Watches are also made with what are called <hi rend="italic">split
                    seconds</hi>-hands, —the two hands being in their ordinary state together and
                    appearing as one, but when you push in a knob one of them is stopped, while the
                    other goes on; the time shown by the stopped one is of course the time of the
                    observation. Sometimes this is done by merely connecting the hands by a very
                    slight spiral spring, which will allow itself to be untwisted one or two coils
                    without stopping the watch; and, as it cannot be of any use to stop the
                    seconds-hand longer than a minute, this seems to answer. There is, however,
                    another plan, in which these two hands, or at least the socket of one and the
                    arbor of the other, are connected by a pair of disks set obliquely on the arbor
                    and the socket respectively, so that, whenever the spring which keeps them
                    together is allowed to act, it brings the loose hand up to the hand fixed on the
                    arbor; and it does not signify how long it may be stopped by throwing the disks
                    out of contact. One of the disks is heart-shaped, and is connected with the
                    other by a spring, forming what is called a <hi rend="italic">jumper.</hi></p>
                <p>For the use of electrical engineers and others who are brought within the
                    influence of powerful electrical machinery, it has been found necessary to
                    introduce non-magnetizable watches. At present this is best secured by making
                    the balance of silver or platinum alloy, and the balance spring of gold or
                    palladium. The use of steel in moving parts of the works is carefully avoided,
                    and thus fairly good timekeepers indifferent to magnetic influences are
                    produced.</p>
                <p>The introduction of machinery for the manufacture of watch movements has had the
                    effect of greatly cheapening the commoner class of watches, and yet supplying a
                    fairly satisfactory timekeeper. It is in America that the application of
                    machinery to watchmaking has found its greatest development, and its success has
                    enabled the American manufacturers to obtain considerable foothold in the
                    European market for cheap watches. But watch movements are also now very
                    extensively made by machinery in Birmingham, Coventry, and several Lancashire
                    towns.</p>
                <p>Under the auspices of the Royal Society a department has been established at Kew
                    observatory for the testing and certifying of watches in respect of their
                    compensation for variations of temperature, and their uniformity of motion in
                    different positions. Watches which obtain certificates of the first class have
                    also awarded to them merit marks up to 40 for complete absence of variation in
                    daily rate, 40 for absolute freedom from change of rate in different positions,
                    and 20 for perfect compensation for variations of temperature. The testing
                    establishment has only been instituted for a few years; but its services are
                    being largely sought by manufacturers of the high class of watches, who have
                    laboured with equal zeal and success to keep the English-made watch unapproached
                    by the product of any other nation. (G.)</p>
