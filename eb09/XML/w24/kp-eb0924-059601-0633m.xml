                    early times, mainly on account of its central position on the Roman high roads
                    in the south of England.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    present cathedral close; but in the 3d century the place is said to have become
                    one of the chief centres of the early Celtic Christians. The Saxon invaders at
                    the end of the 5th century treated the Roman name Venta as if it were a feminine
                    substantive, and, transforming it into “Winte,” called the town <hi
                    rend="italic">Winte-ceaster,</hi> “the City of the Winte;” hence the modern name
                    Winchester. Throughout the Saxon period the city was one of the highest
                    importance: early in the 6th century it became the capital of Wessex; and the
                    kings of Wessex were crowned and usually buried in the cathedral. Even after the
                    formation of the united kingdom of Anglia by Egbert, the great witan was still
                    held in Winchester. It was also one of the chief centres for the coining of
                    money under the pre-Norman kings: in the time of Athelstan it contained six
                    mints, while London possessed only three. Even after the Norman Conquest many
                    sovereigns were crowned and many parliaments held here; the celebrated Statutes
                    of Winchester were passed in a parliament held in 1285. The city continued to be
                    a favourite royal residence, and Henry II. rebuilt the palace on a larger
                    scale.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The hall of this

                    it its first regular charter of incorporation (1184). In the Middle Ages
                    Winchester was famed for its wool trade and textile fabrics; in the 14th century
                    it was the chief wool mart of England and had an extensive trade with France,
                    Belgium, and Holland. In the 15th century its prosperity began to decline. In
                    Cromwell’s time the city suffered severely from a siege, during which Winchester
                    Castle was dismantled. Charles II. began to build a palace on the site of this
                    fortress, after designs by Sir Christopher Wren, but the death of the king
                    prevented the work from being completed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    covering.”</p></note></p>
                <p>The first Christian church at Winchester is said to have been destroyed during
                    the persecution of Aurelian, and rebuilt in 293. It was again burned by the
                    Saxons in 495. St Swithun held the episcopate from 852 to 862, and enlarged the
                    cathedral. The foundations of the adjacent abbey church of Hyde, in which some
                    of the Saxon kings were buried, were discovered in 1886 close to the north side
                    of the cathedral nave. The cathedral church was at one time associated with a
                    priory of secular canons, but St Ethelwold, bishop from 963 to 984, suppressed
                    the secular foundation and built a Benedictine abbey in its place.<note

                    rend="italic">Winchester Cathedral,</hi> London, 1817.</p></note> A wholly new
                    cathedral was begun by Bishop Walkelin (1070-98), and in 1093 the eastern
                    portion was consecrated jointly to St Peter, St Paul, and St Swithun. The two
                    Norman transepts and the low central tower still exist, as does also the very
                    curious early crypt, east of the crossing. This is a low vaulted structure
                    partly supported by a central row of columns; it has an apsidal termination, and
                    is surrounded by an ambulatory, out of which a second smaller apse extends
                    eastwards,—apparently a survival of the “confessio” of the earlier cathedral.
                    The whole of the Norman nave was pulled down and rebuilt on a more magnificent
                    scale by William of Wykeham at the end of the 14th century; the work was
                    completed after his death by means of a large bequest. The choir was also
                    remodelled in the 14th century and again much altered by Bishop Fox
                    (1501-28).</p>
                <p>In plan Winchester cathedral consists of a nave, two transepts, choir, and
                    retro-choir, all with aisles. A large lady chapel extends still further
                    eastwards. The length of the whole building is no less than 546 feet, thus being
                    greater than that of any other church in England, with the exception of St
                    Albans, which measures about the same length. One of its chief beauties is the
                    magnificent teredos behind the high altar; this consists of a lofty wall, the
                    full width of the choir, pierced by two processional doors, and covered with
                    tiers of rich canopied niches, which once contained colossal statues. A cross of
                    plain ashlar stone in the centre shows where an immense silver crucifix was once
                    attached; and a plain rectangular recess above the altar once contained a
                    massive silver-gilt retable, covered with cast and repoussé statuettes and
                    reliefs, an elaborate work of the most costly magnificence. A second stone
                    screen, placed at the interval of one bay behind the great reredos, served to
                    enclose the small chapel in which stood the magnificent gold shrine, studded
                    with jewels, the gift of King Edgar,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Great treasures of gold and jewels were presented to this
                    cathedral by many of the early kings of England, especially by Canute, who gave

                    altar.</p></note> which contained the body of St Swithun. In the choir is the
                    plain tomb of William II., and under many of the arches of the nave and choir
                    are a number of very elaborate chantry chapels, each containing the tomb of its
                    founder. Some of these have fine recumbent effigies, noble examples of English
                    mediaeval sculpture; the most notable are the monuments of Bishops Edingdon,
                    Wykeham, Waynflete, Cardinal Beaufort, Langton, and Fox. The font of black
                    marble is an interesting example of 11th-century art; its sides are covered with
                    curious reliefs representing scenes from the life of St Nicholas. A good deal of
                    very magnificent 14th-century stained glass still exists at Winchester.</p>

                    consisted of a warden, ten fellows, three chaplains, seventy scholars, and
                    sixteen choristers. Its fine chapel, hall, cloister, and other buildings still
                    exist in good preservation. About a mile distant from the town stands the
                    hospital of St Cross, founded in 1136 by Henry de Blois, bishop of Winchester,
                    to provide board and lodging for 13 poor men and a daily dinner for 100 others.
                    It was enlarged and mostly rebuilt by Cardinal Beaufort, 1405-47. The buildings
                    are still in a good state of preservation, including the simple but very stately
                    cruciform chapel, built about the year 1180, which in plan resembles a fine
                    parochial church.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See a

                <p>Winchester suffered greatly in the plague of 1666, and its population was much
                    reduced. At present its prosperity chiefly depends on the presence of the
                    cathedral, the college, and its barracks, which accommodate about 2000 men. The
                    city has several good schools and the usual public and charitable institutions.
