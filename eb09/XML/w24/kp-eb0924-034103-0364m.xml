                    (1626), where he took a leading part in the contest between the London clergy
                    and the citizens about the city tithes, and compiled a treatise on the subject,
                    which is printed in Brewster’s <hi rend="italic">Collectanea,</hi> 1752. His
                    conduct in this matter displayed his ability, but his zeal for the exaction of
                    ecclesiastical dues was remembered to his hurt in 1641 in the articles brought
                    against him in parliament, which appear to have led to the sequestration of his
                    very considerable preferments.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>He was from January 1635-36 rector of Sandon, in Essex,
                    where his first wife, Anne Claxton, is buried. He appears to have also been a
                    prebendary of St Paul’s, and for a very short time he had held the rectory of St
                    Giles in the Fields.</p></note> He was also charged with Popish practices, but
                    on frivolous grounds, and with aspersing the members of parliament for the city.
                    Up to this time he was perhaps more an active ecclesiastic than an eager
                    student. In 1642 he was ordered into custody as a delinquent; thereafter he took
                    refuge at Oxford, and ultimately returned to London to the house of Dr Fuller,
                    dean of Ely, whose daughter Jane was his second wife. In this retirement he
                    planned and executed his great work, a Polyglott Bible which should be
                    completer, cheaper, and provided with a better critical apparatus than any
                    previous work of the kind (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Polyglott).</hi> The
                    proposals for the Polyglott appeared in 1652, and the book itself came out in
                    six great folios in 1657, having been printing for five years. England had at
                    this time a band of Biblical and Oriental scholars of unusual distinction, and
                    Walton could reckon among his active helpers Usher, Lightfoot, and Pococke,
                    Castle, Wheelock, and Patrick Young, Hyde, Thomas Greaves, and others of less
                    note. The great undertaking was supported by liberal subscriptions, and Walton’s
                    political opinions did not deprive him of the help of the Commonwealth; the
                    paper used was freed from duty, and the interest of Cromwell in the work was
                    acknowledged in the original preface, part of which was afterwards cancelled to
                    make way for more loyal expressions towards that restored monarchy under which
                    Oriental studies in England immediately began to languish. To Walton himself,
                    however, the Reformation <pb break="no"

                    bishop of Chester in December 1660. In the following spring he was one of the
                    commissioners at the Savoy Conference, but took little part in the business. In
                    the autumn of 1661 he paid a short visit to his diocese, and returning to London
                    he fell sick and died on 29th November.</p>
                <p>However much Walton was indebted to his helpers, the Polyglott Bible is a great
                    monument of industry and of capacity for directing a vast undertaking, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi> (separately reprinted by Dathe, 1777, and
                    Wrangham, 1825) show judgment as well as learning. The same qualities appear in
                    Walton’s <hi rend="italic">Considerator Considered</hi> (1659), a reply to Dr
                    John Owen’s <hi rend="italic">Considerations,</hi> who thought that the
                    accumulation of material for the revision of the received text tended to
                    atheism. Among Walton’s works must also be mentioned an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introductio ad Lectionem Linguarum Orientalium</hi> (1654, 2d ed. 1655), meant
                    to prepare the way for the Polyglott.</p>
