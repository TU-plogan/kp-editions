                    son of the emperor Charles IV., of the house of Luxemburg. He was born in 1361,
                    and when three years of age was crowned as his father’s successor in Bohemia. In
                    1376 he was elected king of the Romans, and in 1378, on the death of Charles
                    IV., he mounted the Bohemian and German thrones. He repeatedly thought of going
                    to Rome to receive the imperial crown, but this intention was never fulfilled.
                    During his reign there was great confusion both in church and state, and he was
                    wholly powerless to cope with the forces of disorder. Although not without a
                    rude sense of justice, he was of a rough and violent temper, and too fond of
                    pleasure to devote much attention to serious duty. The cities of Germany, in
                    which were some of the best elements of the national life, had been gradually
                    learning how to defend themselves by combining with one another against princes
                    and robber knights; and a wise king or emperor might with their aid have
                    succeeded in re-establishing the authority of the crown. Wenceslaus, however,
                    never understood the importance of the cities, and missed every opportunity of
                    winning their friendship. At a diet in Nuremberg in 1383 an attempt was made to
                    secure the public peace, but the cities, knowing that their liberties were
                    threatened, gave no heed to the measures adopted by the diet. In 1381 the
                    Rhenish cities had formed a confederation, and notwithstanding the threats of
                    Wenceslaus had united with the Swabian League, which was regarded with fear and
                    hatred by most of the southern princes. The battle of Sempach, in which the
                    Swiss confederates gained a decisive victory over the house of Hapsburg, greatly
                    encouraged the cities, but in 1388 a powerful coalition was formed against them,
                    and at the battle of Döffingen their troops suffered so crushing a defeat that
                    they were rendered incapable of further resistance. At a diet held in Eger in
                    1389 public peace was therefore proclaimed, and the cities of Swabia, the Rhine
                    country, Alsace, the Wetterau, Franconia, and Bavaria were ordered, on pain of
                    the king’s displeasure, to dissolve their alliances. This really meant that the
                    princes had both the king and the towns at their mercy. Wenceslaus was not more
                    successful in his native kingdom Bohemia than in Germany. In 1393, in the course
                    of a struggle with the archbishop of Prague, he shocked both friends and enemies
                    by the murder of the vicargeneral John of Pomuk, who, after being subjected to
                    torture, was bound and thrown into the river Moldau. With all his faults,
                    Wenceslaus was sincerely anxious to check the violence of the Bohemian nobles.

                    whom Brandenburg had been given in pledge by Sigismund, the brother of
                    Wenceslaus, they found a powerful friend and leader. Wenceslaus was taken
                    prisoner in 1394, and kept for some months in close confinement, and he was set
                    free only when the German princes threatened that if he were detained the
                    conspirators would be treated as enemies of the empire. He was unable to recover
                    more than the appearance of power, and in 1395 he made himself an object of
                    general contempt by selling to John Galeazzo Visconti, of Milan, the dignity of
                    a duke of Lombardy. After the defeat of his brother Sigismund, king of Hungary,
                    at Nicopolis, Wenceslaus came to an understanding with Jobst, to whom he gave
                    Brandenburg in fief; and he afterwards tried to assert authority in Germany by
                    summoning a diet at Frankfort, where, early in 1398, public peace was once more
                    proclaimed. But Wenceslaus could not now undo the results of his indolence and
                    incapacity, and when, in association with the king of France, he supported a
                    plan for the deposition of Popes Boniface IX. and Benedict XIII., and for the
                    assembling of a general council, the spiritual electors and Rupert, elector of
                    the Palatinate, resolved that he himself should be deposed. These electors met
                    at Oberlahnstein, and on the 20th August 1400 a decree depriving Wenceslaus of
                    the German crown was read by the elector of Mainz as chancellor of the empire.
                    The decree was informal, but Wenceslaus was not in a position to set it aside,
                    and Rupert of the Palatinate was elected king in his stead. Fresh troubles had
                    overtaken him in Bohemia, and in 1402 he was made prisoner by his brother
                    Sigismund, who kept him in confinement for nineteen months. After his release he
                    was not less arbitrary than before, and he caused much discontent by encouraging
                    the disciples of Huss, whom he supported, not apparently because he cared for
                    their doctrines, but because he found it convenient to use them as an instrument
                    against the clergy. On the death of Rupert in 1410 Wenceslaus, while retaining
                    the title of king of the Romans, resigned his claims to the imperial dignity in
                    favour of Sigismund, who was elected to the German throne. Wenceslaus died of a
                    stroke of apoplexy on the 16th August 1419.</p>
