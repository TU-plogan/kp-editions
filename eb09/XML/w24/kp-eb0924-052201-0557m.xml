                    estuary. The harbour affords splendid accommodation for shipping, but its
                    advantages have been in great part lost by a bar at its mouth preventing the
                    entrance of vessels drawing more than 12 feet. The construction of a pier at
                    Rosslare connected with Wexford by a railway has, however, proved of great
                    benefit. The town -consists of the quay, about 1000 feet in length, with' two
                    narrow streets running parallel with it, and other smaller ones branching off at
                    intervals. Some remains of the old walls and flanking towers still exist. The
                    Protestant Episcopal church, near the ruins of the ancient abbey of St
                    Sepulchre, is said to occupy the spot where the treaty was signed between the
                    Irish and their English invaders in 1169. The principal modern buildings are the
                    town-hall, the theatre, the court-house, the barracks, occupying the site of the
                    ancient castle, St Peter’s College for the education of Catholic clergy, the
                    county infirmary, the union workhouse, and a number of convents. The port has
                    communication by steamer with Liverpool and Bristol. In 1886 the number of
                    vessels that entered the port was 847 of 85,004 tons, the number that cleared
                    836 of 84,065 tons. The principal exports are agricultural produce, live stock,
                    and whisky. Shipbuilding is carried on, and also tanning, malting, brewing,
                    iron-founding, distilling, and the manufacture of artificial manure, flour,
                    agricultural implements, and rope and twine. The population of the town in 1871
                    was 12,077, and in 1881 it was 12,163.</p>
                <p>' Wexford was one of the earliest colonies of the English, having been taken by
                    Fitzstephen. It was the second town that Cromwell besieged in 1649. It was
                    garrisoned for William III. in 1690. In 1798 it was made the headquarters of the
                    rebels, who, however, surrendered it on the 21st June. Iu 1318 the town received
                    a charter from Aldomar de Valence, which was extended by Henry IV. in 1411, and
                    confirmed by Elizabeth in 1558. By James 1. it was in 1608 made a free borough
                    corporate, by the title of “the town and free borough corporate of Wexford.” It
                    returned two members to parliament from 1374 till the Union, when they were
                    reduced to one. In 1885 it was included in the South Division of the county.</p>
