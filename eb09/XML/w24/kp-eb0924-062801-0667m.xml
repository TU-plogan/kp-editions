                    painter and satirist under the pseudonym of <hi rend="smallcaps">Peter
                    Pindar,</hi> was son of Alexander Wolcot, surgeon atDodbrooke, adjoining
                    Kingsbridge, in Devonshire, and was baptized there 9th May 1738. He was educated
                    at Kingsbridge free school under John Morris, at the Bodmin grammar school, and
                    in France, and as the result of this training was well acquainted with Greek and
                    Latin, and spoke French with facility. For seven years he was apprenticed to his
                    uncle, John Wolcot, a surgeon at Fowey, and it was intended that he should in
                    due course succeed to the practice. Among his uncle’s patients were Sir William
                    Treiawny and his household, at Treiawne, near Fowey, and when Treiawny went to
                    Jamaica as governor in 1769 he was accompanied by Wolcot, who had now qualified
                    as M.D. of the university of Aberdeen (8th September 1767). Considerable
                    ecclesiastical patronage was in the gift of the governor of Jamaica, and, to
                    render himself eligible for any desirable living which might fall vacant, Wolcot
                    returned to England, and was ordained deacon on 24th June 1769 and priest on the
                    following day. With these qualifications he once more repaired to the West
                    Indies, andin 1772 became incumbent of Vere, Jamaica, but on the death of his
                    patron (11th December 1772) he bade adieu to the colony, and on his arrival in
                    England settled as a physician at Truro. Party politics ran high in that
                    borough, and Wolcot threw himself into the fray, making an especial butt of an
                    influential merchant, afterwards the representative of Truro in parliament. In
                    consequence of those indiscretions he left in 1779, and in 1781 he fixed his
                    permanent abode in London. He brought with him the young Cornish artist John
                    Opie, whose talents in painting received the enthusiastic admiration of the
                    doctor. Wolcot exerted himself energetically in spreading the fame of his young
                    protegé by puffs in the papers and by introductions to the leaders of
                    fashion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="italic">Opie and his Works,</hi> by J. Jope Rogers.</p><p/></note> From
                    this date he dropped the profession of medicine, as he had previously thrown off
                    his clerical orders, and earned the means of subsistence by his satirical
                    productions. Wolcot had long dabbled in poetry. His first effusion, on the
                    recovery of the elder Pitt from gout, is said to have appeared in <hi
                    rend="italic">Martin's Magazine,</hi> about 1756, when he was resident at Fowey,
                    and he dictated verses until within a few days of his death. Many of his serious
                    pieces were marked by taste and feeling, and his translation of Thomas Warton’s
                    Latin epigram on sleep dwells in the memory through its happy simplicity. After
                    his settlement in London he threw off with marvellous rapidity a succession of
                    pungent satires. George III. was his favourite subject of ridicule, and his
                    peculiarities were described or distorted in <hi rend="italic">The Lousiad,
                    Peeps at St James's, The Royal Visit to Exeter.</hi> Two of Wolcot’s happiest
                    satires on the “farmer king” depicted the royal survey of Whitbread’s brewery
                    and the king’s wonder how the apples got into the apple dumplings. The most
                    entertaining biography which the English language has yet produced was ridiculed
                    in <hi rend="italic">An Epistle to James Boswell,</hi> and in a piece on the
                    rival biographers, happily called <hi rend="italic">Bozzy and Piozzi.</hi> The
                    leading man of science and the adventurous traveller fell under his lash,—the
                    former in <hi rend="italic">Sir Joseph Banks and the Emperor of Morocco,</hi>
                    and the latter in a <hi rend="italic">Complimentary Epistle to James Bruce.</hi>
                    When Wolcot came to London with his rough artistic genius from the west his hand
                    was directed against the painters of the day who had already established their
                    reputation, and his <hi rend="italic">Lyric Odes to the Academicians</hi> often
                    turned their modes of painting into a jest with marvellous effect. Wolcot was
                    himself no mean artist, and in 1797 there was published <hi rend="italic">Six
                    Picturesque Views from Paintings by Peter Pindar, engraved by</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Alken.</hi> His knowledge of the art of painting lent force to his
                    strictures on the academicians of the age. In 1795 he disposed of his works to
                    the booksellers for an annuity of £250 a year, which he lived to enjoy for many
                    more years than the purchasers expected or desired. His various pieces were
                    published in 1796 in four octavo volumes, and they were often reprinted. His
                    satires are said to have exercised such an effect on public opinion that the
                    ministers pressed upon him a Government pension, on condition that he refrained
                    from any further attacks on the king’s peculiarities; but it is also asserted
                    that he speedily declined to accept it any longer, and that he even returned the
                    moneys which he had received. Like many another ridiculer of the idiosyncracies
                    of others he was himself very susceptible to criticism, and for some attacks
                    made on him by Gifford, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly
                    Review,</hi> he attempted to belabour his satirical opponent in Wright’s shop in
                    Piccadilly, but Gifford was too quick for him, and Wolcot was soundly thrashed.
                    He died at Latham Place, Somer’s Town, London, on 14th January 1819, and seven
                    days later was buried near Samuel Butler, the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hudibras,</hi> in the vestry vault in the churchyard of St Paul’s, Covent
                    Garden.</p>
                <p>Polwhele, the Cornish historian, was well acquainted with Wolcot in his early
                    life, and the best account of his residence in the west is found in vol. i. of
                    Polwhele’s <hi rend="italic">Traditions</hi> and in Polwhele’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biographical Sketches,</hi> vol. ii. Cyrus Redding was a frequent visitor at
                    the old man’s house, and has described Wolcot’s later days in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Past Celebrities,</hi> vol. i., and his <hi rend="italic">Fifty
                    Years’ Recollections,</hi> vols, i. and ii. John Taylor, “everybody’s Taylor,”
                    lived “on the most friendly footing with the doctor,” who figures in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Records of my Life.</hi> Wolcot’s humour was broad, and he cared
                    little whether he hit above or below the belt, but he had a keen eye for the
                    ridiculous, and was endowed with a wondrous facility of diction.</p>
