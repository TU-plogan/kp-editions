                    as privat-docent in the university of Leipsic, where he lectured till 1706, when
                    he was called as professor of mathematics to Halle. Before this time he had made
                    the acquaintance of Leibnitz, of whose philosophy his own system is a
                    modification. In Halle Wolff limited himself at first to mathematics, but on the
                    departure of a colleague he annexed physics, and presently included in his
                    lectures all the main philosophical disciplines. He followed the example of
                    Thomasius in lecturing in German instead of Latin. This fact, and the remarkable
                    clearness of his exposition, caused his class-rooms to be crowded. He also
                    became known as a writer to a wider circle, and was made member of the Royal
                    Society of London and the Academy of Berlin. But the claims which Wolff advanced
                    on behalf of the philosophic reason appeared impious to his theological
                    colleagues. Halle was the headquarters of Pietism, which, after a long struggle
                    against the rigidity of the older Lutheran dogmatism, had itself assumed the
                    characteristics of a new orthodoxy. This orthodoxy, represented by Joachim Lange
                    and A. H. Francke, considered the cause of supernaturalism endangered by a
                    philosophy which professed by the unassisted reason to present the whole
                    universe as a rational and necessarily determined system. Wolff’s professed
                    ideal was to base theological truths on evidence of mathematical certitude.
                    Personal grounds accentuated the bitterness. Strife broke out openly in 1721,
                    when Wolff, on the occasion of laying down the office of pro-rector, delivered
                    an oration “On the Moral Philosophy of the Chinese,” in which he praised the
                    purity of the moral precepts of Confucius, pointing to them as an evidence of
                    the power of human reason to attain by its own efforts to moral truth. The
                    attacks and accusations in connexion with this address were unsuccessful at the
                    time, but Wolff continued to give offence to his colleagues, and to Lange in
                    particular, by his action in the filling up of university chairs, and in 1723 a
                    disappointed pupil, a docent in the same university, published a hostile
                    criticism upon Wolff’s system, at the instigation, it is said, of Lange. This
                    was contrary to university etiquette and statute, and Wolff somewhat
                    injudiciously appealed to the Government for an interdict upon such attacks. He
                    succeeded in obtaining this, but his enemies retaliated by sending to court a
                    united representation of the dangerous character of his views. Through a
                    worthless courtier, they gained the ear of the king, Frederick William I., by a
                    concrete example, which touched him most nearly. If one of His Majesty’s famous
                    grenadiers at Potsdam should desert, the king would have no right, it was
                    represented, upon the principles of Wolff, to punish the man, seeing that he
                    only did what it was necessarily predetermined that he should do. The result of
                    this representation was swifter and more drastic than "Wolff’s bitterest enemies
                    had calculated on. On the 13th November 1723 a cabinet order arrived in Halle
                    deposing Wolff from his office, and commanding him to leave Halle and quit
                    Prussian territory within forty-eight hours on pain of a halter. The same day
                    Wolff passed into Saxony, and presently proceeded to Marburg, to which
                    university he had received a call before this crisis. The landgrave of <pb

                    distinction, and the circumstances of his expulsion drew universal attention to
                    his philosophy. It was everywhere discussed, and over two hundred books and
                    pamphlets appeared for or against it before 1737, not reckoning the systematic
                    treatises of Wolff and his followers. The seventeen years which Wolff spent at
                    Marburg witnessed the publication of his chief works, and the rise of his
                    philosophy to almost undisputed sway throughout Germany. His earlier treatises
                    were, like his lectures, composed in German :—a treatise on logic, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Vernünftige Gedanken</hi><hi rend="italic">von den</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Kräften des menschlichen Verstandes</hi> (1712); a meta physic,
                    <hi rend="italic">Vernünftige Gedanken von Gott, der Welt, und der Seele des
                    Menschen, auch aller Dinge überhaupt</hi> (1719); treatises on ethics and
                    politics with similar titles (1721); three on the philosophy of nature
                    (1723-4-5), followed by an encyclopaedic review of his system in 1726. From that
                    time he began to go over the same ground more fully and methodically in a series
                    of Latin works. The logic, ontology, cosmology, and empirical psychology
                    appeared between 1728 and 1732, followed by the rational psychology and natural
                    theology in 1734. Meanwhile, after some years the king of Prussia made overtures
                    to Wolff to return, and in 1739, by the irony of events, a cabinet order
                    prescribed the study of the Wolffian philosophy to all candidates for
                    ecclesiastical preferment. In 1740 Frederick William died suddenly, and one of
                    the first acts of his successor, Frederick the Great, was to recall Wolff to
                    Halle on the most flattering and advantageous terms. His entry into Halle on the
                    6th of December 1740 partook of the nature of a triumphal procession. In 1743 he
                    became chancellor of the university, and in 1745 he received the title of
                    “freiherr” from the elector of Bavaria. But, though he was thus loaded with
                    honours, and his philosophy everywhere triumphant, he found that he had outlived
                    his power of attracting the academic youth. His matter was no longer fresh, nor
                    were his own powers what they had been when he left Halle seventeen years
                    before, and he had the bitter experience of lecturing to empty class-rooms. He
                    died on the 9th April 1754, in the seventy-sixth year of his age, fourteen years
                    after his return to Halle.</p>
                <p>The Wolffian philosophy held almost undisputed sway in Germany till it was
                    displaced by the Kantian revolution. It is essentially a common-sense adaptation
                    or watering-down of the Leibnitian system; or, as we can hardly speak of a
                    system in connexion with Leibnitz, Wolff may be said to have methodized and
                    reduced to dogmatic form the thoughts of his great predecessor, which often,
                    however, lose the greater part of their suggestiveness in the process. Since his
                    philosophy disappeared before the influx of new ideas and the appearance of more
                    speculative minds, it has been customary to dwell almost exclusively on its
                    defects—the want of depth or freshness of insight, and the aridity of its
                    neoscholastic formalism, which tends to relapse into verbose platitudes. But
                    this is to do injustice to Wolff’s real merits. These are mainly his
                    comprehensive view of philosophy, as embracing in its survey the whole field of
                    human knowledge, his insistence everywhere on clear and methodic exposition, and
                    his confidence in the power of reason to reduce all subjects to this form. To
                    these must be added that he was practically the first to “teach philosophy to
                    speak German.” It will be seen that these merits concern the form rather than
                    the matter of philosophy, the latter being mainly derived from Leibnitz, with
                    some modifications in the sense of the older scholastic Aristotelian ism. The
                    Wolffian system retains the determinism and optimism of Leibnitz, but the
                    monadology recedes into the background, the monads falling asunder into souls or
                    conscious beings on the one hand and mere atoms on the other. The doctrine of
                    the pre-established harmony also loses its metaphysical significance, and the
                    principle of sufficient reason introduced by Leibnitz is once more discarded in
                    favour of the principle θf. contradiction which Wolfl' seeks to make the
                    fundamental principle of philosophy. Philosophy is defined by him as the science
                    of the possible, and divided, according to the two faculties of the human
                    individual, into a theoretical and a practical part. Logic, sometimes called <hi
                    rend="italic">philosophia rationalis,</hi> forms the introduction or
                    propaedeutic to both. Theoretical philosophy has for its parts ontology or <hi
                    rend="italic">philosophia</hi><hi rend="italic">prima,</hi> cosmology, rational
                    psychology, and natural theology; ontology treats of the existent in general,
                    psychology of the soul as a simple non-extended substance, cosmology of the
                    world as a whole, and rational theology of the existence and attributes of God.
                    These are best known to philosophical students by Kant’s treatment of them in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Critique</hi><hi rend="italic">of Pure Reason.</hi>
                    Practical philosophy is subdivided into ethics, economics, and politics. Wolff’s
                    moral principle is the realization of human perfection. (A. SE.)</p>
