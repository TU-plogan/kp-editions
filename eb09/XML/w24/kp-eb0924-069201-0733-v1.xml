                <p><label type="entry">WRIGHT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Silas</hi></label> (1795-1847),
                    was born at Amherst, Massachusetts, May 24, 1795. He graduated at Middlebury
                    College, Vermont, in 1815, was admitted to the bar in 1819, and began practice
                    at Canton, in northern New York. From the first he showed those characteristics
                    which finally made him a representative American Democratic leader. He had
                    settled in what was almost a wilderness. His farm was a small one, and no hired
                    labourer upon it worked harder than he. His manner of life was of the simplest.
                    In his professional work he was a type of the lawyer of the old school,—shrewd,
                    skilful, rigidly just, and controlled by the belief that his profession was a
                    public trust, and that judicial qualities must mingle with those of the
                    advocate. He seems never to have sought an office, and never to have felt at
                    liberty to refuse one, even that of village postmaster, if he could possibly
                    serve. He was appointed surrogate in 1820, and was elected successively to the
                    State senate in 1823, to the house of representatives in 1827-29, comptroller of
                    the State 1829-33, United States senator 1833-44, and governor of New York
                    1844-46. During his public life he had become a leader of the Democratic party
                    of New York, Van Buren being his closest associate. When the national Democratic
                    party in 1844 nominated and elected Polk to the presidency, instead of Van
                    Buren, Wright and the State organization took an attitude of armed neutrality
                    towards the new administration. Renominated for governor in 1846, Wright was
                    defeated, and the result was ascribed to the hostility of the Polk
                    administration. The death of the defeated candidate, at Canton, August 27, 1847,
                    gave intense bitterness to New York politics for several years; and his faction,
                    in 1848, succeeded in defeating their national party’s candidates in the
                    presidential election.</p>
                <p>Wright was one of a class of politicians which has influenced American
                    development largely, finding its most characteristic types in the State of New
                    York. It may be traced clearly from about 1820, beginning with what was then
                    known as “the Albany Regency,” including Dix, Marcy, Wright, Seymour, Tilden, to
                    Cleveland (president from 1885), and many of the new men who have come into the
                    national administration with him. Absolutely and punctiliously honest, devoted
                    to the public good, and believing intensely that the public good depended on the
                    political principles of their party, they have been prone to consider politics
                    as a warfare, and merciless exclusion of opponents from office as <hi
                        rend="superscript"> a</hi> legitimate war-weapon. One of their earliest
                    leaders, Marcy, declared the rule of party struggle, that “the spoils (of
                    office) belong to the victor”; the latest, President Cleveland, has been the
                    first to recognize the merit system of appointment in practice, Tilden having
                    already accepted it in theory. The sternness of Wright’s integrity in office was
                    illustrated in 1845, when the “antirent troubles” broke out again, and it seemed
                    probable that the votes of the disaffected would decide the coming election. The
                    governor asked and obtained from the legislature the power to suppress the
                    disturbance by armed force, ordered the militia into the disturbed district,
                    arrested the offenders, had them tried, convicted, and punished, and put an end
                    to what was really an insurrection. His defeat in 1846 was a transition from the
                    old to the new phase of American politics; but his name is still the
                    representative of all that was best in the old.</p>
                <p>Wright’s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> has been written by Jenkins, who also has a
                    sketch of him in his <hi rend="italic">Governors of New York·,</hi> but the best
                    biography of him is that of Hammond.</p>
