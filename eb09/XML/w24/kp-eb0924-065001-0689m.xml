                    for the table, on account of its flavour, as by the sportsman, who, from its

                    as well as the suddenness of its appearance and the irregularity of its flight,
                    thinks himself lucky when he has laid one low. Yet, under favourable conditions,
                    large bags of Woodcocks are made in many parts of Great Britain, and still
                    larger in Ireland, though the numbers are trifling compared with those that have
                    fallen to the gun in various parts of the European Continent, and especially in
                    Albania and Epirus. In England of old time Woodcocks were taken in nets and
                    springes, and, though the former method of capture seems to have been disused
                    for many years, the latter was practised in some places until nearly the middle
                    of the present century <hi rend="italic">(cf</hi> Knox, <hi rend="italic"

                    well enough known to need no minute description. Its long bill, short legs, and
                    large eyes—suggestive of its nocturnal or crepuscular habits—have over and over
                    again been the subject of remark, while its mottled plumage of black,
                    chestnut-and umber-brown, ashy-grey, buff, and shining white—the last being
                    confined to the tip of the lower side of the tail-quills, but the rest
                    intermixed for the most part in beautiful combination—could not be adequately
                    described within the present allotted space. Setting aside the many extreme
                    aberrations from the normal colouring which examples of this species
                    occasionally present (and some of them are extremely curious, not to say
                    beautiful), there is much variation to be almost constantly observed in the
                    plumage of individuals, in some of which the richer tints prevail while others
                    exhibit a greyer coloration. This variation is often, but not always accompanied
                    by a variation in size or at least in weight.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The difference in weight is very great,
                    though this seems to have been exaggerated by some writers. A friend who has had
                    much experience tells us that the heaviest bird he ever knew weighed 16∣ oz.,
                    and the lightest 9 oz. and a fraction.</p></note> The paler birds are generally
                    the larger, but the difference, whether in bulk or tint, cannot be attributed to
                    age, sex, season, or, so far as can be ascertained, to locality. It is,
                    notwithstanding, a very common belief among sportsmen that there are two
                    “species” of Woodcock, and many persons of experience will have it that, beside
                    the differences just named, the “little red Woodcock” invariably flies more
                    sharply than the other. However, a sluggish behaviour is not really associated
                    with colour, though it may possibly be correlated with weight —for it is quite
                    conceivable that a fat bird will rise more slowly, when flushed, than one which
                    is in poor condition. It may suffice here to say that ornithologists, some of
                    whom have taken a vast amount of trouble about the matter, are practically
                    unanimous in declaring against the existence of two “species” or even “races,”
                    and moreover in agreeing that the sex of the bird cannot be determined from its
                    plumage, though there are a few who believe that the young of the year can be
                    discriminated from the adults by having the outer web of the first quill-feather
                    in the wing marked with angular notches of a light colour, while the old birds
                    have no trace of this “vandyke” ornament. Careful dissections, weighings, and
                    measurings seem to shew that the male varies most in size; on an average he is
                    slightly heavier than the female, yet some of the lightest birds have proved to
                    be cocks.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Though there are probably few if any counties in the United Kingdom in which the
                    Woodcock does not almost yearly breed, especially since a ‘ ‘ close time” has
                    been afforded by the legislature for the protection of the species, there can be
                    no doubt that by far the greater number of those shot in the British Islands
                    have come from abroad,—mostly, it is presumed, from Scandinavia. These arrive on
                    the east coast in autumn—generally about the middle of October —often in an
                    exhausted and impoverished state. Most of them seem to cross the sea by night,
                    and at that season it is a brutal practice for men to sally forth and slaughter
                    the helpless and almost starving wanderers, who are often found seeking refuge
                    in any shelter that may present itself. If unmolested, however, they are soon
                    rested, pass inland, and, as would appear, in a marvellously short time recover
                    their condition. Their future destination seems to be greatly influenced by the
                    state of the weather. If cold or frost stop their supply of food on the eastern
                    side of Great Britain <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0690-0651"/> they press onward and, letting alone Ireland,
                    into which the immigrant stream is pretty constant, often crowd into the extreme
                    south-west, as Devonshire and Cornwall, and to the Isles of Scilly, while not a
                    few betake themselves to the unknown ocean, finding there doubtless a watery
                    grave, though instances are on record of examples having successfully crossed
                    the Atlantic and reaching Newfoundland, New Jersey, and Virginia. To return,
                    however, to the Woodcocks which breed in Britain, whose habits have been much
                    more frequently observed since the folly and cruelty of killing them in spring
                    has been recognized, and it may be hoped abandoned. Pairing takes place very
                    early in February and the eggs are laid often before the middle of March. These
                    are four in number, of a yellowish cream-colour blotched and spotted with
                    reddish-brown, and seldom take the pyriform shape so common among those of
                    Limicoliue birds. The nest—always made on the ground amid trees or underwood,
                    and usually near water or at least in a damp locality —is at first little more
                    than a slight hollow in the soil, but as incubation proceeds dead leaves are
                    collected around its margin until a considerable mass is accumulated. During
                    this season the male Woodcock performs at twilight flights of a remarkable kind
                    (c∕. <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 771), repeating evening after
                    evening (and it is believed at dawn also) precisely the same course, which
                    generally describes a triangle, the sides of which may be a quarter of a mile or
                    more long. On these occasions the bird’s appearance on the wing is quite unlike
                    that which it presents when hurriedly flying after being flushed, and though its
                    speed is great the beats of the wings are steady and slow. At intervals an
                    extraordinary sound is produced, whether from the throat of the bird, as is
                    commonly averred, or from the plumage is uncertain. To the present writer the
                    sound seems to defy description, though some hearers have tried to syllable it.
                    This characteristic flight is in some parts of England called “roading,” and the
                    track taken by the bird a “cock-road.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The etymology and consequently the correct spelling of these
                    expressions seem to be very uncertain. Some would derive the word from the
                    French <hi rend="italic">rider,</hi> to rove or wander, but others connect it
                    with the Scandinavian <hi rend="italic">rode,</hi> an open space in a wood (see
                    <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries,</hi> ser. 5, ix. p. 214, and ser. 6, viii.
                    pp. 523, 524). Looking to the regular routine followed by the bird, the natural
                    supposition would be that it is simply an application of the English word <hi
                    rend="italic">road</hi>; but of course natural suppositions are often wrong, and
                    they always require the support of evidence before acceptance.</p></note> In
                    England in former times advantage was taken of this habit to catch the simple
                    performer in nets called “cock-shutts,” which were hung between trees across the
                    open glades or rides of a wood, and in many parts of the Continent it still is,
                    or was till very lately, the disgraceful habit of persons calling themselves
                    sportsmen to lie in wait and shoot the bird as he indulges in his measured
                    love-flight. A still more interesting matter in relation to the breeding of
                    Woodcocks is the fact, asserted by several ancient writers, but for long doubted
                    if not disbelieved, and yet finally established on good evidence, that the old
                    birds transport their newly-hatched offspring, presumably to places where food
                    is more accessible. The young are clasped between the thighs of the parent,
                    whose legs hang down during the operation, while the bill is to some extent,
                    possibly only at starting, brought into operation to assist in adjusting the
                    load if not in bearing it through the air.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    performance.</p></note></p>
                <p>The Woodcock inhabits suitable localities across the northern part of the Old
                    World, from Ireland to Japan, migrating southward towards autumn. As a species
                    it is said to be resident in the Azores and other Atlantic Islands; but it is
                    not known to penetrate very far into Africa during the winter, though in many
                    parts of India it is abundant during the cold weather, and reaches even Ceylon
                    and Tenasserim. The popular belief that Woodcocks live “by suction” is perhaps
                    hardly yet exploded; but those who have observed them in confinement know that
                    they have an almost insatiable appetite for earthworms, which the birds seek by
                    probing soft ground with their highly sensitive and flexible bill.<note
