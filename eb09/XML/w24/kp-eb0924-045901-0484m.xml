                <p><label type="entry">WAX</label> is a solid fatty substance of animal and
                    vegetable origin, allied both in sources and constitution to the fixed oils and
                    fats. From fats or solid oils wax differs principally in its greater hardness
                    and higher melting-point; but in the strictly chemical sense, while oils and
                    fats are glycerides, a true wax contains no glycerin, but is a combination of
                    fatty acids with certain solid monatomic alcohols. Of wax from animal sources
                    there are in commerce beeswax, which forms wax <hi rend="italic">par
                    excellence,</hi> Chinese insect wax, and spermaceti. The more important
                    vegetable waxes are Japanese wax, myrtle-berry wax, carnauba wax, and palm
                    wax.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Beeswax</hi> is secreted by all honey bees, and by them formed
                    into the cell walls, &amp;c., of their comb. It is separated by draining the
                    honey, melting the drained comb in boiling water, and collecting the wax which
                    solidifies on the top as the water cools. In this state it is formed into cakes
                    of raw or yellow wax, good examples of which are of a light yellow colour,
                    translucent, with a faint pleasant odour of honey. At ordinary temperatures it
                    breaks with a granular fracture; and in thin flakes or pellets it softens with
                    the heat of the hand, and can be kneaded between the fingers. Its specific
                    gravity is 0⋅960; it melts at about 62° C., and solidifies just under its
                    melting-point without evolution of heat. It is soluble in hot ether, essential
                    and fixed oils, benzol, bisulphide of carbon, and chloroform, and to some extent
                    in boiling alcohol, but it is unaffected by water and cold alcohol. In chemical
                    constitution it contains 10 per cent. of cerin, an ether of cerotic acid and
                    ceryl alcohol, <hi rend="superscript"> 27</hi> ¾ <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>

                <p>matter and other contaminations it contains, is unfit for many uses. The chief of
                    these is candle-making. To remove soluble matter it is first melted over boiling
                    water; and for bleaching it is formed into thin shreds and strips so as to
                    expose the greatest possible surface. So prepared, it is spread out and
                    frequently watered and turned in the direct sunlight, a slow but effective
                    process. To hasten the bleaching action the wax may be mixed with about
                    one-sixth of pure spirit of turpentine; and this preparation, on exposure, by
                    its copious production of ozone, effects in four or five days a bleaching which
                    otherwise would occupy three or four weeks. When the bleaching is complete all
                    trace of turpentine oil will have disappeared. Bleaching may also be effected by
                    chlorine, permanganate of potash, and other chemicals, but these injuriously
                    affect the wax, in some cases forming substitution products which cannot be
                    removed, and which in burning give off deleterious fumes. Wax is obtained in all
                    parts of the world where there is vegetation sufficient to support bees; but it
                    is most largely forthcoming from tropical and subtropical regions. It is subject
                    to extensive adulteration from powdered mineral substances, flour, cheaper
                    waxes, paraffin, &amp;c. Its uses are multifarious; but it is most largely
                    consumed in making candles for the religious services of Roman Catholic and
                    Orthodox Greek Christians, and for wax figures and models (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Wax Figures).</hi><hi rend="italic">Chinese Insect Wax,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Be La,</hi> is a secretion deposited by an insect, <hi
                    rend="italic">Coccus ceriferus,</hi> Fabr., in the twigs of a species of ash,
                    <hi rend="italic">Fraxinus chinensis,</hi> Roxb. The wax is, in its origin and
                    the functions it performs in the insect economy, closely related to the lac
                    produced by the allied species of <hi rend="italic">Coccus</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lac,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 181). When separated from the twigs
                    which it encrusts, and purified, it is a hard translucent white crystalline
                    body, similar to spermaceti. It melts at from 82° to 86° C., and in composition
                    consists of cerin, one of the constituents of beeswax. It is little known in
                    European commerce, but forms a highly important article of trade in China and
                    Japan, where it is largely used for candlemaking and for medicinal purposes.</p>
                <p>For <hi rend="smallcaps">Spermaceti,</hi> see vol. xxii. p. 395.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Japanese Wax</hi> is a hard wax-like fat which now forms an
                    important export from Japan, principally to London. It is obtained from the
                    small stone fruits of several species of <hi rend="italic">Rhus</hi> cultivated
                    in Japan. For the extraction of the wax, which is present to the extent of about
                    20 per cent., the fruits are ground and treated by either of three methods—(1)
                    heating and pressure, (2) boiling in water, and (3) maceration with ether or
                    bisulphide of carbon. The wax is subsequently bleached, and as it comes into the
                    market consists of yellowish hard cakes, covered often with a fine white powdery
                    efflorescence. It has a resinous unpleasant rancid odour. It melts at about 54°
                    C., and solidifies from melting at 41° C. with evolution of heat which raises
                    the temperature about 5° C. Japanese wax becomes translucent about 12° C. under
                    its melting-point, and when it has newly solidified from melting it can again be
                    liquefied at 42° C., from which the melting-point rises by slow degrees with the
                    lapse of time till it reaches the normal. It is not a true wax, but consists
                    principally of the glyceride palmitin with small proportions of stearin and
                    disseminated crystals of free palmitic acid. It is largely mixed with and used
                    as a substitute for beeswax, excepting for uses where its rancidity renders it
                    objectionable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Myrtle-Berry Wax</hi> is obtained from the fruit of several
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Myrica</hi> in the United States, New Granada,
                    Venezuela, the Cape of Good Hope, and other regions. It is a hard greenish
                    substance, with a pleasant balsamic odour. Its melting-point is about 45° C.,
                    and it consists principally of free palmitic acid with a little stearic acid and
                    myristic acid,—a very small proportion of these being combined as glycerides. It
                    is consumed principally in the United States in combination with beeswax for
                    candles; and it is said the Hottentots eat it like cheese.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Carnauba Wax</hi> is an exudation on the surface of the growing
                    leaves of the carnauba palm, <hi rend="italic">Corypha cerifera,</hi> L., which
                    flourishes in tropical South America. The wax is obtained by cutting off and
                    drying the young leaves, from which it is then shaken as fine dust, and caked by
                    melting either over an open fire or in boiling water. It is a true wax,
                    consisting of ethers of myricyl alcohol and ceryl alcohol with cerotic acid, and
                    its melting-point ranges from 85° to 90° C. Carnauba wax is a substance of
                    considerable commercial importance in Brazil, whence large quantities are sent
                    to Europe for use in the candle-trade and otherwise as a substitute for
                    beeswax.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Palm-Tree Wax</hi> is an exudation formed on the stems of two
                    South American palms, <hi rend="italic">Ceroxylon andicola,</hi> H. and K., and

                    scraped from the trees and compacted by melting it is a mixture of resin and
                    wax, having a melting-point as high as 102° to 105° C. The pure wax may be
                    separated by digesting with boiling spirit, when it is obtained with a
                    melting-point of 72° C. and a composition analogous to carnauba wax, like which
                    it is used for candles. Palm-tree wax is little seen in European commerce.</p>
