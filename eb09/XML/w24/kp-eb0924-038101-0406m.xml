                <p><label type="entry">WARWICK, <hi rend="smallcaps">Richard Nevil, Earl
                    of</hi></label> (c. 1420-1471), was boru between 1420 and 1430. He was descended
                    from a family of note in the north of England, that of the Nevils, who enjoyed
                    for many generations the title of earls of Westmorland. His grandmother on the
                    father’s side was Joan, daughter of John of Gaunt. He inherited the title of
                    earl of Salisbury from his father, a younger son of Ralph Nevil, and by his
                    marriage with Anne, daughter of Richard Beauchamp, he became earl of Warwick.
                    His descent from John of Gaunt made him naturally a member of the Lancastrian
                    party, but the marriage of his aunt, Cicely Nevil, to Richard, duke of York,
                    connected him also with the Yorkist house. As first cousin of Edward IV. and
                    second cousin of Henry VI. he was well fitted for the double part which he was
                    destined to play in English history.</p>
                <p>When the struggle between the Roses began, he and his father threw in their lot
                    with the Yorkists. The first attempt of the duke of York (in 1450) to assert his
                    claims proved unsuccessful, but three years later the final loss of Guienne,
                    coupled with the king’s imbecility, enabled him to renew his efforts. The duke
                    became protector, but the king’s recovery drove him from power and forced him to
                    take up arms a second time. He was now joined actively by Warwick and his
                    father, the former of whom raised a body of troops and contributed largely to
                    the Yorkist victory at St Albans (1455). Warwick was rewarded for his services
                    with the governorship of Calais. This important post gave him the control of the
                    narrow seas, and supplied him with a harbour of refuge whither he could safely
                    retire in case of a change of affairs in England. In the latter capacity Calais
                    soon proved useful.</p>
                <p>In 1457, when Henry had recovered his senses, Warwick attended a council at
                    Coventry, at which he took an oath of fealty to the king. Next year he attended
                    a great meeting in London, summoned for the purpose of reconciling the two
                    parties. He was followed on this occasion by six hundred men clad in his livery,
                    and wearing red coats embroidered with ragged staves, the badge of the house of
                    Warwick. An apparent reconciliation was effected, but Warwick, accused of
                    misconduct in attacking a fleet of North Sea merchant-ships near Calais, took
                    advantage of an affray between his followers and some of the king’s men to
                    assert that a plot was laid against his life, and retired to his fortress across
                    the Channel. When in 1459 the duke of York took up arms for the third time,
                    Warwick and his father, the earl of Salisbury, joined him at Ludlow. The
                    confederates were strongly posted, but, being deserted by Sir Andrew Trollop,
                    they lost heart and dispersed, Salisbury and Warwick again taking refuge at
                    Calais. A parliament which met at Coventry now attainted Warwick and his father,
                    with other leaders, of high treason, and Somerset was sent to supersede Warwick
                    in his command. The latter, however, made a strong resistance, repelled
                    Somerset, and took his ships, after which he sailed to Dublin to concert further
                    measures with the duke of York. The results of this negotiation were seen early
                    in 1460, when the duke of York issued a manifesto to rouse the people against
                    the Government, and Warwick, landing in Kent, marched on London. The king
                    retired northward and intrenched himself at Northampton, where he was defeated
                    with much loss by Warwick, and taken prisoner. Warwick returned with his captive
                    to London, and the duke of York at once claimed the crown. After much debate the
                    king was induced to consent to a compromise, by which he was to retain the crown
                    during life, and the duke of York and his heirs were to succeed him. The queen,
                    however, refused to sanction this arrangement, and assembled an army in the
                    north. The duke of York, marching against her, was defeated and killed at
                    Wakefield (December 1460), and the earl of Salisbury was taken and beheaded
                    shortly after. The Yorkist victory of Mortimer’s Cross (1461) did not stop the
                    queen’s march on London, and Warwick, attempting to bar her progress, was
                    entirely defeated at the second battle of St Albans. The king fell into the
                    hands of his own party, but Warwick escaped. The Lancastrian triumph was,
                    however, short-lived. The citizens of London, already devoted to the house of
                    York, were exasperated by the excesses of the Lancastrian troops, and when
                    Warwick, with Edward, earl of March, raised another array and marched towards
                    the capital, the queen was forced to retire to the north. Warwick and Edward
                    entered the city, and the latter was proclaimed king under the title of Edward
                    IV. The sanguinary battle of Towton (March 1461), in which the victory was
                    greatly due to the skill and energy of Warwick, secured the crown for Edward,
                    and gave the nation peace for several years.</p>
                <p>Honours and emoluments were showered on Warwick. The governorship of Guisnes and
                    Dammes, with the lieutenancy of the marches there, was added to his command at
                    Calais; he became warden of the western marches towards Scotland, constable of
                    Dover, and lord high chamberlain. The revenue derived from these employments was
                    calculated at 80,000 crowns a year. His brother, John, Lord Montague, was made
                    earl of Northumberland and warden of the eastern marches, and his brother George
                    became archbishop of York and lord chancellor. For some time Warwick did his
                    best to maintain Edward on his throne. An attempt on the part of the
                    Lancastrians in 1463 to recover their power was put down by the united efforts
                    of the Nevils. Montague defeated Percy at Hedgley Moor and Somerset at Hexham,
                    while Warwick besieged and took Bamborough Castle, which was held by Sir Ralph
                    Grey. Soon afterwards Henry VI. was taken prisoner and was lodged by Warwick in
                    the Tower.</p>
                <p>But the power and ambition of Warwick were too great to allow the good
                    understanding between the king-maker and the king to be of long duration. The
                    first difference between them arose on the question of the king’s marriage. In
                    1464 Warwick was employed to treat for peace with France, and was anxious to
                    establish it on the firm basis of a matrimonial alliance. His plans were
                    frustrated by Edward’s marriage with Elizabeth Woodville. At this time Warwick
                    is said to have been negotiating for a marriage between the king and Bona of
                    Savoy, niece of Louis XI. According to another authority, the princess proposed
                    was Isabella of Castile. Whatever may be the truth of these reports, it is clear
                    that Edward’s marriage was not approved by Warwick, and that on the question of
                    foreign policy they followed divergent aims. The rapid advancement of the
                    queen’s family contributed to widen the breach. When in 1467 a marriage was
                    proposed between the king’s sister Margaret and Charles of Burgundy, Warwick,
                    true to his policy of reconciling England and France, vigorously opposed the
                    match, and suggested in its stead a marriage with a French prince. For a time
                    Edward seemed willing to yield, and Warwick was sent over to treat with the
                    French king. . He met him at Rouen, and was received with unusual marks of
                    respect. The result of the conference was that ambassadors were sent by Louis to
                    offer Edward a treaty on favourable terms. But the latter, who had already shown
                    his displeasure by depriving the archbishop of his chancellorship, rejected the
                    offer, and Warwick retired in disgust to one of his castles in the north.
                    Shortly afterwards the marriage between Charles and Margaret took place. An
                    apparent reconciliation between Edward and Warwick was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n407/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0407-0382"/> now effected, but its hollowness was shown by the
                    marriage of Isabella, eldest daughter of Warwick, with George, duke of Clarence,
                    a match which Edward strenuously but vainly opposed (1468). A period of intrigue
                    and insurrection followed. A rising in the north, under Robin of Redesdale, was
                    at first defeated by Montague, but the rebels were allowed to make head again.
                    They were soon joined by Warwick and his party, who, if they did not originate,
                    at all events encouraged the rebellion. Edward, whose troops were defeated at
                    Edgecote, fell into Warwick’s hands, and was removed to his castle at Middleham.
                    When, however, the Lancastrians took advantage of this state of affairs and rose
                    in arms, they were speedily put down by Warwick. Edward was released and a
                    formal reconciliation followed (1469).</p>
                <p>The situation had, however, by this time become intolerable. A fresh insurrection
                    broke out in Lincolnshire, and the confessions of the leaders, who were taken by
                    the royal troops, showed that it had been instigated by Clarence and Warwick.
                    The king at once marched against the conspirators, who in vain attempted to
                    collect sufficient forces, and with some difficulty escaped from the country.
                    Warwick made for his old stronghold at Calais, but his lieutenant proved
                    faithless, and turned his guns against him. Thereupon he took refuge at the
                    court of France and resolved to side openly with the Lancastrians. A treaty was
                    made between Warwick and Queen Margaret, which was cemented by the marriage of
                    Prince Edward with Warwick’s daughter Anne. This change of front naturally
                    caused a coolness between Warwick and Clarence; but, before the latter could
                    trim his course anew, Warwick, having obtained assistance from Louis XL, landed
                    in the south of England. Edward was taken by surprise, and, unable to make any
                    resistance, fled to Flanders. Warwick at once marched to London, released Henry
                    VI. from captivity, and replaced him on the throne. A general restoration of
                    property and position to the Lancastrians took place. Warwick and his brothers
                    resumed their offices, and Clarence was recognized as successor to the throne in
                    default of heirs-male to Henry VI. (1470).</p>
                <p>But this turn of fortune was as brief as it was sudden. The house of Lancaster
                    was finally overthrown by another revolution as capricious and inexplicable as
                    any of those which had already marked this extraordinary conflict. Henry VI. had
                    only been a few months on the throne when Edward, with the assistance of the
                    duke of Burgundy, landed in Yorkshire, and, gathering troops as he went, marched
                    upon London. He was joined by “false, fleeting, perjured” Clarence, and admitted
                    into the capital by Warwick’s brother the archbishop. On Easter-Day 1471 the
                    forces of the king and the earl met at Barnet, and the former won a complete
                    victory. The earl and his brother Montague were slain. Soon afterwards the
                    battle of Tewkesbury and the death of Prince Edward extinguished the last hopes
                    of the Lancastrian party.</p>
                <p>The career of the king-maker is chiefly remarkable as illustrating the grandeurs
                    and the evils of feudalism. Warwick’s landed property was enormous, comprising,
                    according to the deed by which his widow made it over to Henry VII., upwards of
                    110 manors in 21 counties, besides the city of Worcester, the islands of
                    Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, and Sark, and various places in Wales. Commynes
                    tells us that at Calais he was so popular that every one wore his badge, “no man
                    esteeming himself gallant whose head was not adorned with his ragged staff.”
                    Stow (<hi rend="italic">Annals)</hi> says that “at his house in London six oxen
                    were usually eaten at a breakfast, and every tavern was full of his meat, for
                    who that had any acquaintance in his family should have as much sodden and roast
                    as he could carry on a long dagger.” In a time of civil war and a disputed title
                    to the throne, such a man was naturally too strong for a subject. The
                    restoration of order and the maintenance of the sovereignty of the state
                    rendered inevitable the disappearance of the class so vigorously represented by
                    the “Last of the Barons.”</p>
