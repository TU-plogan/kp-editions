                    or Poems on Several Subjects never before Handled,</hi> 1685. He graduated B.A.
                    1688, was ordained priest 24th February 1689, and the following year was
                    presented to the living of South Ormsby, Lincolnshire. In 1697 he removed to
                    Epworth, Lincolnshire, where he died 25th April 1735. Among other works he was
                    the author of <hi rend="italic">Life of Christ</hi> (1693), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elegies on Queen Mary and Archbishop Tillotson</hi> (1695), <hi rend="italic"

                    published (1705) a long poem on <hi rend="italic">Marlborough, or the Fate of

                    Christ Church, Oxford, and on taking his M.A. degree returned to Westminster as
                    tutor. He lived on intimate terms with Harley, earl of Oxford, Pope, Swift, and
                    Prior, and wrote somewhat clever squibs against Sir Robert Walpole, the Whigs,
                    and the Low Church divines. They were collected and published 1736, reached a
                    second edition 1743, and were reprinted, with notes by James Nicholls and life
                    by W. Nicholls, in 1862. Wesley became master of Tiverton grammar-school in
                    1732, and died there 6th November 1739.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi> (1703-1791), brother of the preceding and founder
                    of Methodism, was born, probably at Epworth, 17th June (O.S., 28th N.S.) 1703.
                    There was a tradition in the family that he was christened John Benjamin, but he
                    never made use of the second name. When his father’s rectory was burnt down in
                    1709 he was for a time left in the building, and narrowly escaped death. He
                    entered Charterhouse in 1714, whence in 1720 he was elected to Christ Church,
                    Oxford. In 1726 he became fellow of Lincoln, and in 1727 graduated M.A. After
                    acting for some time as his father’s curate he settled in November 1729 at
                    Oxford, and began to take pupils. About the same time, along with his brother
                    Charles and others, he commenced that systematic course of religious life which
                    led to their being termed by the Oxonians Methodists. A full record of the
                    religious labours of Wesley is given under <hi rend="smallcaps">Methodism</hi>
                    (vol. xvi. pp. 185-189). In the organization of Methodism he displayed not only
                    extraordinary energy and capacity for work but remarkable administrative powers.
                    His oratory was colloquial, terse, and homely, but never vulgar, while his
                    expressive and refined features and intense yet reasoned earnestness enabled him
                    to acquire among his followers a personal influence of an unrivalled kind.
                    Although from overwork or exposure he had one or two serious illnesses, he
                    generally enjoyed robust health, an experience probably partly accounted for by
                    his constant journeys on horseback. In 1790 he said, “I do not remember to have
                    felt lowness of spirits for a quarter of an hour since I was born.” He preached
                    usually at 5 o’clock in the morning, and frequently twice again in the same day,
                    the number of sermons he delivered in a year being over 800. He continued his
                    labours almost to the last, but wrote, 1st January 1790, “I am now an old man
                    decayed from head to foot.” He died 2d March 1791. Wesley translated several
                    hymns from the German for the collections edited by him and his brother Charles,
                    but is not known to have been the author of any original hymns (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hymns,</hi> vol. xii. p. 594). The first collection of <hi
                    rend="italic">Psalms and Hymns</hi> edited by the brothers appeared anonymously
                    in 1738, and a <hi rend="italic">Collection of Moral and Sacred Poems, from the
                    Most Celebrated Authors,</hi> in 1744. Wesley has no claims to rank as a thinker
                    or even as a theologian, but within certain narrow limits was a skilful
                    controversialist. He was the author of <hi rend="italic">Primitive Physic</hi>
                    (1747), <hi rend="italic">Explanatory Notes on the New Testament (1755), Notes
                    on the Old and New Testaments</hi> (1764), <hi rend="italic">Doctrine of
                    Original Sin</hi> (1757), <hi rend="italic">Survey of the Wisdom of God in
                    Creation</hi> (1763), <hi rend="italic">Preservative against Unsettled Notions
                    in Religion</hi> (1770), and <hi rend="italic">A Calm Address to our American
                    Colonies (1775).</hi> He also edited the <hi rend="italic">Christian
                    Library,</hi> in fifty volumes. His <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> appeared in
                    1818, and an eleventh edition, with life by J. Beecham and preface by T.
                    Jackson, was published in 15 vols., 1856-57.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi> (1708-1788), brother of the preceding, was born
                    prematurely at Epworth, 18th December 1708. He entered Westminster school in
                    1716, was admitted a king’s scholar in 1721, and entered Christ Church, Oxford,
                    in 1726. He accompanied his brother John to Georgia in 1735 as secretary to the
                    managing committee, having been ordained priest a few days before leaving
                    England; but on account of a strong feeling of opposition manifested against him
                    in the religious communities of Frederica he left Georgia for England five
                    months after landing. To a serious illness which happened to him in February
                    1738 he attributed a moral change which he associated with conversion and a
                    conscious sense of pardon. He seconded his brother in his evangelizing labours
                    in England with unceasing diligence, and, although not possessing his brother’s
                    gifts of oratory and personal magnetism, contributed by his hymns an element of
                    success to the movement of prime and permanent importance. He published no fewer
                    than 4100 hymns of his own composition, and left about 2000 in manuscript.
                    Numerous editions both of the special and general collections of his hymns have
                    been published. Both as regards the number of his compositions and their various
                    excellences, he is entitled to the chief place among Methodist hymn writers (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Hymns,</hi><hi rend="italic">ut supra).</hi> He died 29th
                    March 1788. His <hi rend="italic">Sermons,</hi> with memoir, appeared in 1816; a
