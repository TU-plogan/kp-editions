                    grammar schools, but, being intended for his father’s profession, does not seem
                    to have addicted himself especially to the classics, or to have manifested
                    extraordinary proficiency in any study. He lost his father while a boy, and in
                    1714 he was articled to Mr Kirke, attorney at Great Markham, in Nottinghamshire,
                    and after serving his time with him returned to Newark with the intention of
                    practising as a solicitor. Whether he ever did seems uncertain, but a very short
                    time afterwards he is found studying Latin and Greek under the master of Newark
                    school, who frequently sat up till late at night with his pupil. In 1723 he was
                    ordained deacon by the archbishop of York, and on March 1, 1727, received
                    priest’s orders from the bishop of London. He had occupied the interval in
                    various literary labours, the most important being the notes he contributed to
                    Theobald’s edition of Shakespeare, and an anonymous pamphlet on a question which
                    had arisen concerning the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery. Warburton had
                    undertaken to answer another anonymous pamphlet, which proved to be the
                    composition of no less a person than Mr Yorke, afterwards Lord Chancellor
                    Hardwicke, and the impression which he made upon his antagonist was evinced by
                    the pains the latter took with his reply. He now received from Sir Robert Sutter
                    the small living of Griesley, in Nottinghamshire, exchanged next year for that
                    of Brant Broughton, in Lincolnshire, and was made an honorary M.A. of Cambridge.
                    Here for eighteen years he spent his time in intense study, the first result of
                    which was his celebrated treatise on the alliance between church and state,
                    published in 1736. The work was probably intended, and certainly admirably
                    adapted, to afford the ministry of the day an excuse for omitting to redeem
                    their promise to the Dissenters of freeing them from the bondage of the Test and
                    Corporation Acts. To this end the test is represented as the only possible means
                    of reconciling the principle of a religious establishment with that of a free
                    toleration, a piece of logic which, now that religious tests are no longer held
                    a qualification for civil office, would excite most opposition where it
                    originally gained most favour. It fully answered its temporary purpose, and
                    equally subserved the author’s real end by gaining him credit at court. It would
                    appear that he only missed immediate preferment by the death of Queen Caroline.
                    His next performance, the famous <hi rend="italic">Divine Legation of Moses
                    Demonstrated on the Principles af a Religious Deist,</hi> the first part of
                    which was published in 1738, will long preserve his name as the author of the
                    most daring and ingenious of theological paradoxes. The deists had made the
                    absence of any inculcation of the doctrine of a future life an objection to the
                    divine authority of the Mosaic writings. Warburton boldly admits the fact and
                    turns it against the adversary No human legislator, he contends, would have
                    omitted such a sanction of morality; <hi rend="italic">ergo,</hi> the
                    legislation was divine. It may be doubted whether the argument ever convinced
                    any one; and its cogency was not assisted by the multitude of minor paradoxes
                    with which it was interwoven, such as the identification of the scenery of the
                    sixth book of the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> with the exhibitions of the
                    Eleusinian mysteries. But the author’s extraordinary power, learning, and
                    originality were acknowledged on all hands, though he excited censure and
                    suspicion by a circumstance highly honourable to him, his tenderness to the
                    alleged heresies of Conyers Middleton. The second volume of the work appeared in
                    1741.</p>
                <p>Warburton’s next undertaking, though still theological, brought him into the
                    field of general literature. Either in quest of another paradox, or actually
                    unable to recognize the Spinozistic tendency of Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Essay
                    on Man,</hi> he entered upon its defence against Crousaz, in a series of
                    articles contributed to <hi rend="italic">The Republic of Letters.</hi> Whether
                    Pope had really understood the tendency of his own work has always been a
                    question, but there is no question that he was glad of an apologist, or that
                    Warburton’s <hi rend="italic">jeu d'esprit</hi> (for him it was hardly more) in
                    the long run did more for his fortunes than all his erudition. It occasioned a
                    sincere friendship between him and Pope, whom he persuaded to add a fourth book
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Dunciad,</hi> and substitute Cibber for Theobald as the
                    hero of the poem. Pope bequeathed him the copyright and the editorship of his
                    works, and contributed even more to his advancement by introducing him to
                    Murray, afterwards Lord Mansfield, who obtained for him the preachership of
                    Lincoln’s Inn, and to Ralph Allen, who, says Johnson, “gave him his niece and
                    his estate, and, by consequence, a bishopric.” The marriage took place in 1745,
                    and from that time Warburton resided principally at his father-in-law’s estate
                    at Prior Park, in Gloucestershire, which he inherited on Allen’s death in 1764.
                    In 1747 appeared his edition of Shakespeare, into which, as he expressed it,
                    Pope’s previous edition was melted down. He had previously entrusted notes and
                    emendations on Shakespeare to Sir Thomas Hanmer, whose unauthorized use of them
                    led to a warm controversy. Warburton was further kept busy by the attacks on his
                    <hi rend="italic">Divine Legation</hi> from all quarters, by a dispute with
                    Bolingbroke respecting Pope’s behaviour in the affair of Bolingbroke’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Patriot King,</hi> and (1750) by a work of more importance in
                    vindication of the alleged miraculous interruption of the rebuilding of the
                    temple of Jerusalem undertaken by Julian. Here again Warburton shows his
                    habitual intrepidity as a controversialist, and places himself upon ground where
                    few at the present day would care to follow him. His defence of revelation was
                    continued in his <hi rend="italic">View of Bolingbroke's Posthumous
                    Writings</hi> (1754), universally allowed to be a most masterly performance
                    Warburton’s manner of dealing with opponents would be in our day considered both
                    insolent and rancorous, but it did him no disservice in his own. In 1757 he was
                    made dean of Bristol, and in 1760 bishop of Gloucester.</p>
                <p>Mr Abbey characterizes Warburton as an inactive bishop, and the partial Hurd can
                    say no more than that “he performed the duties of his office with regularity,
                    but further than this he could not prevail with himself to go.” Nor did he ever
                    seek to shine in parliament. He continued, however, active with his pen, so long
                    as the infirmities of age allowed, collecting and publishing his sermons,
                    reprinting his principal works with large additions, toiling to complete the <hi
                    rend="italic">Divine Legation,</hi> the last book of which appeared after his
                    death, and writing (1762) a vigorous attack on Methodism under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Doctrine of Grace.</hi> Of this work his friend and biographer
                    Hurd says, with curious infelicity, “the sect will find a sort of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n392/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0392-0369"/> immortality in this discourse.” The reverse has
                    proved true, yet the book ranks among the author’s most powerful productions. He
                    also engaged in a keen controversy with Bishop Lowth on the book of Job, which
                    even his admiring biographer wishes forgotten. His last important act was to
                    found, in 1768, the Warburtonian lecture, “to prove the truth of revealed
                    religion from the completion of the prophecies in the Old and New Testament
                    which relate to the Christian church, especially to the apostacy of Papal Rome.”
                    “On the right determination of the prophecies relating to Antichrist,” he said,
                    “one might rest the whole truth of the Christian religion,”—another opinion
                    which finds little support in the 19th century. The principal authority for his
                    latter years is his correspondence with his friend Bishop Hurd, an important
                    contribution to the literary history of the period. After the death of his only
                    son in 1776 he fell into a lethargic languor, which was terminated by death on
                    June 7, 1779.</p>
                <p>Warburton was undoubtedly a great man, but his intellect, marred by wilfulness
                    and the passion for paradox, has effected no result in any degree adequate to
                    its power. He disdained to persuade unless he could at the same time astonish,
                    and in endeavouring to amaze he has failed to convince. None of the propositions
                    with which his name is chiefly connected have found acceptance with posterity,
                    and while abundantly demonstrating his own learning he has failed to make any
                    considerable addition to the stock of human knowledge, or to leave any signal
                    mark on the history of opinion. He was rather a gladiator than a warrior, an
                    exhibitor of brilliant fence leading to no definite end. Though always faithful
                    to his convictions, he argued for victory rather than truth, and wasted upon
                    advocacy powers which would have produced great results if they had been
                    employed in serious and dispassionate investigation. His rude and arrogant style
                    of controversy deserved and received severe reprehension; it was at all events
                    free from pettiness and malignity; and his faults were in general those of an
                    aspiring and magnanimous nature. He was a warm and constant friend, and gave
                    many proofs of gratitude to his benefactors. As an editor and critic he
                    displayed much force of mind, but his standard of research was not high, and his
                    literary taste was that of the 18th century. (R. G.)</p>
