                    the N.W. by Holland. Its greatest length from north to south is 110 miles, its
                    greatest breadth is 124 miles, and its total area is 7800 square miles.</p>
                <p>The Lippe, an affluent of the Rhine, flowing from east to west across the
                    province, divides it into two parts, dissimilar in their character. The northern
                    portion, a continuation of the plain of the Netherlands, is flat, with the
                    exception of the east, which is occupied by the M <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>
                    ^eser Hills. South of the Lippe, on the other hand, the province is occupied by
                    numerous small chains and groups of hills, enclosing many beautiful valleys.
                    Between the parallel courses of the Lippe and Ruhr stretches the low chain of
                    the Haar or Haarstrang (850-1050 feet), which is steep on its southern face, but
                    slopes gradually down on the north to the valley of the Lippe, known as the
                    Hellweg. The rugged mountain district south of the Ruhr is known as the
                    Sauerland, and its eastern portion, the plateau of Winterberg, is the highest
                    part of the province. The culminating point is the Astenberg (2760 feet). This
                    plateau is connected with the M <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> esterwald on the
                    southwest border by the Rothhaar or Rothlagergebirge. Westphalia is divided
                    between the basins of the Rhine, Ems, and Weser. The Rhine itself does not touch
                    Westphalia, but its affluents, the Lippe and Ruhr, are the leading <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0552-0517"/> streams in the province. The Ems, entering
                    Westphalia from Lippe, flows north-west and enters Hanover. The Weser crosses
                    the north-east of the province, piercing the Weser Hills by means of the narrow
                    pass known as the Porta Westphalica or Westphalian Gate. All these streams are
                    navigable for barges and small vessels. There are no lakes in the province. The
                    climate is on the whole temperate, though sometimes the winters are severe among
                    the mountains.</p>
                <p>About 42 per cent, of the surface is given up to agriculture, 25 per cent, to
                    pastures and moors; 28 per cent, is under wood; and the remainder is
                    unproductive. The fertility of the soil varies; it is most unfertile in the
                    north and north-east. A great proportion of the land is in the hands of small
                    farmers and peasant proprietors, who as a class are well-to-do, though their
                    system of farming is in some respects antiquated. Grain of various kinds is
                    grown, though not in sufficient quantity to meet the demands of the province;
                    potatoes, pease and beans, fruit, and tobacco are also produced; but perhaps the
                    most important crops are hemp and flax, which places Westphalia among the
                    leading flax-producing districts of Germany. The forests are chiefly on the
                    mountains of the Sauerland, and in the south generally. Considerable numbers of
                    cattle and pigs are reared, the latter yielding the well-known Westphalian hams;
                    goats are also numerous in some districts; and Government pays some attention to
                    the breeding of horses in this province. Sheep are comparatively few. (Compare
                    the agricultural statistics under <hi rend="smallcaps">Prussia.)</hi></p>
                <p>In virtue of its abundant coal and iron Westphalia is one of the busiest
                    industrial quarters of Germany. There are coal-fields in the north and in other
                    districts, and the great coal-field of the Ruhr extends into the province. The
                    district of Arnsberg, occupying the south of the province, is the centre of the
                    mineral industry. Dortmund gives name to one of the five mining districts into
                    which Prussia is officially divided. Westphalia produces more iron ore than any
                    other province in Prussia except the Rhine province and Silesia; next to Silesia
                    it produces the most zinc, and next to Saxony the most copper; and it yields
                    more sulphur than any other province. Argentiferous lead, antimony, limestone,
                    gypsum, marble, and slates are also worked. There are seven salt-works and
                    numerous mineral springs.</p>
                <p>The mineral wealth of the province encourages an extensive manufacturing
                    industry, the leading branches of which are linenweaving and iron-working. The
                    linen industry is very ancient, and since the 14th century has flourished in
                    this province between the Lippe and Weser. Its chief centre is now Bielefeld,
                    which also manufactures jute. The cotton factories of Münster are important.
                    Woollens, stockings, and ribbons are also manufactured to some extent. The
                    principal seats of the metallic industries are Iserlohn, Lüdenscheid, Altena,
                    Hagen, and the “Enneper Strasse,” a valley 7 miles long and three quarters of a
                    mile wide, lying along the Ennepe and containing as its chief towns Haspe (7318
                    inhabitants) and Gevelsberg (7055). Cast and wrought iron, steel, rails, wire,
                    blades and tools, machinery and small iron and steel goods, bronze, brass, and
                    plated articles are among the leading products. Vitriol, glass, and paper are
                    also made. An active trade is carried on in the manufactured goods, and in
                    timber, hams, and sausages. The leading commercial towns are Bielefeld,
                    Iserlohn, and Dortmund. Minden has a port on the Weser; Beverungen is the centre
                    of the corn trade; and Paderborn is the chief wool-market. The roads are good,
                    and the railways numerous and convenient.</p>
                <p>The population in 1885 was 2,202,726, or 282 per square mile. About 52 per cent,
                    are Roman Catholics, most of whom are found in the southern district of
                    Arnsberg. About 46⅜ per cent, are Protestants, the remainder are Jews and
                    others. Education is well attended to. The seat of government is at Münster; and
                    the province is divided into the three districts of Minden, Münster, and
                    Arnsberg. It has thirty-one members in the Prussian parliament, and seventeen in
                    the imperial diet.</p>
                <p>Westphalia was the name given to the western portion of the early duchy of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Saxony</hi> (vol. xxi. p. 351). When Henry the Lion fell under
                    the ban of the empire his Saxon domains were distributed by the emperor. The
                    Sauerland and some other parts of Westphalia fell to the archbishops of Cologne,
                    who afterwards received from Frederick Barbarossa the title of dukes of
                    Westphalia and Angria. The northern portion of the original Westphalia became
                    the nucleus of the circle of Westphalia in Maximilian’s administrative
                    organization of the empire, while the duchy of Westphalia, as an apanage of
                    Cologne, was included in the scattered circle of the Lower Rhine. The circle of
                    Westphalia embraced, roughly speaking, what is now Oldenburg, Hanover to the
                    west of the Weser, the districts of Münster and Minden, and a few other
                    territories, an area of about 27,000 square miles, which in Maximilian’s time
                    was divided among four bishoprics and innumerable small secular states with an
                    aggregate population of about 3,000,000. The peace of Lunéville in 1801
                    transferred all parts of this circle west of the Rhine to France, while in 1803
                    the duchy of Westphalia was granted to the duke of Hesse-Nassau as compensation
                    for his former possessions to the west of the Rhine, which had also been added
                    to France.</p>
                <p>In 1807 Napoleon constituted the kingdom of Westphalia and gave it to his
                    youngest brother Jerome. It comprised all the Prussian provinces as far east as
                    the Elbe, and extended south to Fulda and the Thuringian states, embracing an
                    area of about 14,880 square miles, with a population of 2,000,000. Nearly the
                    whole of Hanover was added to this kingdom in 1810; but next year Napoleon again
                    took away the greater part, as well as other territories, leaving, however,
                    17,740 square miles, with 2,057,000 inhabitants. This kingdom was intended to
                    take the lead in the Confederation of the Rhine. After the battle of Leipsic in
                    1813 the kingdom of Westphalia was abolished, and things reverted to their
                    previous order until the congress of Vienna rearranged the map of Europe, when
                    Westphalia as we now understand the term λvas assigned to Prussia.</p>
                <p>The peace of Westphalia, concluded in 1648 at Osnabrück and Münster, put an end
                    to the Thirty Years’ War (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Germany,</hi> vol. X. p.
                    501).</p>
