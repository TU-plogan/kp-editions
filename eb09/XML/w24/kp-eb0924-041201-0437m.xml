                    apprenticed to one Morgan, in whose service he remained for twelve months. From
                    a child he had been extremely delicate, and the hard work and frugal living of
                    his London pupilage taxed his strength so severely that he was forced at the end
                    of a year to seek rest at home, not, however, until he had gained a fair
                    knowledge of the trade and become handy in the use of tools. Before going to
                    London he had made acquaintance with some of the professors in Glasgow college,
                    and on his return to Scotland in 1756 he sought them out and obtained work in
                    repairing astronomical instruments. He next tried to establish himself as an
                    instrument maker in Glasgow, but the city guilds would not recognize a craftsman
                    who had not served the full term of common apprenticeship, and Watt was
                    forbidden to open shop in the burgh. The college, however, took him under its
                    protection, and in 1757 he was established in its precincts with the title of
                    mathematical-instrument maker to the university.</p>
                <p>Before many months Black, the discoverer of latent heat, then lecturer on
                    chemistry, and Robison, then a student, afterwards professor of natural
                    philosophy, became his intimate friends, and with them he often discussed the
                    possibility of improving the steam-engine, of which at that time Newcomen’s was
                    the most advanced type. The engine was then applied only to pumping
                    water,—chiefly in the drainage of mines; and it was so clumsy and wasteful of
                    fuel as to be but little used. Some early experiments of Watt in 1761 or 1762
                    led to no positive result, but in 1764 his attention was seriously drawn to the
                    matter by having a model of Newcomen’s engine, which formed part of the college
                    collection of scientific apparatus, given him to repair. Having put the model in
                    order, he was at once struck with its enormous consumption of steam, and set
                    himself to examine the cause of this and to find a remedy.</p>
                <p>In Newcomen’s engine the cylinder stood vertically under one end of the main
                    lever or “beam” and was open at the top. Steam, at a pressure scarcely greater
                    than that of the atmosphere, was admitted to the under side; this allowed the
                    piston to be pulled up by a counterpoise at the other end of the beam.
                    Communication with the boiler was then shut off, and the steam in the cylinder
                    was condensed by injecting a jet of cold water from a cistern above. The
                    pressure of the air on the top of the piston then drove it down, raising the
                    counterpoise and doing work. The injection water and condensed steam which had
                    gathered in the cylinder were drained out by a pipe leading down into a
                    well.</p>
                <p>Watt at once noticed that the alternate heating and cooling of the cylinder in
                    Newcomen’s engine made it work with tedious slowness and excessive consumption
                    of steam. When steam was admitted at the beginning of each stroke, it found the
                    metal of the cylinder and piston chilled by contact with the condensed steam and
                    cold injection water of the previous stroke, and it was not until much steam had
                    been condensed in heating the chilled surfaces that the cylinder was able to
                    fill and the piston to rise. His first attempt at a remedy was to use for the
                    material of the cylinder a substance that would take in and give out heat
                    slowly. Wood was tried, but it made matters only a little better, and did not
                    promise to be durable. Watt observed that the evil was intensified whenever, for
                    the sake of making a good vacuum under the piston, a specially large quantity of
                    injection water was supplied.</p>
                <p>He then entered on a scientific examination of the properties of steam, studying
                    by experiment the relation of its density and pressure to the temperature, and
                    concluded that two conditions were essential to the economic use of steam in a
                    condensing steam-engine. One was that the temperature of the condensed steam
                    should be as low as possible, 100° F. or lower, otherwise the vacuum would not
                    be good; the other was, to quote his own words, “that the cylinder should be
                    always as hot as the steam which entered it.” In Newcomen’s engine these two
                    conditions were incompatible, and it was not for some months that Watt saw a
                    means of reconciling them. Early in 1765, while walking on a Sunday afternoon in
                    Glasgow Green, the idea flashed upon him that, if the steam were condensed in a
                    vessel distinct from the cylinder, it would be practicable to make the
                    temperature of condensation low, and still keep the cylinder hot. Let this
                    separate vessel be kept cold, either by injecting cold water or by letting it
                    stream over the outside, and let a vacuum be maintained in the vessel. Then,
                    whenever communication was made between it and the cylinder, steam would pass
                    over from the cylinder and be condensed; the pressure in the cylinder would be
                    as low as the pressure in the condenser, but the temperature of the metal of the
                    cylinder would remain high, since no injection water need touch it. Without
                    delay Watt put this idea to the test, and found <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n438/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0438-0413"/> that the separate condenser did act as he had
                    anticipated. To maintain the vacuum in it he added another new organ, namely,
                    the air-pump, the function of which is to remove the condensed steam and water
                    of injection along with any air that gathers in the condenser.</p>
                <p>To further his object of keeping the cylinder as hot as the steam that entered
                    it, Watt supplemented his great invention of the separate condenser by several
                    less notable but still important improvements. In Newcomen’s engine a layer of
                    water over the piston had been used to keep it steam-tight; Watt substituted a
                    tighter packing lubricated by oil. In Newcomen’s engine the upper end of the
                    cylinder was open to the air; Watt covered it in, leading the piston rod through
                    a steam-tight stuffing-box in the cover, and allowed steam instead of air to
                    press on the top of the piston. In Newcomen’s engine the cylinder had no
                    clothing to reduce loss of heat by radiation and conduction from its outer
                    surface; Watt not only cased it in non-conducting material, such as wood, but
                    introduced a steam-jacket, or layer of steam, between the cylinder proper and an
                    outer shell. All these features were specified in his first patent, in words
                    which have been quoted in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Steam-Engine,</hi>
                    vol. xxii. p. 475 <hi rend="italic">(q.v).</hi></p>
                <p>This patent was not obtained till January 1769, nearly four years after the
                    inventions it covers had been made. In the interval Watt had been striving to
                    demonstrate the merits of his engine by trial on a large scale. His earliest
                    experiments left him in debt, and, finding that his own means were quite
                    insufficient to allow him to continue them, he agreed that Dr Roebuck, founder
                    of the Carron iron-works, should take two-thirds of the profits of the invention
                    in consideration of his bearing the cost. An engine was then erected at Kinneil,
                    near Linlithgow, where Roebuck lived, and this gave Watt the opportunity of
                    facing many difficulties in details of construction. But the experiments made
                    slow progress, for Roebuck’s affairs became embarrassed, and Watt’s attention
                    was engaged by other work. He had taken to surveying, and was fast gaining
                    reputation as a civil engineer. In 1767 he was employed to make a survey for a
                    Forth and Clyde canal, —a scheme which failed to secure parliamentary sanction.
                    This was followed during the next six years by surveys for a canal at Monkland,
                    for another through the valley of Strathmore from Perth to Forfar, and for
                    others along the lines afterwards followed by the Crinan and Caledonian Canals.
                    He prepared plans for the harbours of Ayr, Port-Glasgow, and Greenock, for
                    deepening the Clyde, and for building a bridge over it at Hamilton. In the
                    course of this work he invented a simple micrometer for measuring distances,
                    consisting of a pair of horizontal hairs placed in the focus of a telescope,
                    through which sights were taken to a fixed and movable target on a rod held
                    upright at the place whose distance from the observer was to be determined. The
                    micrometer was varied in a number of ways; and another fruit of his ingenuity
                    about the same time was a machine to facilitate drawing in perspective.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the engine had not been wholly neglected. Watt had secured his patent;
                    the Kinneil trials had given him a store of valuable experience; Roebuck had
                    failed, but another partner was ready to take his place. In 1768 Watt had made
                    the acquaintance, through his friend Dr Small, of Matthew Boulton, a man of
                    energy and capital, who owned the Soho engineering works at Birmingham. Boulton
                    agreed to buy Roebuck’s share in the invention, and to join Watt in applying to
                    parliament for an Act to prolong the term of the patent. The application was
                    successful. In 1775 an Act was passed continuing the patent for twenty-five
                    years. By this time the inventor had abandoned his civil engineering work and
                    had settled in Birmingham, where the manufacture of steam-engines was begun by
                    the firm of Boulton and Watt. The partnership was a singularly happy one.
                    Boulton had the good sense to leave the work of inventing to Watt, in whose
                    genius he had the fullest faith; on the other hand, his substantial means, his
                    enterprise, resolution, and business capacity, supplied what was wanting to
                    bring the invention to commercial success.</p>
                <p>During the next ten years we find Watt assiduously engaged in developing and
                    introducing the engine. Its first and for a time its only application was in
                    pumping; it was at once put to this use in the mines of Cornwall, where Watt was
                    now frequently engaged in superintending the erection of engines. Further
                    inventions were required to fit it for other uses, and these followed in quick
                    succession. Watt’s second steam-engine patent is dated 1781. It describes five
                    different methods of converting the reciprocating motion of the piston into
                    motion of rotation, so as to adapt the engine for driving ordinary machinery.
                    The simplest way of doing this, and the means now universally followed, is by a
                    crank and fly-wheel; this had occurred to Watt but had meanwhile been patented
                    by another, and hence he devised the “sun and planet wheels” and other
                    equivalent contrivances. A third patent, in 1782, contained two new inventions
                    of the first importance. Up to this time the engine had been single-acting; Watt
                    now made it double-acting; that is to say, both ends of the cylinder, instead of
                    only one, were alternately put in communication with the boiler and the
                    condenser. Up to this time also the steam had been admitted from the boiler
                    throughout the whole stroke of the piston; Watt now introduced the system of
                    expansive working, in which the admission valve is closed after a portion only
                    of the stroke is performed, and the steam enclosed in the cylinder is then
                    allowed to expand during the remainder of the stroke, doing additional work upon
                    the piston without making any further demand upon the boiler until the next
                    stroke requires a fresh admission of steam. He calculated that, as the piston
                    advanced after admission had ceased, the pressure of the steam in the cylinder
                    would fall in the same proportion as its volume increased,—a law which, although
                    not strictly true, does accord very closely with the actual behaviour of steam
                    expanding in the cylinder of an engine. Recognizing that this would cause a
                    gradual reduction of the force with which the piston pulled or pushed against
                    the beam, Watt devised a number of contrivances for equalizing the effort
                    throughout the stroke. He found, however, that the inertia of the pump-rods in
                    his mine engines, and the fly-wheel in his rotative engines, served to
                    compensate for the inequality of thrust sufficiently to make these contrivances
                    unnecessary. His fourth patent, taken out in 1784, describes the well-known
                    “parallel motion,” an arrangement of links by which the top of the piston-rod is
                    connected to the beam so that it may either pull or push, and is at the same
                    time guided to move in a sensibly straight line. “I have started a new hare,” he
                    writes to Boulton in June of that year; “I have got a glimpse of a method of
                    causing a piston-rod to move up and down perpendicularly by only fixing it to a
                    piece of iron upon the beam, without chains or perpendicular guides or
                    untowardly frictions, arch-heads, or other pieces of clumsiness. I think it a
                    very probable thing to succeed, and one of the most ingenious simple pieces of
                    mechanism I have contrived.”</p>
                <p>Still a later invention was the throttle-valve and centrifugal governor, by which
                    the speed of rotative engines was automatically controlled. One more item in the
                    list of Watt’s contributions to the development of the steam-engine is too
                    important to be passed without mention: the indicator, which draws a diagram of
                    the relation of the steam’s pressure to its volume as the stroke proceeds, was
                    first used by Boulton and Watt to measure the work done by their engines, and so
                    to give a basis on which the charges levied <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n439/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0439-0414"/> from their customers were adjusted. It would be
                    difficult to exaggerate the part which this simple little instrument has played
                    in the evolution of the steam-engine. The eminently philosophic notion of an
                    indicator diagram is fundamental in the theory of thermodynamics; the instrument
                    itself is to the steam-engineer what the stethoscope is to the physician, and
                    more, for with it he not only diagnoses the ailments of a faulty machine,
                    whether in one or another of its organs, but gauges its power in health.</p>
                <p>The commercial success of the engine was not long in being established. By 1783
                    all but one of the Newcomen pumping-engines in Cornwall had been displaced by
                    Watt’s. The mines were then far from thriving; many were even on the point of
                    being abandoned through the difficulty of dealing with large volumes of water;
                    and Watt’s invention, which allowed this to be done at a moderate cost, meant
                    for many of them a new lease of life. His engine used no more than a fourth of
                    the fuel that had formerly been needed to do the same work, and the Soho firm
                    usually claimed by way of royalty a sum equivalent to one-third of the saving—a
                    sum which must have been nearly equal to the cost of the fuel actually consumed.
                    Rival manufacturers came forward, amongst whom Bull and Hornblower are the most
                    conspicuous names. They varied the form of the engine, but they could not avoid
                    infringing Watt’s patent by the use of a separate condenser. When action was
                    taken against them on that ground, they retaliated by disputing the validity of
                    the fundamental patent of 1769. In the case of Boulton and Watt <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Bull the court was divided on this point, but in an action
                    against Hornblower the patent was definitely affirmed to be valid by a unanimous
                    finding of the Court of King’s Bench. This was in 1799, only a year before the
                    monopoly expired, but the decision enabled the firm to claim a large sum as
                    arrears of patent dues. In connexion with these trials Watt himself, as well as
                    his early friends Black and Robison, drew up narratives of the invention of the
                    steam-engine, which are of much interest to the student of its history.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Another narrative of the
                    utmost interest was written by Watt in 1814 in the form of a footnote to
                    Robison’s article “Steam-Engine,” from the fourth edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica,</hi> which Watt revised before it was
                    reprinted in the collected edition of Robison’s works. See Robison’s <hi

                <p>Before Watt’s time the steam-engine was exclusively a steampump, slow-working,
                    cumbrous, and excessively wasteful of fuel. His first patent made it quick in
                    working, powerful, and efficient, but still only as a steam-pump. His later
                    inventions adapted it to drive machinery of all kinds, and left it virtually
                    what it is today, save in three respects. In respect of mechanical arrangement
                    the modern engine differs from Watt’s chiefly in this, that the beam, an
                    indispensable feature in the early pumping-engines, and one which held its place
                    long after the need for it had vanished, has gradually given way to more direct
                    modes of connecting the piston with the crank. Another difference is in the
                    modern use of high-pressure steam. It is remarkable that Watt, notwithstanding
                    the fact that his own invention of expansive working must have opened his eyes
                    to the advantage of high-pressure steam, declined to admit it into his practice.
                    He persisted in the use of pressures that were little if at all above that of
                    the atmosphere. His rivals in Cornwall were not so squeamish. Trevithick
                    ventured as far as 120 lb on the square inch, and a curious episode in the
                    history of the steam-engine is an attempt which Boulton and Watt made to have an
                    Act of Parliament passed forbidding the use of high pressure on the ground that
                    the lives of the public were endangered. The third and only other respect in
                    which a great improvement has been effected is in the introduction of compound
                    expansion. Here, too, one cannot but regret to find the Soho firm hostile,
                    though the necessity of defending their monopoly makes their action natural
                    enough. Hornblower had in fact stumbled on the invention of the compound engine,
                    but as his machine employed Watt’s condenser it was suppressed, to be revived
                    after some years by Woolf. In one of his patents (1784) Watt describes a
                    steam-locomotive, but he never prosecuted this, and when Murdoch, his chief
                    assistant (famous as the inventor of gas-lighting), made experiments on the same
                    lines, Watt gave him little encouragement. The notion then was to use a
                    steam-carriage on ordinary roads; its use on railways had not yet been thought
                    of. When that idea took form later in the last years of Watt’s life, the old man
                    refused to smile upon his offspring; it is even said that Watt put a clause in
                    the lease of his house that no steam-carriage should on any pretext be allowed
                    to approach it.</p>
                <p>On the expiry in 1800 of the Act by which the patent of 1769 had been extended,
                    Watt gave up his share in the business of engine-building to his sons, James,
                    who carried it on along with a son of Boulton for many years, and Gregory, who
                    died in 1804. The remainder of his life was quietly spent at Heathfield
                    Hall,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>His workroom at
                    Heathfield (now in the possession of Mr</p><p>Tangye) has been preserved full of
                    his tools and models of his inventions. These are described, along with other
                    Watt relics now at South Kensington, in an interesting paper by Mr E. A. Cowper,

                    near</p>
                <p>Birmingham, where he devoted his time, with scarcely an interruption, to
                    mechanical pursuits. His last work was the invention of machines for copying
                    sculpture,—one for making reduced copies, another for taking facsimiles by means
                    of a light stiff frame, which carried a pointer over the surface of the work
                    while a revolving tool fixed to the frame alongside of the pointer cut a
                    corresponding surface on a suitable block. We find him in correspondence with
                    Chantrey about this machine not many months before his death, and presenting
                    copies of busts to his friends as the work “of a young artist just entering on
                    his eighty-third year.” His life drew to a tranquil close, and the end came at
                    Heathfield on the 19th of August 1819. His remains were interred in the
                    neighbouring parish church of Handsworth.</p>
                <p>Watt was twice married,—first in 1763 to his cousin Miss Miller, who died ten
                    years later. Of four children born of the marriage, two died in infancy; another
                    was James, who succeeded his father in business; the fourth was a daughter who
                    lived to maturity, but died early, leaving two children. His second wife, Miss
                    Macgregor, whom he married before settling in Birmingham in 1775, survived him;
                    but her two children, Gregory and a daughter, died young.</p>
                <p>Some of Watt’s minor inventions have been already noticed. Another, which has
                    proved of great practical value, was the lettercopying press, for copying
                    manuscript by using <hi rend="italic">a</hi> glutinous ink and pressing the
                    written page against a moistened sheet of thin paper. He patented this in 1780,
                    describing both a roller press, the use of which he seems to have preferred in
                    copying his own correspondence, and also the form of screw press now found in
                    every merchant’s office.</p>
                <p>In the domain of pure science Watt claims recognition not only as having had
                    ideas greatly in advance of his age regarding what is now called energy, but as
                    a discoverer of the composition of water. Writing to Priestley in April 1783,
                    with reference to some of Priestley’s experiments, he suggests the theory that "
                    water is composed of dephlogisticated air and phlogiston deprived of part of
                    their latent or elementary heat.” It is difficult to determine the exact meaning
                    attached to these antiquated terms, and to say how far Watt’s suggestion
                    anticipated the fuller discovery of Cavendish. Watt’s views were communicated to
                    the Royal Society in 1783, Cavendish’s experiments in 1784, and both are printed
                    in the same volume of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi></p>
                <p>The early and middle part of Watt’s life was a long struggle with poor health:
                    severe headache prostrated him for days at a time; but as he grew old his
                    constitution seems to have become more robust. His disposition was despondent
                    and shrinking; he speaks of himself, but evidently with unfair severity, as "
                    indolent to excess.” “I am not enterprising,” he writes; “I would rather face a
                    loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain; in short, I find myself
                    out of my sphere when I have anything to do with mankind.” He was a man of warm
                    friendships, and has left a personal memorial of the greatest interest in his
                    numerous letters to Dr Small and others. They are full of sagacity and insight:
                    his own achievements are told with a shrewd but extremely modest estimate of
                    their value, and in a style of remarkable terseness and lucidity, lightened here
                    and there by a touch of dry humour. In his old age Watt is described by his
                    contemporaries as a man richly stored with the most various knowledge, full of
                    anecdote, familiar with most modern languages and their literature, a great
                    talker. Scott speaks of “the alert, kind, benevolent old man, his talents and
                    fancy overflowing on every subject, with his attention alive to every one’s
                    question, his information at every one’s command.”</p>
