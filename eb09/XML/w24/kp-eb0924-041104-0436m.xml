                    Westmorland, and was the son of the master of the grammar school of that place.
                    He was entirely educated by his father, who sent him in 1754 to Trinity College,
                    Cambridge, with “a considerable stock of classical learning, a spirit of
                    persevering industry, and an obstinate provincial accent.” He was elected a
                    fellow of Trinity in 1760, and about the same time had the offer of the post of
                    chaplain to the factory at Bencoolen. “You are too good,” said the master of
                    Trinity, “to die of drinking punch in the torrid zone,” and Watson, instead of
                    becoming, as he had flattered himself, a great Orientalist, remained at home to
                    be elected professor of chemistry, a science of which he did not at the time
                    possess the simplest rudiments. “I buried myself,” he says, “in my laboratory,
                    and in fourteen months read a course of chemical lectures to a very full
                    audience.” Not the least of his services λvas to procure an endowment for the
                    chair, which served as a precedent in similar instances.</p>
                <p>In 1771 he became a candidate for the regius professorship of divinity, and at
                    the age of thirty-four gained what he calls “the first place for honour in the
                    university,” “and,” he adds, “exclusive of the mastership of Trinity College, I
                    have made it the first for profit. I found it not worth £330 a year; it is now
                    (1814) worth £1000 at the least.” He did not entirely renounce the study of
                    chemistry: in 1768 he had published <hi rend="italic">Institutiones
                    Metal-lurgicae,</hi> intended to give a scientific form to chemistry by
                    digesting facts established by experiment into a connected series of
                    propositions. In 1781 he followed this up with a volume of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chemical Essays,</hi> which Davy told De Quincey remained as late as 1813,
                    after all recent discoveries, unsurpassed as a manual of introductory
                    discipline. But on the day on which he composed his preface he burned all his
                    chemical manuscripts, and never returned to the subject. His course as professor
                    of divinity was no less decisive. “I reduced the study of divinity into as
                    narrow a compass as I could, for I determined to study nothing but my Bible.” He
                    produced several anonymous pamphlets on the liberal side in the subscription
                    controversy and other topics of the day, and some sermons, one of which was
                    thought likely to have involved him in a prosecution, but which, Dunning said,
                    contained “just such treason as ought to be preached once a month at St
                    James’s.” It is said to have prevented his obtaining the provostship of Trinity
                    College, Dublin. In 1776 he answered Gibbon’s chapters on Christianity, and had
                    the honour of being one of the only two opponents whom Gibbon treated with
                    respect. In 1781 he was prostrated with a malignant fever, from the effects of
                    which he never wholly recovered, and which served as an excuse for that neglect
                    of many duties which remains the chief stain upon his character. He had always
                    opposed the American War, and when the accession of Lord Shelburne to power in
                    1782 afforded the then unfrequent opportunity of advancing a Liberal in politics
                    and religion to a bishopric, Watson was made bishop of Llandaff, being permitted
                    to retain his other preferments on account of the poverty of the see. Shelburne,
                    he says, expected great service from him as a pamphleteer, but Watson proved
                    from the ministerial point of view a most impracticable prelate. He immediately
                    brought forward a scheme for improving the condition of the poorer clergy by
                    equalizing the incomes of the bishops, the reception of which at the time may be
                    imagined, though it was substantially the same as that carried into effect by
                    Lord Melbourne’s Government fifty years later. Watson now found that he
                    possessed no influence with the minister, and that he had destroyed his chance
                    of the great object of his ambition, promotion to a better diocese. Neglecting
                    both his see and his professorship, to which latter he appointed a deputy
                    described as highly incompetent, he withdrew to Calgarth Park, in his native
                    county, where he occupied himself largely in forming plantations and the
                    improvement of agriculture. He nevertheless frequently came forward as a
                    preacher and a speaker in the House of Lords, but his only very conspicuous
                    appearance before the public was his warm support of the prince of Wales’s
                    unqualified claim to the regency on the insanity of the king in 1788, which
                    completed his disgrace at court. In 1796 he published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apology for the Bible,</hi> in answer to Thomas Paine, at <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n437/mode/1up"

                    It was most effective in its day; in ours Christianity would hardly be attacked
                    or defended by the arms employed by either disputant. Undismayed by the
                    displeasure of the court, or perhaps hoping to overcome it, Watson continued to
                    exert his pen with vigour, and in general to good purpose, denouncing the slave
                    trade, advocating the union with Ireland, and offering financial suggestions to
                    Pitt, who seems to have frequently consulted him. In 1798 his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Address to the People of Great Britain,</hi> enforcing resistance to French
                    arms and French principles, ran through fourteen editions, but estranged him
                    from many old friends, who accused him, probably with injustice, of aiming to
                    make his peace with the Government. In 1807 the advent of a Whig ministry almost
                    brought the coveted preferment within reach. Had Dr Markham died a few months
                    sooner Watson would have been archbishop of York. Such a disappointment might
                    palliate the querulous strain of his conversation and published references to
                    himself, though it could not render it dignified or decorous. De Quincey,
                    however, who knew the bishop personally in his latter years, while severely
                    criticizing his complaints, allows that his temper had not been soured by
                    disappointment. “His lordship was a joyous, jovial, and cordial host.” He died
                    on July 2, 1816, having occupied his latter years in the composition and
                    revision of an autobiography, which, with all its egotism and partiality, is a
                    valuable work, and the chief authority for his life.</p>
                <p>As an advocate of liberal principles in church and state, Watson stands almost
                    alone among the prelates of his day; and it cannot be said that his longing for
                    preferment, violent and unbecoming as it was, seduced him into mean actions or
                    unworthy compliances. His character is high enough to make it cause for regret
                    that it should stand no higher, as it easily might if he had possessed a nicer
                    sense of dignity and had not measured success so exclusively by the attainment
                    of wealth and station. Hard-headed and pushing, he yet had an intellectual
                    conscience; the two main elements of his character stood in each other’s way: he
                    failed as a courtier, and did not leave a wholly unblemished reputation as a
                    patriot. As a bishop he neither was nor endeavoured to. be anything; as an
                    ecclesiastical statesman it was his misfortune to have been born fifty years too
                    soon. His massive but unoriginal intellect is justly characterized by De Quincey
                    as “robust and commonplace.” (R. G.)</p>
