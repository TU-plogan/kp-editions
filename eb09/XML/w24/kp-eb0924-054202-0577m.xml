                    the Celtic inhabitants of Ireland and Scotland; and its manufacture and use
                    still continue to be closely associated with these two countries. Distilled
                    spirit first became popularly known as aqua vitae, and it was originally used
                    only as a powerful medicinal agent. It was not till about the middle of the 17th
                    century that it came into use in Scotland as an intoxicating beverage. In August
                    1655 the town council of Glasgow issued regulations for persons who should
                    “brew, sell, and tap ail and acquavitae,” and in 1656 the town treasurer was
                    indemnified for “aquavytie sent to ane friend.” In 1660 an excise duty was first
                    imposed on “acquavitae” consumed in England; but not till the year 1684 was any
                    record kept of the quantities on which duty was charged. In that year duty was
                    paid on the considerable quantity of 527,492 gallons. The consumption thereafter
                    rose with great rapidity, reaching one million gallons at the end of the
                    century, and in 1743 the enormous quantity of 8,200,000 gallons was consumed.
                    Meantime the evils of the traffic had induced the legislature to pass, in 1736,
                    the Gin Act (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gin)</hi> with the view of checking the
                    demoralization attendant on the drinking habits of the people. It was
                    principally in the form of gin that distilled spirits were consumed in England;
                    but gin is nothing else than a rectified and specially flavoured variety of
                    whisky. In Scotland and Ireland the attempts of the excise authorities to
                    control the distillation of whisky, and to derive revenue from it, led to
                    unlimited smuggling and open evasion of the law, and it was not till well into
                    the 19th century that efficient regulations and energetic supervision brought
                    the traffic in these countries under public control. Indeed illicit distillation
                    is still extensively practised in Ireland, where the detections average more
                    than eight hundred yearly.</p>
                <p>It is not easy at the present day to define whisky. Originally it was made from
                    malted barley, the fermented wort from which was distilled in the common
                    pot-still (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Distillation,</hi> vol. vii. p. 264); but
                    with the introduction of the Coffey and other continuous stills, which yield a
                    “silent” or flavourless spirit, it has become possible to prepare alcoholic
                    liquor, which is sold as whisky, from any cereal grain, malted or unmalted, and
                    from potato starch, grape sugar, and numerous other starch and sugar yielding
                    substances. As a rule, however, whisky is made from grain, and by preference
                    from barley, malted or raw. The bulk of the whisky made in the United Kingdom
                    can be separated into three classes. (1) Malt whisky is the product of malted
                    barley alone, distilled in the ordinary pot-still. Its flavour is partly due to
                    the circumstance that the malt is dried over a peat fire; and a spirit so
                    prepared constitutes the pure Highland malt whisky of Scotland. (2) Grain
                    whisky, under which heading comes the bulk of the Irish whisky of commerce, is
                    made in the pot-still, principally from raw barley, with only a small proportion
                    of malted barley to favour the transformation of starch into sugar in the
                    preparation of the wort. (3) Plain spirit is produced from barley, rice, and
                    other cereals distilled in the Coffey patent still. Plain spirit forms the basis
                    from which gin, British brandy, and other rectifier’s drinks are prepared; and
                    it is used for blending with other flavoured pot-still spirits, to produce a
                    certain character of potable spirit sold by wholesale dealers and known by
                    special blend names. It is only the finer qualities of matured malt and grain
                    whisky that can be used as single or unblended spirit. In the United States
                    whisky is distilled chiefly from corn and rye, wheat and barley malt being used,
                    though only to a limited extent. When spirit is distilled as whisky, it retains
                    the natural principles which impart an agreeable flavour to the beverage; for
                    the fusel oil, which is contained in alcohol, and is acrid to the taste and
                    stupefying in its effects, is to a great extent extracted. Whisky is greatly
                    improved by age; it is not mellow, nor its flavour agreeable, until it is
                    several years old. In its original state it is almost colourless, but it derives
                    a reddish hue from the wood of the barrels into which it is drawn, the inner
                    surfaces of which are usually charred to facilitate the colouring.</p>
                <p>In the financial year ending 31st March 1886 there were in England 10
                    distilleries, in Scotland 127, and in Ireland 27. The quantity of spirits
                    distilled in that year in the United Kingdom was 38,961,842 gallons; the number
                    of gallons consumed as beverage was 26,342,851 (England 15,290,816, Scotland
                    6,297,365, Ireland 4,754,670); the quantity exported was 2,808,198 gallons; and
                    the stock held in bonded stores at the end of 1885 was 64,405,817 gallons. The
                    total excise revenue from the manufacture, sale, and consumption of British
                    spirits was £13,140,695, a considerable decrease on previous years; and
                    distilled spirits are now a steadily declining source of public income.</p>

                <p>Distilled spirits in the United States are the principal, and an increasing,
                    source of internal revenue. In the fiscal year ending 30th June 1887 there were
                    in the United States 969 grain distilleries; and the quantity of spirits
                    distilled in that year (including whisky, alcohol, high-wines, and cologne or
                    neutral spirits, and excluding fruit-brandy) was 77,831,599 »allons. The stock
                    of spirits remaining in bonded warehouse on 30tn June 1887 was 65,145,269
                    gallons. The total revenue from the manufacture and sale of distilled spirits
                    for the fiscal year ending 30th June 1887 was $65,829,322. This includes the tax
                    upon whisky, fruit-brandy, alcohol, high-wines, cologne spirits, and rum. The
                    revenue from the manufacture of whisky alone was $2,263,718,070.</p>
