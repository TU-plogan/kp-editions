                <p><label type="entry">WALLIS, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1616-1703),
                    an eminent English mathematician, logician, and grammarian, was born on the 23d
                    November 1616 at Ashford, in Kent, of which parish his father was then
                    incumbent. Having been previously instructed in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, he was
                    in 1632 sent to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and afterwards was chosen fellow of
                    Queen’s College. Having been admitted to holy orders, he left the university in
                    1641 to act as chaplain to Sir William Darley, and in the following year
                    accepted a similar appointment from the widow of Sir Horatio Vere. It was about
                    this period that he displayed surprising talents in deciphering the intercepted
                    letters and papers of the Royalists. His adherence to the Parliamentary party
                    was in 1643 rewarded by the living of St Gabriel, Fenchurch Street, London. In
                    1644 he was appointed one of the scribes or secretaries of the Assembly of
                    Divines at Westminster. During the same year he married Susanna Glyde, and thus
                    vacated his fellowship; but the death of his mother had left him in possession
                    of a handsome fortune. In 1645 he attended those scientific meetings which led
                    to the establishment of the Royal Society. When the Independents obtained the
                    superiority, Wallis adhered to the Solemn League and Covenant. The living of St
                    Gabriel he exchanged for that of St Martin, Ironmonger Lane; and, as rector of
                    that parish, he in 1648 subscribed the Remonstrance against putting Charles I.
                    to death. Notwithstanding this act of opposition, he was in June 1649 appointed
                    Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford. In 1654 he there took the degree of
                    D.D., and four years later succeeded Dr Langbaine as keeper of the archives.
                    After the Restoration he was named one of the king’s chaplains in ordinary.
                    While complying with the terms of the Act of Uniformity, Wallis seems always to
                    have retained moderate and rational notions of ecclesiastical polity. He died at
                    Oxford on the 28th of October 1703, in the eighty-seventh year of his age.</p>
                <p>The works of Wallis are numerous, and relate to a multiplicity of subjects. His
                        <hi rend="italic">Institutio Logicae,</hi> published in 1687, was very
                    popular, and in his <hi rend="italic">Grammatica Linguae Anglicanae</hi> we find
                    indications of an acute and philosophic intellect. The mathematical works are
                    published some of them in a small 4to volume, Oxford, 1657, and a complete
                    collection in three thick folio volumes, Oxford, 1695-93-99. The third volume
                    includes, however, some theological treatises, and the first part of it is
                    occupied with editions of treatises on harmonics and other works of Greek
                    geometers, some of them first editions from the MSS., and in general with Latin
                    versions and notes (Ptolemy, Porphyrius, Briennius, Archimedes, Eutocius,
                    Aristarchus, and Pappus). The second and third volumes include also two
                    collections of letters to and from Brouncker, Frenicle, Leibnitz, Newton,
                    Oldenburg, Schooten, and others; and there is a tract on trigonometry by
                    Caswell. Excluding all these, the mathematical works contained in the first and
                    second volumes occupy about 1800 pages. The titles in the order adopted, but
                    with date of publication, are as follows:—“Oratio Inauguratis,” on his

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica Infinitorum</hi> relates chiefly to the
                    quadrature of curves by the so-called method of indivisibles established by
                    Cavalieri, 1629. and cultivated in the interval by him, Fermat, Descartes, and
                    Roberval. The method is substantially that of the integral calculus; thus, <hi

                        rend="italic">n</hi> indefinitely large, is=⅓. The case of the general
                    parabola <hi rend="italic">y = x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> m</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">(m</hi> a positive integer or fraction), where the area is
                        1/(<hi rend="italic">m</hi> +1), had been previously solved. Wallis made the
                    important remark that the reciprocal of such a power of <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    could be regarded as a power with a negative exponent (1/ <hi rend="italic"
                        >x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> m</hi> = <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                        rend="superscript"> -m</hi>), and he was thus enabled to extend the theorem
                    to certain hyperbolic curves, but the case <hi rend="italic">m</hi> a negative
                    value larger than 1 presented a difficulty which he did not succeed in
                    overcoming. It should be noticed that Wallis, although not using the notation
                        <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> m</hi> in the case of
                    a positive or negative fractional value, nor indeed in the case of a negative
                    integer value of <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> deals continually with such powers,
                    and speaks of the positive or negative integer or fractional value of <hi
                        rend="italic">m</hi> as the index of the power. The area of a curve, <hi
                        rend="italic">y</hi> =sum of a finite number of terms A <hi rend="italic"
                        >x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> m</hi>, was at once obtained from that
                    for the case of a single term; and Wallis, after thus establishing the several
                    results which would now be writtenjζ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> (ic-a,' <hi

                    value of □ = — , the term halfway between 1 and 2, in the series of terms 1, 2,
                    6, 20, 70, . . .; and he thus obtained the remarkable 2.4.4.6.6.8.8...</p>

                    number π.</p>
                <p>In the same work Wallis obtained the expression which would now be written <hi
                        rend="italic">ds∙=dx +</hi> for the length of the element of a curve, thus
                    reducing the problem of rectification to that of quadrature. An application of
                    this formula to an algebraical curve was first made a few years later by W.
                    Neil; the investigation is reproduced in the “Tractatus de Cissoide, &amp;c.”
                    (1659, as above), and Wallis adds the remark that the curve thus rectified is in
                    fact the semicubical parabola.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Mathesis Universalis</hi> is a more elementary work
                    intended for learners. It contains copious dissertations on fundamental points
                    of algebra, arithmetic, and geometry, and critical remarks.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">De Algebra Tractatus</hi> contains (chapters 66-69) the
                    idea of the interpretation of imaginary quantities in geometry. This is given
                    somewhat as follows: the distance represented by the square root of a negative
                    quantity cannot be measured in the line backwards or forwards, but can be
                    measured in the same plane above the line, or (as appears elsewhere) at right
                    angles to the line either in the plane, or in the plane at right angles thereto.
                    Considered as a history of algebra, this work is strongly objected to by
                    Montucla on the ground of its unfairness as against the early Italian
                    algebraists and also Vieta and Descartes, and in favour of Harriot; but De
                    Morgan, while admitting this, attributes to it considerable merit.</p>
                <p>The two treatises on the cycloid and on the cissoid, &amp;c., and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Mechanica</hi> contain many results which were then new and
                    valuable. The latter work contains elaborate investigations in regard to the
                    centre of gravity, and it is remarkable also for the employment of the principle
                    of virtual velocities. The cuno-cuneus is a highly interesting surface; it is a
                    ruled quartic surface, the equation of which may be written <hi rend="italic"
                        >c</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi

                        >-x</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>).</p>
                <p>Among the letters in volume iii., we have one to the editor of the Leipsic <hi
                        rend="italic">Acts,</hi> giving the decipherment of two letters in secret
                    characters. The ciphers are different, but on the same principle: the characters
                    in each are either single digits or combinations of two or three digits,
                    standing some of them for letters, others for syllables or words,—the number of
                    distinct characters which had to be deciphered being thus very considerable.</p>
