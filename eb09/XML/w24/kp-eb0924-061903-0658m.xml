                    in its general aspects under <hi rend="smallcaps">Astrology, Demonology,
                    Divination, Magic,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Spiritualism.</hi> In this
                    place what will be mainly attempted will be to illustrate the position assumed
                    by the law towards a crime which was regarded for centuries not only as possible
                    but also as specially noxious. It is a long interval from the Twelve Tables to
                    the Bill of Rights, but the lawyers of the latter age accepted the existence of
                    witchcraft with a faith almost as unquestioning as those of the former, and
                    comparatively few were they, whether lawyers or laymen, who in the interval
                    dared to raise their voices against the prevailing superstition. The writings of
                    Shakespeare and the other Elizabethan dramatists are sufficient of themselves to
                    show the universal prevalence of the belief in England. For the purposes of this
                    article witchcraft may be taken to include any claim of a power to produce
                    effects by other than natural causes. By whatever name such a power might be
                    called in a particular case, whether witchcraft, conjuration, sorcery,
                    incantation, divination, or any similar name, the legal effects attaching to its
                    supposed exercise were usually the same. Witchcraft was the most comprehensive
                    English name, <hi rend="italic">sortilegium</hi> the most comprehensive in
                    ecclesiastical Latin.</p>
                <p>In Roman law it was provided by the Twelve Tables that no one should remove his
                    neighbour’s crops to another field by incantation or conjure away his corn. At a
                    later date the <hi rend="italic">Lex Cornelia</hi><hi rend="italic">de Sicariis
                    et Veneficis</hi> was extended by decree of the senate to cases of offering
                    sacrifice to injure a neighbour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Exercise of magical and diabolical arts rendered the magicians themselves liable
                    to be burned alive, and those who consulted them to crucifixion. Even the
                    possession of magical books was criminal. To administer a love potion, even
                    though harmless, was punished by labour in the mines, or relegation and fine in
                    the case of persons of rank.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    objectionable to both the pagan and Christian emperors. Sorcery was punished by
                    Constantine with banishment, or death by burning; and an accusation of
                    witchcraft, as of treason, rendered every one, whatever his rank, liable to
                    torture. To teach or to learn magic art was equally criminal. The only
                    exceptions allowed (and these were afterwards removed by Leo<note

                    storms, and other natural phenomena injurious to agriculture. A constitution of

                    such as 1 Cor. xi. 10, where the words “because of the ange!s” were supposed to
                    prove the reality of the class of demons called <hi rend="italic"

                    learnedly discussed by Farinaccius and other writers on criminal law. The
                    practical effect of this mode of regarding witchcraft was that, although
                    according to the better opinion the offence was in itself the subject of both
                    secular and ecclesiastical cognizance, in fact it was on the continent of Europe
                    seldom punished by the secular power, except as the mere executive of
                    ecclesiastical sentences. The earliest ecclesiastical decree appears to have
                    been that of Ancyra, 315 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> condemning soothsayers
                    to five years’ penance. In canon law the <hi rend="italic">Decretum</hi>
                    subjected them to excommunication as idolaters and enemies of Christ, and the
                    bishop was to take all means in his power to put down the practice of
                    divination.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pt. ii.

                    published a bull against witchcraft. In the 15th a vigorous crusade was begun by
                    the bull “Summis desiderantes affectibus” of Innocent VIII. in 1484. Under the
                    authority of this bull Sprenger and Kramer (Latinized into “Institor ”) were
                    appointed inquisitors, and five years later they published the famous work <hi

                    type="authorial"><p>The practice was also regulated by instructions promulgated
                    by the Inquisition. A code of such instructions framed in 1657 will be found in

                    below).</p></note> The third part of the work deals with the practice at length.
                    One or two of the more interesting points of practice deserve a brief notice.
                    Witnesses incompetent in ordinary cases were on account of the gravity of the
                    offence admissible on a charge of witchcraft against but not for the accused. An
                    alleged witch was to be conjured by the tears of our Saviour and of our Lady and
                    the saints to weep, which she could not do if she were guilty. The authors
                    explain that witchcraft is more natural to women than to men, on account of the
                    inherent wickedness of their hearts. In the Roman and Greek Churches the form of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Exorcism</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.vf</hi> still
                    survives,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    extraordinary minuteness of detail by which the practice of exorcism was
                    regulated, even in the last century, appears from a curious little Portuguese
                    book by Brognolo, <hi rend="italic">Methodo</hi><hi rend="italic">de exorcizar

                    Church of England as lately as 1603. The 72d canon of that year forbade attempts
                    by the clergy at casting out devils by fasting and prayer unless by special
                    licence from the bishop. No such canon appears among the Irish canons of 1634.
                    On one occasion in 1612 punishment of the exorcised demons was attempted. The
                    bishop of Beauvais, in a document which Garinet has preserved, pronounced
                    sentence of excommunication against five such demons.<note anchored="true"

                    <hi rend="italic">Confessional</hi> of Egbert are full of condemnations of magic

                    made in favour of incantation by a priest by means of the Lord’s prayer or the
                    creed. The practice of magic by women is set out in the same document with
                    minute and disgusting detail. After the Conquest, commissions were from time to
                    time issued empowering bishops to search for sorcerers. A form of such a
                    commission to the bishop of Lincoln in 1406 is given by Rymer.<note

                    The secular courts dealt with witchcraft from a very early period. It was an
                    indictable offence at common law and later by statute, though apparently not a
                    felony until the Act of Henry VIII. The earliest trial recorded in England was
                    in a secular court. In 1324 several persons were appealed before the coroners of
                    the king’s household, and the record, certifying acquittal by a jury, was then
                    brought up by writ of <hi rend="italic">certiοrari.</hi><note anchored="true"

                <p>In proceedings against a woman the doctrine of coercion by the husband (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Women)</hi> did not apply. A distinction, more curious than
                    important, was drawn between conjurers, witches, and sorcerers. Conjurers by
                    force of magic words endeavoured to raise the devil and compel him to execute
                    their commands. Witches by way of friendly conference bargained with an evil
                    spirit that he should do what they desired of him. Sorcerers or charmers, by the
                    use of superstitious forms of words or by means of images or other
                    representations of persons or things, produced strange effects above the
                    ordinary course of nature. Legislation on the subject began in the pre-Conquest
                    codes. Thus the laws of Ethelred banished witches, soothsayers, and magicians.
                    The laws of Canute included love-witchcraft under heathendom. It was evidently
                    regarded as a survival of paganism. The first Act after the Conquest was passed
                    in 1541 (33 Hen. VIII. c. 8), which dealt with a somewhat remarkable mixture of
                    offences. It declared felony without benefit of clergy various kinds of
                    sorceries, discovery of hidden treasure, destruction of a neighbour’s person or
                    goods, making images and pictures of men, women, children, angels, devils,
                    beasts, and fowls, and pulling down crosses. The Act having been repealed at the
                    accession of Edward VI., another Act on similar lines but distinguishing
                    different grades of witchcraft was passed in 1562. By this Act, 5 Eliz. c. 16,
                    conjuration and invocation of evil spirits, and the practice of sorceries,
                    enchantments, charms, and witchcrafts, whereby death ensued, were made felonies
                    without benefit of clergy and punishable with death. If only bodily harm ensued,
                    the punishment for a first offence was a year’s imprisonment and the pillory,
                    and for a second death. If the practice was to discover hidden treasure or to
                    provoke to unlawful love, the punishment for a first offence was the same as in
                    the last case, for a second imprisonment for life and forfeiture of goods. At
                    the accession of James L, perhaps in compliment to the king’s position as an
                    expert and specialist in the matter, was passed 1 Jac. I. c. 12, which continued
                    law for more than a century. The strange verbiage of the most important section
                    of the Act is worth quoting in full. “If any person or persons shall use,
                    practise, or exercise any <pb break="no"

                    woman, or child out of his, her, or their grave or any other place where the
                    dead body resteth, or the skin, bone, or any part of any dead person, to be
                    employed or used in any manner of witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or enchantment, or
                    shall use, practise, or exercise any witchcraft, enchantment, charm, or sorcery,
                    whereby any person shall be killed, destroyed, wasted, consumed, pined, or lamed
                    in his or her body or any part thereof,” every such offender is a felon without
                    benefit of clergy. The Act further punished with imprisonment for a first
                    offence, and for a second made it felony without benefit of clergy, to declare
                    by witchcraft where treasure was, to provoke to unlawful love, or to attempt to
                    hurt cattle, goods, or persons. This Act was repealed in 1736 by 9 Geo. II. c.
                    <hi rend="italic">5.</hi> It will be noticed that in all the Acts it was
                    necessary (except in the case of love-philtres) that injury should have been
                    caused or intended or gain made. There were statutes which, although not
                    directly concerned with witchcraft, aimed at the suppression of analogous
                    offences. Thus multiplication of gold and silver (by means of the philosopher’s
                    stone) was made felony in 1403 by <hi rend="italic">5 Hen.</hi> IV. c. 4. This
                    was repealed by 1 Will, and Μ. c. 30,—it is said, by the influence of Robert
                    Boyle. Numerous Acts dealing with the practice of palmistry and fortune-telling
                    by Egyptians or Gipsies were passed at different times, beginning in 1530 with
                    22 Hen. VIII. c. 10. They are now superseded by the provisions of the Vagrant
                    Act of 1824.</p>
                <p>Trials for witchcraft in England do not seem to have been proportionately as
                    numerous or to have been accompanied with such circumstances of cruelty as those
                    in most other countries. This may be accounted for partly by the diminishing
                    authority of the church courts, partly by the absence of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Torture</hi> (g ’.u) as a recognized means of procedure, though no doubt it was
                    too often used in an informal manner. The pricking of the body of an alleged

                    insensible spot or devil’s mark, the proof by water (a popular survival of the
                    old water ordeal), and similar proceedings, if not judicial torture, at least
                    caused as much pain to the victims. Charges of witchcraft seem to have been made
                    with great frequency against persons of rank during the Wars of the Roses for
                    political purposes. The cases of the duchess of Gloucester and Jane Shore will
                    at once occur to the mind, and neither Edward IV. nor his queen were exempt. The
                    duke of Clarence was accused of imputing witchcraft to the former; and the
                    latter and her mother, the duchess of Bedford, were charged with having obtained
                    the promise of marriage from the king by magical means. Trials in England were
                    most numerous in the 17th century. In the case of the Lancashire witches in 1634
                    seventeen persons were condemned on the evidence of one boy. In the period from
                    1645 to 1647 between two and three hundred are said to have been indicted in
                    Suffolk and Essex alone, of whom more than half were convicted.<note

                    type="authorial"><p>In this case, tried at the assizes at Bury St Edmunds on
                    March 16, 1664-65, two widows named Rose Cullender and Annie Duny were accused
                    of bewitching young children. The main points of the evidence were these. There
                    had been a quarrel between the accused and the parents of the children, and the
                    accused had uttered threats against them. The children fell into fits and
                    vomited crooked pins, and once one of them vomited a twopenny nail with a broad
                    head; they cried out the names of the accused in their fits; they could not
                    pronounce the words “Lord,” “Jesus,” or “Christ” in reading, but when they came
                    to “Satan” or “devil” they cried, “This bites, but makes me speak it right
                    well.” One of the children fell into a swoon after being suckled by one of the
                    accused, and out of the child’s blanket fell a great toad which exploded in the
                    fire like gunpowder, and immediately afterwards the alleged witch was seen
                    sitting at home maimed and scorched. Evidence of finding the witch’s mark was
                    given, and then evidence of reputation, viz., that the accused, besides being
                    themselves accounted witches, had had some of their kindred condemned as such. A
                    farmer swore that once when his cart had touched Cullender’s house it overturned
                    continually and they could not get it home. Sir Thomas Browne testified that the
                    swooning fits were natural, heightened to great excess by the subtlety of the
                    devil co-operating with the witches. Experiments upon the children were then
                    made in court by bringing them into contact with the witches and others. These
                    were of so unsatisfactory a nature that many present openly declared that they
                    thought the children impostors. The chief baron in his summing up said that
                    there were such creatures as witches was undoubted, for the Scriptures affirmed
                    it and the wisdom of nations had provided laws against such persons. The report
                    alleges that after conviction of the accused the children immediately
                    recovered.</p></note> In many of these trials the accused confessed before
                    execution. The reasons which urged them to confess not only impossibilities, but
                    impossibilities of the most revolting kind, are not very easy to discover. In
                    some cases, no doubt, the object was to escape the misery of life as a reputed
                    witch. The theory of witchcraft, too, was universal and well known, and the
                    revolting details of worship of the devil and of the witches’ sabbath must have
                    been familiar to all. Torture, as the Milan case shows (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Torture),</hi> might force from the accused confession of an impossible crime,
                    and even without torture instances have been known in modern times where women
                    have charged themselves with offences in which they were the only
                    believers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A remarkable
                    instance is a case of Robinson <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Robinson and Lane (to
                    be found in the Divorce Court Reports in 1859), where purely imaginary acts of
                    adultery were recorded by the respondent in her diary.</p></note> These
                    considerations may partially, if not fully, solve a difficulty which has been
                    felt ever since the time of Cardan.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the 17th century the feeling towards witchcraft began to
                    change. The case of Hathaway in 1702 no doubt accelerated the decay of the old
                    belief. He was convicted of cheating and assault by falsely pretending to be
                    bewitched and by making an attack on an alleged witch.<note anchored="true"

                    convicted at Hertford, but not executed. A case said to have occurred in 1716
                    does not rest on good authority. This change of feeling was no doubt caused to a
                    great extent by the works of writers, few in number but strong in argument, who
                    from the time of Reginald <hi rend="smallcaps">Scot (j.v.)</hi> struck at the
                    very foundations of the popular belief. One of the most interesting but
                    least-known writers is George Gifford, whose views are in the nature of a
                    compromise. His point is that the devil may deceive not only witches but their
                    accusers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    from the popular than the scientific point of view.<note anchored="true"

                    and Blackstone in guarded language said that its exclusion from the list of
                    crimes was not to be understood as implying a denial of the possibility of such
                    an offence, though, following Addison, he would not give credit to any
                    particular modern instance.</p>
                <p>In the present state of the law pretended supernatural powers may be such as to
                    bring those professing them under the criminal law, or to make void a transfer
                    of property caused by belief in their existence. The Act of 1736 enacted that
                    any person pretending to use witchcraft, tell fortunes, or discover stolen goods
                    by skill in any occult or crafty science, was to be imprisoned for a year, to
                    stand in the pillory, and to find sureties for good behaviour. This is still
                    law, except as to the pillory. By the Vagrant Act of 1824, 5 Geo. IV. c. 83, s.
                    4, any person pretending or professing to tell fortunes, or using any subtle
                    craft, means, or device, by palmistry or otherwise, to deceive and impose on any
                    of Her Majesty’s subjects, is to be deemed a rogue and vagabond. Under this Act
                    a person may be convicted for attempting to deceive by falsely pretending to
                    have the supernatural faculty of obtaining from invisible agents and the spirits
                    of the dead answers, messages, and manifestations of power, viz., noises, raps,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> The principal Act of the Scottish parliament
                    was 1563, c. 73 (ratified and confirmed in 1649), making it a capital offence to
                    use witchcraft, sorcery, or necromancy, or to pretend to such knowledge, or to
                    seek help from witches. It was repealed by 9 Geo. II. c. 5. Trials were either
                    before the ordinary courts or, more frequently, before special tribunals erected
                    by the authority of commissions from time to time issued by the privy council,
                    often on the petition of a presbytery or the General Assembly. Boxes were placed
                    in the churches to receive accusations. The frequency of cases is shown by an
                    order of parliament in 1661 that justices depute should go once a week at least
                    to Musselburgh and Dalkeith to try persons accused of witchcraft. In these
                    trials evidence of the wildest description was admitted. Anything was relevant,
                    especially if sworn to by a professed witch-finder or witch-pricker, a position
                    in which one Kincaid, like Hopkins in England, attained special eminence.
                    Torture was used in most cases, and in an aggravated form, as it was supposed
                    that the devil protected his votaries from the effects of ordinary torture. A
                    special form of iron collar and gag called “the witch’s bridle” was generally
                    used. The details of the trials in Pitcairn’s <hi rend="italic">Criminal
                    Trials</hi> are utterly revolting, especially those of Bessie Dunlop in 1576 and
                    of Dr Fian in 1590. One of the charges in the former case is very remarkable,
                    and the accused herself confessed it, that she acted under the guidance of the
                    spirit of Thome Reid who had been killed at Pinkie in 1547. In some cases a
                    charge of witchcraft was joined with a charge of another crime, as of murder in
                    the master of Orkney’s case, of treason in Dr Fian’s, accused of raising a storm
                    at sea when the king was on a voyage.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>All these cases will be found in vol. i. of Pitcairn. In one

                    James VI. was frequently present in person at trials for witchcraft, and the
                    most horrible cases recorded are those which occurred in his reign. The full
                    pleadings in a charge are given in the case of Margaret Wallace.<note

                    the criminality of sorcery upon the divine law as contained in the 20th chapter
                    of Leviticus and the 18th chapter of Deuteronomy. The punishment was generally
                    burning. The last execution took place in 1722, after conviction before the
                    sheriff of Sutherland. As to pretended powers, the Act of 1736 applies to
                    Scotland, and at common law obtaining money by pretending to tell fortunes or
                    recover property by enchantment is punishable as falsehood, fraud, and wilful
                    imposition.</p>

                    was adopted almost word for word by 28 Eliz. c. 2 (I.). The only other Act of
                    the Irish parliament bearing on the question was 10 Car. I., sess. 2, c. 19
                    (I.), enacting that if a person bewitched in one county died in another the
                    person guilty of causing his death might be tried in the county where the death
                    happened. It is remarkable that this Act is based upon an English Act, 2 and 3

                    1691-92 is one of the most striking incidents in the history of New England.
                    Nineteen persons were executed for witchcraft, among whom was Giles Cory, the
                    only person who ever perished by the <hi rend="italic">peine forte</hi><hi

                    convicted, and they received the governor’s pardon. For these proceedings the
                    writing and preaching of Cotton Mather were largely responsible. The States have
                    now their own legislation against pretended supernatural powers. Provisions
                    similar to those of the English Vagrant Act are common.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Continental States.—</hi> The law against witchcraft was
                    minutely treated by Continental jurists of the 16th and 17th centuries,

                    churchmen or laymen holding ecclesiastical appointments. The extent to which

                    to the service of the devil. Some of the <hi rend="italic">indicia</hi> on which
                    torture might be inflicted were absence of the accused from bed during the
                    night, drawing cabalistic signs on the ground, threats of injury, anointing the
                    body. The text of Roman law was sometimes distorted in an extraordinary way: <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> it was a maxim that a contract with a demon was not
                    binding, and this was expressed in the language of Roman law in the formula “in

                    generally acted, though the crime was sometimes the subject of secular·
                    legislation, especially in the <hi rend="italic">Constitutio Criminalis</hi> of

                    number of victims perhaps exceeded that in any other country. It was in Germany
                    too that the last execution for witchcraft in Europe took place, at Posen in
                    1793. In France prosecutions for <hi rend="italic">vauderie</hi> occurred in the
                    13th and 14th centuries. In the 15th century Joan of Arc was condemned on a

                    Henry III., like Edward IV. of England, was accused by his enemies of practising
                    sorcery. The most numerous prosecutions were set on foot in the 17th century,
                    and as in other countries they met with the firmest support from some literary
                    men, among whom P. de ΓAncre is conspicuous for his orthodoxy.<note

                    against the practice of sorcery and divination, and punished with corporal
                    punishment any persons consulting sorcerers, with death those who exercised
                    magic themselves. The “Chambre Ardente” tried some cases, and the last case ever
                    brought before such a tribunal resulted in the condemnation in 1680 of a woman
                    named Voisin for sorcery and poisoning in connexion with the Marquise de
                    Brinvilliers. The law against sorcery held its place in French legal works till
                    at least the middle of the last century. It was treated at length both by the

                    premises of the accused instruments of magic, as wax figures transfixed with
                    needles, feathers in the form of a circle, or a written pact with the devil.

                    was tried in 1811 in the department of Yonne. The slander consisted in an
                    allegation by the defendant that the complainants had danced around the devil,
                    who was seated on a gilded arm-chair as president of the dance. The tribunal of
                    police thought the matter more a subject of ridicule than of injury and
                    dismissed it, but this judgment was quashed by the court of cassation on the
                    ground that the charge was one which might trouble the public peace. In Spain
                    and Italy there is a considerable body of legislation on the subject of
                    witchcraft. For instance, the code of the <hi rend="italic">Siete</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Partidas</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Partida vii. tit. 23.</p></note> in Spain punished with death those who
                    acted as diviners or witches, especially in love matters. A distinction was
                    drawn between divination by astronomy, which was legitimate, and that by augury
                    from birds or by incantation over water or a mirror. On the Continent, as in
                    England, there was during two centuries a steady flow of literary attack on the
                    reasonableness of belief in witchcraft. The earliest attack was made in Germany,
                    the country which had distinguished itself by the vigour of its prosecutions of
                    the crime. Cornelius Agrippa, in his <hi rend="italic">De Occulta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophia,</hi> was not entirely orthodox on the subject; and it
                    was more directly treated in the <hi rend="italic">De Praestigiis Daemonum</hi>
                    of Johann Wier or Weier in 1563, twenty-one years earlier than Reginald Scot’s
                    work. Wier was followed in the next century by Father Frederick Spee<note

                    >Bekker</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.ν.)</hi> in the Netherlands. The work of Spee,
                    originally published anonymously, appears to have caused a great sensation at
                    the time and to have caused a relaxation of prosecutions in order to give
                    opportunity for further inquiry. The work takes the form of fifty-two doubts,
                    the first of which is “An Sagae Striges seu Malefici revera existant ?” The
                    general conclusion is that, although witches exist in general, the question of
                    their operation in particular cases is open to so much doubt that it would be
                    well to suspend proceedings for a time. The writer did not profess entire
                    disbelief, as did Bekker. The main idea of <hi rend="italic">De Betooνerde
                    Wereld</hi> of the latter is that good and evil spirits could have no effect or
                    influence on earthly affairs, for spirit could not act on matter. All
                    prosecutions for witchcraft were therefore unjust, and against the honour of God
                    and the advantage of man. During the same period other writers both lay and
                    legal treated the question incidentally. Montaigne was sceptical; Montesquieu,
                    while not actually intimating disbelief, enjoined the greatest care in trying
                    accusations. As in England, the current of literary feeling was not uniformly op
                    posed to popular belief, for Wier was answered by Bodin, and Luther and other
                    eminent writers no doubt had full faith in the existence of witchcraft.</p>
