                    north to south is 28 miles. The total area is 461,552 acres, or about 721 square
                    miles. The coast-line is in some parts bold and rocky, and is indented by
                    numerous bays and inlets, the principal being Waterford Harbour; Tramore Bay,
                    with picturesque cliffs and some extensive caves, and noted for its shipwrecks,
                    on account of the rocky character of its bed; Dungarvan Harbour, much frequented
                    for refuge in stormy weather; and Youghal Harbour, partly separating county
                    Waterford from county Cork. The surface of the county is to a large extent
                    mountainous, especially towards the west and northwest, consisting chiefly of
                    metamorphosed Lower Silurian rocks, the valleys being occupied by Carboniferous
                    Limestone. There is also evidence on an extensive scale of former glacial
                    action. The Knockmealdown Mountains, which attain a height of 2609 feet, form
                    the northern boundary with Tipperary. A wide extent of country between Clonmel
                    and Dungarvan is occupied by the two ranges of the Commeragh and Monavallagh
                    Mountains, reaching in Knockanarian a height of 2478 feet. To the south of
                    Dungarvan there is a lower but very rugged range, called the Drum Hills. The
                    south-eastern division of the county is for the most part level, consisting
                    chiefly of clay slate interrupted by patches of primitive limestone, and also by
                    conglomerate and basalt, forming in some parts of the coast lofty columnar
                    cliffs. Coal and iron were formerly wrought, but the only mineral product now of
                    importance is copper, the mines at Knockmahon ranking next in Ireland to those
                    at Berehaven. Lead mining, formerly prosecuted with some success, has now
                    practically ceased. Lime is abundant, and coralline sea-sand is obtained. Slate
                    is quarried in considerable quantities at Lismore, and there are also quarries
                    of valuable sandstone and of marble. Ochres and clays for the manufacture of
                    earthenware are also obtained. Though Waterford has benefited in its
                    communications by the important rivers in its vicinity, the only large river it
                    can properly claim as belonging to it is the Blackwater. This enters the county
                    to the east of Fermoy, and flows eastward along a trough of Carboniferous
                    Limestone to Cappoquin, where it turns abruptly southwards, to fall into the sea
                    at Youghal Harbour. At its junction with the Bride below Cappoquin it is
                    navigable for vessels of 100 tons burden. Waterford Harbour may be called the
                    estuary of three important rivers, the Suir, the Nore, and the Barrow, but
                    neither of the last two touches the county. The Suir reaches it at its union
                    with the Nier about 8 miles from Clonmel, and thence forms its northern boundary
                    with Tipperary and Kilkenny. It is navigable for vessels of 800 tons burden to
                    Waterford, for barques and large lighters to Carrick-on-Suir, and for boats of
                    50 tons to Clonmel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The land is generally better adapted for
                    pasturage than for tillage, although there are considerable tracts of rich soil
                    in <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n426/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0426-0401"/> the south-eastern districts. The total number of
                    holdings in 1886 was 10,188, of which 26 were above 500 acres in extent, 1029
                    between 100 and 500 acres, 1660 between 50 and 100 acres, 2726 between 15 and 50
                    acres, 2530 between 1 and 15 acres, and 2217 did not exceed 1 acre. Out of a
                    total of 456,198 acres only 83,968 acres, or 18⋅4 per cent., were under crops,
                    235,801 acres, or 51⋅7 per cent., were under grass; 330 acres fallow; 19,317
                    acres, or 4⋅2 per cent., woods and plantations; 22,791 acres, or 5⋅0 per cent.,
                    bog and marsh; 76,137 acres, or 16⋅7 per cent., barren mountain land; and
                    17,854, or 3⋅9 per cent., water, roads, fences, &amp;c. Since 1859 the area
                    under crops has decreased nearly a third, the amount in that year being 116,940
                    acres. Corn crops occupied 59,848 acres in 1859 and only 35,461 in 1886, the
                    areas under wheat in these years being respectively 23,671 and 1326 acres, under
                    oats 32,526 and 32,795 acres, and under barley, here, &amp;c., 3651 and 1340
                    acres. The area under green crops in 1859 was 38,213 acres, and in 1886 it was
                    24,436 acres, the areas under potatoes in these years being respectively 23,385
                    and 14,361 acres, under turnips 10,886 and 6171 acres, and under other green
                    crops 4042 and 3904 acres. Horses between 1859 and 1886 diminished from 14,184
                    to 12,794, of which 9122 were two years old and upwards, but cattle increased
                    from 84,440 to 102,878, of which 39,428 were milch cows, and sheep from 42,408
                    to 55,805, while pigs decreased from 55,701 to 44,510. The number of mules in
                    1886 was 942, of asses 4319, of goats 5510, and of poultry 258,058.</p>
                <p>In 1876, according to the <hi rend="italic">Return of Owners of Land,</hi>
                    Waterford was divided among 814 proprietors, possessing 454,937 acres at an
                    annual valuation of £276,642, or an average of about 12s. 2d. per acre. The
                    estimated extent of waste lands was 880 acres. Of the owners 600 possessed one
                    acre and upwards. The number of large estates is exceptionally great. The
                    following possessed upwards of 8000 acres :—marquis of Waterford, 39,884; Lord
                    Stuart de Decies, 30,823; duke of Devonshire, 27,484; R. A. Chearnley, 18,166;
                    Edmond De La Poer, 13,448; John Palisser, 9825; Lord Ashtown, 9435; Sir J. H.
                    Keane, Bart., 8909; and Sir R. J. Musgrave, Bart., 8282.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures and Trade.—</hi> The woollen manufacture, except
                    for private use, is now practically extinct, but the cotton manufacture is still
                    of some importance. There are also breweries, distilleries, and a large number
                    of flour-mills. Sea-fishing is prosecuted chiefly at Dungarvan. There are
                    valuable salmon fisheries on the Blackwater and the Suir.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways. —</hi> From the city of Waterford the Waterford and
                    Central Ireland line goes northwards by Kilkenny, the Waterford and Limerick by
                    Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel to Limerick, the Waterford and Tramore to Tramore,
                    and the Waterford, Dungarvan, and Lismore to Lismore, where it joins a branch of
                    the Great South-Western.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> From 119,457 in 1812 the
                    population increased by 1841 to 196,187, but by 1861 it diminished to 134,252,
                    by 1871 to 123,310, and by 1881 to 112,768 (males 54,618, females 58,150), or
                    8⋅5 per cent. less than in 1871. The total number of emigrants from 1st May 1857
                    to 31st December 1878 was 67,080, and to 31st December 1885 it was 79,240. In
                    1880 the number reached 2675, and in 1885 it was 1333. The county is divided
                    into 8 baronies, with 82 parishes and 1557 townlands. The principal towns are
                    Waterford (population 29,181), Dungarvan (6306), Tramore (2036), Portlaw (1891),
                    and Lismore (1860). Before the Redistribution Act of 1885 the county returned
                    two members to parliament, the borough of Waterford two, and Dungarvan
                    one,—Clonmel, which is partly in Waterford, also returning one. The county now
                    returns two members, for the East and West Divisions respectively, while the
                    county of the city of Waterford returns one member, and Dungarvan and Clonmel
                    have been disfranchised. It is in the Leinster circuit, and assizes are held at
                    Waterford, and quarter sessions at Lismore, Dungarvan, and Waterford. It is in
                    the Cork military district, and there is a brigade depôt at Clonmel, and barrack
                    stations at Dungarvan and Waterford. The Catholics formed 94⋅8 per cent. of the
                    population in 1871 and 95⋅0 in 1881, the Episcopalians in the same years 4⋅1 per
                    cent. The proportion of persons who could read and write in 1871 was 35⋅7 per
                    cent., and in 1881 it was 45⋅8; in 1881 10⋅6 per cent. could read but could not
                    write, and 43⋅6 could neither read nor write,—14⋅3 per cent. being under seven
                    years of age.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> In the 9th century the Danes
                    landed in the district, and afterwards made a permanent settlement there. There
                    are in the county a considerable number of barrows, duns, cromlechs, and similar
                    relics of the ancient inhabitants. At Ardmore there is a round tower 97 feet in
                    height, and near it a huge rath and a large number of circular entrenchments.
                    Waterford was one of the twelve counties into which King John, in 1205, divided
                    that part of Ireland which he nominally annexed to the English crown. On account
                    of the convenience of the city as a landing place, many subsequent expeditions
                    passed through the county directed against disaffected or rebellious tribes. In
                    1444 the greater part of it was granted to James, earl of Desmond, and in 1447
                    it was bestowed on John Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, who was created earl of
                    Waterford. The county suffered severely during the Desmond rebellion, in the
                    reign of Elizabeth, as well as in the rebellion of 1641 and during the
                    Cromwellian period. Among the old castles special mention may be made of
                    Lismore, originally erected by John, afterwards king of England, in 1185, but
                    now in great part comparatively modern. The chief ecclesiastical remains are
                    those of the chancel and nave of the cathedral of Ardmore, where a monastery and
                    oratory were founded by St Declan in the 7th century. The see of Ardmore was
                    abolished in the 12th century.</p>
