                <p><label type="entry">WILKIE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir David</hi></label>
                    (1785-1841), Scottish subjectpainter, was born on 18th November 1785, the son of
                    the parish minister of Cults in Fifeshire. He very early developed an
                    extraordinary love for art: he was accustomed to say that he could draw before
                    he could read and paint before he could spell, and at school he used to barter
                    his sketches and portraits for slate-pencils and marbles. He was also noted for
                    his keen and constant observation of the village life around him; and a friend
                    has recorded that he “liked better to stand and look at his companions at their
                    games than to join in their play.” In 1799, after he had attended school at
                    Pitlessie, Kettle, and Cupar, his father reluctantly yielded to his desire to
                    become a painter; and through the influence of the earl of Leven Wilkie was
                    admitted to the Trustees’ Academy in Edinburgh, and began the study of art under
                    John Graham, the able teacher of the school. From William Allan (afterwards Sir
                    William Allan and president of the Royal Scottish Academy) and John Burnet, the
                    engraver of Wilkie’s works, we have an interesting account of his early studies,
                    of his indomitable perseverance and power of close application, of his habit of
                    haunting fairs and market-places, and transferring to his sketchbook all that
                    struck him as characteristic and telling in figure or incident, and of his
                    admiration for the works of Carse and David Allan, two Scottish painters of
                    scenes from humble life. Among his pictures of this period are mentioned a
                    subject from Macbeth, Ceres in Search of Proserpine, and Diana and Calisto,
                    which in 1803 gained a premium of ten guineas at the Trustees’ Academy, while
                    his pencil portraits of himself and his mother, dated that year, and now in the
                    possession of the duke of Buccleuch, prove that he had already attained
                    considerable certainty of touch and power of rendering character. A scene from
                    Allan Ramsay, and a sketch from Macneill’s ballad of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scotland's Skaith</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> afterwards developed
                    into the well-known Village Politicians, were the first subjects in which his
                    true artistic individuality began to assert itself.</p>
                <p>In 1804 Wilkie returned to Cults, established himself in the manse, and commenced
                    his first important subjectpicture, Pitlessie Fair, which includes about 140
                    figures, and in which he introduced portraits of his neighbours and of several
                    members of his family circle. This work, which was purchased by Kinnear of
                    Kinloch for £25, is rather hot and unpleasant in tone and colouring; but it is a
                    picture of the greatest interest and promise, so full of incident and character
                    as to justify its painter’s remark, when he saw it twelve years afterwards, that
                    it contains “more subject and entertainment than any other three pictures which
                    I have since produced.” In addition to this elaborate figure-piece, Wilkie was
                    much employed at the time upon portraits, both at home and in Kinghorn, St
                    Andrews, and Aberdeen.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1805 he left Scotland for London, carrying with him his
                    Bounty-Money, or the Village Recruit, -which he soon disposed of for £6, and
                    began to study in the schools of the Royal Academy. One of his first patrons in
                    London was Stodart, a pianoforte maker, a distant connexion of the Wilkie
                    family, who commissioned his portrait and other works and introduced the young
                    artist to the dowager countess of Mansfield. This lady’s son was the purchaser
                    of the Village Politicians, which attracted great attention when it was
                    exhibited in the Royal Academy of 1806, where it was followed in the succeeding
                    year by the Blind Fiddler, a commission from the painter’s lifelong friend Sir
                    George Beaumont. Wilkie now turned aside into the paths of historical art, and
                    painted his Alfred in the Neatherd’s Cottage, for the gallery illustrative of
                    English history which was being formed by Alexander Davison. The picture was
                    executed with the most conscientious care, and subjected to many alterations,
                    but in the end it proved far from a success. It bears no vivid impress of
                    reality; the figure of the king is wanting in dignity and character; indeed the
                    subject was one for which the artist had no essential sympathy, and into which
                    he was unable to project his imagination effectively. After its completion he
                    wisely returned to genre-painting, producing the Card-Players and the admirable
                    picture of the Rent Day, which was composed during recovery from a fever
                    contracted in 1807 while on a visit to his native village. His next great work
                    was the AleHouse Door, afterwards entitled the Village Festival (now in the
                    National Gallery), which was purchased by J. J. Angerstein for 800 guineas. It
                    has been styled by Leslie “the most artificial of Wilkie’s earlier productions.”
                    Its figures seem rather small for the extent of canvas; but the separate groups
                    are excellent, and in its handling, in the exquisite delicacy and refinement of
                    touch, and in the variety and beauty of its broken tints it bears marks of the
                    most distinct progress. It was followed in 1813 by the well-known Blind Man’s
                    Buff, a commission from the prince regent, to which a companion picture, the
                    Penny Wedding, was added in 1818.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Wilkie’s eminent success in art had been rewarded by professional
                    honours. In November 1809 he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, when
                    he had hardly attained the age prescribed by its laws, and in February 1811 he
                    became a full academician. In 1812 lie opened an exhibition of his collected
                    works in Pall Mall, but the experiment was unsuccessful, entailing pecuniary
                    loss upon the artist. In 1814 he executed the Letter of Introduction, one of the
                    most delicately finished and perfect of his cabinet pictures. In the same year
                    he made his first visit to the Continent, and at Paris entered upon a profitable
                    and delighted study of the works of art collected in the Louvre. Interesting
                    particulars of the time are preserved in his own matter-of-fact diary, and in
                    the more sprightly and flowing pages of the journal of Haydon, his
                    fellow-traveller. On his return he began Distraining for Rent, one of the most
                    popular and dramatic of his works. In 1816 he made a tour through Holland and
                    Belgium in company with Raimbach, the engraver of many of his paintings. The Sir
                    Walter Scott and his Family, a cabinet-sized picture with small full-length
                    figures in the dress of Scottish peasants, was the result of a visit to
                    Abbotsford in 1818. Reading a Will, a commission <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0604-0569"/> from the king of Bavaria, now in the New
                    Pinakothek at Munich, was completed in 1820; and two years later the great
                    picture of Chelsea Pensioners Reading the Gazette of the Battle of Waterloo,
                    commissioned by the duke of Wellington in 1816, at a cost of 1200 guineas, was
                    exhibited at the Royal Academy. The subject was a particularly happy one, and
                    was carried out -with the greatest fulness of incident and variety of character;
                    it appealed powerfully to the popular sentiment of the time, while the
                    accomplished and masterly technique of the work won the admiration of the
                    artistic portion of the public.</p>
                <p>In 1822 Wilkie visited Edinburgh, in order to select from the royal progress of
                    George IV. a fitting subject for a picture. The Reception of the King at the
                    Entrance of Holyrood Palace was the incident ultimately chosen; and in the
                    following year, when the artist, upon the death of Raeburn, had been appointed
                    royal limner for Scotland, he received sittings from the monarch, and began to
                    work diligently upon the subject. But several years elapsed before its
                    completion; for, like all such ceremonial works, it proved a harassing
                    commission, uncongenial to the painter while in progress and unsatisfactory when
                    finished. His health suffered from the strain to which he was subjected, and his
                    condition was aggravated by heavy domestic trials and responsibilities. In 1825
                    he sought relief in foreign travel: after visiting Paris, he passed into Italy,
                    where, at Rome, he received the news of fresh disasters through the failure of
                    his publishers. A residence at Töplitz and Carlsbad was tried in 1826, with
                    little good result, and then Wilkie returned to Italy, to Venice and Florence.
                    The summer of 1837 was spent in Geneva, where he had sufficiently recovered to
                    paint his Princess Doria Washing the Pilgrims’ Feet, a work which, like several
                    small pictures executed at Rome, was strongly influenced by the Italian art by
                    which the painter had been surrounded. In October he passed into Spain, whence
                    he returned to England in June 1828.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to over-estimate the influence upon Wilkie’s art of these three
                    years of foreign travel. It amounts to nothing short of a complete change of
                    style. Up to the period of his leaving England he had been mainly influenced by
                    the Dutch genre-painters, whose technique he had carefully studied, whose works
                    he frequently kept beside him in his studio for reference as he painted, and
                    whose method he applied to the rendering of those scenes of English and Scottish
                    life of which he was so close and faithful an observer. Teniers, in particular,
                    appears to have been his chief master; and in his earlier productions we find
                    the sharp, precise, spirited touch, the rather subdued colouring, and the clear,
                    silvery grey tone which distinguish this master; while in his subjects of a
                    slightly later period,—those, such as the Chelsea Pensioners, the Highland
                    Whisky Still, and the Rabbit on the Wall, executed in what Burnet styles his
                    second manner, which, however, may be regarded as only the development and
                    maturity of his first,—he begins to unite to the qualities of Teniers that
                    greater richness and fulness of effect which are characteristic of Ostade. But
                    now he experienced the spell of the Italian masters, and of Velazquez and the
                    great Spaniards. His change of feeling is accurately marked in an entry in his
                    journal during his last visit to The Hague. “One feels wearied,” he writes,
                    “with the perfections of the minor Dutch paintings, and finds relief in
                    contemplating even the imperfect sketches and incomplete thoughts of those great
                    Italians. My friend Woodburn used to say when we were in Italy that ‘all
                    collectors begin with Dutch pictures but end with Italian.’”</p>
                <p>In the works which Wilkie produced in his final period he exchanged tlιe detailed
                    handling, the delicate finislι, and the reticent hues of his earlier works for a
                    style distinguished by breadth of touch, largeness of effect, richness of tone,
                    and full force of melting and powerful colour. His subjects, too, were no longer
                    the homely things of the genre-painter: with his broader method he attempted the
                    portrayal of scenes from history, suggested for the most part by the
                    associations of his foreign travel. His change of style and change of subject
                    were severely criticized at the time; to some extent he lost his hold upon the
                    public, who regretted the familiar subjects and the interest and pathos of his
                    earlier productions, and were less ready to follow him into the historic scenes
                    towards which this final phase of his art sought to lead them. The popular
                    verdict had in it a basis of truth: Wilkie was indeed greatest as a
                    genre-painter. He possessed the keenest instinct for the portrayal of what was
                    around him, the truest insight for the effective selection, the artistic and
                    telling combination, of the things that met his every-day sight, and were dear
                    to him through life-long nearness; but he was destitute of that higher and more
                    recondite kind of imagination which “bodies forth the form of things unseen,”
                    and gives life and reality to its re-creations of the past. It is, however,
                    undoubtedly true that on technical grounds his changé of style was criticized
                    with undue severity. While his later works are admittedly more frequently faulty
                    in form and draughtsmanship than those of his earlier period, some of them at
                    least (the Bride’s Toilet, 1837, for instance) show a true gain and development
                    in power of handling, and in mastery over complex and forcible colour harmonies.
                    Most of Wilkie’s foreign subjects, —the Pifferari, Princess Doria, the Maid of
                    Saragossa, the Spanish Podado, a Guerilla Council of War, the Guerilla Taking
                    Leave of his Family, and the Guerilla’s Return to his Family,—passed into the
                    English royal collection; but the dramatic Two Spanish Monks of Toledo, also
                    entitled the Confessor Confessing, became the property of tlιe marquis of
                    Lansdowne. On his return to England Wilkie completed the Reception of the King
                    at the Entrance of Holyrood Palace,—a curious example of a union of his earlier
                    and later styles, a “mixture” which was very justly pronounced by Haydon to be
                    “like oil and water.” His Preaching of John Knox before the Lords of the
                    Congregation had also been begun before he left for abroad; but it was painted
                    throughout in the later style, and consequently presents a more satisfactory
                    unity and harmony of treatment and handling. It was one of the most successful
                    pictures of the artist’s later period.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of 1830 Sir Thomas Lawrence died, and Wilkie was appointed to
                    succeed him as painter in ordinary to the king, and in 1836 he received the
                    honour of knighthood. The main figure-pictures which occupied him until the end
                    were Columbus in the Convent at La Rabida, 1835; Napoleon and Pius VII. at
                    Fontainebleau, 1836; Sir David Baird Discovering the Body of Tippoo Sahib, 1838;
                    the Empress Josephine and the Fortune-Teller, 1838; and Queen Victoria Presiding
                    at her First Council, 1838. His time was also much occupied with portraiture,
                    many of his works of this class being royal commissions. His portraits are
                    pictorial and excellent in general distribution, but the faces are frequently
                    wanting in drawing and character. He seldom succeeded in showing his sitters at
                    their best, and his female portraits, in particular, rarely gave satisfaction. A
                    favourable example of his cabinet-sized portraits is that of Sir Robert Liston;
                    his likeness of W. Esdaile is an admirable three-quarter length; and one of his
                    finest full-lengths is the gallery portrait of Lord Kellie, now in the town-hall
                    of Cupar.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of 1840 Wilkie resolved on a voyage to the East. In a letter to Sir
                    Robert Peel he states that his object was “to judge, not whether I can, but
                    whether <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n605/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0605-0570"/> those that are younger, or with far higher
                    attainments and powers, may not in future be required, in the advance and spread
                    of our knowledge, to refer at once to the localities of Scripture events, when
                    the great work is to be essayed of representing Scripture history,”—a sentence
                    which foreshadows the new direction and aims of Mr Holman Hunt and other modern
                    realists. Passing through Holland and Germany, he reached Constantinople, where,
                    while detained by the war in Syria, he painted a portrait of the young sultan.
                    He then sailed for Smyrna and travelled to Jerusalem, where he remained for some
                    five busy weeks. The last work of all upon which he was engaged was a portrait
                    of Mehemet Ali, done at Alexandria. On his return voyage he suffered from an
                    attack of illness at Malta, and died at sea off Gibraltar on the morning of 1st
                    June 1841. His body was consigned to the deep in the Bay of Gibraltar.</p>

                    rend="italic">Art Union Journal</hi> for January 1840. Apart from his skill as a
                    painter Wilkie was an admirable etcher. The best of his plates, such as the
                    Gentleman at his Desk (Laing, VII. ), the Pope examining a Censer (Laing, VIII.
                    ), and the Seat of Hands (Laing, IV.), are worthy to rank with the work of the
                    greatest figureetchers. During his lifetime he issued a portfolio of seven
                    plates, and in 1875 Dr David Laing catalogued and published the complete series
                    of his etchings and dry-points, supplying the place of a few copper-plates that
                    had been lost by reproductions, in his <hi rend="italic">Etchings of David
                    Wilkie and Andrew Geddes.</hi> (J. Μ. G. )</p>
