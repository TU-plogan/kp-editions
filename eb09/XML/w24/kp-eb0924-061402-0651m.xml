                    15,516), all German-speaking and nearly all Protestants. It is the point of
                    junction of eight lines of railway, and is therefore of considerable commercial
                    importance. Its main industries are cambric-weaving, cotton-printing, the
                    manufacture of machinery, and wine-growing, Stadtberg being the best variety of
                    wine grown in the neighbourhood of the town. It is a modern well-built town with
                    a fine town-hall and well-arranged school buildings. It was formerly very
                    wealthy and thriving, but has suffered severely from the disastrous financial
                    enterprise of the National Railway of Switzerland which it promoted. In 1878 it
                    had to sell its property in that line, and from 1881 to 1885 it was in great
                    difficulties in the matter of a loan of nine million francs guaranteed in 1874
                    by the town, together with three others in Aargau, to that ill-fated railway. As
                    the three co-guarantor towns were unable to pay their share, the whole burden
                    fell on Winterthur, which has struggled valiantly to meet its liabilities, and
                    has been helped by large loans from the cantonal and federal Governments.</p>
                <p>The Roman settlement of <hi rend="italic">Vitudurum</hi> (Celtic <hi
                    rend="italic">dur,</hi> water) was a little north-east of the present town, at
                    the place noλv known as Ober-Winterthur. It was there that in 919 Burkhard IL,
                    duke of Alemannia, defeated Rudolph IL, king of Transjurane Burgundy. It was
                    practically refounded in the valley in 1180 by the counts of Kyburg, who granted
                    it great liberty and privileges, making it the seat of their district court for
                    the Thurgau. In 1260 the townsmen, in their zeal for additional power, overthrew
                    the castle of the counts. In 1264 the town passed with the rest of the Kyburg
                    inheritance to the Hapsburgs, who showed very great favour to it, and thus
                    secured its unswerving loyalty. In 1292 the men of Zurich were beaten back in an
                    attempt to take the town. For a short time after the outlawry of Duke Frederick
                    of Austria, it became a free imperial city (1415-42); but after the conquest of
                    the Thurgau by the Swiss confederates (1460-61) Winterthur, which had gallantly
                    stood a nine weeks’ siege, was isolated in the midst of non·Austrian territory.
                    Hence it was sold by the duke to the town of Zurich in 1467, its rights and
                    liberties being reserved, and its history since then has been that of the other
                    lands ruled by Zurich. In 1717— 26 Zurich tried hard by means of heavy dues to
                    crush the rival silk and cotton industries at Winterthur, which, however, on the
                    whole very successfully maintained its ancient rights and liberties against the
                    encroachments of Zurich.</p>
