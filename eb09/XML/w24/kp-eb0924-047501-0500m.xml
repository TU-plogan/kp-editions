                    1733. He acquired the rudiments of his education at Dalkeith, and in his
                    fourteenth year was sent to the university of Edinburgh, where he matriculated
                    on 18th March 1746. It was from the first his desire to practise at the English
                    bar, though in deference to his father’s wishes he qualified as an advocate at
                    Edinburgh on 29th June 1754, and he did not neglect to enter himself at the
                    Inner Temple on 8th May 1753, so that he might keep the Easter and Trinity terms
                    in that year. His father was called to the bench in 1755, and for the next three
                    years Wedderburn stuck to his practice in Edinburgh, during which period he
                    zealously, with an eye to the main chance, employed his oratorical powers in the
                    General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and passed his evenings in the
                    social and argumentative clubs which abound in its capital. In 1755 a
                    short-lived precursor of the more famous <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>
                    of a later generation was started in Edinburgh, and it is chiefly remembered now
                    from the circumstance that in its pages Adam Smith criticized the dictionary of
                    Dr Johnson, and that the contents of its two numbers were edited by Wedderburn.
                    The dean of faculty at this time, Lockhart, afterwards Lord Covington, a lawyer
                    notorious for his harsh demeanour, in the autumn of 1757 assailed Wedderburn
                    with more than ordinary insolence. His victim retorted with extraordinary powers
                    of invective, and on being rebuked by the bench declined to retract or
                    apologize, but placed his gown upon the table, and with a low bow left the court
                    for ever. It was long supposed that this step was unpremeditated, but it is now
                    believed that the altercation only made him act upon his previous decision of
                    quitting the Scottish for the English courts. Through his prudence in having
                    taken the preliminary steps some years previously he was called to the English
                    bar at the Inner Temple on 25th November 1757. In his new position he acted with
                    characteristic energy. To shake off his native accent and to acquire the graces
                    of oratorical action, he engaged the services of Sheridan and Macklin. To secure
                    business and to conduct his cases with adequate knowledge, he diligently studied
                    the forms of English law, he solicited Strahan, the printer, “to get him
                    employed in city causes,” and he entered into social intercourse (as is noted in
                    Alexander Carlyle’s autobiography) with busy London solicitors, such as the
                    brothers Dagge. His local connexions and the incidents of his previous career
                    introduced him to the notice of his countrymen Lords Bute and Mansfield. When
                    Bute was prime minister this legal satellite used, says Dr Johnson, to go on
                    errands for him, and it is to Wedderburn’s credit that he first suggested to the
                    premier the propriety of granting Johnson a pension. Through the favour of the
                    royal favourite he was returned to parliament (28th December 1761) for the Ayr
                    burghs, and in consequence of the same patronage he was introduced into
                    Churchill’s <hi rend="italic">Rosciad</hi> as “a pert prim prater,” conspicuous
                    for “guilt in his heart and famine in his face.” In 1763 he became king’s
                    counsel and bencher of Lincoln’s Inn, and for a short time went the northern
                    circuits, but was more successful in obtaining business in the Court of
                    Chancery. He obtained a considerable addition to his resources (Carlyle puts the
                    amount at £10,000) on his marriage (31st December 1767) to Betty Anne, sole
                    child and heiress of John Dawson of Marly in Yorkshire. When George Grenville,
                    whose principles leaned to Toryism, quarrelled with the court, Wedderburn
                    affected to regard him as his leader in politics. At the dissolution in the
                    spring of 1768 he was returned by Sir Lawrence Dundas for Richmond as a Tory,
                    but in the struggles over Wilkes he took the popular side of “Wilkes and
                    liberty,” and resigned his seat (May 1769). In the opinion of the people he was
                    now regarded as the embodiment of all legal virtue; his health was toasted at
                    the dinners of the Whigs amid rounds of applause, and, in recompense for the
                    loss of his seat in parliament, he was returned by Lord Clive for his
                    pocket-borough of Bishop’s Castle, in Shropshire (January 1770). During the next
                    session he acted vigorously in opposition, but his conduct was always viewed
                    with distrust by his new associates, and his attacks on the ministry of Lord
                    North grew less and less animated in proportion to its apparent fixity of
                    tenure. In January 1771 he was offered and accepted the prize of
                    solicitor-general. The high road to the woolsack was now open to his steps, but
                    his defection from his former path has stamped his character with general
                    infamy. Junius wrote of him—“As for Mr Wedderburn, there is something about him
                    which even treachery cannot trust,” and Colonel Barré attacked him in the House
                    of Commons. The new law officer defended his conduct with the assertion that his
                    alliance in politics had been with Mr George Grenville, and that the connexion
                    had been severed on his death. In his new position his services were warmly
                    appreciated. He was cool and ready in debate, and when his advice was sought for
                    the deliberation of the cabinet it was given with promptness and energy. The
                    expression of Gibbon that Lord North “was upholden on either hand by the
                    majestic sense of Thurlow and the skilful eloquence of Wedderburn” was not
                    overstrained. All through the lengthened folly of the American War his
                    declamation was consistently employed against the cause of the colonies, but one
                    incident in his conduct is indelibly written in history. Dr Franklin obtained in
                    1773, by means of some unknown member of parliament, certain letters from crown
                    officials in Massachusetts, written before the outbreak of hostilities, and
                    recommending the employment of a military force for the suppression of the
                    discontent which prevailed in America. These letters he sent to the speaker of
                    the house of assembly, and that body thereupon prayed for the recall of the
                    officials. The application came before a committee of the privy council, when
                    Wedderburn, amid the unrestrained applause of the majority of the judges,
                    denounced Franklin in unmeasured terms, comparing “the coolness and apathy of
                    the wily New Englander” with the “revengeful temper of the negro Zanga” in Dr
                    Young’s play of the <hi rend="italic">Revenge.</hi> His victim preserved an
                    impassive demeanour, but was cut to the quick. Years afterwards, on the
                    termination of the war, when articles of peace were signed at Versailles—this is
                    the usually accepted version of a story on which some doubt has been
                    cast—Franklin wore the same clothes which he had worn when exposed to this
                    invective. In June 1778 Wedderburn was promoted to the post of attorneygeneral,
                    and in the same year he refused the dignity of chief baron of the exchequer
                    because the offer was not accompanied by the promise of a peerage. At the
                    dissolution in 1774 he had been returned for Okehampton in Devonshire, and for
                    Castle Rising in Norfolk, and selected the former constituency; on his promotion
                    as leading law officer of the crown he returned to his old love of Bishop’s
                    Castle. The coveted peerage was not long delayed. In June 1780 he was created
                    chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and he was at the same time
                    gratified by the title of Baron Loughborough. For thirteen years he presided
                    over this court, and, although his knowledge of the principles and precedents of
                    law was always deficient, his skill in marshalling his facts and his clearness
                    of diction made his appointment generally acceptable.</p>
                <p>During the existence of the coalition ministry of North and Fox, the great seal
                    was in commission (April to December 1783), and Lord Loughborough held <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n501/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0501-0476"/> the leading place among the commissioners. For
                    some time after its fall he was considered as the leader of the Whig party in
                    the House of Lords, and, had the illness of the king brought about the return of
                    the Whigs to power, the great seal would have been placed in his hands. The
                    king’s restoration to health secured Pitt’s continuance in office, and
                    disappointed the expectations of the Whigs. In 1792, during the period of the
                    French Revolution, Lord Loughborough seceded from Fox, and on the 28th January
                    1793 he received the great seal in the Tory cabinet of Pitt. In legal knowledge
                    he was exceeded by many of his predecessors, but his judgments were always
                    remarkable for their perspicuity, and in the appeal cases to the House of Lords,
                    where it was his function to criticize and elucidate the opinions of others, he
                    shone preeminent. All the political acts of the administration in which he
                    served met with his zealous support, and he remained faithful to his leader
                    until the question of Catholic emancipation became of urgent importance, when he
                    is supposed to have influenced by unfair means the mind of his sovereign. It was
                    probably through his advice that George III. refused his assent to Pitt’s
                    proposals, and that the removal of the disabilities under which the Catholics
                    groaned was delayed for another quarter of a century. When the prime minister
                    found that he could not carry out his compact with his Catholic fellow-subjects
                    he resigned, and Addington succeeded to his place. Much to Lord Loughborough’s
                    surprise, no place was found for him in Addington’s cabinet, and he was obliged
                    to resign his post of lord chancellor (14th April 1801). His first wife died
                    15th February 1781 without leaving issue, and he married in the following year
                    (12th September) Charlotte, youngest daughter of William, Viscount Courtenay,
                    but her only son died in childhood. Lord Loughborough accordingly obtained in
                    1795 a re-grant of his barony with remainder to his nephew, Sir James St Clair
                    Erskine. His fall in 1801 was softened by the grant of an earldom (he was
                    created earl of Rosslyn 21st April 1801, with remainder to his nephew), and by a
                    pension of &lt;£4000 per annum. After this date he rarely appeared in public,
                    but he was a constant figure at all the royal festivities. He attended one of
                    those gatherings at Frogmore, 31st December 1804. On the following day he was
                    seized with an attack of gout in the stomach, and on 2d January 1805 he died at
                    his seat, Baylis, near Salt Hill, Windsor. His remains were buried in St Paul’s
                    Cathedral on the 11th January.</p>
                <p>At the bar Wedderburn was the most elegant speaker of his time, but in legal
                    erudition he was excelled by many of his contemporaries, and he is said to have
                    been markedly afraid of Dunning’s forensic powers. For cool and sustained
                    declamation he stood unrivalled in parliament, and his readiness in debate was
                    universally acknowledged. In social life, in the company of the wits and writers
                    of his day, his faculties seemed to desert him. He was not only dull but the
                    cause of dulness in others, and even Alexander Carlyle confesses that in
                    conversation his illustrious countryman was “stiff and pompous.” In Wedderburn’s
                    character ambition banished all rectitude of principle, but the love of money
                    for money’s sake was not among his faults. (W. P. C.)</p>
