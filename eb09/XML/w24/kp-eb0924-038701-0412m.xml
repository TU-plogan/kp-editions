                <p><label type="entry">WASHINGTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">George</hi></label>
                    (1732-1799), the first president of the United States, was born in Westmoreland
                    county, Virginia, February 22 (Old Style, Feb. 11), 1732. One lawless
                    genealogist has traced his ancestry back to Odin. Another genealogy, since given
                    up with much regret, connected the family with the Washingtons of Northumberland
                    or Durham, England. The ancestry of Washington can be traced no farther back
                    than his greatgrandfather, John Washington, who settled in Virginia about 1657.
                    His eldest son, Lawrence, had three children —John, Augustine, and Mildred.
                    Augustine Washington married twice. By the first marriage, with Jane Butler,
                    there were four children, two of whom, Lawrence and Augustine, grew to manhood.
                    By the second marriage, with Mary Ball, in 1730, there were six children—George,
                    Betty, Samuel, John, Augustine, Charles, and Mildred. The father died when
                    George was but twelve years old; Lawrence inherited the estate now known as
                    Mount Vernon, and George his father’s usual residence, nearly opposite
                    Fredericksburgh.</p>
                <p>Very little is known of Washington’s early life, probably because there was
                    little unusual to tell. The story of the hatchet and the cherry-tree, and
                    similar tales, are quite apocryphal, having been coined by Washington’s most
                    popular biographer, Weems. The boy’s life was not different from that common to
                    Virginia families in easy circumstances: hunting, fishing, plantation affairs,
                    and a <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n413/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0413-0388"/> little reading made up its substance. His
                    education was but elementary and very defective, except in mathematics, in which
                    he was largely self-taught. Sparks has “edited” the spelling, grammar, and
                    rhetoric of Washington’s <hi rend="italic">Writings</hi> to such an extent as to
                    destroy their value as evidence. About 1748 we begin to know something of
                    Washington’s life. He was then at Mount Vernon with his half-brother Lawrence,
                    who was his guardian. Lawrence was the son-in-law of his neighbour Lord Fairfax,
                    with whom he had served at Carthagena, and had made the acquaintance of Admiral
                    Vernon, from whom Mount Vernon was named. A commission as midshipman was
                    obtained for George through the admiral, but the opposition of the boy’s mother
                    put an end to the scheme. As a substitute, the appointment as surveyor of the
                    enormous Fairfax property was given to Washington at the age of sixteen; and the
                    next three years of his life were spent in this service. He always retained a
                    disposition to speculate in Western lands; many of his later investments were of
                    this kind, and they are treated in Butterfield’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Washington-Crawford Letters.</hi> He seems already to have impressed others
                    with a belief in his force of mind and character, for at the age of nineteen,
                    when the first indications of the “French and Indian war” appeared, he was
                    appointed adjutant of the Virginia troops, with the rank of major; on the death
                    of his half-brother Lawrence in the following year he was executor under the
                    will, and residuary heir of Mount Vernon; and in 1753, when he had barely
                    attained his majority, the young man was made commander of the northern military
                    district of Virginia by the new lieutenant-governor, Dinwiddie. It is at this
                    point in his career that Washington appears in Thackeray’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Virginians,</hi> but the portrait there drawn of a “shrewd young man” on the
                    lookout for a rich wife is not accepted as life-like by Americans.</p>
                <p>At the outbreak of the French and Indian war in 1753-54 Washington was the agent
                    sent by Governor Dinwiddie to warn the French away from their new forts in
                    western Pennsylvania; the command of the Virginia troops who began hostilities
                    fell to him, and his vigorous defence of Fort Necessity (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">United States,</hi> vol. xxiii. pp. 734-35) made him so
                    prominent a figure that in 1755, at the age of twenty-three, he was commissioned
                    commander-in-chief of all the Virginia forces. He served in Braddock’s campaign,
                    and in the final defeat showed for the first time that fiery energy which always
                    lay hidden beneath his calm and unruffled exterior. He ranged the whole field on
                    horseback, making himself the most conspicuous mark for Indian bullets, and, in
                    spite of what he called the “dastardly behaviour” of the regular troops, brought
                    the little remnant of his Virginians out of action in fair order. In spite of
                    this reckless exposure he was one of the few unwounded officers. For a year or
                    two his task was that of “defending a frontier of more than 350 miles with 700
                    men but in 1758 he had the pleasure of commanding the advance guard of the
                    expedition which captured Fort Du Quesne and renamed it Fort Pitt. The war in
                    Virginia being then at an end, he resigned his post, married Mrs Custis, a
                    widow, and settled at Mount Vernon.</p>
                <p>Washington’s life for the next twenty years was merely that of a typical Virginia
                    planter, a consistent member of the Established (Episcopal) Church, a large
                    slaveholder, a strict but considerate master, and a widely trusted man of
                    affairs. His extraordinary escape in Braddock’s defeat had led a colonial
                    minister to declare in a sermon his belief that the young man had been preserved
                    to be “the saviour of his country.” If there was any such impression it soon
                    died away, and Washington gave none of his associates reason to consider him an
                    uncommonly endowed man. His marriage had brought him an increase of about
                    $100,000 in his estate; and his diaries show comparatively little reading, a
                    minutely methodical conduct of business, a wide acquaintance with the leading
                    men of the country, but no strong indications of what is usually considered to
                    be “greatness.” As in the case of Lincoln, he was educated into greatness by the
                    increasing weight of his responsibilities and the manner in which he met them.
                    Like others of the dominant caste in Virginia, he was repeatedly elected to the
                    legislature, but he is not known to have made any set speeches in that body, or
                    to have said anything beyond a statement of his opinion and the reasons for it.
                    That he thought a great deal, and took full advantage of his legislative
                    experiences as a political education, is shown by his letter of April 5, 1769,
                    to his neighbour George Mason, communicating the Philadelphia non-importation
                    resolutions, which had just reached him. He considers briefly the best peaceable
                    means of resistance to the policy of the ministry, but even at that early date
                    faces frankly and fully the probable final necessity of resisting by force, and
                    endorses it. Without speech-making, he took a prominent part in struggles of his
                    legislature against Governor Dunmore, and his position was always a radical one.
                    He even opposed petitions to the king and parliament, on the ground that the
                    question had been put by the ministry on the basis of right, not of expediency,
                    that the ministry could not abandon the right and the colonists could not admit
                    it, and that petitions must be, as they had been, rejected. “Shall we,” says he
                    in a letter, “after this whine and cry for relief ?” In 1774 the Virginia
                    Convention, appointing seven of its members as delegates to the Continental
                    Congress, named Washington as one of them; and with this appointment his
                    national career begins.</p>
                <p>Washington’s letters during his service in Congress show that he was under no
                    delusions as to the outcome of the taxation struggle, and that he expected war.
                    In one letter he says that if the ministerial policy is persisted in “more blood
                    will be shed than history has ever yet furnished instances of in the annals of
                    North America.” His associates in Congress recognized his military ability at
                    once, and most of the details of work looking towards preparations for armed
                    resistance were by common consent left to him. Even in the intervals of his
                    Congressional service he was occupied in urging on the formation, equipment, and
                    training of Virginia troops, and it was generally understood that, in case of
                    war, Virginia would expect him to act as her commander-in-chief. History was not
                    to be cheated in that fashion. The two most powerful colonies were Virginia and
                    Massachusetts. War began in Massachusetts; New England troops poured in almost
                    spontaneously; it was necessary to ensure the support of the colonies to the
                    southward; and the Virginia colonel who was at the head of all the military
                    committees was just the man whom the New England delegates desired. When
                    Congress, after the fights at Lexington and Concord, resolved to put the
                    colonies into a state of defence, the first practical step was the unanimous
                    selection, on motion of John Adams of Massachusetts, of Washington as
                    commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the United Colonies. Refusing any
                    salary, he accepted the position, asking “every gentleman in the room,” however,
                    to remember his declaration that he did not believe himself to be equal to the
                    command, and that he accepted it only as a duty made imperative by the unanimity
                    of the call. He reiterated this belief in private letters even to his wife; and
                    there seems to be no doubt that, to the day of his death, he was the most
                    determined sceptic as to his fitness for the positions to which he was called in
                    succession. He was commissioned June 19, 1775, and reached Cambridge, Mass.,
                    July 2, taking command of the levies there assembled for action against the
                    British <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n414/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0414-0389"/> garrison of Boston. The battle of Bunker Hill had
                    already taken place, and Washington’s work until the following spring was to
                    bring about some semblance of military discipline, to obtain ammunition and
                    military stores, to correspond with Congress and the colonial governors, to
                    guide military operations in the widely separated parts of a great continent, to
                    create a military system and organization for a people who were entirely
                    unaccustomed to such a thing and impatient under it, and to bend the course of
                    events steadily towards driving the British out of Boston. It is not easy to see
                    how Washington survived the year 1775; the colonial poverty, the exasperating
                    annoyances, the selfishness or stupidity which cropped out again and again from
                    the most patriotic of his coadjutors, were enough to have broken down most men.
                    They completed his training. The change in this one winter is very evident. If
                    he was not a great man when he went to Cambridge, he was a general and a
                    statesman in the best sense when he drove the British out of Boston in March
                    1776. From that time until his death he was the foremost man of the
                    continent.</p>
                <p>The military operations of the remainder of the war are given elsewhere(see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">United States,</hi> vol. xxiii. pp. 743-745). Washington’s
                    retreat through the Jerseys; the manner in which he turned and struck his
                    pursuers at Trenton and Princeton, and then established himself at Morristown so
                    as to make the way to Philadelphia impassable; the vigour with which he handled
                    his army at Chad’s Ford and Germantown; the persistence with which he held the
                    strategic position of Valley Forge through the dreadful winter of 1777-78, in
                    spite of the misery of his men, the clamours of the people, and the impotence of
                    the fugitive Congress,—all went to show that the fibre of his public character
                    had been hardened to its permanent quality. The Valley Forge winter was said to
                    be “the time that tried men’s souls :” Washington’s had no need to fear the
                    test. It was a serious addition to his burdens that the spirit which culminated
                    in Benedict Arnold chose this moment to make its appearance. Many of the
                    American officers had been affronted by the close personal friendship which had
                    sprung up between La Fayette and Washington, and by the diplomatic deference
                    which the commanderin-chief felt compelled to show to other foreign officers.
                    Some of the latter showed no gratitude. The name of one of them, Conway, an
                    Irish soldier of fortune from the French service, is attached to what was called
                    “Conway’s Cabal.” He formed a scheme for replacing Washington in the command by
                    Gates, who had just succeeded in forcing Burgoyne to surrender at Saratoga; and
                    a number of officers and men in civil life were mixed up in it. The methods
                    employed were the lowest forms of anonymous slander, and at the first breath of
                    exposure every one concerned hurried to cover up his part in it, leaving Conway
                    to shoulder all the responsibility. The treaty of 1778 with France put an end to
                    every such plan. It was a flat absurdity to expect foreign nations to deal with
                    a second rate man as commander-in-chief while Washington was in existence, and
                    he seems to have had no more trouble of this kind. The prompt and vigorous
                    pursuit of Clinton across the Jerseys towards New York, and the battle of
                    Monmouth, in which the plan of battle was thwarted by Charles Lee, another of
                    the foreign officers, closed the direct military record of Washington until the
                    end of the war. The enemy confined their movements to other parts of the
                    continent, and Washington did little more than watch their headquarters in New
                    York city. It was more than appropriate, however, that he who had been the
                    mainspring of the war, and had borne far more than his share of its burdens and
                    discouragements, should end it with the campaign of Yorktown, conceived by
                    himself, and the surrender of Cornwallis. The war was then really over, but the
                    commander-in-chief retained his commission until December 28, 1783, when he
                    returned it to Congress, then in session at Annapolis, Md., and retired to Mount
                    Vernon.</p>
                <p>By this time the canonization of Washington had fairly begun. He occupied such a
                    position in the American political system as no man could possibly hold again.
                    He had become a political element, quite apart from the Union, the States, or
                    the people of either. In a country where communication was still slow and
                    difficult, the general knowledge that Washington favoured anything superseded
                    argument and the necessity of information with very many men. His constant
                    correspondence with the governors of the States gave him a quasi-paternal
                    attitude towards government in general. On resigning his commission, for
                    example, he was able to do what no other man could have done with propriety or
                    safety: he addressed a circular letter to the governors of the States, pointing
                    out changes in the existing form of government which he believed to be
                    necessary. His refusal to accept a salary, as general or as president, would
                    have been taken as affectation or impertinence in anyone else; it seemed natural
                    and proper enough in the case of Washington, but it was his peculiar privilege.
                    It is possible that he might have had a crown if he had even been willing. The
                    army, at the end of the war, was justly dissatisfied with its treatment. The
                    officers were called to meet at Newburgh, and it was the avowed purpose of the
                    leaders of the movement that the army should march westward, appropriate vacant
                    lands, leave Congress to negotiate for peace without an army, and “mock at their
                    calamity and laugh when their fear cometh.” It was the less publicly avowed
                    purpose to make their commander-in-chief king, if he could be persuaded to aid
                    in establishing a monarchy. Washington put a summary stop to the whole
                    proceeding. Their letter to him detailed the weakness of a republican form of
                    government as they had experienced it, their desire for “a mixed government,”
                    with him at its head, and their belief that “the title of king” would be
                    objectionable to few and of material advantage to the country. His reply was
                    peremptory, and even angry. He stated in plain terms his abhorrence of the
                    proposal; he was at a loss to conceive what part of his conduct could have
                    encouraged their address; they could not have found “a person to whom their
                    schemes were more disagreeable;” and he threatened them with exposure unless the
                    affair was stopped at once. His influence, and that alone, secured the quiet
                    disbanding of the discontented army. His influence was as powerful after he had
                    retired to Mount Vernon as before his resignation. He was in constant
                    correspondence with public men in every part of the country. He received from
                    them such a store of suggestions as came to no other man, digested it, and was
                    able from it to speak with what seemed infallible wisdom. In the midst of his
                    voluminous correspondence, the minute details in his diaries of tree-planting
                    and rotation of crops, and his increasing reading on the political side of
                    history, he found time for a stream of visitors. Among these, in March 1785,
                    were the commissioners from Virginia and Maryland, who met at Alexandria to form
                    a commercial code for Chesapeake Bay, and made an opportunity to visit Mount
                    Vernon. From that moment the current of events, leading into the Annapolis
                    convention of 1786 and the final convention of the next year, shows Washington’s
                    close supervision at every point.</p>
                <p>When the Federal Convention met at Philadelphia in May 1787 to frame the present
                    constitution he was present as a delegate from Virginia, though much against his
                    will; and a unanimous vote at once made him its presiding officer. He took no
                    part in the debates, however, beyond <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0415-0390"/> such suggestive hints as his proposal to amend a
                    restriction of the standing army to 5000 men by forbidding any enemy to invade
                    the United States with more than 3000. He approved the constitution which was
                    decided upon, believing, as he said, “that it was the best constitution which
                    could be obtained at that epoch, and that this or a dissolution awaits our
                    choice, and is the only alternative.” All his influence was given to secure its
                    ratification, and his influence was probably decisive. When it had been
                    ratified, and the time came to elect a president, there was no more hesitation
                    than if the country had been a theocracy. The office of president had been “cut
                    to fit the measure of George Washington,” and no one thought of any other person
                    for it. The unanimous vote of the electors made him the first president of the
                    United States; their unanimous vote re-elected him in 1792-93; and, even after
                    he had positively refused to serve for a third term, two electors obstinately
                    voted for him in 1796-97. The public events of his presidency are given
                    elsewhere (see <hi rend="smallcaps">United States,</hi> vol. xxiii. pp.
                    752-755). One can hardly follow them without receiving the conviction that the
                    sudden success of the new system was due mainly to the existence at that time of
                    such a character as Washington. He held the two natural parties apart, and
                    prevented party contest until the new form of government had been firmly
                    established. It seems hardly possible that the final result should have been
                    baulked, even if “blood and iron” had been necessary to bring it about. It would
                    be unwise to attribute the quiet attainment of the result to the political sense
                    of the American people alone, or to use it as an historical precedent for the
                    voluntary assumption of such a risk again, without the advantage of such a
                    political factor as Washington.</p>
                <p>No greater mistake could be made, however, than to think that the influence of
                    the president was fairly appreciated during his term of office. He attempted to
                    balance party against party, to divide his cabinet between them, and to
                    neutralize the effects of parties in that way. The consequence was that the two
                    leading members of the cabinet soon occupied the position, to use the words of
                    one of them, of “two game-cocks in a pit.” The unconscious drift of Washington’s
                    mind was toward the Federal party; his letters to La Fayette and Henry, in
                    December 1798 and January 1799, are enough to make that evident. When the
                    Republican party was formed, about 1793, it could not have been expected that
                    its leaders would long submit with patience to the continual interposition of
                    Washington’s name and influence between themselves and their opponents; but they
                    maintained a calm exterior. Some of their followers were less discreet. The
                    president’s proclamation of neutrality between France and Great Britain excited
                    them to anger; his support of Jay’s treaty with Great Britain roused them to
                    fury. Forged letters, purporting to show his desire to abandon the revolutionary
                    struggle, were published; he was accused of drawing more than his salary; hints
                    of the propriety of a guillotine for his benefit began to appear; some spoke of
                    him as the “stepfather of his country.” The attacks embittered the close of his
                    term of service; he declared, in a cabinet meeting in 1793, that “he had never
                    repented but once the having slipped the moment of resigning his office, and
                    that was every moment since.” Indeed, the most unpleasant portions of
                    Jefferson’s <hi rend="italic">Ana</hi> are those in which, with an air of
                    psychological dissection, he details the storms of passion into which the
                    president was hurried by the newspaper attacks upon him. These attacks, however,
                    came from a very small fraction of the politicians; the people never wavered in
                    their devotion to the president, and his election would have been unanimous in
                    1796, as in 1789 and 1792, if he had been willing to serve.</p>
                <p>All accounts agree that Washington was of imposing presence. He measured just 6
                    feet when prepared for burial; but his height, in his prime, as given in his
                    orders for clothes from London, was 3 inches more. La Fayette says that his
                    hands were “the largest he ever saw on a man.” Custis says that his complexion
                    was “fair, but considerably florid.” His weight was about 220 lb. The various
                    and widely-differing portraits of him find exhaustive treatment in the seventh
                    volume of Winsor’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative and Critical History of the
                    United States.</hi> The editor thinks that “the favourite profile has been
                    unquestionably Houdon’s, with Stuart’s canvass for the full face, and probably
                    Trumbull’s for the figure.” Stuart’s face, however, gives the popular notion of
                    Washington, though it has always been a subject of curious speculation to some
                    minds how much of the calm and benign expression of the face was due to the
                    shape of Washington’s false teeth.</p>
                <p>Washington was childless: said the people of his time, he was the father only of
                    his country. Collateral branches of the family have given the Lees, the
                    Custises, and other families a claim to an infusion of the blood; but no direct
                    descendants of Washington can claim his honours, or disgrace his name. His
                    estate of Mount Vernon was acquired in 1858 by an association, and has been
                    practically national property ever since.</p>
                <p>Retiring from the presidency in 1797, Washington resumed the plantation life
                    which he most loved, the society of his family, and the care of his slaves. He
                    had resolved some time before never to obtain another slave, and “wished from
                    his soul” that his State could be persuaded to abolish slavery; “it might
                    prevent much future mischief.” He was too old, however, to attempt further
                    innovations. In 1798 he was made commanderin-chief of the provisional army
                    raised in expectation of open war with France, and was fretted almost beyond
                    endurance by the quarrels of Federalist politicians about the distribution of
                    commissions. In the midst of his military preparations, he was struck down by
                    sudden illness, which lasted but for a day, and he died at Mount Vernon,
                    December 14, 1799. The third of the series of resolutions introduced in the
                    house of representatives five days after his death, by John Marshall, and passed
                    unanimously, states exactly, if a trifle rhetorically, the position of
                    Washington in American history: “first in war, first in peace, and first in the
                    hearts of his countrymen.”</p>
                <p>Washington’s disorder was an oedematous affection of the wind-pipe, contracted by
                    careless exposure during a ride in a snow-storm, and aggravated by neglect
                    afterwards, and by such contemporary remedies as excessive bleeding, gargles of
                    “molasses, vinegar, and butter” and “vinegar and sage tea,” which “almost
                    suffocated him,” and a blister of cantharides on the throat. He died without
                    theatrical adieus; his last words were only business directions, affectionate
                    remembrances to relatives, and repeated apologies to the physicians and
                    attendants for the trouble he was giving them. Just before he died, says his
                    secretary, Mr Lear, he felt his own pulse; his countenance changed; the
                    attending physician placed his hands over the eyes of the dying man, “and he
                    expired without a struggle or a sigh.”</p>
