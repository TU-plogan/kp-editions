                <p><label type="entry">WAXWING</label>, a bird first so-called apparently by Selby
                    in 1825 <hi rend="italic">(Illustr. Brit. Ornithology,</hi> p. 87), having been
                    before known as the “Silk-tail” <hi rend="italic">(Philos. Transactions,</hi>
                    1G85, p. 1161)—a literal rendering of the German <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seidenschwanz—</hi> or “Chatterer ”—the prefix “German,” “Bohemian,” or “Waxen”
                    being often also applied. Selby’s convenient name has now been generally
                    adopted, since the bird is readily distinguished from almost all others by the
                    curious expansion of the shaft of some of its wingfeathers at the tip into a
                    flake that looks like scarlet sealing-wax, while its exceedingly silent habit
                    makes the name “Chatterer” wholly inappropriate, and indeed this last arose from
                    a misinterpretation of the specific term <hi rend="italic">garrulus,</hi>
                    meaning a Jay (from the general resemblance in colour of the two birds), and not
                    referring to any garrulous quality. It is the <hi rend="italic">Ampelis
                    garrulus</hi> of Linnaeus and of more recent ornithologists.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some writers, ignoring
                    historical facts, have taken a South-American form (now known to belong to a
                    wholly distinct Suborder of Birds) as the “type” of the Linnaean genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Ampelis.</hi> Linnaeus had, as is well known, no conception of
                    what is meant by the modem idea of a “type”; but none can doubt that, if such a
                    notion had been entertained by him, he would have declared his type-species to
                    be that to which the name was first applied, viz., the present, and hence those
                    systematists are wrong who would remove this to a genus variously called <hi
                    rend="italic">Bombycilla, Bombiciphora,</hi> or, most absurd of all, <hi
                    rend="italic">Bombicivora.</hi> The birds which ought to be removed from <hi
                    rend="italic">Ampelis</hi> are those which are now generally recognized as
                    forming a Family <hi rend="italic">Cotingidae,</hi> allied to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pipridae (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Manakin),</hi> and like
                    them peculiar to the Neotropical Region, in the fauna of which they constitute,
                    according to the investigations of Garrod and Forbes <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Ornithology,</hi> vol. xviii. pp. 41, 47), the natural group <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Waxwing is a bird that for many years excited vast interest. An irregular
                    winter-visitant, sometimes in countless hordes, to the whole of the central and
                    some parts of southern Europe, it was of old time looked upon as the harbinger
                    of war, plague, or death, and, while its harmonious coloration and the grace of
                    its form were attractive, the curiosity with which its irregular appearances
                    were regarded was enhanced by the mystery which enshrouded its birthplace, and
                    until the summer of 1856 defied the searching of any explorer. In that year,
                    however, all doubt was dispelled, through the successful search in Lapland,
                    organized by the late John Wolley, as briefly described by him to the Zoological
                    Society <hi rend="italic">(Proceedings,</hi> 1857, pp. 55, 56, pl. cxxii.).<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A fuller account of his
                    discovery, illustrated by Hewitson, is given in <hi rend="italic">The Ibis</hi>
                    (1861, pp. 92-106, pl. iv.).</p></note> In 1858 Mr Dresser found a small
                    settlement of the species on an island in the Baltic near Uleåborg, and with his
                    own hands took a nest. It is now pretty evident that the Waxwing, though
                    doubtless breeding yearly in some parts of northern Europe, is as irregular in
                    the choice of its summer-quarters as in that of its winter-retreats. Moreover,
                    the species exhibits the same irregular habits in America. Mr Drexler on one
                    occasion, in Nebraska, saw it in “millions.” In 1861 Kennicott found it breeding
                    on the Yukon, and later Mr MacFarlane had the like good fortune on the Anderson
                    River.</p>
                <p>Beautiful as is the bird with its drooping crest, its cinnamon-brown<pb

                    and relieved by black, white, and yellow—all of the purest tint—the external
                    feature which has invited most attention is the “sealing-wax” (already
                    mentioned) which tips some of the secondary or radial quills, and occasionally
                    those of the tail.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    structure of these appendages has been carefully described by Herr Andersen <hi
                    rend="italic">(Oefvers. K. Vet.-Ak. Förhandlingar,</hi> 1859, pp. 219- 231, pl.
                    ii.). Their development seems chiefly due to age, though, as Wolley shewed, they
                    are perceptible in the nestling plumage. Mr Turner states (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Contr. Nat. Hist. Alaska,</hi> p. 177) that the Eskimo name of the Waxwing
                    means a “killer of small birds,” these appendages being held to be “the clotted
                    blood of its victims”!</p></note> This is nearly as much exhibited by the
                    kindred species, <hi rend="italic">A. cedrorum—</hi> the well-known Cedar-bird
                    of the English in North America—which is easily distinguished by its smaller
                    size, less black chin-spot, the yellower tinge of the lower parts, and the want
                    of white on the wings. In the <hi rend="italic">A. phoenicopterus</hi> of
                    south-eastern Siberia and Japan, the remiges and rectrices are tipped with red
                    in the ordinary way without dilatation of the shaft of the feathers.</p>
                <p>Both the Waxwing and Cedar-bird seem to live chiefly on insects in summer, but
                    are marvellously addicted to berries during the rest of the year, and will gorge
                    themselves if opportunity allow. Hence they are not pleasant cage-birds, though
                    quickly becoming tame. The erratic habits of the Waxwing are probably due
                    chiefly to the supplies of food it may require, prompted also by the number of
                    mouths to be fed, for there is some reason to think that this varies greatly
                    from one year to another, according to season. The flocks which visit Britain
                    and other countries outside the breeding range of the species naturally contain
                    a very large proportion of young birds.</p>
                <p>The systematic position of the genus <hi rend="italic">Ampelis</hi> is very
                    doubtful. It can hardly be said to have any near ally, for neither of the
                    Neotropical and Antillean genera, <hi rend="italic">Ptilogonys</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Myiodectes</hi> (often erroneously spelt <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myiadestes),</hi> can as yet be safely declared of kin to it, as has been
                    alleged. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
