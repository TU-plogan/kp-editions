                    most popular national hero of Scotland, is believed to have been the second son
                    of Sir Malcolm Wallace of Elderslie and Auchinbothie, in Renfrewshire. The date
                    of his birth is not certainly ascertained, but is usually given as 1270. The
                    only authority for the events of his early life is the metrical history of Blind
                    Harry. That authority cannot be implicitly relied on, though we need not
                    conclude that the minstrel invented the stories he relates. He lived about two
                    centuries later than Wallace, during which a considerable body of legend had
                    probably gathered round the name, and these popular “gestis” he incorporates in
                    his narrative. At the same time he professes to follow as his “autour” an
                    account that had been written in Latin by John Blair, the personal friend and
                    chaplain of Wallace himself. As Blair’s account has perished, we cannot tell how
                    far the minstrel has faithfully followed his authority, but some comparatively
                    recent discoveries have confirmed the truth of portions of the narrative which
                    had previously been doubted. At best, however, his authority must be regarded
                    with suspicion, except when it is confirmed by other and more trustworthy
                    evidence.</p>
                <p>Only for a period of less than two years in his life— from the beginning of the
                    insurrection in 1297 to the battle of Falkirk—does Wallace come before us in the
                    clearest historical light. With the exception of one or two glimpses of him that
                    we obtain from authentic historical documents, the recorded events of his later
                    as of his earlier life rest on no more certain authority than that of Blind
                    Harry.</p>
                <p>In his boyhood, according to the usual accounts, he resided for some time at
                    Dunipace, in Stirlingshire, with an uncle, who is styled “parson” of the place.
                    By this uncle he was partially educated, and from him he imbibed an enthusiastic
                    love of liberty. His education was continued at Dundee, where he made the
                    acquaintance of John Blair. On account of an incident that happened at
                    Dundee—his slaughter of a young Englishman named Selby, for an insult offered to
                    him—he is said to have been outlawed, and so driven into rebellion against the
                    English. Betaking himself to the wilds of the country, he gradually gathered
                    round him a body of desperate men whom he led in various attacks upon the
                    English. In consequence of the success of these early enterprises his following
                    largely increased, several of the more patriotic nobles—including the steward of
                    Scotland, Sir Andrew Moray, Sir John de Graham, Douglas the Hardy, Wishart,
                    bishop of Glasgow, and others—having joined him. His insurrection now became
                    more open and pronounced, and his enterprises of greater importance. An attack
                    was made upon the English justiciar, Ormsby, who was holding his court at Scone.
                    The justiciar himself escaped, but many of his followers <pb break="no"

                    of Ayr, the quarters of English soldiers, in revenge for the treacherous
                    slaughter of his uncle, Sir Ronald Crawford, and other Scottish noblemen,
                    followed. The success of these exploits induced the English king to take
                    measures for staying the insurrection. A large army, under the command of Sir
                    Henry Percy and Sir Robert Clifford, was sent against the insurgents, and came
                    up with them at Irvine. Dissensions broke out among the Scottish leaders, and
                    all Wallace’s titled friends left him and made submission to Edward, except the
                    ever faithful Sir Andrew Moray. The treaty of Irvine, by which these Scottish
                    nobles agreed to acknowledge Edward as their sovereign lord, is printed in
                    Rymer’s <hi rend="italic">Foedera.</hi> It is dated 9th July 1297, and is the
                    first public document in which the name of Sir William Wallace occurs. Wallace
                    retired to the north, and although deserted by the barons was soon at the head
                    of a large army. The vigour and success of his operations was such that in a
                    short time he succeeded in recovering almost all the fortresses held by the
                    English to the north of the Forth. He had begun the siege of Dundee when he
                    received information that an English army, led by the earl of Surrey and
                    Cressingham the treasurer, was on its march northward. Leaving the citizens of
                    Dundee to continue the siege of the castle, he made a rapid march to Stirling.
                    Encamping in the neighbourhood of the Abbey Craig—on which now stands the
                    national monument to his memory—he watched the passage of the Forth. After an
                    unsuccessful attempt to bring Wallace to terms, the English commander, on the
                    morning of 11th September 1297, began to cross the bridge. When about one-half
                    of his army had crossed, and while they were still in disorder, they were
                    attacked with such fury by Wallace, that almost all—Cressingham among the
                    number—were slain, or driven into the river and drowned. Those on the south side
                    of the river were seized with panic and fled tumultuously, having first set fire
                    to the bridge. The Scots, however, crossed by a ford, and continued the pursuit
                    of the enemy as far as Berwick. Sir Andrew Moray fell in this battle. The
                    results of it were important. The English were everywhere driven from Scotland.
                    To increase the alarm of the English, as well as to relieve the famine which
                    then prevailed, Wallace organized a great raid into the north of England, in the
                    course of which he devastated the country to the gates of Newcastle. On his
                    return he was elected guardian of the kingdom. In this office he set himself to
                    reorganize the army and to regulate the affairs of the country. His measures
                    were marked by much wisdom and vigour, and for a short time succeeded in
                    securing order, even in the face of the jealousy and opposition of the nobles.
                    Edward was in Flanders when the news of this successful revolt reached him. He
                    hastened home, and at the head of a great army entered Scotland in July 1298.
                    Wallace was obliged to adopt the only plan of campaign which could give any hope
                    of success. He slowly retired before the English monarch, driving off all
                    supplies and wasting the country. The nobles as usual for the most part deserted
                    his standard. Those that remained thwarted his councils by their jealousies. His
                    plan, however, came very near being successful. Edward, compelled by famine, had
                    already given orders for a retreat when he received information of Wallace’s
                    position and intentions. The army, then at Kirkliston, was immediately set in
                    motion, and next morning (July 22, 1298) Wallace was brought to battle in the
                    vicinity of Falkirk. After an obstinate fight the Scots were overpowered and
                    defeated with great loss. Among the slain was Sir John de Graham, the bosom
                    friend of Wallace, whose death, as Blind Harry tells, threw the hero into a
                    frenzy of rage and grief. The account of his distress is one of the finest and
                    most touching passages in the poem. With the remains of his army Wallace found
                    refuge for the night in the Torwood —known to him from his boyish life at
                    Dunipace. He then retreated to the north, burning the town and castle of
                    Stirling on his way. He resigned the office of guardian, and betook himself
                    again to a wandering life and a desultory and predatory warfare against the
                    English. At this point his history again becomes obscure. He is known to have
                    paid a visit to France, with the purpose of obtaining aid for his country from
                    the French king. This visit is narrated with many untrustworthy details by Blind
                    Harry; but the fact is established by other and indisputable evidence. When in
                    the winter of 1303-4 Edward received the submission of the Scottish nobles,
                    Wallace was expressly excepted from all terms. And after the capture of Stirling
                    Castle and Sir William Oliphant, and the submission of Sir Simon Fraser, he was
                    left alone, but resolute as ever in refusing allegiance to the English king. A
                    price was set upon his head, and the English governors and captains in Scotland
                    had orders to use every means for his capture. On the 5th August 1305 he was
                    taken—as is generally alleged, through treachery—at Robroyston, near Glasgow, by
                    Sir John Menteith, carried to the castle of Dumbarton, and thence conveyed in
                    fetters and strongly guarded to London. He reached London on the 22d August, and
                    next day was taken to Westminster Hall, where he was impeached as a traitor by
                    Sir Peter Mallorie, the king’s justice. To the accusation Wallace made the
                    simple reply that he could not be a traitor to the king of England, for he never
                    was his subject, and never swore fealty to him. He was found guilty and
                    condemned to death. The sentence was executed the same day with circumstances of
                    unusual cruelty.</p>
                <p>The cause of national independence was not lost with the life of Wallace.
                    Notwithstanding the cruelty and indignity amid which it terminated, that life
                    was not a failure. It has been an inspiration to his countrymen ever since. The
                    popular ideas regarding his stature, strength, bodily prowess, and undaunted
                    courage are confirmed by the writers nearest his own time—Wyntoun and Fordun.
                    And indeed no man could in that age have secured the personal ascendency which
                    he did without the possession of these qualities. The little we know of his
                    statesmanship during the short period he was in power gives proof of political
                    wisdom. His patriotism was conspicuous and disinterested. He was well skilled in
                    the modes of warfare that suited the country and the times. That he failed in
                    freeing his country from the yoke of England was due chiefly to the jealousy
                    with which he was regarded by the men of rank and power. But he had a nobler
                    success in inspiring his countrymen with a spirit which made their ultimate
                    conquest impossible. (A. F. H.)</p>
