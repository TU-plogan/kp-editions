                    Oberholzheim, a Swabian village near Biberach, then an imperial city. He was
                    carefully educated by his father, who was a clergyman at Oberholzheim; and at a
                    very early age he gave evidence of a strong literary impulse. In his fourteenth
                    year he was sent to the school of Klosterbergen, near Magdeburg, where he
                    attracted a good deal of attention, not only by his knowledge of the classics
                    and of French and English literature, but by his power of lucid and graceful
                    expression. When he was about sixteen he left school and went to live with a
                    relative at Erfurt, who undertook to prepare him for the university by reading
                    with him the writings of the philosopher Wolff. Having spent a year and a half
                    with this relative, he went for some time to Biberach, whither his father had
                    been transferred from Oberhqlzheim. At Biberach he met a young kinswoman, Sophie
                    Gutermann, with whom he fell in love, and who exercised a powerful influence
                    upon the development of his intellect and imagination. While talking with her,
                    after they had heard his father preach a sermon on the text “God is Love,” he
                    conceived the scheme of his first poem, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Natur der Dinge.</hi> In 1750 he went to the university of
                    Tübingen, nominally for the purpose of studying law; but in reality he devoted
                    his attention wholly to literature. At Tübingen he wrote his poem on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nature of Things,</hi> and in 1752 it was published anonymously.
                    Here also he wrote <hi rend="italic">Anti-Ovid, Lol&gt;gesang</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">auf</hi><hi rend="italic">den</hi><hi rend="italic">Frühling,
                    Moralische Briefe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Moralische Erzählungen.</hi> At
                    home Wieland had been strictly brought up, and his home training had been
                    confirmed at the Klosterbergen school, the head-master of which was a member of
                    the straitest sect of the Pietists. In his early writings, therefore, Wieland
                    appears as a youth of a deeply serious disposition, with an ardent enthusiasm
                    for what he conceives to be the highest ideas of theology and ethics.</p>
                <p>Bodmer, the Swiss critic and poet, strongly attracted by this new literary force,
                    cordially invited Wieland to visit him at Zurich. Wieland accepted the
                    invitation, and lived for many months in Bodmer’s house. In 1754 the two friends
                    parted; for, although they had apparently the same aims and motives, they were
                    in reality very unlike one another, and Bodmer was apt to play rather too
                    ostentatiously the part of a guide and patron. Wieland continued to reside in
                    Switzerland, remaining in Zurich about <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n594/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0594-0559"/> five years and in Bern about a year, and
                    supporting himself by working as a tutor. During the early part of his residence
                    in Switzerland Wieland maintained the serious tone that had marked his first
                    writings. In his <hi rend="italic">Briefe</hi><hi rend="italic">von</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Verstorbenen</hi><hi rend="italic">an</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >hinterlassene Freunde, Sympathien, Empfindungen eines Christen,</hi> and other
                    works of this period he sought to give expression to the loftiest spiritual
                    aspirations; and in the letter in which he dedicated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Empfindungen</hi> to the court preacher Sack, in Berlin, he went out of his way
                    to rebuke the frivolity of certain Anacreontic poets, whom he denounced as “a
                    band of epicurean pagans.” But Wieland’s mystical and ascetic doctrines did not
                    at all correspond to his real impulses, and soon after he left Bodmer’s house he
                    began to feel that he had misunderstood his own character. His piety became less
                    enthusiastic, and he learned to have a keen appreciation of pleasures which he
                    had formerly condemned as incompatible with any high or worthy conception of the
                    ends of human life. This change led to a kind of literary activity wholly
                    different from that by which he had made his reputation. He wrote two dramas,
                    <hi rend="italic">Johanna Grey</hi> (in which he made free use of Rowe’s play
                    <hi rend="italic">Lady Jane Gref)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Clementina von
                    Poretta∙,</hi> and he chose as the subject of an epic poem the career of Cyrus,
                    who was to be presented as a hero closely resembling Frederick the Great. <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyrus</hi> he never finished; but he completed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Araspes</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Panthea,</hi> a poem in
                    which he developed an episode from the <hi rend="italic">Cyropaedia</hi> of
                    Xenophon.</p>
                <p>In 1760 he settled at Biberach as director of the chancery. The appointment was a
                    poor one, and for a time Wieland found life at Biberach extremely dull and
                    tiresome. By and by, however, he made the acquaintance of Count Stadion, an
                    experienced man of the world, at whose house Wieland became a constant visitor;
                    there he met, among many other persons whose society he liked, his first love,
                    Sophie, who had married Von Laroche, the count’s confidential friend and
                    “factotum.” Under these new influences the change of tone which had been begun
                    in Switzerland was soon completed; and in <hi rend="italic">Don Sylvio von
                    Rosalva</hi> (1764), a romance, intended to be taken as an imitation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> he gave himself the pleasure of laughing at
                    principles and sentiments which he had formerly held to be sacred. This work was
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">Komische Erzählungen</hi> (1766), the cynical
                    grossness of which far surpassed that of any contemporary German writer. Wieland
                    himself seems to have felt that in these tales he had gone too far, for,
                    although in his next work, <hi rend="italic">Agathon</hi> (1766-67), the hero of
                    which is a disciple of Plato, he sometimes treads on slippery ground, his
                    ultimate aim is to show that the true rule of life is to hold the balance even
                    between the spiritual and the physical impulses of man. His unfinished <hi
                    rend="italic">Idris</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Zenide</hi>
                    (1768) has a less worthy motive; but in the didactic poem <hi rend="italic"
                    >Musarion</hi> (1768) he returned to the idea of <hi rend="italic">Agathon,</hi>
                    that fanaticism and sensuality are equally opposed to enduring happiness, and
                    that he is most to be envied who knows how to gratify all legitimate impulses
                    without allowing any of them to become unduly powerful. To Wieland, when his
                    mind and character were fully developed, this law of conduct seemed to be the
                    highest to which man can attain, and he was never tired of indirectly expounding
                    it in his later writings. At Biberach he devoted much time to the study of
                    Shakespeare, and in 1762-66 he published, in eight volumes, translations of
                    twenty-two of Shakespeare’s plays.</p>
                <p>In 1765 Wieland had married a lady of Augsburg, to whom he was warmly attached.
                    Four years afterwards he was made professor of philosophy at Erfurt, where he
                    remained until 1772. During his stay at Erfurt he wrote <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dialogen</hi><hi rend="italic">des Diogenes von Sinope;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Beitrage zur geheimen</hi><hi rend="italic">Geschichte des menschlichen
                    Verstandes und Herzens, aus den Archiven der Natur; Der goldene Spiegel; Die
                    Grazien,</hi> a didactic poem; <hi rend="italic">Comb</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >abus,</hi> a disagreeable tale in verse; and <hi rend="italic">Der neue</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Amadis,</hi> a comic poem in eighteen cantos.</p>
                <p>In 1772 Wieland settled for life at Weimar, his position at first being that of a
                    tutor to the two sons of the duchess Anna Amalia. Here he founded the monthly
                    periodical, <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Deutsche Mercur,</hi>
                    which he edited until 1796. For this periodical he wrote constantly, and,
                    considering the immense number of his productions, it is surprising that he was
                    able to maintain, oh the whole, so high a level of excellence. By far the best
                    of his works is the poem <hi rend="italic">Oberon,</hi> the only work by him
                    which has still a wide circle of readers in Germany. It was published in 1780.
                    Among other original writings produced in Weimar may be named a comic romance,
                    <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Geschichte</hi><hi rend="italic">der
                    Abderiten</hi> (1774), <hi rend="italic">Der verklagte Amor</hi> (1774), <hi
                    rend="italic">Das Wintermarchen</hi> (1776), and <hi rend="italic">Das
                    Sommermarchen</hi> (1777). In 1782 and 1786 appeared translations of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistles</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> of Horace; and in
                    1788 and 1789 he issued a translation of Lucian, his study of whom led to his
                    writing <hi rend="italic">Neue</hi><hi rend="italic">G'ottergesprache</hi>
                    (1791), <hi rend="italic">Geheime Geschichte des Philosophen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Peregrinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Proteus</hi> (1791), and <hi
                    rend="italic">Agathodamon</hi> (1799). From 1793 to 1802 he was engaged in
                    issuing a revised edition of his writings; but in 1796 he found time to
                    establish a new periodical, <hi rend="italic">Das Attische</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Museum,</hi> in which he printed, among other things, translations of some of
                    the comedies of Aristophanes. In 1797 Wieland bought Osmannstädt, an estate near
                    Weimar; and there he lived for some years with his large family. At Osmannstädt
                    he wrote his last important romance, <hi rend="italic">Aristipp</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">und einige</hi><hi rend="italic">seiner</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Zeitgenossen</hi> (1800-2). In 1801 his wife died, and two years afterwards he
                    sold his estate and returned to Weimar, where he spent his last years in
                    translating and annotating the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> of Cicero. He died
                    on 20th January 1813.</p>
                <p>Wieland was a man of many moods, and his friends, when talking with him, could
                    never be quite sure that they would not unintentionally offend him. But,
                    although vain and over-sensitive, he often gave evidence of an essentially
                    humane and generous spirit. As a writer he lacked force of imagination and depth
                    of feeling; and even at his best he had too narrow a range of vision to be a
                    great moral teacher. Nevertheless, he has an important place in the history of
                    German literature. He was the founder in Germany of the psychological romance,
                    and few of his successors in this kind have surpassed his delicate and subtle
                    analyses of complicated motives. Both in prose and in verse he was a master of
                    the art of composition, and most of the younger writers of his day learned
                    something from the clearness, ease, and grace of his style. To him belongs the
                    merit of having first suggested to his countrymen that it might be worth their
                    while to study their native literature as well as that of France, England, and
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>wieland’s Collected <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> edited by Gruber, were issued
                    in 53 vols, in 1818- 1828 and in 36 vols, in 1851-56. There are biographies of
                    him by Gruber (1827-28), Loebell (1858), and Ofterdingen (1877). Much light is
                    thrown on his character by his letters; see <hi rend="italic">Αusgeu∙iihlte
