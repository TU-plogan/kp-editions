                    now lost to us through the carelessness of genius or the malignity of chance.
                    Beyond the period included between these two dates there are no traces to be
                    found of his existence; nor is anything known of it with any certainty during
                    that period, except that seven plays appeared with his name on the title page,
                    three of them only the work of his unassisted hand. His first noteworthy
                    appearance in print, as far as we know, was as the author of certain additions
                    to Marston’s tragicomedy of <hi rend="italic">The Malcontent</hi>; these
                    probably do not extend beyond the induction, a curious and vivacious prelude to
                    a powerful and irregular work of somewhat morbid and sardonic genius. Three
                    years later, in 1607, two comedies and a tragedy, “written by Thomas Dekker and
                    John Webster,” were given to the press. The comedies are lively and humorous,
                    full of movement and incident; but the beautiful interlude of poetry which
                    distinguishes the second scene of the fourth act of <hi rend="italic">Westward
                    Ho!</hi> is unmistakably and unquestionably the work of Dekker; while the
                    companion comedy of <hi rend="italic">Northward Ho!</hi> is composed throughout
                    of homespun and coarse-grained prose. <hi rend="italic">The Famous History of
                    Sir Thomas Wyatt</hi> is apparently a most awkward and injurious abridgment of a
                    historical play in two parts on a pathetic but undramatic subject, the fate of
                    Lady Jane Grey. In this lost play of <hi rend="italic">Lady Jane</hi> Heywood,
                    Chettle, and Smith had also taken part; so that even in its original form it can
                    hardly have been other than a rough piece of patchwork. There are some touches
                    of simple eloquence and rude dramatic ability in the mangled and corrupt residue
                    which is all that survives of it; but on the whole this “history” is crude,
                    meagre, and unimpressive. In 1612 John Webster stood revealed to the then
                    somewhat narrow world of readers as a tragic poet and dramatist of the very
                    foremost rank in the very highest class. <hi rend="italic">The White Devil,</hi>
                    also known as <hi rend="italic">Vittoria Corombona,</hi> is a tragedy based on
                    events then comparatively recent—on a chronicle of crime aud retribution in
                    which the leading circumstances were altered and adapted with the most delicate
                    art and the most consummate judgment from the incompleteness of incomposite
                    reality to the requisites of the stage of Shakespeare. By him alone among
                    English poets have the finest scenes and passages of this tragedy been ever
                    surpassed or equalled in the crowning qualities of tragic or dramatic poetry,—in
                    pathos and passion, in subtlety and strength, in harmonious variety of art and
                    infallible fidelity to nature. Eleven years had elapsed when the twin
                    masterpiece of its author —if not indeed a still greater or more absolute
                    masterpiece —was published by the poet who had given it to the stage seven years
                    before. <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Malfy</hi> (an Anglicized version of
                    Amalfi, corresponding to such designations as Florence, Venice, and Naples) was
                    probably brought on the stage about the time of the death of Shakespeare; it was
                    first printed in the memorable year which witnessed the first publication of his
                    collected plays. This tragedy stands out among its compeers as one of the
                    imperishable and ineradicable landmarks of literature. All the great qualities
                    apparent in <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi> reappear in <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Duchess of Malfy,</hi> combined with a yet more perfect execution, and
                    utilized with a yet more consummate skill. No poet has ever so long and so
                    successfully sustained at their utmost height and intensity the expressed
                    emotions and the united effects of terror and pity. The transcendent imagination
                    and the impassioned sympathy <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n499/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0499-0474"/> which inspire this most tragic of all tragedies
                    save <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> are fused together in the fourth act into
                    a creation which has hardly been excelled for unflagging energy of impression
                    and of pathos in all the dramatic or poetic literature of the world. Its wild
                    and fearful sublimity of invention is not more exceptional than the exquisite
                    justice and tenderness and subtlety of its expression. Some of these executive
                    merits may be found in an ill-constructed and ill-conditioned tragi-comedy which
                    was printed in the same year; but few readers will care to remember much more of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Devil’s Law-Case</hi> than the admirable scenes and
                    passages which found favour in the unerring and untiring sight of Webster’s
                    first and final interpreter or commentator, Charles Lamb. Thirty-one years later
                    the noble tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Appius and Virginia</hi> was given to the
                    world,—a work which would alone have sufficed to perpetuate the memory of its
                    author among all competent lovers of English poetry at its best. Seven years
                    afterwards an unprincipled and ignorant bookseller published, under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">A Cure for a Cuckold,</hi> a play of which he assigned the
                    authorship to John Webster and William Rowley. This attribution may or may not
                    be accurate; the play is a mixture of coarsely realistic farce and gracefully
                    romantic comedy. An elegy on Henry, prince of Wales, and a few slight occasional
                    verses, compose the rest of Webster’s remaining works.</p>
                <p>Webster’s claims to a place among the chief writers of his country were ignored
                    for upwards of two centuries. In 1830 the Rev. Alexander Dyce first collected
                    and edited the works of a poet who had found his first adequate recognition
                    twenty-two years earlier at the pious and fortunate hands of Lamb. But we cannot
                    imagine that a presentiment or even a foreknowledge of this long delay in the
                    payment of a debt so long due from his countrymen to the memory of so great a
                    poet would seriously have disturbed or distressed the mind of the man who has
                    given us the clue to his nature in a single and an imperishable sentence—“I rest
                    silent in my own work.” (A. C. S.)</p>
