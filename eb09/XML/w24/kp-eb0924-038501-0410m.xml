                <p><label type="entry">WASHINGTON</label>, a Territory of the United States, is the
                    extreme north-western political subdivision of the Union (except the detached
                    Alaska), and is bounded on the N. by the Canadian province of British Columbia,
                    on the E. by Idaho Territory, on the S. by Oregon, and on the W. by the Pacific
                    Ocean. It lies between 45° 40' and 49° 0' N. lat. and 117° 0' and 124° 44' W.
                    long., and has a total land area within its boundaries of 66,880 square miles
                    and a water area of 3114 square miles; its average length from east to west is
                    330 miles and from north to south is 220 miles. The Territory is divided by the
                    Cascade Mountains into two unequal sections, which have very different climatic
                    and physical characteristics and commercial and business interests. The climate
                    is very mild, on account of the warm oceanic current from Japan which flows
                    south along the coast. The moisture-bearing winds moving inland from the ocean
                    are chilled against the Cascade Mountains, and cause the western section of the
                    Territory to have a very heavy annual rainfall (about 53 inches), which is quite
                    evenly distributed throughout the year. The summers are cool and pleasant and
                    the winters mild; flowers bloom in the open air every month in the year, and the
                    nights are always cool and refreshing. The climate in the western section is
                    similar to that of Scotland. That of the eastern section is remarkable for
                    clearness and brightness; it is hot and dry in summer, and has a brief and
                    severe winter. The climate is tempered by a remarkable balmy wind, called the
                    Chinook wind, coming over the mountains from the great Japanese current of the
                    Pacific. In the summer it is a cool wind tempering the heat, and in the winter
                    it is a warm wind, before which snow and ice disappear with marvellous
                    rapidity.</p>
                <p>The Cascade range is the local name of the extension through the Territory of the
                    Sierra Nevada, the great and sharply-defined mountain chain which extends at a
                    distance from shore of about 100 miles through the Pacific States and
                    Territories (see vol. xxiii. pp. 800-1). To the north of the Columbia river the
                    range widens out considerably into a region of high grassy mountain plateaus, of
                    deep canons, heavily timbered slopes, and high peaks of volcanic origin,
                    furnishing mountain scenery of indescribable grandeur. The western slopes are
                    covered with magnificent forests, principally of fir, the trees growing to an
                    immense size. The mountain plateaus are from 3000 to 5000 feet in elevation,
                    untimbered and covered with excellent grass, furnishing a large extent of
                    valuable pasture-land. On the eastern slope the forests are more open, and
                    consist principally of blue and yellow pine, tamarack, fir, and white cedar. The
                    Northern Pacific Railroad reaches the sea by two routes, one of which goes down
                    the Columbia river, and the other crosses the Cascade range by the Yakima Pass
                    in 47° 20' N. lat.; this pass has an elevation of 3600 feet, and is in a region
                    of beautiful deeply-embosomed lakes, the high cliff-like banks of which are
                    crowned with splendid evergreen forests. To the north of the Yakima Pass the
                    range becomes higher, and more rough and rugged than it is farther south. There
                    seems to have been a volcanic centre between the Yakima and Wenatchee and about
                    midway between the upper Yakima lakes and the Columbia, the highest peak of
                    which is known as Mount Stuart, from which poured a grand flood of lava to the
                    east and south, forming the elevated range between the Yakima and Wenatchee
                    known as the Wenatchee Mountains, and crossing the present channel of the
                    Columbia and forming Badger Mountain on the east. To the north of the 48th
                    parallel, which is about the line of the Spokane river and the westwardflowing
                    portion of the upper Columbia, the country changes, becoming more independent in
                    its mountain formations, and the eastern jutting ranges of the Cascades meet and
                    join with the earlier rock materials of the western spurs of the Rocky
                    Mountains. Here the great interior basin may be considered as ending, for to the
                    north the Rocky and Cascade ranges approach, and are blended in inextricable
                    confusion. The principal rivers having their sources in the Cascade Mountains on
                    the west are the Nooksack, Skagit, Steilaguamish, Snohomish, Puyallup, and
                    Nisqually flowing into Puget Sound, the Chehalis flowing into Gray’s Harbour,
                    and the Cowlitz and Lewis rivers flowing into the Columbia; while on the east
                    are the Methow, Chelan, Wenatchee, Yakima, and Klickitat, flowing into the
                    Columbia. The mountains are well stocked with large game, as deer, bear,
                    mountain sheep, mountain goats, wolves, panthers, foxes, &amp;c., the valleys,
                    plateaus, and lakes with feathered game, and the streams and lakes with trout
                    and salmon.</p>
                <p>The western section of the Territory lying between the Cascades and the ocean is
                    the smaller of the two, and is covered with timber throughout nearly its entire
                    extent. The principal natural feature is Puget Sound—one of the most beautiful
                    sheets of salt water in the world, if not indeed <hi rend="italic">the</hi> most
                    beautiful. It is an arm of the sea joining the waters of the Gulf of Georgia and
                    Strait of Juan de Fuca, and stretching about a hundred miles to the south into
                    the heart of the country; it has a great number of bays, coves, inlets, and
                    channels branching off from the main sound, altogether forming a collection of
                    harbours unsurpassed in the world. The total area of the Sound is about 2000
                    square miles, with a shore-line of about 1600 miles. The water is very deep, in
                    places more than 800 feet, the ordinary depths in the inlets and channels being
                    from 300 to 600 feet. These depths in some places continue right up to the
                    shore, so that vessels of the deepest draught could go and tie up to the trees
                    on the banks as to a wharf. The tides in Puget Sound vary ordinarily from about
                    9 feet at Port Townsend to 15 feet or more at Olympia and the remote inlets.
                    Along the shores, and for many miles back, the country is covered with the
                    densest growth of very fine timber. The region of the Olympic Mountains lying
                    between Puget Sound and the Pacific has never been explored to any extent, owing
                    to the enormous difficulties of penetrating the forests, which, besides the
                    standing trees, consist of masses of fallen timber and undergrowth. No rivers or
                    creeks navigable for canoes penetrate any distance into it. There is no doubt
                    that Puget Sound once extended much farther south, and occupied the Willamette
                    valley of Oregon. Its retrogression has left large areas of low-lying land
                    bordering the Sound and between it and the Columbia, which, when brought under
                    cultivation, are found to be remarkably fertile. There are large areas of these
                    low-lying lands covered with water at the highest tides which could be easily
                    reclaimed by dyking; about 30,000 acres have been so reclaimed, and it is
                    estimated that 150,000 acres besides can be thus improved. There are no good
                    harbours along the Pacific coast of the Territory; but on the Straits of Juan de
                    Fuca several fine ones exist. Western Washington is specially adapted to raising
                    all the grasses, oats, hops, the root-crops, and fruits; whatever requires great
                    heat does not ripen well.</p>
                <p>Eastern Washington Territory differs in a very marked manner and in almost every
                    material respect from the western section. South of the 48th parallel and east
                    of the Cascades it is essentially a prairie country, which owes its origin to
                    the great lava flow that covered eastern Oregon and northern California. This
                    lava has disintegrated in the course of ages, and produced a soil which is
                    unsurpassed in the world for richness. The region lying between the Blue
                    Mountains and the Snake river, known <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n411/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0411-0386"/> as the Walla Walla country, and that between the
                    Snake and the Spokane, known as the Palouse and Spokane countries, are noted for
                    their fertility. This is also the case with the regions along the eastern
                    foot-hills of the Cascades known generally as the Yakima and Kittitass
                    countries. In these regions there is sufficient rainfall to enable the
                    agriculturist to raise almost every product of the temperate zone of the finest
                    quality and in the greatest abundance. Besides the cereals, such as wheat, oats,
                    barley, flax, &amp;c., there are grown grapes, apples, cherries, peaches,
                    prunes, potatoes, both white and sweet, tobacco, cotton, broom corn, sorghum,
                    peanuts, egg plants, &amp;c. Over a large part of this eastern section, however,
                    the rainfall is not sufficient, and irrigation must be resorted to. With
                    irrigation properly conducted it is safe to say that nearly every foot of land
                    now classed as desert will be found to be as productive as the regions more
                    favoured by rain.</p>
                <p>That part of eastern Washington Territory north of the Columbia and Spokane
                    rivers is a region of low-timbered mountains and fertile valleys. This is mostly
                    given up to the Indians, there being the two large reservations called the
                    Columbia and Colville reservations stretching from the Cascade Mountains
                    eastward to the southward-flowing portion of the Columbia, and embracing 7880
                    square miles of land. North of the Spokane river is the Colville country, which
                    is open to settlement, and in which are much good land and large quantities of
                    valuable timber.</p>
                <p>The most important feature of eastern Washington is the Columbia river, which
                    enters the Territory from British Columbia at about 117° 30' W. long., and
                    pursues nearly a southerly course to the “Big Bend,” a distance of 110 miles,
                    where it takes a westerly course, which it keeps for 93 miles until it receives
                    the waters of the Okinakane, where it changes its course again to the south,
                    keeping it for 224 miles, until it unites with its greatest tributary, the Snake
                    river; from this point it keeps a westerly course, breaking through the
                    Cascades, and entering the Pacific in lat. 46° 15'. It forms the boundary
                    between Washington Territory and Oregon for this latter part of its course. The
                    lower portion of the Columbia is described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Oregon
                    (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v).</hi> The upper part may be briefly described as a
                    deeply cañoned river with numerous rapids and falls, which make it unnavigable
                    and in all probability incapable of improvement. The Kettle Falls, near the
                    northern boundary, are the most marked on the river, being about 25 feet at low
                    water. Here each year the Indians from all directions gather on neutral ground
                    to take salmon for their next year’s subsistence. A salmon chief is elected,
                    whose duties are to keep order and to divide equitably all the fish taken. The
                    fish are taken in baskets as they try to jump the falls, those that fail falling
                    back into the baskets. That part of the Columbia from the northern boundary-line
                    to the "Big Bend” is the most beautiful portion of the river within the
                    Territory, except where it breaks through the Cascades. Throughout this portion
                    there is considerable bottom-land, and this and the neighbouring hills and
                    mountains are well covered with fine open timber, with charming little grassy
                    prairies scattered here and there. Below the Big Bend the canon of the Columbia
                    becomes more prominent, the timber recedes from the banks, and the channel
                    narrows between basalt rocks, and in places is highly dangerous to anyone who
                    entrusts himself upon the waters. The general depth of the canon is about 2000
                    feet. Much gold is found in the sand bars and low terraces along the river.</p>
                <p>The principal tributaries of the Columbia within the Territory are Clarke’s Fork,
                    the outlet of Lake Pend d’Oreille, an unnavigable stream flowing through a deep
                    canon, which enters the Columbia just above the northern boundary of the
                    Territory. The Spokane river, one of the most important tributaries, is the
                    outlet of Lake Coeur d’Alene, which drains a large extent of the Bitter Root
                    Mountains. The Spokane, from the lake to Spokane Falls, a distance of about 30
                    miles, flows just below the level of a lovely prairie country; at the falls the
                    river takes a plunge of 156 feet, and from there to the Columbia it flows
                    through a deep canon. These falls of the Spokane furnish one of the finest, most
                    accessible, and most easily controlled water-powers in the world, and already
                    they are utilized to a considerable extent for manufacturing purposes. The
                    Okinakane is the next important tributary; it rises in British Columbia and
                    flows southward through Lakes Okinakane and Oso-yoos, and enters the Territory
                    in 119° 30' W. long. Its course lies through a rich and inviting country. At its
                    mouth was one of the most important of the old Hudson’s Bay Company’s trading
                    posts. The Methow river, Lake Chelan and its outlet, and the Wenatchee are
                    rivers of considerable magnitude, draining the eastern slopes of the Cascades.
                    They are in a mountainous country presenting few attractions to the settler. The
                    Yakima, which also comes from the Cascades, is of far greater importance, as
                    about its headwaters is a large amount of fine agricultural land, and the river
                    itself and its tributaries will ultimately furnish the water for irrigating an
                    enormous extent of very fine land now virtually desert. Already large irrigating
                    canals, having a total length of 325 miles, are projected, and work on them has
                    been commenced.</p>
                <p>The largest tributary of the Columbia, the Snake, joins it about 8 miles below
                    the mouth of the Yakima. The Snake is navigable for the whole 150 miles of its
                    course through the Territory, but has some difficult rapids. It flows through a
                    canon 1000 to 2000 feet deep, which it has cut for itself through the lava
                    deposits.</p>
                <p>An area nearly encircled by the Columbia, below the Big Bend, and the Snake, in
                    the last 50 miles of its course, is known as the Great Plain of the Columbia.
                    Its southern part is an alkaline nearly waterless desert, the principal
                    vegetation being sage brush; the northern part is somewhat more elevated, and is
                    for the most part a rich rolling grassy country intersected here and there by
                    <hi rend="italic">coules,</hi> or deep and almost vertical cuts, through the
                    basalt rock underlying the soil. They indicate the former presence of large
                    streams of water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forests.—</hi> Very valuable forests exist in every part of
                    western Washington and in the northern part of eastern Washington. The sawmills
                    on Puget Sound have a capacity of 350,000,000 feet per year, and the total
                    capacity of the mills of the Territory is over 650,000,000 feet per year. The
                    principal timber is yellow and red fir, ordinarily known as “Oregon pine,” which
                    constitutes the bulk of the forests; white and red cedar, spruce, and larch also
                    abound. White pine of magnificent size grows on the upper benches of the Cascade
                    Mountains; white fir and hemlock are also found. Alder, maple, ash, oak, and
                    cottonwood occur in abundance on the bottom-lands of western Washington, but are
                    not equal to timber of the same names in the east. Bull pine, yellow pine, and
                    tamarack grow on the eastern slopes of the Cascade range, and constitute the
                    bulk of the forests of eastern Washington. They make a fair quality of lumber,
                    but greatly inferior to the products of the western slopes aud the Pacific coast
                    regions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fisheries.—</hi> The salmon fisheries of the Columbia river,
                    Shoalwater Bay, Gray’s Harbour, and Puget Sound form one of the leading
                    industries of the Territory. The preservation of salmon in cans was commenced in
                    1866 on the Columbia river, and the business rapidly increased, so that now the
                    annual value of the pack is from 2 to 2½ million dollars.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mines aud Mining.—</hi> The mineral resources of the Territory
                    are very great upon both sides of the Cascade Mountains. There are large tracts
                    of valuable coal-lands between Puget Sound and the Cascades, stretching all the
                    way from Bellingham Bay on the north to the Chehalis valley on the south. The
                    veins at present worked vary from 5 to 12 feet in thickness, and in quality from
                    lignite to bituminous coal, some of which produces gas and coke of superior
                    excellence. Mines are also worked on the eastern slope of the Cascades about the
                    head of the Yakima river. The present known area of coal-lands in the Territory
                    is about 180,000 acres, and the total shipments for the year ending June 30,
                    1887, amounted to 525,705 tons. The supply of coal for the Pacific coast is
                    mainly drawn from the beds in Washington Territory and their continuation in
                    British Columbia.</p>
                <p>There are large deposits of valuable iron ore in the western part of the
                    Territory and in the Snoqualmie Pass. Brown haematite iron ore is found in
                    Skagit county, magnetic ore in King county, and bog iron ore of the best quality
                    in several counties, notably Jefferson, King, and Pierce; but these deposits
                    have not yet been worked to any great extent. There can be no question, however,
                    that the existence of coal, iron, and timber in the near vicinity of Puget Sound
                    must make this a great manufacturing and shipbuilding centre. Limestone is found
                    in great abundance on San Juan Island, in the Puyallup valley, and in the
                    north-eastern part of the Territory. Copper and lead are found in different
                    localities.</p>
                <p>The northern part of eastern Washington abounds in mines of the precious metals,
                    and these are now being worked on quite an extensive scale. In the Colville
                    district (between the Columbia, Clarke’s Fork, and Spokane rivers) the
                    prevailing country rock is limestone, and the prevailing mineral is
                    argentiferous galena; at some points grey copper ore is found carrying both
                    silver and lead, and in others silver chlorides are found. The development of
                    these mines has been delayed by lack of railway facilities, but this will be
                    remedied in a short time by lines now projected and incorporated.</p>
                <p>The Kettle river district lies to the west of the Columbia, and in regions about
                    the headwaters of the river. The mines are very varied in their character,
                    comprising placer gold, gold quartz, copper, and galena with carbonates. Some of
                    the placer mines have yielded heavily, the gold being coarse and obtained by
                    ground sluicing.</p>

                <p>Very valuable quartz ledges, assaying 80 to 2000 ounces of gold per ton, have
                    been discovered in a formation of granite and slate.</p>
                <p>The Okinakane district comprises the mines in the vicinity of the Okinakane,
                    Salmon, and the Similkameen rivers and Osoyoos lake. Here the formation is
                    granite, syenite, and porphyry, and the ores are galena, grey copper, and
                    quartz, carrying sulphurets and native silver.</p>
                <p>The city of Spokane Falls, on the Northern Pacific Railroad, is the distributing
                    point for all these mines, as well as for the Coeur d’Alene mines in northern
                    Idaho.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shipbuilding.—</hi> Shipyards exist at Seattle and Tacoma, and
                    at other points on Puget Sound, at Gray’s Harbour and Shoalwater Bay, and on the
                    Columbia river. The vessels constructed are mainly schooners for the
                    lumber-carrying trade; many of them also are provided with auxiliary
                    steam-power. All raw materials for their construction are found in the vicinity.
                    The yellow fir of the northern Pacific ranks next to oak for strength and
                    durability, and constitutes excellent material for shipbuilding. Vessels of 4854
                    tons were built during 1886, and the industry is rapidly growing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> The principal articles of export are lumber,
                    coal, wheat, and salmon, and their annual value is from 8 to 10 millions of
                    dollars. In the year from July 1886 to June 1887 the total entrances at Puget
                    Sound were 994 vessels (539,597 tons), and the clearances 988 (514,441
                    tons).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> Washington Territory was the last of the
                    political subdivisions of the United States to be reached by railroads. In 1883
                    the Northern Pacific was completed and direct rail connection secured with the
                    east.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> There are about a thousand common schools in
                    the Territory, under the supervision of a superintendent of public instruction
                    and a board of education of three persons, all of whom are appointed by the
                    governor. In each county, county superintendents and a board of county examiners
                    visit the schools and report to the superintendent of public instruction. There
                    is held each year a territorial teachers’ institute, and local teachers’
                    institutes are also held in different sections. These common schools are
                    supported by county taxes and by certain criminal fines. Special taxes are also
                    permitted in counties under certain conditions. There are at present about
                    65,000 children under instruction, at a cost of about $500,000 per annum.</p>
                <p>The general Government has set aside for educational purposes one-eighteenth of
                    all the land in the Territory, comprising about 2½ million acres. This land,
                    however, does not become available until the Territory becomes a State. All
                    children must attend school at least three months in the year.</p>
                <p>There is a university at Seattle, supported by large annual appropriations of the
                    legislature. It has four departments at present :— literature, science, and the
                    arts; law; medicine; and military instruction. There are also twenty-four higher
                    institutions of learning scattered throughout the Territory, consisting of
                    colleges, seminaries, and academies, most of which are under sectarian control,
                    and some of which have already a liberal endowment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Churches. —</hi> All the leading Christian sects are well
                    represented in the Territory, their membership and value of church property
                    being about in the order given below :—Methodist Episcopal, Roman Catholic,
                    Protestant Episcopal, Congregational, Baptist, Presbyterian, Christian,
                    Lutheran, German Reformed, and Unitarian, <hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi>
                    The administrative affairs of the Territory are in the hands of a governor,
                    secretary, and chief justice, all appointed by the president of the United
                    States, and a treasurer and comptroller and an upper and lower legislative house
                    elected by the people. The Territory is represented in Congress by a delegate
                    also elected by the people.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The total population, 75,116 in 1880, was
                    143,669 (84,470 males, 59,199 females) according to the census taken in 1886 and
                    1887, classified as follows :—whites, 137,430; blacks, 254; mulattoes, 69;
                    Chinese, 2584; Indian half-breeds, 3288; and Kanakas, 44. In addition to these
                    there are about 11,000 Indians. The total population is now (1888) about
                    175,000. The capital is Olympia, and the chief city Seattle, both on Puget
                    Sound.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Banks.—</hi> There are in the Territory 18 national banks, with
                    a capital of $1,430,000, 5 territorial banks, with a capital of $355,000, and
                    also a number of private banks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The first event in history relating to
                    Washington Territory was the discovery, in 1592, of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
                    by an old Greek pilot of that name in the service of Spain. In 1775 Captain
                    Hecata, a Spanish navigator, discovered the mouth of the Columbia, but was
                    unable to enter the river. Captain Kendrick, an American navigator, in 1789
                    sailed into the Strait of Fuca and through the Gulf of Georgia and Queen
                    Charlotte Sound to the Pacific, and was the first to clearly make known the
                    character of these inland waters. On the 11th of May 1792 Captain Gray, of the
                    American ship “Columbia,” sailed into and explored for about 15 miles the great
                    river to which he gave the name of his ship. This first entrance into the
                    Columbia river gave the United States their principal claim to the territory
                    drained by the river, and is thus a very important episode in the history of the
                    Oregon region, which formerly comprised the present State of Oregon and the
                    Territories of Washington and Idaho. In October of the same year (1792) an
                    Englishman, Lieutenant Broughton, sailed up and examined the Columbia for about
                    100 miles from its mouth. The coast soon became quite well known, and the
                    Government of the United States fitted out a number of expeditions to obtain a
                    knowledge of the interior. The most important of these was that of Lewis and
                    Clarke, who were directed to ascend the Missouri, cross the Rocky Mountains, and
                    trace the Columbia from its sources to the sea. They began the ascent of the
                    Missouri in 1804, and spent the winter of 1804-5 at Fort Mandan. In the next
                    season, after incredible hardships and great sufferings, they crossed the Rocky
                    Mountains, and reached the Clearwater river. Here they made boats, and proceeded
                    down it, the Snake river, and the main Columbia, reaching the Pacific in
                    December 1805. They returned by nearly the same route.</p>
                <p>The next important era in the history of the Territory was the attempt of J. J.
                    Astor to establish a fur-trading empire on the Columbia and its tributary lands
                    and streams. Two expedition were sent out in 1810 for this purpose, one by land
                    and one by sea. The latter reached the Columbia in 1811, and established a
                    trading post at Astoria near the mouth of the river. The land expedition reached
                    this post in 1812. In the meantime, in hopes of forestalling Astor’s
                    expeditions, the North-West Fur Company sent a party in 1810 to cross the
                    mountains and reach the mouth of the Columbia before them. This expedition
                    experienced great difficulty in crossing the mountains in 52° N. lat., but in
                    the spring of 1811 they reached the Columbia, and went down to its mouth, where
                    they found Astor’s sea party already established. This North-West Fur Company’s
                    expedition was the first to navigate the upper Columbia, or to traverse any part
                    of the country drained by it. In 1813 the fortunes of war compelled the transfer
                    of the Astor Fur Company to the North-West Fur Company. Henceforward for many
                    years the history of the Territory is the history of the operations of the great
                    North-West and Hudson’s Bay Companies, and of the effort of private parties to
                    get a share in the profits of the fur trade. A number of trading posts were
                    built, and exploring and trading expeditions sent into all parts of the country.
                    Missionaries began to arrive, and emigrants to drift in by sea and land.</p>
                <p>During all the years in which this region was first being explored and settled, a
                    dispute had been going on between the United States and Great Britain in regard
                    to its ownership, which at different times waxed so fierce as to threaten war.
                    Finally an arrangement was arrived at, and in 1846 the treaty was signed fixing
                    the boundary-line at the 49th parallel. The Territory of Oregon (comprising
                    Washington, Idaho, and Oregon) was formed in 1848, and General Joseph Lane, the
                    first Territorial governor, arrived in 1849, after which United States courts
                    were established. The present Territory of Washington was established in 1853,
                    and its first governor was Isaac I. Stevens.</p>
                <p>The settlement of the Territory has been slow, on account of its remoteness and
                    the fact that it has had no great mining excitement to attract adventurous
                    settlers. Since the advent of railroads, however, its development has been
                    rapid. (T. W. S. )</p>
