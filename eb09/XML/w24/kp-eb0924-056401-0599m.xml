                    Society,” which afterwards developed into the “Union,” Wilberforce distinguished
                    himself as a zealous advocate of liberalism. The set of friends with whom he
                    chiefly associated at Oxford were sometimes named, on account of their
                    exceptionally decorous conduct, the “Bethel Union”; but he was by no means
                    averse to amusements, and specially delighted in hurdle jumping and hunting. He
                    graduated in 1826; and the summer and autumn of 1827 were spent in a Continental
                    tour. After his marriage on 11th June 1828 to Emily Sargent, he was in December
                    ordained and appointed curate-in-charge at Checkenden near Henley-on-Thames. In
                    1830 he was presented by Bishop Sumner of Winchester to the rectory of
                    Brightstone in the Isle of Wight. In this comparatively retired sphere he soon
                    found scope for that manifold activity which so prominently characterized his
                    subsequent career. In 1831 he published a tract on tithes, “to correct the
                    prejudices of the lower order of farmers,” and in the following year a
                    collection of hymns for use in his parish, which had a large general
                    circulation; a small volume of stories entitled the <hi rend="italic">Note Book
                    of a Country Clergyman</hi>; and a sermon, <hi rend="italic">The Apostolical
                    Ministry.</hi> He now began to be sought for as a preacher and declined several
                    offers of appointments. In February 1836 he was made a rural dean. At the close
                    of 1837 he published the <hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals</hi> of Henry
                    Martyn. Although a High Churchman Wilberforce held aloof from the Oxford
                    movement, and in 1838 his divergence from the “Tract” writers became so marked
                    that J. H. Newman declined further contributions from him to the <hi
                    rend="italic">British Critic,</hi> not deeming it advisable that they should
                    longer “co-operate very closely.” In 1838 Wilberforce published, with his elder
                    brother Robert, the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of his father and two years
                    later his father’s <hi rend="italic">Correspondence.</hi> In 1839 he also
                    published <hi rend="italic">Eucharistica</hi> (from the old English divines), to
                    which he wrote an introduction, <hi rend="italic">Agathos and other Sunday
                    Stories,</hi> and a volume of <hi rend="italic">University Sermems,</hi> and in
                    the following year <hi rend="italic">Rocky Island and other Parables.</hi> In
                    November 1839 he was installed archdeacon of Surrey, in August 1840 collated
                    canon of Winchester, and in October he accepted the rectory of Alverstoke. In
                    1841 he was chosen Bampton lecturer, and shortly afterwards made chaplain to the
                    Prince Consort, an appointment he owed to the impression produced by a speech at
                    an antislavery meeting some months previously. In October 1843 he was appointed
                    by the archbishop of York to be sub-almoner to the queen. In 1844 appeared his
                    <hi rend="italic">History of the American Church.</hi> In March of the following
                    year he accepted the deanery of Westminster, and in October the bishopric of
                    Oxford.</p>
                <p>The bishop in 1847 became involved in the Hampden controversy, and signed the
                    remonstrance of the thirteen bishops to Lord John Russell against Dr Hampden’s
                    appointment to the bishopric of Hereford. He also endeavoured to obtain
                    satisfactory assurances from Dr Hampden; but, though unsuccessful in this, he
                    withdrew from the suit against him. The publication of a papal bull in 1850
                    establishing a Roman hierarchy in England brought the High Church party, of whom
                    Wilberforce was the most prominent member, into temporary disrepute. The
                    secession to the Church of Rome of his brother-in-law, Archdeacon (now Cardinal)
                    Manning, and afterwards of his two brothers, brought him under further
                    suspicion, and his revival of the powers of convocation lessened his influence
                    at court; but his unfailing tact and wide sympathies, his marvellous energy in
                    church organization, the magnetism of his personality, and his eloquence, both
                    on the platform and in the pulpit, gradually won for him recognition as without
                    a rival on the episcopal bench. In the House of Lords he took a prominent part
                    in the discussion of social and ecclesiastical questions. He has been styled the
                    “bishop of society”; but society occupied only a fraction of his time. The great
                    bent of his energies was ceaselessly directed to the better organization of his
                    diocese and to the furtherance of schemes for increasing the influence and
                    efficiency of the church. In 1854 he opened a theological college at Cuddesdon,
                    which was afterwards the subject of some controversy on account of its alleged
                    Romanist tendencies. His attitude towards <hi rend="italic">Essays and
                    Reviews</hi> in 1861, against which he wrote an article in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly,</hi> won him the special gratitude of the Low Church party, and
                    latterly he enjoyed the full confidence and esteem of all except the extreme men
                    of either side and party. On the publication of Colenso’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentary on the Romans</hi> in 1861 Wilberforce endeavoured to induce the
                    author to hold a private conference with him; but after the publication of the
                    first two parts of the <hi rend="italic">Pentateuch Critically Examined</hi> he
                    drew up the address of the bishops which called on Colenso to resign his
                    bishopric. In 1867 he framed the first <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> of the
                    Ritualistic Commission, in which coercive measures against ritualism were
                    discountenanced by the use of the word “restrain” instead of “abolish” or
                    “prohibit.” He also endeavoured to take the sting out of some resolutions of the
                    second Ritualistic Commission in 1868, and was one of the four who signed the
                    <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> with qualifications. Though strongly opposed to
                    the disestablishment of the Irish Church, yet, when the constituencies decided
                    for it, he prudently advised that no opposition should be made to it by the
                    House of Lords. After twenty-four years’ labour in the diocese of Oxford, he was
                    named by Mr Gladstone for the bishopric of Winchester. His unremitting labours
                    had, however, seriously told on his constitution, and the change to a new
                    diocese, entailing a repetition of the work of organization which he had
                    completed in the old one, proved too much for his health. The result was a
                    severe affection of the heart, which on more than one occasion threatened to
                    prove fatal. He was killed on 19th July 1873 by the shock of a fall from his
                    horse near Dorking, Surrey.</p>

                    of Hebrew History</hi> (1870), originally contributed to <hi rend="italic">Good
