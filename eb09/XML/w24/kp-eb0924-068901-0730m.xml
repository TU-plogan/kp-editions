                    himself in geometry and applied mathematics;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    he became professor of astronomy at Gresham College, and in 1660 was elected
                    Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford. It is, however, as an architect that
                    Wren is best known, and the great fire of London, by its destruction of the
                    cathedral and nearly all the city churches, gave Wren a scope for his talent
                    such as probably no architect has ever had to the same extent. Just before the
                    fire Wren was asked by Charles II. to prepare a scheme for the restoration of
                    the old St Paul’s. Iu May 1666 Wren submitted his report and designs<note

                    exists in the All Souls collection.</p></note> for this work; the old cathedral
                    was in a very ruinous state, and Wren proposed to remodel the greater part, as
                    he said, “after a good Roman manner,” and not “to follow the Gothick Rudeness of
                    the old Design.” According to this scheme, only the old choir was left; the nave
                    and transepts were to be rebuilt after the classical style, with a lofty dome at
                    the crossing—not unlike the plan which was eventually carried out.</p>
                <p>In September of the same year (1666) the fire occurred, and the old St Paul’s was
                    completely gutted, though the greater part of its walls still remained standing.
                    From 1668 to 1670 attempts were being made by the chapter to restore the ruined
                    building; but Dean Sancroft was anxious to häve the cathedral wholly rebuilt,
                    and in 1668 he had asked Wren to prepare a design for a wholly new church. This
                    first design, the model for which is preserved in the South Kensington Museum,
                    is very inferior to what Wren afterwards devised. In plan it is an immense
                    rotunda surrounded by a wide aisle, and approached by a double portico; the
                    rotunda is covered with a dome taken from that of the Pantheon in Rome; on this
                    a second dome stands, set on a lofty drum, and this second dome is crowned by a
                    tall spire. This plan was devised as being specially suitable to the needs of a
                    Protestant church, but the dean and chapter objected to the absence of a
                    structural choir, nave, and aisles, and wished to follow the mediaeval cathedral
                    arrangement, at least as far as concerned the plan. Thus, in spite of its having
                    been approved by the king, this design was happily abandoned—much to Wren’s
                    disgust; and he prepared another scheme with a similar treatment of a dome
                    crowned by a spire, which in 1675 was ordered to be carried out. Wren had,
                    however, been much hampered by ignorant interference, and apparently did not
                    himself approve of this second design, for he got the king to give him
                    permission to alter it as much as he liked, without showing models or drawings
                    to any one. Wren fully availed himself of this permission, and the actual
                    building bears little resemblance to the approved design, to which it is very
                    superior in almost every possible point. Wren’s earlier designs have the
                    exterior of the church arranged with one order of columns; the division of the
                    whole height into two orders was an immense gain in increasing the apparent
                    scale of the whole, and makes the exterior of St Paul’s very superior to that of
                    St Peter’s in Rome, which is utterly dwarfed by the colossal size of the columns
                    and pilasters of its single order.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Proportionally the apparently greater size of St Paul s is
                    very remarkable; it is very difficult to realize that the top of the dome of St
                    Paul’s is only as high as the springing of that of St Peter’s. In actual fact
                    the one looks about as high as the other.</p></note> The present very graceful
                    dome and the drum on which it stands, masterpieces of graceful line and
                    harmonious proportion, were very important alterations from the earlier scheme.
                    As a scientific engineer and practical architect Wren was perhaps more
                    remarkable than as an artistic designer. The construction of the wooden external
                    dome, and the support of the stone lantern by an inner cone of brickwork, quite
                    independent of either the external or internal dome, are wonderful examples of
                    Wren’s constructive ingenuity. The first stone of the new St Paul’s was laid on
                    June 21, 1675; the choir was opened for use December 2, 1697; and the last stone
                    of the cathedral was set in 1710. The stone used is from the Portland quarries;
                    the wooden dome is covered with lead, not copper as was at first proposed. The
                    fine oak stalls were carved by Grinling Gibbons, who received £1333, 7s. 5d. for
                    them. The whole cost of the cathedral was £1,167,474,—of which £810,181 was
                    provided by the London import duty on coal.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Wren also designed a colonnade to enclose a large piazza
                    forming a clear space round the church, somewhat after the fashion of Bernini’s
                    colonnade in front of St Peter’s, but space in the city was too valuable to
                    admit of this. Wren was an enthusiastic admirer of Bernini’s designs, and
                    visited Paris in 1665 in order to see him and his proposed scheme for the
                    rebuilding of the Louvre. Bernini showed his design to Wren, but would not let
                    him copy it, though, as he said, he “would have given his skin” to be allowed to
                    do so.</p><p/></note></p>
                <p>After the destruction of the city of London Wren was employed to make designs for
                    rebuilding its fifty burnt churches, and he also prepared a scheme for laying
                    out the whole city on a new plan, with a series of wide streets radiating from a
                    central space. Difficulties arising from the various ownerships of the ground
                    prevented the accomplishment of this scheme.</p>
                <p>Among Wren’s city churches the most noteworthy are St Michael’s, Cornhill; St
                    Bride’s and St Mary le Bow, Fleet Street, the latter remarkable for its graceful
                    spire; and St Stephen’s, Walbrook, with a plain exterior, but very elaborate and
                    graceful interior. In the design of spires Wren showed much taste and wonderful
                    power of invention. He was also very judicious in the way in which he expended
                    the limited money at his command; he did not fritter it away in an attempt to
                    make the whole of a building remarkable, but devoted it chiefly to one part or
                    feature, such as a spire or a rich scheme of internal decoration. Thus he was in
                    some cases, as in that of St James’s, Piccadilly, content to make the exterior
                    of an almost barnlike plainness.</p>
                <p>The other buildings designed by Wren were very numerous. Only a few of the
                    principal ones can be mentioned :— the custom house, the royal exchange,
                    Marlborough House, Buckingham House, and the Hall of the College of
                    Physicians—now destroyed; others which exist are—at Oxford, the Sheldonian
                    theatre, the Ashmolean museum, the Tom Tower of Christ Church, and Queen’s
                    College chapel; at Cambridge, the library of Trinity College and <pb break="no"

                    Bishop Matthew Wren, his uncle. The western towers of Westminster Abbey are
                    usually attributed to Wren, but they were not carried out till 1735-45, many
                    years after Wren’s death, and there is no reason to think that his design was
                    used. ’ Wren (D.C.L. from 1660) was knighted in 1673, and was elected president
                    of the Royal Society in 1681.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Kneller.</p><p/></note> He was in parliament for many years, representing
                    Plympton from 1685, Windsor from 1689, and Weymouth from 1700. He occupied the
                    post of surveyor of the royal works for fifty years, but by a shameful cabal was
                    dismissed from this office a few years before his death. He died in 1723, and is
                    buried under the choir of St Paul’s; on a tablet over the inner north doorway is
                    the well-known epitaph—“Si monumentum requiris, circumspice.”</p>
                <p>Wren’s genius as an artist is very difficult to estimate; he lived at a most
                    unhappy time, when architecture had sunk almost to its lowest point of
                    degradation. If, however, we bear this in mind we must admit that he was an
                    artist of very remarkable ability; his inventive genius no one can dispute.</p>
