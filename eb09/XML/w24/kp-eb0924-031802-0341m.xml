                <p><label type="entry">WAKEFIELD, <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward Gibbon</hi></label>
                    (1796-1862), colonial statesman, was born in London, March 20, 1796, of an
                    originally Quaker family. His father, Edward Wakefield, author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ireland, Statistical and Political,</hi> was a surveyor and land
                    agent in extensive practice; his grandmother, Priscilla Wakefield, was a popular
                    author for the young, and one of the first introducers of savings banks.
                    Wakefield was for a short time at Westminster School, and was brought up to his
                    father’s profession, which he relinquished on occasion of his elopement at the
                    age of 20 with Miss Pattle, the orphan daughter of an Indian civil servant. The
                    young lady’s relatives ultimately became reconciled to the match, and procured
                    him an appointment as attaché to the British legation at Turin. He resigned this
                    post in 1820, upon the death of his wife, to whom he was fondly attached, and,
                    though making some efforts to connect himself with journalism, spent the years
                    immediately succeeding in idleness, residing for the most part in Paris. In 1826
                    he appeared before the public as the hero of a most extraordinary adventure, the
                    abduction of Miss Ellen Turner, daughter of William Turner, of Shrigley Park,
                    Cheshire. Miss Turner was decoyed from school by means of a forged letter, and
                    made to believe that she could only save her father from ruin by marrying
                    Wakefield, whom she accordingly <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0342-0319"/> accompanied to Gretna Green. This time the family
                    refused to condone his proceedings; he was tried with his confederates at
                    Lancaster assizes, March 1827, convicted, and sentenced to three years’
                    imprisonment in Newgate. The marriage, which had not been consummated, was
                    dissolved by a special Act of Parliament. A disgrace which would have blasted
                    the career of most men made Wakefield a practical statesman and a benefactor to
                    his country. Meditating, it is probable, emigration upon his release, he turned
                    his attention while in prison to colonial subjects, and acutely detected the
                    main causes of the slow progress of the Australian colonies in the enormous size
                    of the landed estates, the reckless manner in which land was given away, the
                    absence of all systematic effort at colonization, and the consequent
                    discouragement of immigration and dearth of labour. He proposed to remedy this
                    state of things by the sale of land in small quantities at a sufficient price,
                    and the employment of the proceeds as a fund for promoting immigration. These
                    views were expressed with extraordinary vigour and incisiveness in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Letter from Sydney</hi> (1829), published while he was still in
                    prison, but composed with such graphic power that it has been continually quoted
                    as if written on the spot. After his release Wakefield seemed disposed for a
                    while to turn his attention to social questions at home, and produced a tract on
                    the <hi rend="italic">Punishment of Death,</hi> with a terribly graphic picture
                    of the condemned sermon in Newgate, and another on incendiarism in the rural
                    districts, with an equally powerful exhibition of the degraded condition of the
                    agricultural labourer. He soon, however, became entirely engrossed with colonial
                    affairs, and, having impressed Stuart Mill, Colonel Torrens, and other leading
                    economists with the value of his ideas, became a leading though not a
                    conspicuous manager of the South Australian Company, by which the colony of
                    South Australia was ultimately founded. In 1833 he published anonymously <hi
                    rend="italic">England and America,</hi> a work primarily intended to develop his
                    own colonial theory, which is done in the appendix entitled “The Art of
                    Colonization.” The body of the work, however, is fruitful in seminal ideas,
                    though some statements may be rash, and some conclusions extravagant. It
                    contains the distinct proposal that the transport of letters should be wholly
                    gratuitous—the precursor of subsequent reform—and the prophecy that, under given
                    circumstances, “the Americans would raise cheaper corn than has ever been
                    raised.” In 1836 Wakefield published the first volume of an edition of Adam
                    Smith, which he did not complete. In 1837 the New Zealand Association was
                    established, and he became its managing director. Scarcely, however, was this
                    great undertaking fairly commenced when he accepted the post of private
                    secretary to Lord Durham on the latter’s appointment as special commissioner to
                    Canada. The Durham Report, the charter of constitutional government in the
                    colonies, though drawn up by Charles Buller, embodied the ideas of Wakefield,
                    and the latter was the means of its being given prematurely to the public
                    through the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> to prevent its being tampered with by
                    the Government. He acted in the same spirit a few months later, when (about
                    July, 1839), understanding that the authorities intended to prevent the despatch
                    of emigrants to New Zealand, he hurried them off on his own responsibility, thus
                    compelling the Government to annex the country just in time to anticipate a
                    similar step on the part of France. For several years Wakefield continued to
                    direct the New Zealand Company, fighting its battles with the colonial office
                    and the missionary interest, and secretly inspiring and guiding many
                    parliamentary committees on colonial subjects, especially on the abolition of
                    transportation. The company was by no means a financial success, and many of its
                    proceedings were wholly unscrupulous and indefensible; its great object,
                    however, was attained, and New Zealand became the Britain of the south. In 1846
                    Wakefield, exhausted with labour, was struck down by apoplexy, and spent more
                    than a year in complete retirement, writing during his gradual recovery his <hi
                    rend="italic">Art of Colonization.</hi> The management of the company had
                    meanwhile passed into the hands of others, whose sole object was to settle
                    accounts with the Government, and wind up the undertaking. Wakefield seceded,
                    and joined Lord Lyttelton and Mr Godley in establishing the Canterbury
                    settlement as a Church of England colony. A portion of his correspondence on
                    this subject has been published by his son, and is perhaps the most adequate
                    memorial extant of the vigour and sagacity of his intellect. As usual with him,
                    however, he failed to retain the confidence of his coadjutors to the end. In
                    1853, after the grant of a constitution to New Zealand, he took up his residence
                    in the colony, and immediately began to act a leading part in colonial politics.
                    In 1854 he appeared in the first New Zealand parliament as extra-official
                    adviser of the acting governor, a position which excited great jealousy, and as
                    the mover of a resolution demanding the appointment of a responsible ministry.
                    It was carried unanimously, but difficulties, which will be found detailed in
                    Swainson’s <hi rend="italic">New Zealand and its Colonization</hi> (ch. 12),
                    prevented its being made effective until after the mover’s retirement from
                    political life. In December 1854, after a fatiguing address to a public meeting,
                    followed by prolonged exposure to a south-east gale, his constitution entirely
                    broke down. He spent the rest of his life in retirement, dying at Wellington on
                    16th May 1862.</p>
                <p>Wakefield was a man of large views and lofty aims, and in private life displayed
                    the warmth of heart which commonly accompanies these qualities. His main defect
                    was unscrupulousness: he hesitated at nothing necessary to accomplish an object,
                    and the conviction of his untrustworthiness gradually alienated his associates,
                    and left him politically powerless. Excluded from parliament by the fatal error
                    of his youth, he was compelled to resort to indirect means of working out his
                    plans by influencing public men. But for a tendency to paradox, his intellectual
                    powers were of the highest order, and as a master of nervous idiomatic English
                    he is second to Cobbett alone. After every deduction it remains true that no
                    contemporary showed equal genius as a colonial statesman, or in this department
                    rendered equal service to his country.</p>
