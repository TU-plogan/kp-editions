                    not only common sense but also the accepted rules of scientific nomenclature),
                    by an utterly mistaken view of Vieillot’s intention in establishing the genus
                        <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes,</hi> reserve that term for some American
                    species—which can hardly be generically separated from the European form—and
                    have attempted to fix on the latter the generic term <hi rend="italic"
                        >Anorthura,</hi> which is its strict equivalent and was proposed by Rennie
                    on grounds that are wholly inadmissible.</p>
                <p>The interest taken in this bird throughout all European countries is scarcely
                    exceeded by that taken in any other, and, though in Britain comparatively few
                    vernacular names have been applied to it, two of them—“Jenny” or <hi
                        rend="superscript"> u</hi> Kitty-Wren”—are terms of endearment. Μ. Rolland
                    records no fewer than 139 local names for it in France; and Italy, Germany, and
                    other lands are only less prolific. Many of these carry on the old belief that
                    the Wren was the King of Birds, a belief connected with the fable that on one
                    occasion the fowls of the air in general assembly resolved to choose for their
                    leader that one of them which should mount highest. This the Eagle seemed to do,
                    and all were ready to accept his rule, when a loud burst of song was heard, and
                    perched upon him was seen the exultant Wren, which unseen and unfelt had been
                    borne aloft by the giant. The curious association of this bird with the Feast of
                    the Three Kings, on which day in South Wales, or, in Ireland and in the south of
                    France, on or about Christmas Day, it was customary for men and boys to “hunt
                    the Wren,” addressing it in a song as “the King of Birds,” is very remarkable,
                    and has never yet been explained.</p>
                <p>The Wren hardly needs description here, and its domed nest, apparently so
                    needlessly large for the size of the bird, is a well-known object, for it is
                    built with uncommon care, and often (though certainly not always) in such a
                    fashion as to assimilate its exterior to its surroundings and so to escape
                    observation. Very curious too is the equally unaccountable fact, that near any
                    occupied nest may generally be found another nest, or more than one, of
                    imperfect construction. The widespread belief concerning these unfinished
                    fabrics is implied by their common name of “cocks’ nests,” but evidence to that
                    effect is not forthcoming. The breeding-habits of the Wren were most closely
                    studied and accurately reported by Mr Weir to Macgillivray <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Brit. Birds,</hi> iii. pp. 23-30) in a way that leads every ornithologist
                    to wish that the same care might be bestowed on other kinds of birds.</p>

                            333), that the Wren, for 200 years and upwards, known to inhabit St
                            Kilda differed in hue from that of the other British Islands and of the
                            continent of Europe, and it has by him been described as a distinct

                            twenty years been known that the Wren of the Faeroes and Iceland

                    Circle; but it occurs in Algeria, Madeira, and, according to Bolle, in the
                    Canaries. It also inhabits Palestine. Further to the eastward its limits are
                    difficult to trace, because they inosculate with those of a considerable number
                    of local races or species. As might be expected, the form inhabiting Japan, <hi
                        rend="italic">T.</hi><hi rend="italic">fumigatus,</hi> seems to be
                    justifiably deemed a species. In North America, <hi rend="italic">T.
                        alascensis</hi> occurs in the extreme north-west, and is replaced further to
                    the southward by <hi rend="italic">T. pacificus.</hi> Eastward of the Rocky
                    Mountains, the form is <hi rend="italic">T. hyemalis—</hi> the well-known
                    Winter-Wren of Canada and the United States. The number of species of Wrens
                    inhabiting North America is, however, very considerable: but authorities are by
                    no means agreed as to how many should be reckoned valid, and they have been
                    segregated into six or seven genera. Here the House-Wren, <hi rend="italic">T.
                        domesticus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">aedon,</hi> can alone be mentioned. It
                    is a very common summervisitant to most parts of the Eastern States, and where
                    it occurs is of a very familiar disposition, entering into the closest relations
                    with those that cultivate its acquaintance. It is represented in the West by <hi

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Troglodytidae,</hi> if they are to be regarded as forming a
                    distinct Family, predominate in the New World, no fewer than 60 species being
                    enumerated in the <hi rend="italic">Nomenclator</hi> of Messrs Sclater and
                    Salvin as belonging to the Neotropical Region. But the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Troglodytidae</hi> by no means contain all the birds to which the name
                    “Wren” is applied. Several of the <hi rend="italic">Sylviidae (cf.</hi><hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Warbler)</hi> bear it, especially the beautiful little
                    Golden-crested Wren (c∕. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kinglet)</hi> and the group
                    commonly known in Britain as “Willow-Wrens ”— forming the genus <hi
                        rend="italic">Phylloscopus.</hi> Three of these are habitual
                    summer-visitants, which differ much more in their manners than in their look.
                    The largest, usually called the Wood-Wren, <hi rend="italic">P. sibilatrix,</hi>
                    is more abundant in the north than in the south of England, and chiefly
                    frequents woods of oak or beech. It has a loud and very peculiar song, like the
                    word <hi rend="italic">twee,</hi> sounded very long, and repeated several times
                    in succession—at first slowly, but afterwards more quickly, and near the end
                    accompanied by a peculiar quivering of the wings, while at uncertain intervals
                    comes another note, which has been syllabled as <hi rend="italic">chea,</hi>
                    uttered about three times in succession. The Willow-Wren proper, <hi
                        rend="italic">P. trochilus,</hi> is in many parts of Great Britain the
                    commonest summer-bird, and is the most generally dispersed. In spring its joyous
                    burst of song is repeated time after time, until all around thrills with the
                    loud and merry chorus, and yet never tires the ear. The restless but graceful
                    activity of the bird, as it flits from twig to twig, adds to the charm of its
                    appearance, which Hewitson so well appreciated. The third species, <hi
                        rend="italic">P. collybita</hi> or <hi rend="italic">minor</hi> (frequently
                    but most wrongly called <hi rend="italic">Sylvia rufa</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >P.</hi><hi rend="italic">rufus),</hi> commonly known as the Chiffchaff,
                    from the peculiarity of its constantly repeated two-noted cry, is very numerous
                    in the southern and western part of England, but seems to be scarcer northward.
                    These three species make their nest upon or very close to the <pb break="no"

                    Hence they are commonly called “Oven-birds,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
