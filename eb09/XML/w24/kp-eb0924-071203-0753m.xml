                <p><label type="entry">WYOMING</label>, a Territory of the United States, is nearly
                    rectangular in shape, having as its boundaries the 41st and 45th parallels of N.
                    latitude and the 27th and 34th meridians west of Washington. South of it are
                    Colorado and Utah; on the west, Utah, Idaho, and Montana; on the north, Montana;
                    and on the east, Dakota and Nebraska. The area is 97,890 square miles.</p>
                <p>The surface is greatly diversified. Its mean elevation is great, being probably
                    not less than 6400 feet. The lowest portions of the Territory are along the
                    northern and eastern borders, where in several places the surface is less than
                    5000 feet above sea-level, while its highest points exceed 13,000 feet. By far
                    the greater part consists of high plains, which are broken by numerous mountain
                    ranges and ridges, which form parts of the Rocky Mountain system. This system
                    enters the Territory in the south-eastern part, and traverses it in a north-west
                    direction. On the south it consists of three members, the Laramie range, which
                    is crossed by the Union Pacific railroad at Sherman, and the Medicine Bow and
                    Park ranges, which separate branches of the North Platte river. These ranges run
                    out and fall down into the plain in the southern part of the Territory, leaving
                    for 150 miles a broad flat plateau to represent the Rocky Mountain system. The
                    ill-defined summit of this plateau forms the parting between the waters of the
                    Missouri and Colorado. Eastward this plateau slopes to the Great Plains, and
                    westward to the Green river basin. The Union Pacific Railroad traverses it, and
                    therefore the traveller upon this road sees little of the Rocky Mountains except
                    at a distance. Farther north the mountains rise again from this plateau in
                    several ranges. The principal of these is that known as the Wind River range,
                    which in a sense is continued northward beyond the northern boundary of the
                    Territory by the Absτ,roka range. The former contains the most elevated land in
                    the Territory, its highest peak being Frémont’s, with an elevation of 13,790
                    feet. The latter range is in its southern part a great volcanic plateau,
                    elevated 10,000 to 11,COO feet above the sea, while farther north it is eroded
                    into very rugged mountain forms. About the point where these ranges join, there
                    is a confused mass of mountains of great breadth and considerable height. In
                    this elevated mass rise streams flowing to the Atlantic, the Gulf of California,
                    and the Pacific. The highest peaks of these mountains are those known as the
                    Three Tétons, the most elevated of which, Mount Hayden, has an altitude of
                    13,691 feet. East of the Wind River and Absaroka ranges, and separated from them
                    by the valley of the Wind River and the Big Horn basin, is the range <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n758/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0758-0713"/> known as the Big Horn Mountains, which is reputed
                    to contain peaks having an altitude of 12,000 feet. These ranges form the
                    backbone of the Territory. Eastward from the Big Horn and Laramie ranges stretch
                    the plains in an almost unbroken expanse, gently sloping to the eastward from an
                    altitude of about 6000 feet at the base of the mountains, while south-west of
                    the Wind River range is spread the expanse of the Green river basin, through
                    which flows the principal fork of the Colorado.</p>
                <p>The drainage system of Wyoming is somewhat complex. While the mountainous regions
                    are well watered by numerous streams, the broad valleys and the plains are
                    poorly supplied with streams. Many of those which flow full in the mountains
                    during the entire year run dry in summer upon the plains. None of the streams
                    are navigable. The eastern three-fourths of the Territory is drained by the
                    tributaries of the Missouri to the Atlantic. Of this area the North Platte
                    drains the southern portion of the Rocky Mountain system, together with a large
                    part of the plains lying north and east of it. Farther northward and eastward
                    the plains are drained by the Cheyenne river. The eastern face of the Big Horn
                    mountains is drained by the Powder and Tongue rivers, while from its western
                    slopes, and from the eastern slopes of the Wind River and Absaroka ranges, the
                    Wind River, known lower down in its course as the Big Horn, collects the waters.
                    The Yellowstone, heading in the confused mass of mountains about the north end
                    of the Wind River range, flows northward through a beautiful lake, draining the
                    west slope of the Absaroka range. The Snake, or “Mad” river of the early
                    explorers, heading in the same mass of mountains, flows south-westward to seek
                    an exit from them, while the Green, whose sources are in the same elevated
                    country, drains the west slope of the Wind River range, and flows southward
                    through the broad sage-covered expanse known as the Green river basin. In the
                    southwest corner of the Territory is a small area drained by means of Bear river
                    into Great Salt Lake.</p>
                <p>The geological structure of Wyoming is even more complicated than its surface
                    features. In the northwestern corner is an area in which volcanic action, as
                    represented in hot springs and geysers, is still alive, while the evidences of
                    volcanic action upon a tremendous scale, in recent geological time, are seen in
                    the form of sheets of lava and volcanic breccia, which are spread over the land,
                    and from which mountain ranges have been carved. Most of this region is
                    comprised in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Yellowstone National Park</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.vf,</hi> which has been set apart from settlement by the
                    general Government. Many of the mountain slopes show a succession of the
                    stratified formations, from the Triassic downwards through the series. The
                    plains region is mainly floored by Tertiary and Cretaceous formations, as is
                    also the case with the higher plateaus and with the Green river basin.</p>
                <p>The native fauna of Wyoming resembles that of the other northwest Territories.
                    The larger quadrupeds, which were formerly very abundant, and which are now not
                    unfrequently to be met with, are the grizzly, black, and cinnamon bears, the
                    North American panther, the elk, the moose, two or three species of deer, and
                    the antelope. Upon the plains are seen the grey wolf and the coyote, the jack
                    rabbit, the prairie dog, and the gopher. The buffalo, which was formerly
                    extremely abundant upon the plains, is now practically extinct.</p>
                <p>The eastern plains are mainly grass-covered, but as one goes westward the grass
                    gradually disappears, and gives place to artemisia and greasewood. Forests are
                    confined almost entirely to the mountains, although the high plains in the
                    Yellowstone Park, in the north-western corner of the Territory, are covered with
                    timber. The forests are composed of quaking aspen upon the lower slopes,
                    succeeded at greater elevations by pines and spruces, the upper limit of timber
                    in the Territory being about 10,000 feet above the sea.</p>
                <p>Wyoming has, in common with most of the western States, an arid climate. In the
                    arable regions the rainfall is nowhere sufficient for the needs of agriculture,
                    and irrigation is universally practised. The rainfall ranges in this part of the
                    Territory from 8 to 15 inches, being greater in the eastern part and diminishing
                    westward. Upon the mountains it probably reaches, if it does not exceed, 30
                    inches annually.</p>
                <p>The temperature ranges with the elevation. Upon the plains and plateaus and in
                    the valleys (this comprising nearly all the habitable parts of Wyoming) the
                    annual temperature is between 40° and 50° F. Upon the mountains it diminishes
                    until at an altitude of 10,000 feet it reaches approximately the freezing
                    point.</p>
                <p>At the last census (1880) the Territory contained 20,789 inhabitants. In 1870
                    there were only 9118, showing an increase of 128 per cent. The population is now
                    (1888) estimated at not far from 40,000. As in all frontier communities, a large
                    proportion consists of adult males. In 1880 there were 14,152 males to 6637
                    females. The proportion of the foreign born was large, there being 5850 of this
                    class to 14,939 natives.</p>
                <p>The Territory contains eight counties :—Albany (population 4626), Carbon (3438),
                    Crook (239), Johnson (637), Laramie (6409), Sweetwater (2561), Uinta (2879), and
                    Frémont (formed since 1880). The principal cities are Cheyenne, the capital,
                    which is situated upon the plains, near the east base of the Laramie range
                    (population in 1880, 3456); Laramie City, near the west base of the same range
                    (2696); Rawlins, upon the high plateau forming the continental watershed (1451);
                    and Evanston, in the south-west corner of the Territory (1277).</p>
                <p>The industries of Wyoming mainly relate to the raising of cattle and to mining.
                    The former industry is in proportion to the number of inhabitants very large,
                    and has been until recently extremely profitable. The raising of cattle is
                    carried on at slight expense, the cattle being allowed to range freely over the
                    plains, and little provision is made for feeding and shelter, even in winter, as
                    the loss from exposure and starvation is not sufficiently great to warrant the
                    additional expense. In 1880 the number of cattle was returned as 521.213, and
                    sheep as 450,225. In 1887 the report of the governor states that the number of
                    cattle has increased to 753,648, while that of sheep has slightly diminished,
                    being 421,688.</p>
                <p>Mines of gold and silver have been worked to a limited extent near the east base
                    of the Wind River range and in the north-western part of the Territory, and also
                    at the extreme south, in the Park range, but the production is insignificant. On
                    the other hand, the coal mines of Wyoming are very valuable; they are mainly
                    situated ifl the southern part of the Territory, at Carbon, Rock Spring, Almy,
                    and Twin Creek, on or near the Union Pacific Railroad. The production in 1886
                    was 829,355 tons, valued at $2,488,065.</p>
                <p>As in other Territories, the government of Wyoming is under the immediate
                    jurisdiction of the United States, the executive and judicial officers being
                    appointed by the president. The treasurer is appointed by the governor. The
                    Territory has a legislature consisting of two houses, the members of which are
                    elected by the people.</p>
                <p>The area of Wyoming was in the main included in the Territory of Louisiana,
                    acquired by the United States by purchase from France. The western part was
                    acquired by prior settlement, as was the case with Washington, Oregon, and
                    Idaho. It was organized as a Territory in 1868. The progress of settlement has
                    until recent years been very slow, owing to the inhospitable character of the
                    country along its southern border, traversed by the Union Pacific railroad, and
                    to the occupation by Indians of the more fertile districts. Latterly, as the
                    Indians have been removed, settlement has progressed more rapidly. (H. G*. )</p>
