                    must be under the hand and seal of the person issuing it, unless such
                    formalities be dispensed with by statute. Warrants are of several kinds, and may
                    be conveniently divided into four classes, which may be called the executive,
                    the judicial, the financial, and the private.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Executive.—</hi> A warrant under the sign-manual of the king,
                    countersigned by the lord chancellor or a secretary of state, is still in use
                    for some purposes. It is the means of granting <hi rend="smallcaps">Pardon
                    (</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> q.v.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">)</hi> and
                    letters patent (except those for inventions), and of framing certain regulations
                    for the forces. It was by royal warrant (afterwards confirmed by Act of
                    Parliament) that purchase of commissions in the army was abolished in 1871.<note

                    called no doubt from the mode of his appointment) is a distinct rank in both the

                    293.</p></note> By 18 Hen. VI. c. 1 letters patent are to bear the date of the
                    king’s warrant delivered to the lord chancellor. The issue of warrants under the
                    sign-manual has been recently regulated by the Great Seal Act, 1884. Such a
                    warrant must bear a ten-shilling stamp. Royal warrants were at one time in
                    considerably more frequent use than they are at present. For instance, in 1602
                    the censorship of the stage was committed to the poet Daniel by royal warrant
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Theatre).</hi> A false representation that any goods
                    were made by a person holding a royal warrant is now punishable under the
                    Merchandise Marks Act, 1887. The issue of warrants under the hand of a secretary
                    of state is now, with two exceptions, confined to cases in which there is
                    suspicion of treason or treasonable practices, and the warrant must name the
                    person whom it is intended to arrest. The exceptions are the cases of bringing
                    up a prisoner to give evidence under 16 and 17 Vict. c. 30, and warrants issued
                    under the Extradition Act (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Extradition).</hi> By 16
                    Car. I. c. 10, if any person be imprisoned by warrant of the king in person, of
                    the council board, or any of the privy council, he is entitled to a writ of <hi
                    rend="italic">habeas corpus.</hi> By the Habeas Corpus Act, 31 Car. II. c. 2,
                    detention on a legal warrant is good ground for refusing discharge to the
                    prisoner on return to a writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus.</hi> General
                    warrants of a secretary of state were decided to be illegal in 1763. A named
                    person may still be committed by a secretary of state’s warrant, but his papers
                    cannot be seized (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Press Laws).</hi> Power to issue
                    warrants to search for arms and to arrest for treason or treasonable practices
                    in Ireland has been given by various Acts, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 44 Vict.
                    cc. 4, 5, and by the Criminal Law and Procedure Act, 1887. The right of a
                    secretary of state or the lord lieutenant in Ireland by warrant to detain or
                    open letters in the postoffice still exists, and has been recognized by orders
                    in council and proclamations in the 17th century, and more recently by various
                    Post-Office Acts, such as 9 Anne c. 10, 35 Geo. III. c. 62, 7 Will. IV. and 1
                    Vict. c. 36. The right was finally established by the reports of committees of
                    both houses appointed in 1844 on a complaint by Mazzini and others that Sir
                    James Graham, then home secretary, had opened their letters. It was exercised as
                    recently as 1881 over the letters of persons suspected of treasonable
                    correspondence in Ireland. Committal for breach of privilege of the House of
                    Commons is by warrant of the speaker. A warrant of a law officer of the crown
                    for sealing letters patent for invention was necessary under the old patent law,
                    but has been superseded by other procedure since the Patents Act, 1883. The
                    lowest form of executive warrant is the warrant of a sheriff to his bailiff in
                    pursuance of a writ.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Judicial.—</hi> Warrants of this kind are used in either civil
                    or criminal procedure. The only kind used in both seems to be that issued by a
                    judge of the High Court, who has the same jurisdiction as a secretary of state
                    under 16 and 17 Vict. c. 30. In civil procedure the warrant in a county court
                    corresponds very nearly to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Writ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.)</hi> in the High Court. Examples of county court warrants are those of
                    attachment, delivery, execution, and possession. The warrant of arrest in
                    Admiralty is a form of procedure confined to Courts of Admiralty jurisdiction.
                    The most important and frequent use of the warrant is for the apprehension of an
                    accused person to be brought before a court of summary jurisdiction, either in
                    the first instance or on failure to obey a summons (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Summary Jurisdiction, Summons).</hi> Such warrants are usually issued by a
                    justice of the peace; when issued by the court they are called bench warrants.
                    Where issued by a justice for execution out of his jurisdiction, a warrant must
                    usually be backed by another justice having jurisdiction where it is to be
                    executed. The warrant of a justice may also issue in some non-judicial matters,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> for the compul sory supply of carriages under the
                    Army Act, 1881. There are certain warrants which by common law or statute extend
                    much further than ordinary judicial warrants. Those issued under the Fugitive
                    Offenders Act, 1881, if duly backed, extend throughout the British empire.
                    Warrants of a court having jurisdiction in bankruptcy run throughout the United
                    Kingdom. A judge of the Queen’s Bench Division has, both at common law and by
                    statute, authority to issue a warrant in certain cases. Such a warrant is valid
                    throughout England. Execution of the decisions of a court of summary
                    jurisdiction is secured by warrants, part of the process of the court, such as
                    warrants of distress or commitment. A warrant may also issue for the
                    apprehension of a witness whose attendance cannot be otherwise assured. A search
                    warrant may be granted for the purpose of searching suspected premises for
                    stolen goods. Special powers for issuing such warrants are given by the Army,
                    Merchant Shipping, Customs, Pawnbrokers, Stamp, and other Acts. The Criminal Law
                    Amendment Act, 1885, allows the issue of search warrants where it is suspected
                    that a female is unlawfully detained for immoral purposes. As a general rule no
                    one can be arrested without warrant. To this rule there are certain exceptions
                    either at common law or by statute.. At common law a justice of the peace, a
                    sheriff, a coroner, a constable, and even a private person, may arrest any one
                    without warrant for a treason, felony, or breach of the peace committed, or
                    attempted to be committed, in his presence. A constable (whether a constable at
                    common law or a police constable appointed under the Police Acts) may arrest a
                    person indicted for felony; a constable or a private person may arrest on
                    reasonable suspicion that he who is arrested has committed a felony. But in the
                    latter case he does so at his peril, for he must prove (what the constable need
                    not) that there has been an actual commission of the crime by some one, as well
                    as a reasonable ground for suspecting the particular person. What is a
                    reasonable ground it is of course impossible to define, but, in the case of a
                    constable, a charge by a person not manifestly unworthy of credit is generally
                    regarded as sufficient. An accused person who <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n395/mode/1up"

                    the police may assist in the arrest. In neither case is a warrant necessary. Nor
                    is it necessary for the apprehension of one against whom the hue and cry is
                    raised (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Theft).</hi> The king cannot arrest in person
                    or by verbal command, as no action would lie against him for wrongful arrest.
                    Statutory powers of arrest without warrant are given to both constables and
                    private persons by numerous Acts of Parliament, for instance, the Game Act of 9
                    Geo. IV. c. 69, various Police Acts, the Criminal Law Consolidation Acts of
                    1861, the Prevention of Crime Act, 1871. The possession of a legal warrant by a
                    peace officer on arrest is of great importance in determining whether the person
                    resisting apprehension is justified or not in so doing. Should the officer
                    attempt to apprehend him on an illegal warrant, or without a warrant in a case
                    where a warrant is necessary, and be killed in the attempt, the killing would
                    probably be held to be manslaughter and not murder. The authorities on this
                    point are, however, conflicting. In an action against a peace officer for arrest
                    on an illegal warrant, he is, by 24 Geo. II. c. 44, entitled to demand perusal
                    and a copy of the warrant. Execution of warrants in border counties of England
                    and Scotland, and backing and execution of warrants issued in one part of the
                    kingdom by justices and officers of another part, are specially provided for by
                    numerous Acts of Parliament. Forms of warrants will be found in the schedule to
                    the rules under the Summary Jurisdiction Act and the appendix to the County
                    Court Rules, 1886.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Financial.—</hi> Payment out of the Treasury is generally made
                    upon warrant. Treasury warrants are regulated by many of the Acts dealing with
                    the national debt. Payment of dividends by trading corporations and companies is
                    generally made by means of dividend warrants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Private.—</hi> Warrants issued by private persons are either
                    mercantile or non-mercantile. Mercantile warrants are negotiable instruments
                    giving a right to the delivery of goods, generally those deposited at a dock or
                    warehouse, and by mercantile custom regarded as documents of title to the goods
                    to which they relate. They have been recognized by the legislature, especially
                    in the Factors Acts (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Factor).</hi> Thus the
                    interpretation clause of one of those Acts, 5 and 6 Vict. c. 39, included under
                    the head of documents of title India warrants, dock warrants, and warehouse
                    keepers’ warrants. The forgery of any warrant or endorsement or assignment of
                    any warrant of this kind is by 24 and 25 Vict. c. 98 punishable with a maximum
                    penalty of penal servitude for life. The stamp on such a warrant is, with
                    certain exceptions, threepence. Among private warrants of a non-mercantile kind
                    those in the most frequent use are warrants of distress, by which a landlord
                    empowers his agent to distrain for arrears of rent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Warrant of Attorney</hi> to confess judgment is a security for
                    money (now practically obsolete) in the form of a warrant to a solicitor named
                    by the creditor, empowering him to sign judgment in an action against the debtor
                    for the sum due, with a defeasance, or clause that the warrant shall not be put
                    into force in case of due payment of the money secured. It was often used as a
                    collateral security for the payment of an annuity. The Debtors Act, 1869,
                    contained various provisions for making known to the debtor the extent of the
                    liability incurred by him, among others that the warrant must be executed in the
                    presence of a solicitor named by the debtor, and that it and the defeasance must
                    be written on the same paper. A warrant of attorney must be duly stamped,
                    generally as a <hi rend="smallcaps">Mortgage</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>),
                    and must be registered as a judgment in the central office of the Supreme
                    Court.</p>
                <p>Quo <hi rend="smallcaps">Warranto (</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> q.v</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">.)</hi> is a means of determining the right of a person to
                    continue to hold an office.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> By Art. xxiv. of the Articles of Union royal
                    warrants were to continue to be kept as before the union. The Secretary for
                    Scotland Act, 1885, enabled the crown by royal warrant to appoint the secretary
                    to be vice-president of the Scotch Education Department. The lord advocate’s
                    warrant runs throughout the whole of Scotland. Warrants issued by courts of
                    summary jurisdiction agree in the main with those in use in England, though
                    their names are not the same (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Summary
                    Jurisdiction).</hi> There are numerous statutory provisions as to warrants of
                    other kinds. By 1 and 2 Vict. c. 114 warrants for diligence, and to charge the
                    debtor under pain of imprisonment, may be inserted in an extract of decree; and
                    in a summons concluding for payment of money a warrant to arrest the movables,
                    debts, and money of the defender may be included. By 31 and 32 Vict. c. 100 a
                    warrant of inhibition may be inserted in the will of a summons. A crown writ is
                    a warrant for infeftment (31 and 32 Vict. c. 101). The same Act gives forms of
                    warrants of R <hi rend="smallcaps">egistration</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi>
                    The practice as to warrants of citation and commitment in the High Court of
                    Justiciary and the sheriff court now depends chiefly on the Criminal Procedure
                    Act, 1887, 50 and 51 Vict. c. 35. The <hi rend="italic">meditatio fugae</hi>
                    warrant is a judicial warrant on which imprisonment may follow until the debtor
                    give <hi rend="italic">cautio judicio sisti.</hi> It corresponds to some extent
                    to the writ <hi rend="italic">ue exeat regno</hi> of English practice, but it
                    may be issued by a sheriff (1 and 2 Vict. c. 119). A border warrant for
                    arresting a debtor on the English side of the border is another kind of judicial
                    warrant. The warrant of attorney is not known in Scotland, its place being taken
                    by the clause of registration, which has this advantage over the warrant of
                    attorney that it is not avoided, as is the warrant, by the death of the person
                    giving it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> By the constitutions of the United States
                    and of almost all the States, warrants are not to issue but upon probable cause,
                    supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be
                    searched and the persons or thing to be seized. These provisions have been held
                    not to mean that there shall be no arrest without warrant, but to confine the
                    right of arrest to circumstances similar to those which justify it in English
                    law. The constitutions of some States forbid general warrants. A warrant is
                    generally necessary for the payment of money out of the United States or a State
                    treasury. (J. W†. )</p>
