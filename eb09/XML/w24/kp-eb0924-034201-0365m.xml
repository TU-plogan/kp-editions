                    hardly a name in our literature, even of the first rank, whose immortality is
                    more secure, or whose personality is the subject of a more devoted cult. Not
                    only is he the <hi rend="italic">sacer vates</hi> of a considerable sect in the
                    religion of recreation, but multitudes who have never put a worm on a hook—even
                    on a fly-hook—have been caught and securely held by his picture of the delights
                    of the gentle craft and his easy leisurely transcript of his own simple,
                    peaceable, lovable, and amusing character.</p>
                <p>A succession of devotees have supplemented by patient inquiry what he tells us of
                    himself. He was born at Stafford in August 1593; the register of his baptism
                    gives his father’s name as Jervis, and nothing more is known of his parentage.
                    He settled in London as a shopkeeper, and at first had one of the small shops,
                    seven and a half feet by five, in the upper story of Gresham’s Royal Burse or
                    Exchange in Cornhill. In 1624 he had a shop in Fleet Street opposite the Temple,
                    and was described as a linendraper. In 1632 he bought a lease of a house and
                    shop in Chancery Lane, and was described as a “sempster” or milliner.<note

                    men’s clothes in those days; hence his location near the fashionable

                    great-great-niece of Archbishop Cranmer.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    being also of distinguished clerical connexion, Anne Ken—the pastoral “Kenna” of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Angler's Wish</hi> —sister of Thomas Ken, afterwards
                    bishop of Bath and Wells. When the civil war broke out, he retired from
                    business. He had bought some land near his birthplace, Stafford, and he went to
                    live there, but, according to Wood, spent most of his time “in the families of
                    the eminent clergymen of England, of whom he was much beloved.” His second wife
                    died in 1662, and was buried in Worcester cathedral church, where there is a
                    monument to her memory. One of his daughters married Dr Hawkins, a prebendary of
                    Winchester, in whose house he died in December 1683, at the age of ninety. The
                    last forty years of his long life seem to have been spent in ideal leisure and
                    occupation, the old man travelling here and there, visiting his “eminent
                    clergymen” and other brethren of the angle, compiling the biographies of
                    congenial spirits, and collecting here a little and there a little for the
                    enlargement of his famous treatise.</p>
                <p>The first edition of <hi rend="italic">The Compleat Angler</hi> was published in
                    1653, but the peaceful angler continued to add to its completeness in his
                    leisurely way for a quarter of a century. There was a second edition in 1656, a
                    third in 1661 (identical with that of 1664), a fourth in 1668, and a fifth in
                    1676. In this last edition the thirteen chapters of the original have grown to
                    twenty-one, and a second part was added by his loving friend and brother angler
                    Charles Cotton, who took up “Venator” where Walton had left him and completed
                    his instruction in fly-fishing and the making of flies.</p>
                <p>Walton did not profess to be an expert with the fly; the fly-fishing in his first
                    edition was contributed by Mr Thomas Barker, a retired cook and humorist, who
                    produced a treatise of his own in 1659; but in the use of the live worm, the
                    grasshopper, and the frog “Piscator” himself could speak as a master. The famous
                    passage about the frog—often misquoted about the worm— “use him as though you
                    loved him, that is, harm him as little as you may possibly, that he may live the
                    longer”—appears in the original edition. The additions made as the work grew
                    were not merely to the didactic part; happy quotations, new turns of phrase,
                    songs, poems, and anecdotes were introduced as if the leisurely author, who
                    wrote it as a recreation, had kept it constantly in his mind and talked it over
                    point by point with his numerous brethren. Thero were originally only two
                    interlocutors in the opening scene, “Piscator” and “Viator”; but in the second
                    edition, as if in answer to an objection that “Piscator” had it too much in his
                    own way in praise of angling, he introduced the falconer, “Auceps,” changed
                    “Viator” into “Venator,” and made the new companions each dilate on the joys of
                    his favourite sport.</p>
                <p>Although <hi rend="italic">The Compleat Angler</hi> was not Walton’s first
                    literary work, his leisurely labours as a biographer seem to have grown out of
                    his devotion to angling. It was probably as an angler that he made the
                    acquaintance of Sir Henry Wotton, but it is clear that Walton, whatever his
                    education and breeding may have been, must have had more than a love of fishing
                    and a humorous temper to recommend him to the friendship of the accomplished
                    ambassador. At any rate, Wotton, who had intended to write the life of John
                    Donne, left the task to Walton, who had lamented his pastor’s death in an <hi
                    rend="italic">Elegy</hi> in 1633, and now completed and published the life, much
                    to the satisfaction of the most learned critics, in 1640. Sir Henry Wotton dying
                    in 1639, Walton undertook his life also; it was finished in 1642, and published
                    in 1651. His life of Hooker was published in 1662, George Herbert in 1670, and
                    Bishop Sanderson in 1678. All these subjects were endeared to the biographer by
                    a certain gentleness of disposition and cheerful piety; three of them at least,
                    Donne, Wotton, and Herbert, were anglers. Their lives were evidently written
                    with loving pains, in the same leisurely fashion as his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Angler,</hi> and like it are of value less as exact knowledge than as
                    harmonious and complete pictures of character. Walton also rendered affectionate
                    service to the memory of his friends Sir John Skeffington and John Chalkhill,
                    editing with prefatory notices Skeffington’s <hi rend="italic">Hero of
                    Lorenzo</hi> in 1652, and Chalkhill’s<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The existence of Chalkhill was called in question by S. W.
                    Singer in 1820, and the pastoral supposed to be Walton’s own. There can be
                    little doubt that the poet is the same person whose tomb is in Winchester
                    cathedral, and that Walton was simply mistaken in describing him as “an
                    acquaintant and friend of Edmund Spenser.”</p></note><hi rend="italic">Thealma

                    facsimile of the original edition of the <hi rend="italic">Angler</hi> was
                    issued by Bagster in 1810, another by Elliot Stock in 1876. (W. Μ.)</p>
