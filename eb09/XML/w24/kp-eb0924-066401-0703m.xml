                    Charing Cross by rail and 12 by steamer. The town is irregularly built, with
                    narrow streets, and for the most part mean-looking houses. The spacious level at
                    the summit of the hill is known as Woolwich Common. The feature of Woolwich is
                    the Royal Arsenal, at which the number of men usually employed is about 10,000.
                    It occupies an area of 333 acres, and includes four departments :—the royal gun
                    factories, employed in the manufacture of rifled wrought-iron and steel
                    ordnance, the principal divisions being the rolling and puddling furnaces, the
                    coiling mills, the boring mills, the tanneries, and the steam-hammers, including
                    one of 40 tons; the royal carriage department, for the manufacture of gun
                    carriages, pontoon trains, baggage and store waggons, and ambulances for the
                    sick and wounded; the royal laboratory department, for the manufacture of shot
                    and shell, caps, fuzes, &lt;fcc.; and the ordnance store department of the army,
                    for the supply of every kind of military equipment. Separated from the other
                    portions of the arsenal are the laboratories for the manufacture of rockets and
                    cannon cartridges. The Royal Artillery Barracks, facing the Common, originally
                    erected in 1775, has been greatly extended at different times, and now consists
                    of six ranges of brick building, each over 400 feet in length. It includes a
                    church in the Italian Gothic style erected in 1863, a theatre, and a library of
                    40,000 volumes in connexion with the officers’ mess room. Opposite the barracks
                    is the memorial to the officers and men of the royal artillery who fell in the
                    Crimean War, a bronze figure of Victory cast out of cannon captured in the
                    Crimea. Near the barracks is the Royal Artillery Institution, with a fine museum
                    and a lecture hall. On the western side of the barrack field is the Royal
                    Military Repository, where all officers of artillery pass a term of instruction.
                    Within the Repository enclosure is the Rotunda, originally erected in St James’s
                    Park for the reception of the allied sovereigns in 1814, and shortly afterwards
                    transferred to its present site. It contains models of the principal dockyards
                    and fortifications of the British empire, naval models of all dates, and
                    numerous specimens of weapons of war from the remotest times to the present day.
                    On the Common is the Royal Military Academy, where cadets are trained for the
                    artillery and engineering services, erected in the castellated style from the
                    design of Sir R. Wyatville in 1801. Within the grounds is a memorial erected to
                    the prince imperial of France, for two years a student in the academy; while
                    near the Rotunda is a monument erected in 1882 to the memory <pb break="no"

                    the Zulu and Afghan wars of 1879. In addition to the great barracks of the royal
                    artillery there are a number of other barracks, and a permanent camp of huts. At
                    the southeast extremity of the Common is the Hubert military hospital. The
                    parish church of St Mary Magdalene was rebuilt, in 1726-29, near the site of the
                    old one dating from before the 12th century. The other parishes are Holy
                    Trinity, St John the Evangelist, and St Michael’s and All Angels. The
                    Goldsmiths’ almshouses, originally founded by Sir Martin Bowes, who was lord
                    mayor of London in 1545, and rebuilt in 1771 by the Goldsmiths’ Company, are
                    (1888), on the appropriation of the charity to pensions, to be purchased by the
                    trustees of the present parochial almshouses, built by private benevolence.*
                    Behind the Royal Military Academy is a mineral well, “the Shooter’s Hill waters”
                    of Evelyn. Near Woolwich Common there are brick and tile kilns and sand and
                    chalk pits. In the neighbourhood are extensive market-gardens. The town is
                    governed by a local board of health, and is within the jurisdiction of the
                    central criminal court and the metropolitan police. The population of the entire
                    parish of Woolwich (area 1126 acres) in 1871 was 35,557 and in 1881 it was
                    36,665. The population of the district now included in the parliamentary
                    borough, which comprises the parishes of Woolwich, Eltham, and Plumstead, was
                    74,963 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Woolwich (Wnlewich) is mentioned in a grant of land by King Edward in 964 to the
                    abbey of St Peter at Ghent. In Domesday, where the manor is mentioned as
                    consisting of 63 acres of land, it is named Hulviz. The Roman Watling Street
                    crossed Shooter’s Hill, and a Roman cemetery is supposed to have occupied the
                    site of the Royal Arsenal, numerous Roman urns and fragments of Roman pottery
                    having been dug up in the neighbourhood. Woolwich seems to have been a small
                    fishing village until in the beginning of the 16th century it rose into
                    prominence as a dockyard and naval station. There is evidence that ships were
                    built at Woolwich in the reign of Henry VII., but it was with the purchase by
                    Henry VIII. of two parcels of land in the manor of Woolwich, called Boughton’s
                    Docks, that the foundation of the town’s prosperity was laid, the launching of
                    the “Harry Grâce de Dieu,” of 1000 tons burden, making an epoch in its history.
                    Woolwich remained the chief dockyard of the English navy until the introduction
                    of iron ship building, but the dockyard was finally closed in 1870. The town has
                    been the headquarters of the royal artillery since the establishment of a
                    separate branch of this service in the reign of George I. An arsenal existed at
                    Woolwich in the reign of Henry VII., and the laboratory is mentioned in 1695. On
                    account of an explosion at Moorfields, the gun foundry was removed to Woolwich
                    in 1716, but the establishment was of minor importance until the commencement of
                    the Napoleonic wars. In 1860 the arsenal was greatly extended. Formerly Woolwich
                    was included in the parliamentary borough of Greenwich, but in 1885 it was made
                    a separate borough returning one member.</p>
