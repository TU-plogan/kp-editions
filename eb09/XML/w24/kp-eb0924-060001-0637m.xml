                    21 miles from London by the Great Western Railway, situated on the right bank of
                    the Thames, is chiefly remarkable for its royal castle. The town itself<note

                    south-east of Windsor Castle.</p><p/></note> is of no special interest, in spite
                    of its great antiquity. In 1276 Edward I. made Windsor a free borough. In 1302
                    it began to send representatives to parliament, though at irregular intervals,
                    and from the time of Henry VI. it returned two members till 1867, when they were
                    reduced to one. The town is presided over by a mayor, aidermen, and councillors,
                    who were incorporated by a charter of Edward IV. The town-hall was built in 1686
                    by Sir</p>
                <p>Christopher Wren, but was much altered in 1852. The Thames is crossed here by a
                    bridge resting on three granite piers (1823). The parish church of St John the
                    Baptist was rebuilt in 1822; the other two churches are also modern. The town
                    was formerly celebrated for the number of its inns, of which “The Garter” and
                    “The White Hart” were the chief. The former was the favourite inn of
                    Shakespeare’s Sir John Falstaff, and is frequently mentioned in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Merry Wives of Windsor.</hi> In 1650 the town contained 70 inns,
                    many of which were very picturesque half-timbered buildings; but none of these
                    now exist. In <pb break="no"

                    11,769 and in 1881 12,273; that of the parliamentary borough (area 3253 acres)
                    in the same years was 17,281 and 19,082 respectively. Of this last total 3464
                    were in Buckinghamshire, into which county the parliamentary borough of Windsor
                    extends.</p>
                <p>Windsor Castle, from its commanding position, its stately group of ancient
                    buildings, and its long list of historical associations, is one of the most
                    magnificent and interesting of royal palaces. It has for many centuries been the
                    chief residence of the English sovereigns.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the time of the Heptarchy a stronghold of some importance existed at Windsor;
                    the chief part of this still remains, and forms the great circular mound, about
                    125 feet in diameter, on which the Round Tower now stands. This great earthwork
                    was once surrounded by the fosse, agger, and vallum which were usually
                    constructed to defend both Roman and Saxon strongholds. The primitive wooden
                    enclosure was replaced by a stone circuit-wall in the time of William the
                    Conqueror; and the first complete Round Tower was built by Henry III. about
                    1272, but was wholly reconstructed on a more massive scale by Edward III., who
                    in 1344 designed the new tower to form a meeting-place for his newly-established
                    order of the Knights of the Garter. Edward selected this spot because, according
                    to a popular legend (quoted by Froissart), it was on the summit of the circular
                    mound that King Arthur used to sit surrounded by his knights of the Round Table.
                    The main bulk of the present Round Tower is of this date; but its walls were
                    heightened, and the tall flag-turret was added by the court architect, Sir
                    Jeffrey Wyatville, in the reign of George IV. In addition to the Round Tower,
                    Henry III. constructed long lines of circuit-walls, crowned at intervals with
                    many smaller towers, one of which, named after him, still exists in good
                    preservation. He also built a great hall, kitchen, and other apartments,
                    together with a chapel, which was afterwards pulled down to make room for the
                    present chapel of St George. The beautiful little chapel cloister which Henry
                    III. built still exists, and on its walls are traces of contemporary paintings
                    in distemper. Another chapel was built by Henry III. and dedicated to his
                    favourite saint, Edward the Confessor. This graceful building, with an eastern
                    apse, is now called the Albert Memorial Chapel; a good deal of Henry III.’s work
                    still exists in the lower part of its walls, but the upper part was rebuilt in
                    1501-3 by Henry VII. Some years later the unfinished chapel was given by Henry
                    VIII. to Cardinal Wolsey, and for long after it was known as “Wolsey’s
                    tomb-house.” Wolsey engaged a Florentine sculptor named Benedetto<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Probably a son or nephew of
                    the Florentine sculptor Benedetto da Maiano, who died in 1497; another member of
                    the same family was employed by Wolsey at Hampton Court.</p></note> to make him
                    a very magnificent and costly tomb of marble and gilt bronze, with a recumbent
                    effigy at the top, probably very similar in design to Torrigiano’s tomb of Henry
                    VII. at Westminster. The rich bronze work of Wolsey’s tomb was torn off and
                    melted by order of the Commonwealth in 1642, and the mere metal was sold for the
                    then large sum of £600. In 1805 the black marble sarcophagus, stripped of its
                    bronze ornaments, was moved from Windsor and used as a monument over Nelson’s
                    grave in the crypt of St Paul’s. Though Wolsey’s tomb-house was roofed in and
                    used for mass by James II., the stone vaulting was not completed till recent
                    times, when the whole place was fitted up by Sir Gilbert Scott as a memorial to
                    the Prince Consort. Its internal walls were then lined with rich marbles, and
                    decorated with reliefs by Baron Triqueti, in a style somewhat tawdry and
                    discordant with the old building.</p>
                <p>The magnificent chapel of St George ranks next to Westminster Abbey as a royal
                    mausoleum, though no king was buried there before Edward IV., who left
                    directions in his will that a very splendid tomb was to be erected with an
                    effigy of himself in silver. Nothing now remains of this, except part of the
                    wrought iron grille which surrounded the tomb—one of the most elaborate and
                    skilfully wrought pieces of iron-work in the world. This grille has recently
                    been moved from the north aisle to the north side of the sanctuary. The next
                    sovereign buried here was Henry VIII., who directed that his body should be laid
                    beside that of Jane Seymour, in a magnificent bronze and marble tomb. The tomb
                    was never completed, and what existed of its metal-work was probably melted down
                    by the Commonwealth. No trace of it now remains. The chapel itself is one of the
                    finest examples of Perpendicular architecture in England, and is on the whole
                    finer in design than the other two royal chapels, those of King’s College at
                    Cambridge and that of Henry VII. at Wéstminster, which were a little later in
                    date. The existing building was begun by Edward IV., who in 1473 pulled down
                    almost the whole of the earlier chapel, which had been completed and filled with
                    stained glass by Edward III. in 1363. The nave of St George’s was vaulted about
                    the year 1490, but the choir groining was not finished till 1507; the hanging
                    pendants from the fan vaulting of the choir mark a later development of style,
                    which contrasts strongly with the simpler lines of the earlier nave vault. In
                    1516 the lantern and the rood-screen were completed, but the stalls and other
                    fittings were not finished till after 1519.</p>
                <p>The present private apartments of the sovereign at Windsor were mostly rebuilt or
                    remodelled by Sir Jeffrey Wyatville, but some of the rooms, and especially the
                    library, contain fine mantelpieces and ceilings of the 16th and 17th centuries.
                    Among the many treasures preserved in t ’ he royal library is a fine collection
                    of drawings by the chief Italian painters, together with three volumes of MSS.
                    in the autograph of Leonardo da Vinci, illustrated with many drawings by his
                    hand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These have
                    recently been printed with an English translation by Dr Richter, London, 1883.

                    1854, vol. it.</p><p/></note> The library also contains a magnificent series of
                    portraits by Holbein, eighty-seven in number, highly finished in sepia and
                    chalk, representing the chief personages of Henry VIII.’s court—all of them
                    works of the highest beauty and marvels of iconic vigour. The foundation
                    attached to the royal chapel, which possesses the privileges of a “royal
                    peculiar,” consists of a dean, who is exempt from any episcopal jurisdiction,
                    and a’college of canons.</p>
                <p>The royal forest of Windsor is one of the finest in the country, though it has
                    been much reduced in size even since 1790, when it contained about 60,000 acres;
                    many of its oaks are of great size and antiquity. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi>
