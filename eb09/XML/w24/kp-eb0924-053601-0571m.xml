                    meaning,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The vulgar
                    supposition of its being an euphemism of an Anglo-Saxon name <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi> Bennett’s ed. of White’s <hi rend="italic">Nat. Hist. Selborηe,</hi>
                    p. 69, note) must be rejected until evidence that such a name ever existed be
                    adduced. It is true that “Whittaile” (c∕. Dutch <hi rend="italic">Witstaart</hi>
                    and French <hi rend="italic">CulblanS)</hi> is given by Cotgrave in 1611; but
                    the older names, according to Turner, in 1544, of “Clotburd” ( = Clod-bird) and
                    Smatch ( = Chat) do not favour the usual derivation. “Fallow-chat” is another
                    old name still locally in use, as is “Coney-chuck.”</p></note> though Taylor,
                    the “water poet” (d. 1654), in whose writings it seems first to occur, and
                    Willughby explain it (in the words of Ray, the latter’s translator) as given
                    “because [in] the time of wheat harvest they wax very fat.” It would seem also
                    from this author to have been originally the local name for the species in
                    Sussex, on the South Downs of which county its capture in a very simple kind of
                    trap has been the occupation of many generations of shepherds, who thereby have
                    made an excellent trade, since Wheatears in their proper season, from the end of
                    July till towards the end of September, are justly esteemed for the table and
                    fetch a price that for many years has been continually rising owing to the
                    failing supply, which is chiefly due to the bringing under tillage of so much of
                    the sheep-walk, heath, down, and other open country that was formerly in a
                    natural condition.</p>
                <p>The Wheatear, the <hi rend="italic">Saxicola</hi><hi rend="italic">oenanthe</hi>
                    of ornithologists, is one of the earliest migrants of its kind to return to its
                    home, often reaching <pb break="no"

                    by the middle of March. The cock bird, with his bluish grey back and light buff
                    breast, set off by black ear-coverts, wings, and part of the tail, is rendered
                    still more conspicuous by his white rump as he takes short flights in front of
                    those who disturb him, while his sprightly actions and gay song harmonize so
                    well with his delicately-tinted plumage as to render him a welcome object to all
                    who delight in free and open country. When alarmed both sexes have a sharp
                    monosyllabic note that sounds like <hi rend="italic">chat</hi>; and this has not
                    only entered into some of the local names of this species and of its allies, but
                    has caused all to be frequently spoken of as “Chats.” The nest is constantly
                    placed under ground; the bird takes advantage of the hole of some other animal,
                    or the shelter of a clod in a fallowfield, or a recess beneath a rock. A large
                    amount of soft materials is therein collected, and on them from 5 to 8 pale blue
                    eggs are laid. The Wheatear has a very wide range throughout the Old World,
                    extending in summer far within the Arctic Circle, from Norway to the Lena and
                    Yana valleys, while it winters in Africa beyond the Equator, and in India. But
                    it also breeds regularly in Greenland and some parts of North America. Its
                    reaching the former and the eastern coast of the latter, as well as the
                    Bermudas, may possibly be explained by the drifting of individuals from Iceland;
                    but far more interesting is the fact of its continued seasonal appearance in
                    Alaska without ever showing itself in British Columbia or California, and
                    without ever having been observed in Kamchatka, Japan, or China, though it is a
                    summer resident in the Tchuktchi peninsula. Hence it would seem as though its
                    annual flights across Bering’s Strait must be in connexion with a migratory
                    movement that passes to the north and west of the Stanovoi range of mountains,
                    for Mr Nelson’s suggestion <hi rend="italic">{Cruise of the Corwen,</hi> pp. 59,

                    likely.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On this subject
                    see also Dr Stejneger’s observations in his “Ornithological Exploration of
                    Kamtschatka,” in <hi rend="italic">Bull. U.S. Nat. Museum,</hi> No. 29, pp.

                <p>More than 60 other species more or less allied to the Wheatear have been
                    described,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    probably so many do not really exist. Some 8 are included in the European fauna;
                    but the majority are inhabitants of Africa. Several of them are birds of the
                    desert; and here it may be remarked that, while most of these exhibit the
                    sandcoloured tints so commonly found in animals of like habitat, a few assume a
                    black plumage, which, as explained by Canon Tristram, is equally protective,
                    since it assimilates them to the deep shadows cast by projecting stones and
                    other inequalities of the surface.</p>
                <p>Of other genera closely allied to, and by some writers included in, <hi
                    rend="italic">Saxicola</hi> there is only need here to mention <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pratincola,</hi> which comprises among others two well-known British birds, the
                    Stonechat and Whinchat, <hi rend="italic">P. rubicolα</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >P. ηιbetra,</hi> the latter a summermigrant, while the former is resident as a
                    species, and the black head, ruddy breast, and white collar and wing-spot of the
                    cock render him a conspicuous object on almost every furze-grown common or heath
                    in the British Islands, as he sits on a projecting twig or flits from bush to
                    bush. This bird has a wide range in Europe, and several other species, more or
                    less resembling it, inhabit South Africa, Madagascar, Réunion, and Asia, from
                    some of the islands of the Indian Archipelago to Japan. The Whinchat, on the
                    other hand, much more affects enclosed lands, and with a wide range has no very
                    near ally.</p>
                <p>Placed near these forms by nearly all systematists is the group containing the
                    Australian genus <hi rend="italic">Petraeca,</hi> containing about a dozen
                    species,—the “Robins,” so called of the colonists, some of them remarkable for
                    their bright plumage; and possibly allied to them, as indeed is generally
                    thought, with 5 or 6 species peculiar to New Zealand, are the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Miro</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Myiomoira.</hi> But Prof. Parker
                    has seen in the osteology of the first inferior characters which appear to him
                    to separate them from their presumed colleagues, and, as stated before <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Ornithology,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 48), he terms them
                    “Struthious Warblers.” Like so many other forms from the same countries, they
                    probably preserve the more generalized structure of earlier and lower types, and
                    should possibly be distinguished as a separate sub-family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Petraecinae.</hi></p>
                <p>All the birds mentioned in this article form the group <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saxicolinae</hi> of most authors. Some, however, have raised them to the rank
                    of a distinct Family <hi rend="italic">Saxicolidae (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Warbler)</hi>; and Mr Sharpe <hi rend="italic">(Cat. Birds Brit.</hi><hi
