                    in comparative anatomy. Aided by a public <hi rend="italic">stipendium,</hi> he
                    spent a year or more studying in the Jardin des Plantes, under the friendly eye
                    of Cuvier, and in making zoological discoveries at Cagliari and other places on
                    the Mediterranean. On his return he set up in medical practice at Augsburg,
                    whither his father had been transferred; but in a few months he found an opening
                    for an academical career, on being appointed prosector at Erlangen. In 1832 he
                    became full professor of zoology and comparative anatomy there, and held that
                    office until 1840, when he was called to succeed Blumenbach at Göttingen. At the
                    Hanoverian university he remained till his death in 1864, being much occupied
                    with administrative work as pro-rector for a number of years, and for nearly the
                    whole of his residence troubled by ill-health (hereditary phthisis). In 1860 he
                    gave over the physiological part of his teaching to a new chair, retaining the
                    zoological, with which his career had begun. While at Frankfurt, on his way to
                    examine the Neanderthal skull at Bonn, he was struck with paralysis, and died at
                    Göttingen a few months later (May 1864) in his 59th year.</p>
                <p>Wagner’s activity as a writer and worker was enormous, and his range extensive,
                    most of his hard work having been done at Erlangen while his health was good.
                    His graduation thesis was on the ambitious subject of “the historical
                    development of epidemic and contagious diseases all over the world, with the
                    laws of their diffusion,” which showed the influence of Schönleim His first
                    treatise was <hi rend="italic">Die Naturgeschichte des Mcnschen</hi> (in 2
                    vols., Kempten, 1831). Frequent journeys to the Mediterranean, the Adriatic, and
                    the North Sea gave him abundant materials for research on invertebrate anatomy
                    and physiology, which he communicated first to the Munich academy of sciences,
                    and republished in his <hi rend="italic">Beiträge zur vergleichenden Physiologie
                    des Blutes</hi> (Leipsic, 1832-33, with additions in 1838). In 1834-35 he
                    brought out a text-book on the subject of his chair <hi rend="italic">{Lehrbuch
                    der vergleichenden Anatomie,</hi> Leipsic), which recommended itself to students
                    by its clear and concise style. A new edition of it appeared in 1843 under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch der Zootomie,</hi> of which only the
                    vertebrate section was corrected by himself. The precision of his earlier work
                    is evidenced by his <hi rend="italic">Micrometric Measurements of the Elementary
                    Parts of Man and Animals</hi> (Leipsic, 1834). His zoological labours may be
                    said to conclude with the atlas <hi rend="italic">Icones Zootomicae</hi>
                    (Leipsic, 1841). In 1835 he communicated to the Munich academy of sciences his
                    researches on the physiology of generation and development, including the famous
                    discovery of the germinal vesicle of the human ovum. These were republished
                    under the title <hi rend="italic">Prodromus Historiae Generationis Hominis atque
                    Animalium</hi> (Leipsic, 1836). As in zoology, his original researches in
                    physiology were followed by a students’ text-book, <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch
                    der speciellen Physiologie</hi> (Leipsic, 1838), which soon reached a third
                    edition, and was translated into French and English. This was supplemented by an
                    atlas, <hi rend="italic">Icones Physiologicae</hi> (Leipsic, 1839). To the same
                    period belongs a very interesting but now little known work on medicine proper,
                    of a historical and synthetic scope, <hi rend="italic">Grundriss der
                    Encyklopädie und Methodologie der medicinischen Wissenschaften nach
                    geschichtlicher Ansicht</hi> (Erlangen, 1838), which was translated into Danish.
                    About the same time he worked along with Will at a translation of Prichard’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Natural History of Man,</hi> and edited various writings of
                    Sömmering, with a biography of that anatomist (1844), which he himself fancied
                    most of all his writings. In 1843, after his removal to Gottingen, he began his
                    great <hi rend="italic">Handwörterbuch der Physiologie, mit Rücksicht auf
                    physiologische Pathologie,</hi> and brought out the fifth (supplementary) volume
                    in 1852; the only contributions of his own in it were on the sympathetic nerve,
                    nerve-ganglia, and nerve-endings, and he modestly disclaims all merit except as
                    being the organizer. While resident in Italy for his health from 1845 to 1847,
                    he occupied himself with researches on the electrical organ of the torpedo and
                    on nervous organization generally; these he published in 1853-54 <hi
                    rend="italic">{Neurologische Untersuchungen,</hi> Gottingen), and therewith his
                    physiological period may be said to end. His next period was stormy and
                    controversial. He entered the lists boldly against the materialism of "Stoff und
                    Kraft,” and avowed himself a Christian believer, whereupon he lost the
                    countenance of a number of his old friends and pupils, and was unfeelingly told
                    that he was suffering from an “atrophy of the brain.” His quarrel with the
                    materialists began with his oration at the Gottingen meeting of the
                    Naturforscher-Versammlung in 1854 on “Menschenschöpfung und Seelensubstanz.”
                    This was followed by a series of “Physiological Letters” in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung,</hi> by an essay on “Glauben und Wissen,” and
                    by the most important piece of this series, “Der Kampf um die Seele” (Gottingen,
                    1857). Having come to the consideration of these philosophical problems late in
                    life, he was at some disadvantage; but he endeavoured to join as he best could
                    in the current of contemporary German thought. He had an exact knowledge of
                    classical German writings, more especially of Goethe’s, and of the literature
                    connected with him. In what may be called his fourth and last period, Wagner
                    became anthropologist and archaeologist, occupied himself with the cabinet of
                    skulls in the Gottingen museum collected by Blumenbach and with the excavation
                    of prehistoric remains, corresponded actively with the anthropological societies
                    of Paris and London, and organized, in co-operation with the veteran Von Baer, a
                    successful congress of anthropologists at Gottingen in 1861. His last writings
                    were memoirs on the convolutions of the human brain, on the weight of brains,
                    and on the brains of idiots (1860-62).</p>
