                    Yorkshire, Great Northern, and North-Eastern Railway lines, 9 miles south of
                    Leeds and 175½ miles from London. It has water communication <hi rend="italic"
                    >(via</hi> Goole) with Hull by the Calder, which also communicates with the
                    Lancashire canals. The streets are spacious; and, if the town has a somewhat
                    old-fashioned appearance, and is less regularly built than several of the other
                    large towns in Yorkshire, it enjoys the advantage of an atmosphere less polluted
                    by smoke. The Calder is crossed by a fine bridge of eight arches, on which
                    stands the chantry of St Mary, a beautiful Gothic structure, 30 feet long by 24
                    feet wide, endowed by Edward IV. in memory of his father Richard, duke of York,
                    killed at the battle of Wakefield in 1460; it was restored in 1847 at a cost of
                    £3000. The parish church of All Saints, consecrated by Archbishop William de
                    Melton in 1329, but almost wholly rebuilt in the 15th century, is a beautiful
                    building, partly Early English and partly Perpendicular, consisting of chancel,
                    nave, and tower surmounted by a fine spire rebuilt in 1860-61, the total height
                    being 247 feet. The whole building was restored in 1857-86 from designs of the
                    late Sir Gilbert Scott, at a cost of about £30,000. The other churches are
                    without special interest. The Elizabethan grammar school founded in 1592 was
                    rebuilt in 1829; it is now regulated by a scheme formed by the charity
                    commissioners. Among the principal public buildings of Wakefield are the corn
                    exchange, erected in 1837, enlarged in 1862, and including a public
                    concert-room; the town-hall, in the French Renaissance style, opened in 1880 at
                    a cost of £80,000; the large prison for the West Riding of Yorkshire; the West
                    Riding sessions house; the borough police station (1879); the office of probate
                    (1863); the mechanics’ institution, with large library; the church institute and
                    library; the fine art institution; and the public baths. The benevolent
                    institutions include the Clayton hospital, built on the pavilion system, opened
                    in 1879 at a cost of £25,000, and the West Riding pauper lunatic asylum, with
                    accommodation for upwards of 1400 patients. Formerly Wakefield was the great
                    emporium of the cloth manufacture in Yorkshire, but it has within the present
                    century been superseded in this respect by Leeds. Foreign weavers of cloth were
                    established at Wakefield by Henry VII.; and Leland, writing in the time of Henry
                    VIII., states that its “whole profit standeth by coarse drapery.” During the
                    18th century it became noted for the manufacture of worsted yarn and woollen
                    stuffs. Although its manufacturing importance is now small in comparison with
                    that of several other Yorkshire towns, it possesses large mills for spinning
                    worsted and carpet yarns, cocoa fibre, and China grass. It has also rag-crushing
                    mills, chemical works, soap-works, and ironworks; and there are a large number
                    of collieries in the neighbourhood. Wakefield is the chief agricultural town in
                    the West Riding, and has one of the largest corn-markets in the north of
                    England. It possesses large agricultural implement and machine works, corn and
                    flour mills, maltworks, and breweries. A large trade in corn is carried on by
                    means of the Calder, and the building of boats for inland navigation is also a
                    considerable industry. There are very extensive market-gardens in the
                    neighbourhood. Wakefield is the seat of the court of probate for the Wakefield
                    district. It is governed by a mayor, eight aldermen, and twenty-four
                    councillors. The erection of a new diocese of Wakefield was sanctioned in 1878,
                    and the first bishop was appointed in February 1888. The population of the
                    municipal and parliamentary borough (area 1553 acres) in 1871 was 28,069, and in
                    1881 it was 30,854. By the Act of 1885 the parliamentary borough was enlarged by
                    the addition of the suburb of Bellevue.</p>
                <p>Wakefield is supposed by some to occupy the site of a Roman station. In Domesday
                    the name occurs as Wackefield. Originally it consisted of three
                    hamlets—Northgate, Kirkgate, and Westgate. The manor of Wakefield soon after the
                    Conquest was granted to William, third earl of Warren. It formed an extensive
                    baronial liberty extending westwards to the borders of Lancashire and Cheshire.
                    On the death without male issue (30th June 1347) of John, eighth earl of Warren,
                    it reverted to the crown, aud by Edward III. it was given to his fifth son,
                    Edward de Langley, whom he created earl of Cambridge, and who in the reign of
                    Richard II. was created duke of York. After the battle of Wakefield in 1460 it
                    remained in the possession of the crown till the reign of Charles I., who
                    granted it to Henry, earl of Holland. It became the marriage portion of the
                    earl’s daughter when she married Sir Gervaise Clifton of Clifton in the county
                    of Nottingham. About 1663 Sir Gervaise Clifton sold it to Sir Christopher
                    Clapham, whose heirs in the year 1760 sold it to the duke of Leeds, and it still
                    remains in the possession of that family. Near Wakefield Queen Margaret
                    inflicted a memorable defeat on Richard, duke of York (31st December 1460). The
                    town has possessed a corn-market since the time of the Saxons. It obtained a
                    charter for a cattle-market 1st March 1765. It was incorporated by Charles I. in
                    1626, and was governed by a constable, until it obtained a new charter under the
                    Municipal Act, 11th March 1848. Since 1832 it has returned a member of
                    parliament. Under an Improvement Act obtained in 1877, the corporation were
                    empowered to purchase the waterworks belonging to a company which had been
                    formed in 1835. In 1880 an Act was granted for obtaining a supply from Rishworth
                    Moors, near Halifax, and the works were completed in 1888 at a cost of about
                    £500,000.</p>
