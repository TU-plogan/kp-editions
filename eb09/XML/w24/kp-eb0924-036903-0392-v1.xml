                <p><label type="entry">WARD, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label> (1769-1859),
                    animal painter and engraver, was born in Thames Street. London, on October 23,
                    1769. At the age of twelve he was bound apprentice with J. Raphael Smith, but he
                    received little attention and learnt nothing from this engraver. He was
                    afterwards instructed for over seven years by his elder brother, William Ward,
                    and he engraved many admirable plates, among which his Mrs Billington, after
                    Reynolds, occupies a very high place. He presented a complete set of his
                    engravings, in their various states, numbering three hundred impressions, to the
                    British Museum. While still a youth he made the acquaintance of George Morland,
                    who afterwards married his sister; and the example of this artist’s works
                    induced him to attempt painting. His early productions were rustic subjects in
                    the manner of Morland, which were frequently sold as the work of the more
                    celebrated painter. His Bull-Bait, an animated composition, introducing many
                    figures, attracted much attention in the Royal Academy of 1797. A commission
                    from Sir John Sinclair, president of the new agricultural society, to paint an
                    Alderney cow led to much similar work, and turned Ward’s attention to
                    animal-painting, a department in which he achieved his highest artistic
                    successes, his renderings of cattle being unrivalled in the English school, and
                    worthy to rank with the pictures of the great animalpainters of Holland. His
                    Landscape with Cattle, acquired for the National Gallery at a cost of £1500, was
                    painted in 1820-22 at the suggestion of West, in emulation of the Bull of Paul
                    Potter at The Hague. His Boa Serpent Seizing a Horse was executed in 1822, and
                    his admirable Grey Horse, shown in the Old Masters’ Exhibition of 1879, dates
                    from 1828. Ward also produced portraits, and many landscapes like the Gordale
                    Scar and the Harlech Castle in the National Gallery. Sometimes he turned aside
                    into the less fruitful paths of allegory, as in his unsuccessful Pool of
                    Bethesda (1818), and Triumph of the Duke of Wellington (1818). He was a frequent
                    contributor to the Royal Academy and the British Institution, and in 1841 he
                    collected one hundred and forty examples of his art, and exhibited them in his
                    house in Newman Street. He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in
                    1807, and a full member in 1811, and died at Cheshunt on the 23rd of November,
                    1859.</p>
