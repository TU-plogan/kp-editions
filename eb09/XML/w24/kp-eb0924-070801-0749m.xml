                    Out of thirteen contemporary entries in <hi rend="italic">documents,</hi> twelve
                    give “y” in the first syllable; the seven entries in the Queen’s College
                    accounts show four with “y” to three with “i,” but these do not certainly refer
                    to the reformer. In not one of these is there a “ck” (though once a “kc”) (see
                    Mr F. D. Matthew, in the <hi rend="italic">Academy,</hi> June 7, 1884). The
                    chroniclers, &amp;c., offer every imaginable variety of spelling, and it is
                    possible that our favourite form in more recent times, “Wickliffe,” derived its
                    popularity from the old play on the name, “nequam vita,” which we find in
                    Gascoigne. Our choice must be decided by usage, and the spelling adopted in the
                    present article is that of the village from which Wycliffe derived his name; it
                    is also preferred by the editors of the Wycliffe Bible, by Milman, and bý Bishop

                    Leland elsewhere mentions that he “drew his origin” from Wycliffe-on-Tees <hi
                    rend="italic">(Collectanea,</hi> ii. 329), so that his lineage was of the
                    ancient family which is celebrated by Scott in <hi rend="italic">Marmion.</hi>
                    The Wycliffes had a natural connexion with the college at Oxford which had been
                    founded in the latter part of the previous century by their neighbours, the
                    Balliols of Barnard Castle; and to Balliol College, then distinctively an “arts”

                    generally believed, and was in fact believed not many years after his death,
                    that he was a fellow of Merton College in 1356; but in all probability this
                    identification rests upon a confusion with another and contemporary John
                    Wycliffe. That the future reformer was a fellow of Balliol College is implied in
                    the fact that some time after 1356, but before the summer of 1360, he was
                    elected master of the college. This office he held but a short time. So soon as
                    1361 he accepted a college living, that of Fillingham in Lincolnshire, and
                    probably left Oxford for some time. In 1363, however, he was back again, this
                    time resident in Queen’s College, where he seems to have rented rooms at various
                    dates from this year onwards;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    College. It is indeed open to question whether this be not yet another John
                    Wycliffe; see Mr H. T. Riley’s remarks in the <hi rend="italic">Second

                    his bishop leave of absence “insistendo literarum studio in universitate Oxon.
                    per biennium,” and in the following November he exchanged his benefice for one
                    more conveniently situate, at Ludgarshall, in Buckinghamshire. A certain amount
                    of residence at Oxford was necessary if he was now proceeding to a degree in
                    divinity, and still more if, as is generally understood, he is the same person
                    with the John Wycliffe who was appointed, December 1365, to the wardenship of
                    Canterbury Hall, a house which Archbishop Islip had lately founded for a mixed
                    body of monks and secular clergymen, and then, changing his mind, had filled
                    exclusively with the latter. His successor Archbishop Langham in 1367 reversed
                    the arrangement, expelled Wycliffe and his colleagues, and substituted monks.
                    Wycliffe appealed to Rome and lost his case, 1370. There seems no reason to
                    dispute the legality of the action either of Archbishop Langham or of the
                    cardinal who tried the appeal at Viterbo; but Wycliffe no doubt felt himself
                    hardly used, and (if he be rightly identified with the reformer) the experience
                    may have confirmed him in some of the opinions which are characteristic of his
                    subsequent career, and which have been attributed, but only on the authority of
                    a bitter opponent, Thomas Netter of Walden, to disappointment at not receiving
                    the bishopric of Worcester (perhaps at its voidance in 1368). But the doubt as
                    to the identification in the one case, and the suspicion attaching to the
                    evidence in the other, may disincline us to reason about the motives which
                    directed Wycliffe on to the path of reform.</p>

                <p>Some years indeed before this time he had thrown himself publicly into the
                    defence of what had become the national resistance to the papacy at Avignon,
                    closely associated as the latter was with the interests of France. He had
                    entered the service of the royal court, and apparently as king’s chaplain
                    (“peculiaris regis clericus ”) had published a tract, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Determinatio</hi><hi rend="italic">quaedam de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dominio,</hi> in support of the action of parliament in 1366, when it
                    repudiated the tribute due to the pope. The tract is of interest, not only
                    because it contains the first trace of the writer’s special doctrine of
                    “dominium” or <hi rend="italic">lordship</hi> (adjusting the spiritual relation
                    to a feudal framework), but also because it shows the line of thought by which
                    Wycliffe’s position became determined in a sense hostile to the papal system. It
                    was not at the outset dogmatic but political elements in it which provoked his
                    censure. He disputed the right of the spiritual power to interfere in temporal
                    matters, and was gradually led on to deny the lawfulness of any temporal
                    possessions of the church, and thus to become the common enemy of the beneficed
                    clergy and of the endowed monks; with the friars he was at present on friendly
                    terms. Wycliffe thus drew from Richard Fitz-Ralph, archbishop of Armagh, whose
                    instruction he may have personally followed in his youth,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Archbishop FitzRalph had been a fellow of
                    Balliol College, and was vice-chancellor of the university in or about 1333 (A.
                    à Wood, <hi rend="italic">Fasti Oxοn.,</hi> p. 21, ed. Gutch, 1790). His work,
                    on which Wycliffe mainly based his theory, is entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Pauperie Salvatoris,</hi> and exists only in
                    manuscript; but Mr R. L. Poole is preparing *the greater part of it for
                    publication. An old legend makes Wycliffe take part in the archbishop’s
                    controversy with the friars so early as 1360. It was suspected by Robert
                    Vaughan, and then denied by Shirley. The further researches of Dr Lechler have
                    placed the late date at which Wycliffe began his opposition to the friars on a
                    sure foundation; and the fact has been confirmed decisively by the publication
                    of the St Albans <hi rend="italic">Chronieon Angliae,</hi> by Mr E. Μ. Thompson,
                    in 1874 (see pp. 116, 118), and more recently by that of the reformer’s earlier
                    Latin works.</p></note> his doctrine of “dominium,” which the latter had
                    employed against the friars and in favour of the endowed clergy; while at the
                    same time he combined it with the doctrine of the excellence of “evangelical·
                    poverty” which he derived from William of Ockham and the tradition of the
                    Spiritual Franciscans nearly half a century earlier. Wycliffe’s position may
                    appear paradoxical; but in truth he made a selection from the discordant views,
                    and built up a consistent theory of his own, of which the salient principles
                    were (1) that sin deprived a man of all right to possess anything; (2) that all
                    property should be held in common; (3) that the spiritual power is entirely
                    separate from the civil, and thus (4) that, should it overstep its bounds and
                    come into contact with temporal concerns, it becomes thereby subject to civil
                    jurisdiction; (5) that the church should hold no property; (6) that
                    excommunication is of no effect unless justified by the sin of him against whom
                    it is directed; and (7) that in no case should it be pronounced for any offence
                    connected with temporal affairs. These views are expounded in Wycliffe’s several
                    treatises <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Dominio,</hi> which were
                    written some time before 1377 and probably not long after 1370, though their
                    precise date has not yet been established.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is uniformly asserted that Wycliffe fell into heresy

                <p>Plainly such a writer was likely to be useful to the court, where John of Gaunt
                    was now supreme,—especially since Wycliffe enjoyed the reputation of an
                    unmatched proficiency in the scholastic learning of his day. On’ the 7th April
                    1374 he was presented by the crown to the rectory of Lutterworth, in
                    Leicestershire, which he held until his death; and on the following July 26th he
                    was nominated one of the royal ambassadors to proceed to Bruges to confer with
                    the papal representatives on the long-vexed question of “provisions.” The rank
                    he took is shown by the facts that his name stands second, next after that of
                    the bishop of Bangor, on the commission, and that he received pay at the
                    princely rate of twenty shillings per diem. The commission itself was appointed
                    in consequence of urgent and repeated complaints on the part of the Commons, but
                    the negotiations were practically fruitless; the king had an interest in keeping
                    up the system of papal provisions and reservations, and it could hardly be
                    expected that any concessions that might be gained by his commissioners would
                    imply more than a temporary compromise or an illusory advantage. Yet it is
                    possible that the real result of the negotiations is to be found, not in the
                    formal stipulations, but in certain articles not then committed to writing which
                    were laid before the English parliament in February 1377.</p>
                <p>Some time after his return Wycliffe was given the prebend of Aust in the
                    collegiate church of Westbury-on-Trim, which he held but a short time, the
                    confirmation of his appointment (November 6, 1375) being followed within a
                    fortnight by the grant of the benefice to another person. Henceforth he lived
                    mainly at Lutterworth and Oxford, making, however, frequent and, as it seems,
                    prolonged visits to London from time to time. He assumed the position of a
                    popular preacher there, and delighted an audience already sufficiently
                    disaffected towards the rich and powerful clergy. He was also closely allied
                    with John of Gaunt, who welcomed him as an instrument towards his design of
                    humbling the church. Wycliffe indeed expressly refused to affirm that it was in
                    such a condition as to deserve spoliation; but when to this he added that the
                    decision was the affair of statesmen, “politicorum qui intendunt praxi et statui
                    regnorum” <hi rend="italic">{De Civili Dominio,</hi> i. 37, p. 269), it is plain
                    that his theory might readily commend itself to the duke, while the proviso
                    could only increase the hostility towards him of the endowed clergy. For some
                    years he was suffered to spread his doctrines without hindrance. The archbishop
                    of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, had no mind to proceed against him until at length
                    the pressure of the bishops compelled him to summon the dangerous preacher to
                    appear before the bishop of London and answer certain charges laid against him.
                    The nature of these accusations is not stated, but their purport can hardly be
                    doubtful. On the 19th February 1377 Wycliffe made his appearance at St Paul’s.
                    He was accompanied by the duke of Lancaster, by Lord Percy the marshal of
                    England, and by four doctors of the four mendicant orders. The trial, however,
                    came to nothing; for, before Wycliffe could open his mouth, the court was broken
                    up by a rude brawl between his protectors and Bishop Courtenay, ending in a
                    general riot of the citizens of London, who were so much enraged by the insult
                    to their bishop in his own cathedral church—coming as this did at the same time
                    as a serious attempt at an invasion by the duke in parliament of their civic
                    liberties <hi rend="italic">{Chron. Angl.,</hi> p. 120)—that they would have
                    sacked his palace of the Savoy had not Courtenay himself intervened.</p>
                <p>Wycliffe had escaped for the time, but his enemies did not rely solely on their
                    own weapons. Probably before this they had set their case before the pope; and
                    towards the end of May five bulls were issued by Gregory XI., who had just
                    returned to Rome from Avignon, condemning eighteen (or in other copies nineteen)
                    “conclusions” drawn from Wycliffe’s writings. All the articles but one are taken
                    from his first book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Civili
                    Dominio,</hi> the recent publication of which shows the charges to be honestly
                    made and the quotations to be entirely free from any <pb break="no"

                    Wycliffe’s intellectual lineage; he was following in the error of Marsiglio of
                    Padua; and the articles laid against him are concerned entirely with questions
                    agitated between church and state—how far ecclesiastical censures could lawfully
                    affect a man’s civil position, and whether the church had a right to receive and
                    hold temporal endowments. The bulls were addressed (May 22) to the archbishop of
                    Canterbury and the bishcp of London, the university of Oxford, and the king. The
                    university was to take Wycliffe and send him to the prelates; the latter were
                    then to examine the truth of the charges and to report to the pope, Wycliffe
                    being meanwhile kept in confinement. The execution of the papal bulls was
                    impeded by three separate causes,—the king’s death on the 21st June; the tardy
                    action of the bishops, who enjoined the university to make a report, instead of
                    simply sending Wycliffe to them; and the unwillingness of the university to
                    admit external authority, and, above all, the pope’s right to order the
                    imprisonment of any man in England. The convocation, indeed, as the St Albans

                    the bull at all; and in the end it merely directed Wycliffe to keep within his
                    lodgings at Black Hall for a time.</p>
                <p>If the university was disposed to favour the reformer, the Government was not
                    less so. John of Gaunt was for the moment in retirement; but the mother of the
                    young king appears to have adopted his policy in church affairs, and she
                    naturally occupied a chief position in the new council. As soon as parliament
                    met in the autumn of 1377 Wycliffe was consulted by it as to the lawfulness of
                    prohibiting that treasure should pass out of the country in obedience to the
                    pope’s demand. Wycliffe’s affirmative judgment is contained in a state paper
                    still extant; and its tone is plain proof enough of his confidence that his
                    views on the main question of church and state had the support of the
                    nation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In one text of

                    apparently a measure of precaution.</p></note> Indeed he had laid before this
                    same parliament his answer to the pope’s bulls, with a defence of the soundness
                    of his opinions. His university, moreover, confirmed his argument; his tenets,
                    it said, were true <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> orthodox), though their
                    expression was such as to admit of an incorrect interpretation. But Wycliffe was
                    still bound to clear himself before the prelates who had summoned him, and early
                    in 1378 he appeared for this purpose in the chapel of Lambeth Palace. His
                    written defence, expressed in some respects in more cautious language than he
                    had previously used, was laid before the council; but its session was rudely
                    interrupted, not only by an inroad of the London citizens with a crowd of the
                    rabble, but also by a messenger from the princess of Wales enjoining them not to
                    pass judgment against Wycliffe; and thus a second time he escaped, either
                    without sentence, or at most with a gentle <hi rend="italic">request</hi> that
                    he would avoid discussing the matters in question. Meanwhile his “protestatio”
                    was sent on to Rome.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of this year Wycliffe was once more called upon to prove his
                    loyalty to John of Gaunt. The duke had violated the sanctuary of Westminster by
                    sending a band of armed men to seize two knights who had taken refuge there.
                    They resisted, and one of them was killed. After a while the bishop of London
                    excommunicated all concerned in the crime (excepting only the king, his mother,
                    and his uncle), and preached against the culprits publicly at St Paul’s Cross.
                    The duke, fearing the anger of the Londoners, arranged that the ensuing
                    parliament should be held at a safe distance, at Gloucester, and, it was
                    rumoured, proposed to bring before it a sweeping scheme of spoliation of church
                    property. Wycliffe was required to write an apology for the duke’s actions at
                    Westminster. His paper, which is still preserved, and forms part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesia,</hi> seeks, without excusing
                    the homicide, to lay down the limits within which the privilege of asylum is
                    permissible, and maintains that the duke was right in invading the sanctuary in
                    order to bring escaped prisoners to justice. But the duke’s whole behaviour
                    seems to have been high-handed, and Wycliffe can with difficulty be excused from
                    a charge of subserviency to his patron.</p>
                <p>The year 1378 forms a turning point in Wycliffe’s career. The schism in the
                    papacy caused by the election in September of Clement VII. in opposition to
                    Urban VI. slowly decided Wycliffe towards a more revolutionary attitude with
                    respect to the Roman see, a power which he now convinced himself was at the root
                    of the disorders of the church. He set on foot an active propaganda, choosing
                    the two special means of sending forth his “poor” or “simple priests” to preach
                    pure doctrine throughout the country, and of making the first complete English
                    version of the Bible. This latter work w as mainly executed by Wycliffe himself,
                    but his friend Nicholas Hereford did part of the Old Testament. Afterwards the
                    whole was revised by John Purvey, who assisted Wycliffe in his parish duty at
                    Lutterworth, and finished his edition probably not long after the reformer’s
                    death. Most existing copies are of the latter redaction, which is printed in
                    parallel columns with the older one in the great edition of the version edited
                    by J. Forshall and Sir F. Madden (Oxford, 1851). Wycliffe’s translation of the
                    Bible, and still more his numerous English sermons and tracts, establish his now
                    undisputed position as the founder of English prose writing.</p>
                <p>Wycliffe’s itinerant preachers were not necessarily intended to work as rivals to
                    the beneficed clergy. The idea that underlay their mission was rather analogous
                    to that which animated Wesley four centuries later. Wycliffe aimed at
                    supplementing the services of the church by regular religious instruction in the
                    vernacular; and his organization included a good number of men who held or had
                    held respectable positions in their colleges at Oxford. The influence of their
                    teaching was soon felt throughout the country. The common people were rejoiced
                    by the plain and homely doctrine which dwelt chiefly on the simple “law” of the
                    gospel, while they no doubt relished the denunciation of existing evils in the
                    church which formed, as it were, the burthen of such discourses. The feeling of
                    disaffection against the rich and careless clergy, monks, and friars was
                    widespread but undefined. Wycliffe turned it into a definite channel (he was now
                    persuaded that the friars were as bad as the monks); he insensibly passed from
                    an assailant of the papal to an assailant of the sacerdotal power; and in this
                    way he was led to reject the distinctive symbol of that power, the doctrine of
                    transubstantiation. It was in the summer of 1381<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is the date given in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fasciculi</hi><hi rend="italic">Zizaniorum.</hi> Wood, however,
                    makes Berton chancellor in 1380 and 1382. But if Wycliffe’s heresy was first put
                    forth in the latter year there seems to be hardly time for the condemnation and
                    then for the archbishop’s summons to the London council in May. It is safest
                    therefore to leave the date of the <hi rend="italic">Fasciculi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Zizaniorum</hi> undisturbed. The Peasants’ Revolt in June 1381,
                    and the murder of Archbishop Sudbury, may sufficiently account for the interval
                    between the Oxford and the London proceedings.</p><p/></note> that Wycliffe
                    propounded at Oxford a set of theses, substituting for the accredited doctrine
                    of the church one which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n752/mode/1up"

                    consecrated elements, but denied any change of substance, a doctrine practically
                    undistinguishable (unless by its scholastic form) from the modern Lutheran
                    doctrine. The theologians of the university were at once roused. The chancellor,
                    William Berton, sat with twelve doctors (half of whom were friars), and solemnly
                    condemned the theses; Wycliffe appealed to the king, and John of Gaunt hastily
                    sent down a messenger enjoining the reformer to keep silence on the subject.</p>
                <p>The condemnation at Oxford was almost immediately followed by the Peasants’
                    Revolt, with which it has been supposed that Wycliffe had something to do. The
                    only positive fact implicating him is the confession of one of its leaders, John
                    Ball, that he learned his subversive doctrines from Wycliffe. But the confession
                    of a condemned man can seldom be accepted without reserve; and we have not only
                    the precise and repeated testimony of Knyghton that he was a “precursor” of
                    Wycliffe, but also documentary evidence that he was excommunicated as early as
                    1366, long before Wycliffe exposed himself to ecclesiastical censure. Wycliffe
                    in truth was always careful to state his communistic views in a theoretical way;
                    they are confined to his Latin scholastic writings, and thus could not reach the
                    people from him directly. At the same time it is very possible that his less
                    scrupulous followers translated them in their popular discourses, and thus fed
                    the flame that burst forth in the rebellion. Perhaps it was a consciousness of a
                    share of responsibility for it that led them to cast the blame on the friars. In
                    any case Wycliffe’s advocates must regret that in all his known works there is
                    only one trace of any reprobation of the excesses that accompanied the
                    outbreak.</p>
                <p>In the following spring his old enemy William Courtenay, now archbishop of
                    Canterbury, resolved to take measures for stamping out Wycliffe’s crowning
                    heresy. He called a provincial council at the Blackfriars in London, which
                    assembled on the 21st May 1382, and sat with intervals until July. The council
                    was met by a hardly expected manifestation of university feeling on Wycliffe’s
                    side. The chancellor and both the proctors stood by him. They allowed a
                    Wycliffite sermon to be preached before the university on Ascension Day. The
                    archbishop’s commissary complained that his life was not safe at Oxford. Still
                    no steps were taken to bring Wycliffe to judgment. Twenty-four articles
                    extracted from his works were condemned; some of his prominent adherents were
                    imprisoned until they recanted; tlιe university officers were soon brought to
                    submission, but Wycliffe himself remained at large and unmolested. It is said
                    indeed by Knyghton that at a council held by Courtenay at Oxford in the
                    following November Wycliffe was brought forward and made a recantation; but our
                    authority fortunately gives the text of the recantation, which proves to be
                    nothing more nor less than a plain English statement of the condemned doctrine.
                    It is therefore lawful to doubt whether Wycliffe appeared before the council at
                    all, and even whether he was ever summoned before it. Probably after the
                    overthrow of his party at Oxford by the action of the Blackfriars council
                    Wycliffe found it advisable to withdraw permanently to Lutterworth. That his
                    strength among the laity was undiminished is shown by the fact that an ordinance
                    passed by the House of Lords alone, in May 1382, against the itinerant preachers
                    was annulled on the petition of the Commons in the following autumn. In London,
                    Leicester, and elsewhere there is abundant evidence of his popularity. The
                    reformer, however, was growing old. There was work, he probably felt, for him to
                    do, more lasting than personal controversy. So in his retirement he occupied
                    himself, with restless activity, in writing numerous tracts, Latin and English,
                    as well as one of his most important books, the <hi rend="italic">Trüdogus.</hi>
                    In spite of a paralytic seizure which came upon him in 1382 or early in 1383, he
                    continued his labours. In 1384 it is stated that he was cited by pope Urban VI.
                    to appear before him at Rome; but to Rome he never went. On the 28th December of
                    this year, while he was hearing mass in his own church, he received a final
                    stroke, from the effects of which he died on the New Year’s eve.<note

                    appearance we know hardly more than that he was a spare man with frail health.

                    at Lutterworth; but by a decree of the council of Constance, May 4, 1415, his
                    remains were ordered to be dug up and burned, an order which was carried out by
                    Bishop Fleming in 1428.</p>
                <p>At this distance of time Wycliffe’s reputation is still a battleground of
                    parties. By those who uphold the indefeasible sanctity of church property, the
                    exemption of the church from all control or oversight on the part of the state,
                    or yet more the apostolic prerogative of the Roman see, his political doctrine
                    is judged as revolutionary, sacrilegious, and heretical. His denial of
                    transubstantiation is conceived to imply a base hypocrisy in his continued
                    discharge of priestly functions; but they who maintain this argument should bear
                    in mind that the office of the mass is older than the doctrine of
                    transubstantiation, and a man cannot be fairly accused of dishonesty in using
                    words in a sense at all events nearer that in which they were originally
                    written. A sober study of Wycliffe’s life and works justifies a conviction of
                    his complete sincerity and earnest striving after what he believed to be right.
                    If he cannot be credited (as he has been by most of his biographers) with all
                    the Protestant virtues, he may at least claim to have discovered the secret of
                    the immediate dependence of the individual Christian upon God, a relation which
                    needs no mediation of any priest, and to which the very sacraments of the
                    church, however desirable, are not essentially necessary. When he divorces the
                    idea of the church from any connexion with its official or formal constitution,
                    and conceives it as consisting exclusively of the righteous, he may seem to have
                    gone the whole length of the most radical reformers of the 16th century. And
                    yet, powerful as was his influence in England, it was but transient, and within
                    forty years it was nearly extinct. His true tradition is to be found not in his
                    own country but in Bohemia, where his works were eagerly read and multiplied,
                    and where his disciple John Huss, with less originality but greater simplicity
                    of character and greater spiritual force, raised Wycliffism to the dignity of
                    national religion. To Huss, whose works are to a great extent a cento of
                    extracts from Wycliffe, Luther owed much; and thus the spirit of the English
                    teacher had its influence on the reformed churches of Europe.</p>
