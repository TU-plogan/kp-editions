                    tended to diminish.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Procedure.—</hi> Determination of cases, civil and criminal, by
                    means of wager or analogous forms of procedure is a characteristic feature of
                    archaic law. The <hi rend="italic">legis actio sacramenti</hi> at Rome—at first
                    a real, then a fictitious wager—the wager of battle and of law in England, of
                    the highest antiquity in their origin, survived up to a comparatively late
                    period in the history of both legal systems. The form of the wager survived long
                    after its reason had been forgotten. The general prevalence of the wager form of
                    proceeding is perhaps to be attributed to the early conception of a judge as a
                    mere referee who decided the dispute submitted to him, not as an executive
                    officer of the state, but as an arbitrator casually called in (see Maine, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ancient Law,</hi> c. x.). Wager of battle in England was a mode of
                    trial which was allowed in certain cases, viz., on a writ of right (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Writ),</hi> and on appeals of treason and felony (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Appeal).</hi> A full account of the judicial combat will be
                    found under <hi rend="smallcaps">Duel</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Ordeal.</hi>
                    Wager of law <hi rend="italic">(vadiatio legis)</hi> was a right of a defendant
                    in actions of simple contract debt and of detinue. It superseded the ordeal
                    (itself called <hi rend="italic">lex</hi> in the Assize of Clarendon and other
                    ancient constitutional records). The mode of proceeding in a wager of law was an
                    interesting relic of that system of compurgation—traced by Blackstone to the
                    Mosaic law, Ex. xxii. 10—which was employed in many legal systems, especially
                    the Scandinavian, and had probably an appreciable effect on the development of
                    the English <hi rend="smallcaps">Jury (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> It also
                    has some points of resemblance, perhaps some historical connexion, with the <hi
                    rend="italic">sponsio</hi> and the decisory oath of Roman law, and the reference
                    to oath of Scots law (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Oath).</hi> The use of the oath
                    instead of the real or feigned combat—real in English law, feigned in Roman
                    law—no doubt represents an advance in legal development. The technical term <hi
                    rend="italic">sacramentum</hi> is the bond of union between the two stages of
                    law. In the wager of law the defendant, with eleven compurgators, appeared in
                    court, and he swore that he did not owe the debt or (in detinue) that he did not
                    detain the plaintiff’s chattel; while the compurgators swore that they believed
                    that he spoke the truth. It was an eminently unsatisfactory way of arriving at
                    the merits of a claim, and it is therefore not surprising to find that the
                    policy of the law was in favour of its restriction rather than of its extension.
                    Thus it was not permitted where the defendant was not a person of good
                    character, where the king sued, where the defendant was the executor or
                    administrator of the person alleged to have owed the debt, or in any actions
                    other than those named, even though the cause of action were the same. No wager
                    of law was allowed in <hi rend="italic">assumpsit,</hi> even though the cause of
                    action were a simple debt. This led to the general adoption of <hi rend="italic"
                    >assumpsit—</hi> proceeding originally upon a fictitious averment of a promise
                    by the defendant—as a means of recovering debts. Where a penalty was created by
                    statute, it became a common form to insert a proviso that no wager of law was to
                    be allowed in an action for the penalty. Wager of law was finally abolished by 3
                    aud 4 Will. IV. c. 42. Another form of the judicial wager in use up to 1845 was
                    the feigned issue by which questions arising in the course of Chancery
                    proceedings were sent for trial by jury in a common law court. The plaintiff
                    averred the laying of a wager of <hi rend="italic">£5</hi> with the defendant
                    that a certain event was as he alleged; the defendant admitted the wager, but
                    disputed the allegation; on this issue was joined. 8 and 9 Vict. c. 109 enabled
                    such questions to be referred by the Chancery to the common law courts in a
                    direct manner.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Substantive Law.—</hi> A wager may be defined as “a promise to
                    pay money or transfer property upon the determination or ascertainment of an
                    uncertain event” (Anson, <hi rend="italic">Law of Contract,</hi> p. 171). At
                    common law wagers were legally enforceable, subject to certain rules dictated by
                    considerations of public policy, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> that they did not
                    lead to immorality or breach of the peace, or expose a third person to ridicule.
                    Actions or wagers were not favoured by the judges; and, though a judge could not
                    refuse to try such an action, he could, and often did, postpone it until after
                    the decision of more important cases. Parliament gradually intervened to confine
                    the common law within narrower limits, both in commercial and non-commercial
                    wagers, and both by general and temporary enactments. An example of the latter
                    was 7 Anne c. 16, avoiding all wagers and securities relating to the then war
                    with France. The earliest general enactment was 16 Car. II. c. 7, prohibiting
                    the recovery of a sum exceeding .£100 lost in games or pastimes, or betting on
                    the sides or hands of the players, and avoiding securities for money so lost. 9
                    Anne c. 19 avoided securities for such wagers for any amount, even in the hands
                    of <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> holders for value without notice, and
                    enabled the loser of £10 or upwards to sue for the money he had lost within
                    three months. The hardship of the Act, as it affects securities in the hands of
                    <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> holders, was remedied by 5 and 6 Will. IV. c.
                    41, which enacted that such securities should be taken to be held for illegal
                    consideration. Finally, 8 and 9 Vict. c. 109, § 18, enacted “that all contracts
                    or agreements, whether by parole or in writing, by way of gaming or wagering
                    shall be null and void; and that no suit shall be brought or maintained in any
                    court of law or equity for recovering any sum of money or valuable thing alleged
                    to be won upon any wager, or which shall have been deposited in the hands of any
                    person to abide the event on which any wager shall have been made; provided
                    always that this enactment shall not be deemed to apply to any subscription, or
                    contribution, or agreement to subscribe or contribute, for or towards any plate,
                    prize, or sum of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n329/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0329-0306"/> money to be awarded to the winner or winners of
                    any lawful game, sport, pastime, or exercise.”</p>
                <p>What is a lawful game depends upon numerous statutes from 33 Hen. VIII. c. 9
                    downwards, among which may be classed the Lottery Acts (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lotteries).</hi> A curious exception is made in some of the statutes in favour
                    of unlawful games if they are played in a royal palace. The mere making of a
                    wager is not now illegal, as it was under the earlier statutes; it is simply
                    unenforceable. The winner has no legal remedy against the loser or the
                    stakeholder. The loser can recover his stake where it still remains in the
                    stakeholder’s hands or has been paid over to the winner after notice from the
                    loser to the stakeholder not to pay it over. He cannot recover where it has been
                    paid over to the winner without notice. The agent in a wagering contract may
                    have legal rights against his principal, though the principal has none against
                    the other party. Agreements between buyers and sellers of stocks and shares to
                    pay or receive differences only (sometimes known as “time-bargains”) are within
                    8 and 9 Vict. c. 109, but a broker employed to speculate on the understanding
                    that only differences should be paid by his principal may recover indemnity
                    against the principal. Employment of an agent to bet in his own name may imply
                    an authority to pay the bet if lost, an authority that may become irrevocable
                    after payment to the winner. Though wagers themselves are now void and not
                    illegal, securities for wagers, by the combined effect of 5 and 6 Will. IV. c.
                    41 and 8 and 9 Vict. c. 109, are still either illegal (as a bet on the result of
                    a game) or void (as a bet on the result of something other than a game, such as
                    a contested election). This difference is important as affecting the question of
                    burden of proof in actions on securities originally given for wagering purposes.
                    Where the consideration is illegal, the plaintiff must show affirmatively that
                    he gave value, but the mere absence of consideration throws on him no such duty.
                    In commercial matters the most important examples are wagering policies of
                    insurance, that is, policies made by persons having no insurable interest, and
                    made void by statute (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Insurance).</hi> Sir John
                    Barnard’s Act, 7 Geo II. c. 8 (called “An Act to prevent the infamous practice
                    of stock-jobbing ”), prohibited contracts for liberty to accept or refuse any
                    public stocks or securities, and wagers relating to the stocks.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the courts refuse to try actions on wagers, as being <hi
                    rend="italic">sponsiones ludicrae,</hi> unbecoming the dignity of the courts. 9
                    Anne c. 19 and 5 and 6 Will. IV. c. 41 extend to Scotland, but the weight of
                    judicial opinion is that 8 and 9 Vict. c. 109 does not. In the United States the
                    loser may, by the legislation of some States, recover his money if he sue within
                    a limited time, as he might have done in England under 9 Anne c. 19.</p>
