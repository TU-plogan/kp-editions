                <p><label type="entry">WILL, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Testament</hi></label>, is an
                    instrument by which a person regulates the rights of others over his property or
                    family after his death. For the devolution of property not disposed of by will,
                    see <hi rend="smallcaps">Inheritance, Intestacy.</hi> In strictness “will” is a
                    general term, whilst “testament” applies only to dispositions of personalty; but
                    this distinction is seldom observed. The conception of freedom of disposition by
                    will, familiar as it is in modern England, is by no means universal. In fact,
                    complete freedom is the exception rather than the rule. Legal systems which are
                    based upon Roman law, such as those of Scotland and France, allow the whole
                    property to be alienated only where the deceased leaves no widow or near
                    relatives. In France this restriction has met with condemnation from eminent
                    legal and economical authorities. Μ. Troplong, for instance, holds that “un
                    peuple n’est pas libre, s’il n’a pas le droit de tester, et la liberté du
                    testament est la plus grande preuve de la liberté civile.”<note anchored="true"

                    The will, if not purely Roman in origin, at least owes to Roman law its complete
                    development,—a development -which in most European countries was greatly aided
                    at a later period by ecclesiastics versed in Roman law. In India, according to
                    the better opinion, it was unknown before the English conquest; in the Mosaic
                    law and in ancient Athens the will, if it existed at all, was of a very
                    rudimentary character. The same is the case with the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Leges</hi><hi rend="italic">Barbarorum,</hi> where they are unaffected by
                    Roman law. The will is, on the other hand, recognized by Rabbinical and
                    Mohammedan law. The early Roman will, as Sir H. Maine shows,<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ancient
                                Law,</hi> chap. vi.</p></note> differed from the modern will in most
                    important respects. It was at first effectual during the lifetime of the person
                    who made it; it was made in public; and it was irrevocable. Its original object,
                    like that of adoption, was to secure the perpetuation of the family. This was
                    done by securing the due vesting of the <hi rend="italic">hereditas</hi> in a
                    person who could be relied upon to keep up the family rites. There is much prob
                    ability in the conjecture that a will was only allowed to be made when the
                    testator had no <hi rend="italic">gentiles</hi> discoverable, or when the <hi
                        rend="italic">gentiles</hi> had waived their rights. It is certain from the
                    text of Gaius<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>ii.
                            101.</p></note> that the earliest forms of will were those made in the
                        <hi rend="italic">comitia calata,</hi> and those made <hi rend="italic"
                        >in</hi><hi rend="italic">procinctu,</hi> or on the eve of battle. The
                    former were published before the <hi rend="italic">comitia,</hi> as
                    representative of the patrician <hi rend="italic">g entes,</hi> and were
                    originally a legislative act. These wills were the peculiar privilege of
                    patricians. At a later time grew up a form of plebeian will <hi rend="italic"
                        >(festamentum per aes</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >libram),</hi> and the law of succession under testament was further
                    modified by the influence of the praetor, especially in the direction of
                    recognition of <hi rend="italic">fideicommissa</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Trust).</hi><hi rend="italic">Codicilli,</hi> or informal wills, also came
                    into use, and were sufficient for almost every purpose but the appointment of an
                    heir. In the time of Justinian a will founded partly on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >jus civile,</hi> partly on the edict of the praetor, partly on imperial
                    constitutions and so called <hi rend="italic">testamentum tripartitum,</hi> was
                    generally in use. The main points essential to its validity were that the
                    testator should possess testamentary capacity, and that the will should be
                    signed or acknowledged by the testator in the presence of seven witnesses, or
                    published orally in open court. The witnesses must be <hi rend="italic"
                        >idonei,</hi> or free from legal disability. For instance, women and slaves
                    were not good witnesses. The whole property of the testator could not be
                    alienated. The rights of heirs and descendants were protected by enactments
                    which secured to them a legal minimum. The age at which testamentary capacity
                    began was fourteen in the case of males, twelve in the case of females. Up to
                    439 A.D. a will must have been in Latin; after that date Greek was allowed.
                    Certain persons, especially soldiers, were privileged from observing the
                    ordinary forms. The liability of the heir to the debts of the testator varied at
                    different periods. At first it was practically unlimited. Then the law was
                    gradually modified in his favour, until in the time of Justinian the heir who
                    duly made an inventory of the property of the deceased was liable only to the
                    amount of the property to which he had succeeded. This limitation of liability
                    is generally termed by the civilians <hi rend="italic">beneficium
                        inventarii.</hi> Closely connected with the will was the <hi rend="italic"

                    in England (see below). An immense space in the <hi rend="italic">Corpus

                    and so do a large number of constitutions in the <hi rend="italic">Code</hi> and

                <p>The effect of Christianity upon the will was very marked. For instance, the duty
                    of bequeathing to the church was inculcated as early as Constantine, and
                    heretics and monks were placed under a disability to make a will or take gifts
                    left by will. A will was often deposited in a church. The canon law follows the
                    Roman law with a still greater leaning to the advantage of the church. No church
                    property could be bequeathed. Manifest usurers were added to the list of those
                    under disability. For the validity of a will it was generally necessary that it
                    should be made in the presence of a priest and two witnesses, unless where it
                    was made <hi rend="italic">in pias</hi><hi rend="italic">causas.</hi> The

                <p>The Roman law of wills has had considerable effect upon English law. In the words
                    of Sir H. Maine, “The <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n606/mode/1up"

                    personalty has become a modified form of the dispensation under which the
                    inheritances of Roman citizens were administered.”<note anchored="true"

                            vi.</p></note> At the same time there are some broad and striking
                    differences which should be borne in mind. The following among others may be
                    noticed. (1) A Roman testator could not, unless a soldier, die partly testate
                    and partly intestate. The will must stand or fall as a whole. This is not the
                    case in England. (2) There is no one in English law to whom the <hi
                        rend="italic">universitas</hi><hi rend="italic">juris</hi> of the testator
                    descends as it did to the Roman <hi rend="italic">heres,</hi> whose appointment
                    was essential to the validity of a formal will, and who partook of the nature of
                    the English heir, executor, administrator, devisee, and legatee. (3) The
                    disabilities of testators differed in the two systems. The disability of a slave
                    or a heretic is peculiar to Roman law, of a youth between fourteen and
                    twenty-one to English law. (4) The whole property may be disposed of in England;
                    but it was not so at Rome, where, except by the wills of soldiers, children
                    could not be disinherited unless for specified acts of misconduct. During the
                    greater part of the period of Roman law the heir must also have had his fourth
                    in order to induce him to accept the inheritance. (5) In English law all wills
                    must conform to certain statutory requirements; the Romans recognized from the
                    time of Augustus an informal will called <hi rend="italic">codicilli.</hi> The
                    English codicil has little in common with this but the name. It is not an
                    informal will, but an addition to a will, read as a part of it, and needing the
                    same formalities of execution. (6) There is a striking difference, unknown to
                    Roman law, between wills of realty and wills of personalty. Probate is necessary
                    for the latter but not for the former. The Roman <hi rend="italic">legatum</hi>
                    applied to both movables and immovables; in England a legacy or bequest is a
                    gift of personalty only, a gift of real estate being called a devise.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The distinction between
                            bequest and devise did not always exist. For instance, the Assize of
                            Northampton, c. 4, speaks of a devise <hi rend="italic">{divisa)</hi> of
                            chattels.</p></note> (7) The Roman will spoke from the time of making;
                    the English speaks from the time of death. This difference becomes very
                    important in case of alteration in the position of the testator between the
                    making of the will and his death. As a rule the Roman will could not, the
                    English can, pass afteracquired property.</p>
                <p>Liberty of alienation by will is found at an early period in England. To judge
                    from the words of a law of Canute, intestacy appears to have been the exception
                    at that time.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                                rend="italic">Secular Laιos,</hi> c. 68.</p></note> How far the
                    liberty extended is uncertain: it is the opinion of some authorities that
                    complete disposition of land and goods was allowed, of others that limited
                    rights of wife and children were recognized. However this may be, after the
                    Conquest a distinction, the result of feudalism, to use a convenient if
                    inaccurate term, arose between real and personal property. It will be convenient
                    to treat the history of the two kinds of will separately.</p>
                <p>It became the law after the Conquest, according to Sir E. Coke,<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Inst.,
                                7.</hi></p></note> that no estate greater than for a term of years
                    could be disposed of by will, unless in Kent, where the custom of <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Gavelkind</hi><hi rend="italic">{g.v.)</hi> prevailed, and
                    in some manors and boroughs (especially the City of London), where the
                    pre-Conquest law was preserved by special indulgence. The reason why devise of
                    land was not acknowledged by law was, no doubt, partly to discourage death-bed
                    gifts in mortmain, partly because the testator could not give the devisee that
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Seisin</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.vf)</hi> which was the
                    principal element in a feudal conveyance. By means of the doctrine of uses,
                    however, the devise of land was secured by a circuitous method, generally by
                    conveyance to feoffees to uses in the lifetime of the feoffer to such uses as he
                    should appoint by his will (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Trust).</hi><note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Many instances of such
                            conveyances occur in Sir Harris Nicolas’s <hi rend="italic">Testamenta

                                Wills</hi> (1387-1439), edited by Mr F. J. Furnivall in
                        1882.</p><p/></note> On the passing of the Statute of Uses lands again
                    became non-devisable, with a saving in the statute for the validity of wills
                    made before the 1st of May 1536. The inconvenience of this state of things soon
                    began to be felt, and was probably aggravated by the large amount of land thrown
                    into the market after the dissolution of the monasteries. As a remedy the Act of
                    32 Hen. VIII. c. 1 was passed in 1540, and was afterwards explained by 34 and 35
                    Hen. VIII. c. 5. The effect of these Acts was to make lands held in fee simple
                    devisable by will in writing, to the extent of two-thirds where the tenure was
                    by knight service, and the whole where it was in socage. Corporations were
                    incapacitated to receive, and married women, infants, idiots, and lunatics to
                    devise. The Act 12 Car. II. c. 24, by abolishing tenure by knight service, made
                    all lands devisable. In the same reign the Statute of Frauds (29 Car. II. c. 3)
                    dealt with the formalities of execution. Up to this time simple notes, even in
                    the handwriting of another person, constituted a sufficient will, if published
                    by the testator as such. The Statute of Frauds required, <hi rend="italic">inter
                        alia,</hi> that all devises should be in writing, signed by the testator or
                    by some person for him in his presence and by his direction, and should also be
                    subscribed by three credible witnesses. The strict interpretation by the courts
                    of the credibility of witnesses led to the passing of 26 Geo. II. c. 6, making
                    interested witnesses sufficient for the due execution of the will, but declaring
                    gifts to them void. The will of a man was revoked by marriage and the birth of a
                    child, of a woman by marriage only. A will was also revoked by an alteration in
                    circumstances, and even by a void conveyance <hi rend="italic">inter vivos</hi>
                    of land devised by the will made subsequently to the date of the will, which was
                    presumed to be an attempt by the grantor to give legal effect to a change of
                    intention. As in Roman law, a will spoke from the time of the making, so that it
                    could not avail to pass afteracquired property without republication, which was
                    equivalent to making a new will. Copyholds were not devisable before 1815, but
                    were usually surrendered to the use of the will of the copy hold tenant; 55 Geo.
                    III. c. 192 made them devisable simply. Devises of lands have gradually been
                    made liable to the claims of creditors by a series of statutes beginning with 3
                    and 4 W. and M. c. 14.</p>
                <p>The history of wills of personalty was considerably different, but to some extent
                    followed parallel lines. In both cases partial preceded complete power of
                    disposition. The general opinion of the best authorities is that by the common
                    law of England a man could only dispose of his whole personal property if he
                    left no wife or children; if he left either wife or children he could only
                    dispose of one-half, and one-third if he left both wife and children. The shares
                    of wife and children were called their <hi rend="italic">pars</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">rationabilis.</hi> This <hi rend="italic">pars</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">rationabilis</hi> is expressly recognized in Magna Charta. At
                    what period the right of disposition of the whole personalty superseded the old
                    law is uncertain. That it did so is certain, and the places where the old rule
                    still existed,—the province of York, Wales, and the City of London,—were
                    regarded as exceptions. The right of bequest in these places was not assimilated
                    to the general law until comparatively recent times by Acts passed between 1693
                    and 1726. A good will of personalty could be made by a male at fourteen, by a
                    female at twelve. The formalities in the case of wills of personalty were not as
                    numerous as in the case of wills of land. Up to 1838 a nuncupative or oral will
                    was sufficient, subject, where the gift was of £30 or more, to the restrictions
                    contained in the Statute of Frauds. The witnesses to a written will need not be

                    and 5 Anne c. 3 that anyone who could give evidence in a court of law was a good
                    witness to a will of personalty. A will entirely in the testator’s handwriting,
                    called a holograph will, was valid without signature. At one time the executor
                    was entitled to the residue in default of a residuary legatee. But 11 Geo. IV.

                    dioceses. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction was of very ancient origin. It was
                    fully established under Henry IL, as it is mentioned by Glanvill. In the City of
                    London wills were enrolled in the Court of Hustings from 1258 to 1688 after
                    having been proved before the ordinary. Contested cases before 1858 were tried
                    in the Prerogative Court with an appeal originally to the Court of Delegates,
                    later to the judicial committee of the privy council. There were also a few
                    special local jurisdictions, probably for the most part survivals of the
                    pre-Conquest period, when wills seem to have been published in the county court.
                    The ecclesiastical courts had no jurisdiction over wills of land, and the common
                    law courts were careful to keep the ecclesiastical courts within their limits by
                    means of <hi rend="smallcaps">Prohibition</hi><hi rend="italic">(jj.vf</hi> No
                    probate of a will of land was necessary, and title to real estate by will might
                    be made by production of the will as a document of title. This is still the law
                    in ordinary cases; but the Act of 1857 has introduced probate of will of land as
                    an exceptional proceeding. The liability of the executor and legatee for the
                    debts of the testator has been gradually established by legislation. In general
                    it is limited to the amount of the succession. Personal liability of the
                    executor beyond this can by the Statute of Frauds only be established by
                    contract in writing.</p>
                <p>Such were the principal stages in the history of the law as it affected wills
                    made before 1838 or proved before 1858. The principal Acts now in force are the
                    Wills Act, 1837 (7 Will. IV. and 1 Vict. c. 26), the Court of Probate Act, 1857
                    (20 and 21 Vict. c. 77), and the Judicature Acts. Some of the earlier Acts are
                    still law, though of little importance since the more modern and comprehensive
                    enactments. The earliest on the statute roll is 20 Hen. III. c. 2, enabling a
                    widow to bequeath the crops of her lands. Before the Wills Act uniformity in the
                    law had been urgently recommended by the Real Property Commissioners in 1833. It
                    appears from their report<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the time of its appearance there were ten different ways in which a will might

                <p>The Act of 1837 affected both the making and the interpretation of wills.<note

                            word “will” includes codicil.</p><p/></note> Excluding the latter for
                    the present, its main provisions were these. All property, real and personal,
                    and of whatever tenure, may be disposed of by will. If customary freeholds or
                    copyholds be devised, the will must be entered on the court rolls. No will made
                    by any person under the age of twenty-one is valid. Every will is to be in
                    writing, signed at the foot or end thereof by the testator or by some person in
                    his presence and by his direction, and such signature is to be made or
                    acknowledged by the testator in the presence of two or more witnesses present at
                    the same time, who are to subscribe the will in the presence of the testator.
                    Publication is not necessary. A will is not void on account of the incompetency
                    of a witness. Gifts to a witness or the husband or wife of a witness are void. A
                    creditor or executor may attest. A will is revoked (except where made in
                    exercise of a power of appointment of a certain kind) by a later will, or by
                    destruction with the intention of revoking, but not by presumption arising from
                    an alteration in circumstances. Alterations in a will must be executed and
                    attested as a will. A will speaks from the death of the testator, unless a
                    contrary intention appear. The Act of 1857 transferred the jurisdiction, both
                    voluntary and contentious, of all ecclesiastical, royal peculiar, peculiar, and
                    manorial courts to the Court of Probate constituted by the Act, created a judge
                    and registrars of that court, abolished the old exclusive rights in testamentary
                    matters of the advocates of Doctors’ Commons, and laid down rules of procedure.
                    Contentious jurisdiction was given to county courts where the personal estate of
                    the deceased was under £200 in value. The Judicature Act, 1873, merged the old
                    Court of Probate in the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of the High
                    Court of Justice. The division now consists of the president and one other
                    judge. The practice of the division is mainly regulated by the Rules of the
                    Supreme Court, 1883. Appeals lie to the Court of Appeal and thence to the House
                    of Lords. Before the Judicature Act they lay directly to the House of Lords. The
                    principal rules now obtaining as to probate are these. Probate is confined as a
                    rule to wills of personalty or of mixed personalty and realty, and is either in
                    common form, where no opposition to the grant is made, or in solemn form,
                    generally after opposition, when the witnesses appear in court. The Act of 1857
                    introduced proof of wills of realty in solemn form after citation of the
                    heir-at-law and devisees. Probate may be granted either in the principal or in a
                    district registry, and should be obtained within six months after the testator’s
                    death. Where no executor is named in a will, the will is not now invalid, as was
                    once the case, but administration <hi rend="italic">cum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >testamento</hi><hi rend="italic">annexo</hi> is granted. The same course is
                    pursued where the executor renounces or dies intestate before administering the
                    estate of the deceased∣∙ After probate the probate (as the official copy of the
                    will is called) itself becomes evidence, the original will being deposited in
                    the principal registry at Somerset House, London. On grant of probate a duty,
                    denoted by a stamp on the probate, is payable. It varies according to the amount
                    at which the personalty is fixed by the oath of the executor. Other Acts dealing
                    with the practice in wills and probate may be shortly stated. 15 and 16 Vict. c.
                    24 removed some of the difficulties which had arisen on the clause of the Wills
                    Act that the signature was to be at the foot or end. 44 Vict. c. 12 enabled any
                    officer of inland revenue to grant probate where the personal estate does not
                    exceed £300. The main duty of an executor is to pay the debts of the deceased in
                    a certain order of priority, to administer the estate, to pay probate and legacy
                    duties, and in general to carry out the intention of the testator. There are
                    numerous Acts, especially the Conveyancing Act, 1881, dealing with the rights
                    and liabilities of executors, the general effect of which is to discharge an
                    executor from liability for <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> payment of debts,
                    for distribution of assets after public notice to persons interested, &amp;c.
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Executors).</hi></p>
                <p>Rules of interpretation or construction depend chiefly on decisions of the
                    courts, to a smaller extent on statutory enactment. The law was gradually
                    brought into its present condition through precedents extending back for
                    centuries, especially decisions of the Court of Chancery, the court <hi
                        rend="italic">par excellence</hi> of construction, as distinguished from the
                    Court of Probate. The Court of Probate did not deal unless incidentally with the
                    meaning of the will; its jurisdiction was confined to seeing that it was duly
                    executed. The present state of the law of interpretation is highly technical.
                    Some phrases have obtained a conventional meaning which the testators who used
                    them probably did not dream of. Many of the judicial doctrines which had
                    gradually become established were altered by the Wills Act. These provisions of
                    the Act have since that time themselves become the subject of judicial decision.
                    Among other provisions are these, most of them to take effect only in the
                    absence of a contrary intention. A residuary devise is to include estates
                    comprised in lapsed and void devises. A general gift of the testator’s lands is
                    to include copyholds and leaseholds. A general gift of real or personal estate
                    is to include real or personal estate over which the testator had a general
                    power of appointment. A devise without words of limitation is to pass the fee
                    simple. The words “die without issue” or similar words are to mean die without
                    issue living at the time of the death of the person whose issue was named.
                    Trustees under an unlimited devise are to take the fee simple. Devises of
                    estates tail are not to lapse if the devisee, though he predeceased the
                    testator, left issue inheritable under the entail. Gifts to children or other
                    issue leaving issue living at the testator’s death are not to lapse. Rules of
                    interpretation founded on principles of equity independent of statute are very
                    numerous, and for them the works devoted to the subject must be consulted. Some
                    of the more important, stated in as general a form as possible, are these. The
                    intention of the testator is to be observed. This rule is called by Sir E. Coke
                    the pole star to guide the judges. There is a presumption against intestacy,
                    against double portions, against constructing merely precatory words to import a
                    trust, &amp;c. One part of the will is to be expounded by another.
                    Interlineations and alterations are presumed to have been made after, not as in
                    deeds before, execution. Words are supposed to be used in their strict and
                    primary sense. Many words and phrases, however, such as “money,” “residue,” and
                    “issue” and other words of relationship, have become invested with a technical
                    meaning. Evidence is admissible in certain cases to explain latent ambiguity,
                    and parol evidence of the terms of a lost will may be given.</p>

                <p>A will may be void, in whole or in part, for many reasons, which may be divided
                    into two great classes, those arising from external circumstances and those
                    arising from the will itself. The main examples of the former class are
                    revocation by burning, tearing, &amp;c., by a later will, or by marriage of the
                    testator, incapacity of the testator from insanity, infancy, or legal disability
                    (such as being a convict), undue influence, and fraud, any one of which is
                    ground for the court to refuse or revoke probate of a will good on the face of
                    it, or declare a will of lands void. Undue influence is a ground upon which
                    frequent attempts are made to set aside wills. Its nature is well explained in a
                    judgment of Lord Penzance’s: “Pressure of whatever character, whether acting on
                    the fears or the hopes, if so exerted as to overpower the volition without
                    convincing the judgment, is a species of restraint under which no valid will can
                    be made.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hall <hi

                    will which make it open to objection may either avoid it altogether or create a
                    partial intestacy, the will remaining good as a whole. Where the will is not
                    duly executed, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> if it is a forgery or if it is not
                    signed by the testator or the proper number of witnesses, the will is not
                    admitted to probate at all. Where it contains devises or bequests bad in law, as
                    in general restraint of marriage, or tending to create perpetuities, or contrary
                    to public policy, or to some particular enactment, only the illegal part is
                    void. A remarkable instance is a well-known case in which a condition subsequent
                    in a devise was held void as against public policy, being a gift over of the
                    estate devised in case the first devisee, the eldest son of an earl, did not
                    before his death obtain the lapsed title of duke of Bridge water.<note

                    conferred on an English king were given to Henry VIII. by 25 Hen. VIII. c. 7,
                    empowering him to limit and appoint the succession to the crown by will, in

                    property, but even at common law a will simply appointing a guardian was good.
                    The common law was superseded by 12 Car. II. c. 24, under which a father mày
                    dispose of the custody of his unmarried infant children by will. The
                    Guardianship of Infants Act, 1886, extended such powers in certain cases to the
                    mother. <hi rend="italic">Married Woman.—</hi> At common law a married woman
                    could not (with a few exceptions) make a will without her husband’s licence and
                    consent, and this disability was specially preserved by the Wills Acts of Henry
                    VIII. and of 1837. A common mode of avoiding this difficulty was for the husband
                    to contract before marriage to permit the wife to make an appointment disposing
                    of personalty to a certain value. Courts of equity from an early time allowed
                    her, under certain restrictions, to make a will of property held for her
                    separate use. In some cases her husband could dispose of her property by will,
                    in others not. The law as it existed previously to 1882 is now practically
                    obsolete, the Married Women’s Property Act of that year enabling a married woman
                    to dispose by will of any real or personal property as her separate property as
                    a <hi rend="italic">feme sole</hi> without the intervention of any trustee. The
                    Act also enables a married woman who is executrix of a will to act as if she

                    resident in England could only dispose of property by will with the king’s
                    licence. The Naturalization Act, 1870, enables him to do so as fully as a
                    natural-born British subject. <hi rend="italic">Soldier and Sailor.—</hi> Wills
                    of soldiers in actual military service, and of sailors, are subject to special
                    legislation, and are excepted from the operation of the Wills Act. The privilege
                    only applies to wills of personal estate. Wills of soldiers on an expedition may
                    be made by unattested writing or by nuncupative testament before two witnesses.
                    Wills of petty officers and seamen in the navy, and of marines, as far as
                    relates to their pay or prizemoney, must be attested by an officer, and wills
                    made by a seaman in the merchant service must, if made at sea, be attested by
                    the master or mate, if made on land by a superintendent of a mercantile marine
                    office, a clergyman, justice of the peace, or consular or customs officer. The
                    wills of prisoners of war are subject to special regulations, and the Admiralty
                    may at its discretion waive the due execution of wills in other instances. The
                    effects of seamen, marines, and soldiers, killed or dying in the service, are
                    exempt from probate duty. Pay, wages, prize money, and pensions due to persons
                    employed in the navy may be paid out without probate where the whole assets do
                    not exceed £32. The Board of Trade may at its discretion dispense with probate
                    of the will of a merchant seaman whose effects do not exceed £50 in value. By an
                    Act passed in 1868 the existing exemptions are extended to the sum of £100 in
                    the case of civil service pay or annuities, of civil or military allowances
                    chargeable to the army votes, and of army prize money. <hi rend="italic">Will
                        made under power.—</hi> A will made under a power of appointment is not
                    revoked by marriage when the real or personal estate thereby appointed would not
                    in default of appointment pass to the testator’s executor or administrator or to
                    the next of kin. Before the Wills Act a will exercising a power of appointment
                    had to conform to any special requisitions in the power, but since the Act the
                    power is duly exercised if executed and attested like an ordinary will. <hi

                    wills affecting lands in those counties must be registered (see <hi

                <p>At common law there could be no larceny of a will of lands. But now by the
                    Larceny Act of 1861 stealing, injuring, or concealing a will, whether of real or
                    personal estate, is punishable with penal servitude for life. Forgery of a will
                    (at one time a capital crime) renders the offender liable to the same penalty.
                    Fraudulent concealment of a will material to the title by a vendor or mortgagor
                    of land or chattels is by 22 and 23 Vict. c. 35 a misdemeanour punishable by
                    fine or imprisonment or both.</p>
                <p>Connected with the subject of this article, though not falling directly under it,
                    is the <hi rend="italic">donatio mortis causa,</hi> depending for the most part
                    upon rules adopted from Roman law. Unlike a bequest under a will, such a gift
                    passes without probate and does not need the presence of any statutory number of
                    witnesses. It is, however, liable to legacy duty and is part of the assets of
                    the deceased. For its validity two elements are essential: the gift must be
                    conditional on the donor’s dying from his existing illness, and therefore
                    revocable, and there must be delivery. Money, jewels, or other chattels may be
                    the subjects of a <hi rend="italic">donatio mortis causa</hi>; so may negotiable
                    instruments passing by delivery, but not cheques signed by the giver, as his
                    authority to draw is revoked by his death. If presented before his death, the
                    gift, being unconditional, is wanting in one of the elements of a good <hi

                    Act on lines similar to the English Act was passed for Ireland, 21 and 22 Vict.
                    c. 79. Under the Irish Judicature Act of 1877 the then existing Court of Probate
                    was merged in the High Court of Justice.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> Up to 1868 wills of immovables were not allowed
                    in Scotland. The usual means of obtaining disposition of heritage after death
                    was a trust disposition and settlement by deed <hi rend="italic"
                        >deprae-senti,</hi> under which the truster disponed the property to
                    trustees according to the trusts of the settlement, reserving a life interest.
                    Thus something very similar to a testamentary disposition was secured by means
                    resembling those employed in England before the Wills Act of Henry VIII. The
                    main disadvantage of the trust disposition was that it was liable to he
                    overthrown by the heir, who could reduce <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">capite lecti</hi> all voluntary deeds made to his prejudice
                    within sixty days of the death of his ancestor. In 1868 the Titles to Land
                    Consolidation Act made it competent to any owner of lands to settle the
                    succession to the same in the event of death by testamentary or <hi
                        rend="italic">mortis causa</hi> deeds or writings. In 1871 reduction <hi
                        rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">capite lecti</hi> was abolished by 34
                    and 35 Vict. c. 81. A will of immovables must be executed with the formalities
                    of a deed and registered to give title (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Registration).</hi> The disability of a woman as a witness was removed by
                    the Titles to Land Consolidation Act. As to wills of movables, there are several
                    important points in which they differ from corresponding wills in England, the
                    influence of Roman law being more marked. Males may make a will at fourteen,
                    females at twelve. A nuncupative legacy is good to the amount of £100 Scots (£8,
                    6s. 8d.), and a holograph testament is good without witnesses, but it must be
                    signed by the testator, differing in this from the old English holograph. By the
                    Conveyancing Act, 1874, such a will is presumed to have been executed on the
                    date which it bears. Not all movables can be left, as in England. The movable
                    property of the deceased is subject to <hi rend="italic">jus relictae,</hi> or
                    widow’s right to half if there be no child or children, one-third if there be a
                    child or children, and the <hi rend="italic">legitim,</hi> or bairn’s part, of
                    half if there be no widow, one-third if there be a widow. Only the remainder is
                    disponible as dead’s part. Legitim depends upon survivance and is not
                    transmissible on predecease of a person prospectively entitled to it. Both jus
                    relictae and legitim may be excluded by discharge or satisfaction, as by
                    provision in the contract of marriage. Executor in Scotch law is a more
                    extensive term than in English. He is either nominate or dative, the latter
                    appointed by the court and corresponding in most respects to the English
                    administrator. Caution is required from the latter, but not from the former.
                    Confirmation includes both the probate and letters of administration of English
                    procedure. Without confirmation by the court interference by the executor
                    becomes a vitious <pb break="no"

                    testaments of movables fell, as in England, under the cognizance of the church
                    courts. Such jurisdiction certainly existed at the time of <hi rend="italic"
                        >regiam majestatem.</hi> This ecclesiastical right continued through the
                    Commissary Court at Edinburgh (constituted by Queen Mary in 1563) and the local
                    commissaries until modern times, when the jurisdiction of these courts was at
                    first transferred and then abolished by a series of enactments from 4 Geo. IV.
                    c. 97 to the Sheriff Courts Act, 1876. The Act of George IV. placed the
                    commissary jurisdiction in the sheriff courts; by the Act of 1876 the sheriffs
                    sit as sheriffs in testamentary matters, no longer as commissaries. Confirmation
                    of wills where the whole estate is under £300 is regulated by 44 Viet, c. 12 and
                    other Acts. An eik is an addition to a confirmation made on discovery of
                    additional effects of the deceased after confirmation. By the common law
                    doctrine of passive representation the heir or executor was liable to be sued
                    for implement of the deceased’s obligations. The Roman principle of <hi
                        rend="italic">beneficium inventarii</hi> was first introduced by an Act of
                    1695. As the law at present stands, the heir or executor is liable only to the
                    value of the succession, except where there has been vitious intromission in
                    movables, and in <hi rend="italic">gestio</hi><hi rend="italic">pro</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">herede</hi> and some other cases in heritabl·es. The present
                    inventory duty on succession to movables depends upon 44 Vict. c. 12. In England
                    the executor is bound to pay the debts of the deceased in a certain order; in
                    Scotland they all rank <hi rend="italic">pari passu,</hi> except privileged

                        States.—</hi> By the constitutions of many States laws giving effect to
                    informal or invalid wills are forbidden. The age of testamentary capacity varies
                    very much. Eighteen is a common one. Full liberty of disposition is not
                    universal. Homesteads generally, and dower estates frequently, are not
                    devisable. In some States only a disposable portion of the property can be left,
                    so that children cannot be disinherited without good cause, and in some children
                    omitted in a will may still take their share. It is frequently provided that a
                    certain amount must be left to the widow. Louisiana follows French law, by which
                    the testator can under no circumstances alienate by will more than half his
                    property if he leave issue or ascendants. In some States a married woman may not
                    leave more than half her property away from her husband. Some require the
                    husband’s consent and subscription to make the will of a married woman valid.
                    Nuncupative and holograph wills are in use. The former are confined to
                    personalty and must generally be reduced to writing within a short time after
                    the words are spoken. In Louisiana there is a special form of will, borrowed
                    from Roman law, called the mystic or sealed will, in which the testator declares
                    a sealed packet to be his will before witnesses. The number of witnesses
                    necessary for the validity of a will of any kind is usually two, sometimes
                    three. Wills of soldiers and sailors are privileged, as in England. Probate is
                    granted sometimes by the ordinary chancery or common law courts, more frequently
                    by courts of special jurisdiction, such as the Prerogative Court in New Jersey,
                    the Surrogate’s Court in New York.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        rend="italic">International Law.—</hi> There are three main directions which
                    the opinion of jurists and the practice of courts have taken. (1) The whole
                    property of the testator may be subjected to the law of his domicil. To this
                    effect is the opinion of Savigny and the German practice. (2) The property may
                    be subjected to the law of the place where it happens to be at the time of the
                    testator’s death. (3) The movable property may be subjected to the law of the
                    domicil, the immovable to the law of the place where it is situate, the <hi
                        rend="italic">lex loci rei sitae.</hi> England and the United States follow
                    this rule. Testamentary capacity is generally governed by the law of the
                    testator’s domicil, the form of the instrument in most countries either by the
                    law of his domicil or the law of the place where the will was made, at his
                    option. The old rule of English law was to allow the former alternative only.
                    The law was altered for the United Kingdom in 1861 by Lord Kingsdown’s Act (24
                    and 25 Vict, c. 114), by which a will made out of the United Kingdom by a
                    British subject is, as far as regards personal estate, good if made according to
                    the forms required by the law of the place where it was made, or by the law of
                    the testator’s domicil at the time of making it, or by the law of the place of
                    his domicil of origin. Subsequent change of domicil does not avoid such a will.
                    Another Act passed on the same day (24 and 25 Vict. c. 121) enacted that by
                    convention with any foreign Government foreign domicil could not be acquired by
                    a testator without a year’s residence and a written declaration of intention to
                    become domiciled. In the United States some States have adopted the narrow
                    policy of enacting by statute the old common law rule, and providing that no
                    will is valid unless made in the form required by the law of the State of the
                    testator’s domicil. The construction of a will is governed by the law of the
                    domicil of the testator, as he must be supposed to have used language in
                    consonance with that law, unless indeed he express himself in technical language
                    of another country. The persons who are to take under a will are decided by
                    different rules according as the property is movable or immovable, the former
                    being governed by the law of the domicil, the latter by the <hi rend="italic"

                    have succeeded simply under that designation to real property in England devised
                    by the will. A will duly executed abroad is generally required to be clothed
                    with the authority of a court of the country where any property affected by the
                    will is situate. As far as regards the different kingdoms composing the United
                    Kingdom, 21 and 22 Vict. c. 56 enables an English or Irish probate, or a Scotch
                    confirmation, to be sealed as of course in the proper court of one of the other
                    kingdoms. (J. W+. )</p>
