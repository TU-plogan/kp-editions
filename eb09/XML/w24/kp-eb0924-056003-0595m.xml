                    main line of the London and North Western Railway, 18 miles west-north-west of
                    Manchester, 18 north-east of Liverpool, and 195 north-west of London. The
                    Douglas is spanned by several bridges, and is connected with the Leeds and
                    Liverpool Canal. There is also a branch canal by Leigh and Worsley to
                    Manchester. The older portions of the town occupy the north bank of the river,
                    the modern additions being chiefly on the south bank. The church of All Saints,

                    restored in 1630 and again in 1847 There are six other ecclesiastical parishes.
                    The principal public buildings are the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary and
                    Dispensary (1873, enlarged 1884), the public hall (1853), the borough courts and
                    offices (1866), the arcade (1872), the market-hall (1877), the free public
                    library (1878), the public baths (1882), and the county justices courts and
                    offices (1888). The educational institutions include the free grammar school
                    (founded by James Leigh in 1619 and rebuilt in 1876), the mining and mechanical
                    school, and the mechanics’ institution. The charities are numerous but of small
                    individual importance, their aggregate annual value amounting to about £2500. A
                    public park of 27 acres was opened in 1878. The town owes much of its prosperity
                    to its coal mines, which afford employment to a large proportion of the
                    inhabitants and supply fuel for the factory furnaces. Mills for making hats were
                    established at Wigan in 1482; and subsequently bell-founding and pottery-making
                    were of some importance. The chief industry is now the maufacture of cotton
                    fabrics; the town also possesses iron forges, iron and brass foundries, oil and
                    grease works, railway waggon factories, and bolt, screw, and nail works. The
                    population of the municipal and parliamentary borough (area 2188 acres) was
                    20,774 in 1831; by 1861 it had increased to 37,658, by 1871 to 39,110, and by
                    1881 to 48,194 (23,508 males and 24,686 females); in 1888 it was estimated at
                    55,000.</p>
                <p>Wigan is situated at the junction of three Roman roads, and there was a ford
                    across the river where Millgate now stands. Many Roman coins have been found in
                    the neighbourhood; hence it is supposed that Wigan was an important Roman
                    station. Numerous Danish barrows also exist in the neighbourhood. After the
                    Conquest Newton (in which Wigan is situated) was bestowed on Roger de Poictou,
                    but on account of his rebellion was forfeited to the crown. The rectory of Wigan
                    existed before 1243, and the rector as lord of the manor received a charter for
                    the town in the 30th year of Henry III. Wigan was a city of refuge for runaway
                    slaves during the Middle Ages. It was one of the 120 boroughs selected to send
                    members to parliament in 1306; but the privilege lay dormant until 1547. From
                    the charter it received in the 24th year of Edward III., confirming its
                    liberties, it is evident that it was already an important market town, while its
                    fairs were on a large scale and regulated by special laws. It also received
                    charters from Richard II. and Charles II. Leland refers to it as a paved town
                    “as bigge as Warrington, and better builded.” Camden describes it as “neat and
                    plentiful.” Wigan contributed £50 of ship-money to Charles I. in 1636. On the
                    outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 it was occupied by the earl of Derby, and
                    formed the central garrison for the king in Lancashire; but the entrenchments
                    were taken by Sir John Seaton in 1643 after a desperate battle. It was again
                    repossessed by the earl of Derby, but was retaken by Colonel Ashton in March,
                    when the outworks and fortifications were demolished. On 25th August 1651 the
                    earl of Derby was defeated at Wigan by Colonel Lilburne, when Sir Thomas
                    Tyldesley was slain. A memorial pillar to Tyldesley was erected in 1679 and
                    restored in 1882. The town was governed by a mayor, recorder, 12 aidermen, and 2
                    bailiffs till the charter of 2d William IV. Under the Municipal Act it was
                    divided into five wards, and is governed by a mayor, recorder, 10 aidermen, and
                    30 councillors. It has a commission of the peace and a separate court of quarter
                    sessions. In 1885 the number of its parliamentary representatives was reduced to
                    one.</p>
