                    (1782-1852), American statesman, was born at Salisbury, New Hampshire, January
                    18, 1782. His family can be traced back without difficulty to Thomas Webster, of
                    Scottish ancestry, who settled in New Hampshire in 1636, but no further.
                    Ebenezer Webster, the father of Daniel, rose to the rank of captain in the
                    “French and Indian War.” From him his sons Ezekiel and Daniel inherited great
                    physical force; their mother, Abigail Eastman, gave them their intellectual
                    powers. Daniel always insisted on considering his elder brother, who became a
                    leading lawyer in his native State, as really his superior in intellect, and the
                    correspondence between them was close and confidential until Ezekiel’s death in
                    1829. Living on the frontier, Daniel was compelled to depend for early education
                    on his mother and on the scanty schooling customary in winter; and for much of
                    this he was indebted to the fact that he was physically the weakest of his
                    family. It is a little odd, however, that he failed utterly in that with which
                    his final reputation was so closely connected. In his own words: “There was one
                    thing I could not do: I could not make a declamation; I could not speak before
                    the school.” When he was fifteen years old a family council decided to send him
                    to college, a step involving severe abstinence and additional struggle on the
                    part of his immediate relatives. After an imperfect preparation, he graduated at
                    Dartmouth College in 1801, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in Boston in
                    1805, from the office of Christopher Gore.</p>
                <p>Regard for his father made Webster begin practice in the town of Boscawen, near
                    his early home; but his father died within a year, and he removed to Portsmouth,
                    the largest town of the State. Here he took a leading place at the bar, having
                    but one rival. In May 1813 he entered Congress as a representative from New
                    Hampshire, being placed at once on the committee of foreign affairs. As a
                    moderate Federalist, he held that attacks on Canada should oease, and that the
                    war should be confined to the ocean. His first speech showed that the raw New
                    Hampshire boy of a dozen years before had developed new powers. “If the war must
                    continue, go to the ocean. If you are seriously contending for maritime rights,
                    go to the theatre where alone those rights can be defended. Thither every
                    indication of your fortune points you. There the united wishes and exertions of
                    the nation will go with you Even our party divisions, acrimonious as they are,
                    cease at the water’s edge.” The position of any Federalist in Congress, however,
                    was not a wide sphere of influence; and Webster, removing to Boston in 1816,
                    gave up political life for some years.</p>
                <p>At the Massachusetts bar Webster soon gained a place as prominent as he had held
                    in New Hampshire, and within three years his reputation as a lawyer had become
                    national. His national standing was gained by his argument in the “Dartmouth
                    College case,” practically endorsed by the Supreme Court. Dartmouth College had
                    been chartered by the king in 1769. In 1816 the New Hampshire legislature
                    undertook to alter the charter and reorganize the corporation; and the State
                    courts sustained the legislature in a suit brought by the old trustees against
                    the new. On appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1818, Webster
                    contended that the College was an eleemosynary corporation, over which the
                    legislature had no more power than the king who chartered it; that the king had
                    no power to void such a charter, and the New Hampshire legislature no such
                    sovereign powers as parliament; that the legislature’s action came within the
                    Federal constitution’s prohibition of State legislation altering contracts; that
                    “the charter of 1769 is a contract;” that “the acts in question impair this
                    contract;” and that they were therefore unconstitutional and void. The Supreme
                    Court upheld Webster’s view, and it was soon seen that he had worked a serious
                    change in the relations of the States to corporations, as they had thus far been
                    understood. The States endeavoured to meet the new rule by inserting in their
                    charters clauses retaining the right to alter them; but the spirit of the
                    “Dartmouth College case,” which has always had its opponents among American
                    lawyers, has had its influence upon judges everywhere, in every variety of
                    cognate cases. From this time Webster was recognized as the leading lawyer of
                    the country, and his services were in constant demand.</p>

                    commonly known as the Rhode Island case, in 1848, in which he laid the

                    constitution, and stated the meaning of the “republican government” of a State.
                    Like other American lawyers, he made no distinction in his practice between
                    kinds of cases, and was often retained in criminal causes. The most celebrated
                    of these were the trials of Goodridge and Knapp; in the latter (6 Webster’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Works,</hi> 53) is the passage on the power of conscience, which
                    has been declaimed by countless American schoolboys.</p>
                <p>Webster’s reputation as an orator began with his address at Plymouth in 1820, on
                    the 200th anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims. It was increased by his
                    address at the laying of the corner-stone of the Bunker Hill monument in 1825,
                    on the 50th anniversary of the battle, and by that which commemorated in 1826
                    the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and the coincident
                    deaths of Jefferson and John Adams. On every great public occasion thereafter,
                    if Webster was obtainable, he was held to be the natural speaker to be chosen.
                    His finest subsequent speeches were made on the completion of the Bunker Hill
                    monument in 1843, and at the laying of the corner-stone of the addition to the
                    Capitol at Washington in 1851.</p>
                <p>In December 1823 Webster returned to Congress as a representative from
                    Massachusetts, and his first speech, in January 1824, in support of a resolution
                    to send a commissioner to Greece, then in insurrection, made him the first of
                    Congressional speakers. During his service in the house the tariff of 1824 came
                    up for discussion. Representing a commercial district, Webster’s speech has
                    always been a source of gratification to American opponents of protection. He
                    repudiated the name of “American system,” claimed by Clay for the system of
                    protection which he was introducing. He cited with cordial approval the
                    expressed belief of English statesmen that English manufactures had prospered in
                    spite of protection, not because of it, and their desire for “unrestricted
                    trade.” He attacked the “old notion” of the balance of trade with such vigour
                    that he felt compelled to apologize “for speaking irreverently of the dead.” He
                    stated the manner in which, under unrestricted trade, the American production in
                    cotton, woollens, and iron had already come to rival that of England, protected
                    for hundreds of years, and the loss in labour which would come from an attempt,
                    by legal protection, to “support a business that cannot support itself.” The
                    whole speech would be a very striking free-trade argument even at the present
                    day. When the tariff of 1828, which was still more protective, came up for
                    discussion, Webster had ceased to oppose protection; but his speech does not
                    attempt to argue in favour of it. It states that his people, after giving
                    warning in 1824 that they would consider protection as the policy of the
                    Government, had gone into protected manufactures, and that he now asked that
                    that policy be not reversed to the injury of his constituents. It can hardly
                    escape notice that, in his published <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> Webster has
                    but two subsequent speeches in Congress on the tariff, both defending protection
                    rather as a policy under which industries had been called into being than as an
                    advisable policy, if the stage had been clear for the adoption of a new
                    policy.</p>
                <p>In 1827 Webster was sent to the senate, in which he remained until his death,
                    with the exception of his service in the cabinet in Tyler’s administration. In
                    January 1830 came the crowning event of his political life. A debate on public
                    lands, under a resolution offered by Senator Foot, thence known as “Foot’s
                    resolution,” had wandered off into all possible fields. In course of it, Hayne,
                    of South Carolina, attacked New England for having pursued a selfish policy as
                    to western lands. Webster replied. During Hayne’s answer Webster drew from him
                    the first distinct and public statement of the new doctrine of nullification, of
                    the constitutional right of a State to forbid the execution within its
                    jurisdiction of Acts of Congress which it considered unconstitutional. This had
                    been the product of Calhoun’s intellect, which was generally taken to be the
                    source of Hayne’s inspiration. Webster’s reply is his famous “second speech on
                    Foot’s resolution.” He began by a defence of Massachusetts, which has been
                    severely criticized, and is perhaps open to criticism. But if effect is to be
                    taken as a test, it is above criticism. The remainder of the speech was of
                    intense interest, not merely to New England, but to the whole North and West,
                    and to all the progressive elements of the country. He stated the anarchistic
                    doctrine of nullification in its nakedness, extorted from Hayne an unwilling
                    half-admission of the exactness of his statement, and then went on to trample on
                    it with such an exhibition of logic, sarcasm, and elephantine humour as has
                    never been heard in the senate before or since. It is on this speech that
                    Webster’s fame was built. Southern men had taken the lead so long that it was a
                    new sensation to the North and West to see a Southern leader completely
                    overmatched by their champion; and “Black Dan Webster,” a popular name, due to
                    his dark complexion, beetling brows, and heavy cast of features, was for twenty
                    years the representative of Northern sentiment as to the nature of the
                    Union.</p>
                <p>Calhoun took Hayne’s place in the senate in 1833, introduced and defended
                    resolutions endorsing the right of nullification, and was still more fully
                    answered by Webster. For the next seventeen years the records of the senate are
                    full of constitutional arguments between the two. Webster’s oratory made him an
                    invaluable member of the Whig party, and his addresses at political meetings are
                    so numerous as to defy special mention. A leader so distinguished had a fair
                    right to think of the presidency, but it always remained just beyond his reach.
                    In the general Whig confusion of 1836 he received the fourteen electoral votes
                    of Massachusetts. In 1840 the candidature of Harrison left him no chance. In
                    1844 Webster’s retention of his position under Tyler gave Clay an overwhelming
                    advantage with his party. In 1848 the nomination of Taylor, which Webster
                    declared to be “one not fit to be made,” was a fatal blow to the prospects of
                    the Massachusetts leader. His final failure to obtain the Whig nomination in
                    1852 put an end to his political career.</p>
                <p>When the Whig party came into power in 1841, Webster was appointed secretary of
                    state (foreign affairs), and he retained his post under Tyler, after his
                    colleagues had broken with the new president and resigned. There was good reason
                    for his action. When he entered office war with Great Britain was a probable
                    event of the near future. The M'Leod case, in which the State of New York
                    insisted on trying a British subject, with whose trial the Federal Government
                    had no power to interfere, while the British Government had declared that it
                    would consider conviction and execution a <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi>;
                    the exercise of the right of search by British vessels on the coast of Africa,
                    of which Americans had a deep-seated detestation, quite apart from <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0498-0473"/> any feeling about the slave-trade; the Maine
                    boundary, as to which the action of a State might at any time bring the federal
                    Government into armed collision with Great Britain,—all these at once met the
                    new secretary, and ho felt that he had no right to abandon his work for party
                    reasons. With the special commissioner from Great Britain, Lord Ashburton, he
                    concluded the treaty of 1842, which settled all these questions satisfactorily
                    to both parties. At the same time Webster took the opportunity to end the long
                    controversy as to the right of impressment. Sixteen years afterwards the British
                    Government admitted at last the correctness of the American position.</p>
                <p>The treaty of 1842 also introduced the principle of extradition into the
                    connexion between the two countries. It had been admitted once before, in Jay’s
                    treaty of 1794, but only as to murder and forgery, and only until 180G.</p>
                <p>Leaving the cabinet in 1843, Webster was returned to the senate in 1845 and spent
                    the remainder of his life there. He opposed the annexation of Texas and the
                    Mexican War, and was, as before, the recognized spokesman of his party. As the
                    growing intensity of the quarrel over the organization of the territory acquired
                    from Mexico revealed the depth of the chasm which now yawned between the
                    sections, Webster’s standing-ground in American politics disappeared. His 7th of
                    March speech, in 1850, which stamped him, in the opinion of many of his former
                    Northern worshippers, as a recreant bidding for Southern votes for the
                    presidency, was really little different from his former words. It was the
                    country that had changed. He was still for the Union as the one controlling
                    consideration, with an equal dislike for the abolitionist and the secessionist,
                    who endangered the Union. But the North and the South were already so far apart
                    that not even Webster could stand with one foot in one and the other foot in the
                    other section; and his fate was parallel with that of John Dickinson, who
                    essayed a similar rôle during the revolution. Angered at the spirit with which
                    his speech was received, Webster threw all his influence towards driving through
                    the Whig Convention of 1852 an endorsement of the compromise of 1850 “in all its
                    parts,” including, of course, the Fugitive Slave Act. The result was his own
                    failure to receive the Whig nomination for the presidency, and the downfall of
                    his party. Just before the election he died at his home, Marshfield,
                    Massachusetts, October 1852.</p>
                <p>Webster was twice married—to Grace Fletcher, of New Hampshire, in 1808, and two
                    years after her death to Catherine Bayard le Roy, of New York, in 1829. One of
                    his sons, Edward, lost his life in the Mexican War; his only surviving child,
                    Fletcher Webster, colonel of a Massachusetts regiment, was killed at Bull Run.
                    In marked contrast to Webster’s wonderfully able treatment of public financial
                    affairs, his management of his private finances was notoriously shiftless,—so
                    much so that, in his later years, the care of them was assumed by a voluntary
                    committee of Boston business men. Like other men of his time, he was neither
                    careful nor temperate in table enjoyment. Washington people still tell of the
                    enthusiasm with which, after dinner, he once insisted on standing up in a
                    theatre-box, to join in the chorus of the American national hymn. He was a
                    devoted angler, and intensely interested in scientific agriculture; much of his
