                    disputes with Baden-Baden the title to be considered the most frequented and
                    most fashionable watering-place in Germany. It is situated in a small and

                    Mainz and 3 miles from the Rhine (see the subjoined plan). The town is neat and
                    well-built, with broad and regular streets. Its prosperity is entirely owing to
                    its hot springs; and the general character and appearance of the place, with its
                    numerous hotels, lodging-houses, villas, bath-houses, promenades, and places of
                    entertainment, are dictated by the requirements of the visitors, who number
                    annually about 60,000. The principal buildings are the palace, built in 1837-42
                    and restored in 1882; the Cursaal, a large and <pb break="no"

                    educational institutions, including a well-known chemical laboratory. The
                    thermal springs contain only ⅜ per cent, of salt, and very little carbonic acid;
                    and a good deal of their efficacy is due to their high temperature, which varies
                    from 156° to 142° Fahr.</p>
                <p>The water is generally cooled to 93° Fahr, for bathing. The principal spring is
                    the Kochbrunnen (156° Fahr.), the water of which is drunk by sufferers from
                    gout, chronic dyspepsia, obesity, &amp;c. There are twenty-eight other springs
                    used for bathing, and efficacious in cases of rheumatism, gout, scrofula, and
                    nervous ailments.</p>
                <p>The town lies 320 feet above the sealevel. Its climate is mild and warm, so that
                    even in winter it is fre quented by from 5000 to 6000 visiters. The population
                    in 1885 was 55,457; in 1816 it was 4608; in 1867, 30,085.</p>
                <p>Wiesbaden is one of the oldest watering-places in Germany, and may be regarded as
                    the capital of the Taunus spas. The springs, mentioned by Pliny as <hi
                    rend="italic">Fontes</hi><hi rend="italic">Mattiaci,</hi> were known to the
                    Romans, who appear to have fortified the place. Under the Caro1ingian monarchs
                    it was the site of a palace. Otho I. made it a town. The name Wisibada appears
                    in 830. Though the springs never passed out of knowledge, they did not attain
                    their greatest repute until the close of the 18th century. From 1771 till 1873
                    Wiesbaden was a notorious gambling resort; but in the latter year public
                    gambling was suppressed by the Prussian Government.</p>
