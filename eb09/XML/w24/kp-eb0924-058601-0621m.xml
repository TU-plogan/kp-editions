                    a knowledge of the native language. After staying there for a short time, he
                    finally settled at Raiatea, which became his permanent headquarters. His success
                    as a missionary here and elsewhere was remarkable. The people rapidly became
                    Christianized and adopted many of the habits of civilization. Williams was
                    fairly liberal for his age, and the results of his labours among the Pacific
                    Islands were essentially beneficial. He travelled unceasingly among the various
                    island groups, planting stations and settling native missionaries whom he
                    himself had trained. From the Society Islands he visited the Hervey group, where
                    he discovered, and stayed for a considerable time on, the island of Rarotonga.
                    Most of the inhabitants of the group were converted in a remarkably short time,
                    and Williams’s influence over them, as over the people of other groups, was very
                    great. Besides establishing Christianity and civilization among them, he also,
                    at their own request, helped them to draw up a code of laws for civil
                    administration upon the basis of the new religion. While at Rarotonga he, with
                    the help of the natives, built himself a ship, within about four months; with
                    this he returned to Raiatea, and made voyages among other island groups,
                    including Samoa and the neighbouring islands. Williams returned to England in
                    1834 (having previously visited New South Wales in 1821); and during his four
                    years’ stay at home he had the New Testam 3nt, which he had translated into
                    Rarotongan, printed. Returning in 1838 to the Pacific, he visited the stations
                    already established by him, as well as several fresh groups. He went as far west
                    as the New Hebrides, and, while visiting Erromango, one of the group, for the
                    first time, was murdered by the natives, 20th November 1839.</p>
                <p>Williams was probably on the whole one of the most successful of Christian
                    missionaries, both as regards the extent and the permanence of the work he
                    accomplislιed. His <hi rend="italic">Narrative of Missionary Enterprises in the
                    South Sea Islands</hi> was published in 1837, and formed an important
                    contribution to our knowledge of the islands with which Williams was acquainted.
