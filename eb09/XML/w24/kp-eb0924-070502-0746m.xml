                    of the comedy of repartee, was born about 1640 at Clive, near Shrewsbury, where
                    for several generations his family had been settled on a moderate estate of

                    whither, at the age of fifteen, he was sent to be educated in the very heart of
                    the “precious” circle who disported on the banks of the Charente. Wycherley’s
                    friend, Major Pack, tells us that his hero “improved, with the greatest
                    refinements,” the “extraordinary talents” for which he was “obliged to nature.”
                    Although the harmless affectations of the Rambouillets and Montausiers, among
                    whom he was thrown, are certainly not chargeable with the “refinements” of
                    Wycherley’s comedies—comedies which caused even his great admirer Voltaire to
                    say afterwards of them, “Il semble que les Anglais prennent trop de liberté et
                    que les Françaises n’en prennent pas assez ”— these same affectations seem to
                    have been much more potent in regard to the “refinements” of Wycherley’s
                    religion.</p>
                <p>Wycherley, though a man of far more intellectual power than is generally
                    supposed, was a fine gentleman first, a responsible being afterwards. Hence
                    under the manipulations of the heroine of the “Garland” he turned from the
                    Protestantism of his fathers to Romanism—turned at once, and with the same easy
                    alacrity as afterwards, at Oxford, he turned back to Protestantism under the
                    manipulations of such an accomplished master in the art of turning as Bishop
                    Barlow. And if, as Macaulay hints, Wycherley’s turning back to Romanism once
                    more had something to do with the patronage and unwonted liberality of James IL,
                    this merely proves that the deity he worshipped was the deity of the “polite
                    world” of his time—gentility. Moreover, as a professional fine gentleman, at a
                    period when, as the genial Major Pack says, “the amours of Britain would furnish
                    as diverting memoirs, if well related, as those of France published by Rabutin,
                    or those of Nero’s court writ by Petronius,” Wycherley was obliged to be a loose
                    liver. But, for all that, Wycherley’s sobriquet of “Manly Wycherley” seems to
                    have been fairly earned by him, earned by that frank and straightforward way of
                    confronting life which, according to Pope and Swift, characterized also his
                    brilliant successor Vanbrugh.</p>
                <p>That effort of Wycherley’s to bring to Buckingham’s notice the case of Samuel
                    Butler (so shamefully neglected by the court Butler had served) shows that the
                    writer of even such heartless plays as <hi rend="italic">The Country Wife</hi>
                    may be familiar with generous impulses, while his uncompromising lines in
                    defence of Buckingham, when the duke in his turn fell into trouble, show that
                    the inventor of so shameless a fraud as that which forms the pivot of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Plain Dealer</hi> may in actual life possess that passion for
                    fairplay which is believed to be a specially English quality. But among the
                    “ninety-nine” religions with which Voltaire accredited England there is one
                    whose permanency has never been shaken—the worship of gentility. To this
                    Wycherley remained as faithful to the day of his death as Congreve himself. And,
                    if his relations to that “other world beyond this,” which the Puritans had
                    adopted, were liable to change with his environments, it was because that “other
                    world” was really out of fashion altogether.</p>
                <p>Wycherley’s university career seems also to have been influenced by the same
                    causes. Although Puritanism had certainly not contaminated the universities, yet
                    English “quality and politeness” (to use Major Pack’s words) have always, since
                    the great rebellion, been rather ashamed of possessing too much learning. As a
                    fellow-commoner of Queen’s College, Oxford, Wycherley only lived (according to
                    Wood) in the provost’s lodgings, being entered in the public library under the
                    title of “Philosophiae Studiosus” in July 1660. And he does not seem to have
                    matriculated or to have taken a degree.</p>
                <p>Nor when, on quitting Oxford, he entered himself of the Middle Temple, did he
                    give any more attention to the dry study of the law than was proper to one so
                    warmly caressed “by the persons most eminent for their quality or politeness.”
                    Pleasure and the stage were alone open to him, and in 1672 was produced, at the
                    Theatre Royal, <hi rend="italic">Love in a Wood.</hi> With regard to this comedy
                    Wycherley told Pope—told him “over and over” till Pope believed him—believed
                    him, at least, until they quarrelled about Wycherley’s verses—that he wrote it
                    the year before he went to Oxford. But we need not believe him: the worst
                    witness against a man is mostly himself. To pose as the wicked boy of genius has
                    been the foolish ambition of many writers, but on inquiry it will generally be
                    found that these inkhorn Lotharios are not nearly so wicked as they would have
                    us believe. When Wycherley charges himself with having written, as a boy of
                    nineteen, scenes so callous and so depraved that even Barbara Palmer’s appetite
                    for profligacy was, if not satisfied, appeased, there is, we repeat, no need to
                    believe him. Indeed, there is ∙every reason to disbelieve him,—not for the
                    reasons advanced by Macaulay, however, who in challenging Wycherley’s date does
                    not go nearly deep enough. Macaulay points to the allusions in the play to
                    gentlemen’s periwigs, to guineas, to the vests which Charles ordered to be worn
                    at court, to the great fire, &amp;c., as showing that the comedy could not have
                    been written the year before the author went to Oxford. We must remember,
                    however, that even if the play had been written in that year, and delayed in its
                    production <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n747/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0747-0706"/> till 1672, it is exactly this kind of allusion to
                    recent events which any dramatist with an eye to freshness of colour would be
                    certain to weave into his dialogue. It is not that “the whole air and spirit of
                    the piece belong to a period subsequent to that mentioned by Wycherley,” but
                    that “the whole air and spirit of the piece” belong to a man,—an experienced and
                    hardened young man of the world,—and not to a boy who would fain pose as an
                    experienced and hardened young man of the world. The real defence of Wycherley
                    against his foolish impeachment of himself is this, that <hi rend="italic">Love
                    in a Wood,</hi> howsoever inferior in structure and in all the artistic
                    economies to <hi rend="italic">The Country Wife</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Plain Dealer,</hi> contains scenes which no inexperienced boy could have
                    written—scenes which, not for moral hardness merely, but often for real dramatic
                    ripeness, are almost the strongest to be found amongst his four plays. With
                    regard to dramatic ripeness, indeed, if we were asked to indicate the finest
                    touch in all Wycherley, we should very likely select a speech in the third scene
                    of the third act of this very play, where the vain, foolish, and boastful rake
                    Dapperwit, having taken his friend to see his mistress for the express purpose
                    of advertising his lordship over her, is coolly denied by her and insolently
                    repulsed. “I think,”says Dapperwit, “women take inconstancy from me worse than
                    from any man breathing.”</p>
                <p>Now, does the subsequent development of Wycherley’s dramatic genius lead us to
                    believe that, at nineteen, he could have given this touch, worthy of the hand
                    that drew Malvolio? Is there anything in his two masterpieces— <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Country Wife</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Plain Dealer—</hi> that makes it
                    credible that Wycherley, the boy, could have thus delineated by a single quiet
                    touch vanity as a chain-armour which no shaft can pierce—vanity, that is to say,
                    in its perfect development? However, Macaulay (forgetting that, among the myriad
                    vanities of the writing fraternity, this of pretending to an early development
                    of intellectual powers that ought not to be, even if they could be, developed
                    early is at once the most comic and the most common) is rather too severe upon
                    Wycherley’s disingenuousness in regard to the dates of his plays. That the
                    writer of a play far more daring than Etheredge’s <hi rend="italic">She Would if
                    She Could</hi> —and far more brilliant too—should at once become the talk of
                    Charles’s court was inevitable; equally inevitable was it that the author of the
                    song at the end of the first act, in praise of harlots and their offspring,
                    should touch to its depths the soul of the duchess of Cleveland. Possibly
                    Wycherley intended this famous song as a glorification of Her Grace and her
                    profession, for he seems to have been more delighted than surprised when, as he
                    passed in his coach through Pall Mall, he heard the duchess address him from her
                    coach window as a “rascal,” a “villain,” and as a son of the very kind of lady
                    his song had lauded. For his answer was perfect in its readiness: “Madam, you
                    have been pleased to bestow a title on me which belongs only to the fortunate.”
                    Perceiving that Her Grace received the compliment in the spirit in which it was
                    meant, he lost no time in calling upon her, and was from that moment the
                    recipient of those “favours” to which he alludes with pride in the dedication of
                    the play to her. Voltaire’s story (in his <hi rend="italic">Letters on the
                    English Nation)</hi> that Her Grace used to go to Wycherley’s chambers in the
                    Temple disguised as a country wench, in a straw hat, with pattens on and a
                    basket in her hand, may be apocryphal, —very likely it is,—for disguise was
                    quite superfluous in the case of the mistress of Charles II. and Jacob Hall,—
                    but it at least shows how general was the opinion that, under such patronage as
                    this, Wycherley’s fortune as poet and dramatist, “eminent for his quality and
                    politeness,” was now made.</p>
                <p>Charles, who had determined to bring up his son, the duke of Richmond, like a
                    prince, was desirous of securing for tutor a man so entirely qualified as was
                    Wycherley to impart what was then recognized as the princely education, and it
                    seems pretty clear that, but for the accident, to which we shall have to recur,
                    of his meeting the countess of Drogheda at Bath and secretly marrying her, the
                    education of the young man would actually have, been entrusted by his father to
                    Wycherley as a reward for the dramatist’s having written <hi rend="italic">Love
                    in a Wood.</hi></p>
                <p>Whether Wycherley’s experiences as a naval officer, which he alludes to in his
                    lines “On a Sea Fight which the Author was in betwixt the English and the
                    Dutch,” occurred before or after the production of <hi rend="italic">Love in a
                    Wood</hi> is a point upon which opinions differ, but on the whole we are
                    inclined to agree with Macaulay, against Leigh Hunt, that these experiences took
                    place not only after the production of <hi rend="italic">Love in a Wood</hi> but
                    after the production of <hi rend="italic">The Gentleman Dancing Master,</hi> in
                    1673. We also think, with Macaulay, that he went to sea simply because it was
                    the “polite” thing to do so—simply because, as he himself in the epilogue to <hi
                    rend="italic">The Gentleman Dancing Master</hi> says, “all gentlemen must pack
                    to sea.”</p>
                <p>This second comedy is inferior to <hi rend="italic">Love in a Wood,</hi> and for
                    the reasons already discussed in connexion with the works of another dramatist
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Vanbrugh).</hi> In <hi rend="italic">The Relapse,</hi>
                    however, the artistic mistake of blending comedy and farce damages a splendid
                    play, but leaves it a splendid play still. In <hi rend="italic">The Gentleman
                    Dancing Master</hi> this mingling of discordant elements destroys a play that
                    would never under any circumstances have been strong,—a play nevertheless which
                    abounds in animal spirits, and is luminous here and there with true dramatic
                    points.</p>
                <p>It is, however, on his two last comedies— <hi rend="italic">The Country Wife</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">The Plain Dealer—</hi> that must rest Wycherley’s fame as
                    a master of that comedy of repartee which, inaugurated by Etheredge, and
                    afterwards brought to perfection by Congreve and Vanbrugh, supplanted the
                    humoristic comedy of the Elizabethans. <hi rend="italic">The Country Wife,</hi>
                    produced in 1675, is so full of wit, ingenuity, animal spirits, and conventional
                    humour that, had it not been for its motive—a motive which in any healthy state
                    of society must always be as repulsive to the most lax as to the most moral
                    reader—it would probably have survived as long as the acted drama remained a
                    literary form in England. So strong, indeed, is the hand that could draw such a
                    character as Marjory Pinchwife (the undoubted original not only of Congreve’s
                    Miss Prue but of Vanbrugh’s Hoyden), such a character as Sparkish (the undoubted
                    original of Congreve’s Tattle), such a character as Horner (the undoubted
                    original of all those cool impudent rakes with whom our stage has since been
                    familiar), that Wycherley is certainly entitled to a place alongside Congreve
                    and Vanbrugh. And, indeed, if priority of date is to have its fair and full
                    weight, it seems difficult to challenge Prof. Spalding’s dictum that Wycherley
                    is “the most vigorous of the set.”</p>
                <p>In order to do justice to the life and brilliance of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Country Wife</hi> we have only to compare it with <hi rend="italic">The Country
                    Girl,</hi> afterwards made famous by the acting of Mrs Jordan, that Bowdlerized
                    form of <hi rend="italic">The Country Wife</hi> in which Garrick, with an object
                    more praiseworthy than his success, endeavoured to free it of its load of
                    unparalleled licentiousness by disturbing and sweetening the motive,—even as
                    Voltaire afterwards (with an object also more praiseworthy than his success)
                    endeavoured to disturb and sweeten the motive of <hi rend="italic">The Plain
                    Dealer</hi> in <hi rend="italic">La Prude.</hi> While the two Bowdlerized forms
                    of Garrick and Voltaire are as dull as the <hi rend="italic">Aesop</hi> of
                    Boursault, the texture of Wycherley’s scandalous dialogue would seem to
                    scintillate with the changing hues of shot silk or of the neck of a <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n748/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0748-0707"/> pigeon or of a shaken prism, were it not that the
                    many-coloured lights rather suggest the miasmatic radiance of a foul ditch
                    shimmering in the sun. It is easy to share Macaulay’s indignation at Wycherley’s
                    satyr-like defilement of art, and yet, at the same time, to protest against that
                    disparagement of their literary riches which nullifies the value of Macaulay’s
                    criticism. And scarcely inferior to <hi rend="italic">The Country Wife</hi> is
                    <hi rend="italic">The Plain Dealer,</hi> produced in 1677,·— a play of which
                    Voltaire said, “Je ne connais point de comédie chez les anciens ni chez les
                    modems ou il y ait autant d’esprit.” Strong language, no doubt; but Voltaire has
                    prevented it from seeming too strong by turning the play into <hi rend="italic"
                    >La Prude,</hi> and offering us in that a subject for comparison. No one has
                    pointed out the immense influence of this comedy, as regards manipulation of
                    dialogue, upon all our subsequent comedies of repartee, from those of Congreve
                    and Vanbrugh to those of Douglas Jerrold and T. W. Robertson; and, as to
                    characters, he who wants to trace the ancestry of Tony Lumpkin and Mrs
                    Hardcastle has only to turn to Jerry Blackacre and his mother, while Manly (for
                    whom Wycherley’s early patron, the duke of Montausier, sat), though he is
                    perhaps overdone, has dominated this kind of stage character ever since. If but
                    few readers know how constantly the blunt sententious utterances of this
                    character are reappearing, not on the stage alone, but in the novel and even in
                    poetry, it is because a play whose motive is monstrous and intolerable can only
                    live in a monstrous and intolerable state of society; it is because Wycherley’s
                    genius was followed by Nemesis, who always dogs the footsteps of the defiler of
                    literary art. When Burns said—</p>
                <p>“The rank is hut the guinea stamp The man ’s the gowd. for a’ that,”</p>
                <p>when Sterne, in <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy,</hi> said, “Honours, like
                    impressions upon coin, may give an ideal and local value to a bit of base metal,
                    but gold and silver will pass all the world over without any other
                    recommendation than their own weight,” what did these writers do but adopt—
                    adopt without improving—Manly’s fine saying to Freeman, in the first act :—“I
                    weigh the man, not his title; ’tis not the king’s stamp can make the metal
                    better or heavier ”? And yet it is in the fourth and fifth acts that the
                    coruscations of Wycherley’s comic genius are the most dazzling; also, it is
                    there that the licentiousness is the most astonishing. Not that the worst scenes
                    in this play are really more wicked than the worst scenes in Vanbrugh’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Delapse,</hi> but they are more seriously imagined. Being less
                    humorous than Vanbrugh’s scenes, they are more terribly and earnestly realistic;
                    therefore they seem more wicked. They form indeed a striking instance of the
                    folly of the artist who selects a story which cannot be actualized without
                    hurting the finer instincts of human nature. When Menander declared that, having
                    selected his plot, he looked upon his comedy as three parts finished, he touched
                    upon a subject which all workers in drama—all workers in imaginative literature
                    of every kind—would do well to consider. In all literatures—ancient and
                    modern—an infinite wealth of material has been wasted upon subjects that are
                    unworthy, or else incapable, of artistic realization; and yet Wycherley’s case
                    is, in our literature at least, without a parallel. No doubt it may be right to
                    say, with Aristotle, that comedy is an imitation of bad characters, but this
                    does not mean that in comedy art may imitate bad characters as earnestly as she
                    may imitate good ones,—a fact which Thackeray forgot when he made Becky Sharp a
                    murderess, thereby destroying at once what would otherwise have been the finest
                    specimen of the comedy of convention in the world. And perhaps it was because
                    Vanbrugh was conscious of this law of art that he blended comedy with farce.
                    Perhaps he felt that the colossal depravity of intrigue in which the English
                    comedians indulged needs to be not only warmed by a superabundance of humour but
                    softened by the playful mockery of farce before a dramatic circle such as that
                    of the Restoration drama can be really brought within human sympathy. Plutarch’s
                    impeachment of Aristophanes, which affirms that the master of the Old Comedy
                    wrote less for honest men than for men sunk in baseness and debauchery, was no
                    doubt unjust to the Greek poet, one side of whose humour, and one alone, could
                    thus be impeached. But does it not touch all sides of a comedy like
                    Wycherley’s—a Comedy which strikes at the very root of the social compact upon
                    which civilization is built? As to comparing such a Comedy as that of the
                    Restoration with the Comedy of the Elizabethans, Jeremy Collier did but a poor
                    service to the cause he undertook to advocate when he set the occasional
                    coarseness of Shakespeare alongside the wickedness of Congreve and Vanbrugh. And
                    yet, ever since Macaulay’s essay, it has been the fashion to speak of Collier’s
                    attack as being levelled against the immorality of the “Restoration dramatists.”
                    It is nothing of the kind. It is (as was pointed out so long ago as 1699 by Dr
                    Drake in his little-known vigorous reply to Collier) an attack upon the English
                    drama generally, with a special reference to the case of Shakespeare. While
                    dwelling upon that noxious and highly immoral play <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hamlet,</hi> Collier actually leaves unscathed the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Country Wife,</hi> but fastens on Congreve and Vanbrugh, whose
                    plays—profligate enough in all conscience—seem almost decent beside a comedy
                    whose incredible <hi rend="italic">vis matrix</hi> is “the modish
                    distemper.”</p>
                <p>That a stage, indeed, upon which was given with applause <hi rend="italic">A
                    Woman Killed with Kindness</hi> (where a wife dies of a broken heart for doing
                    what any one of Wycherley’s married women would have gloried in doing) should,
                    in seventy years, have given with applause <hi rend="italic">The Country
                    Wife</hi> shows that in historic and social evolution, as in the evolution of
                    organisms, “change” and “progress” are very far from being convertible terms.
                    For the barbarism of the society depicted in these plays was, in the true sense
                    of the word, far deeper and more brutal than any barbarism that has ever existed
                    in these islands within the historic period. If civilization has any meaning at
                    all for the soul of man, the Englishmen of Chaucer’s time, the Anglo-Saxons of
                    the Heptarchy, nay, those half-naked heroes, who in the dawn of English history
                    clustered along the southern coast to defend it from the invasion of Caesar,
                    were far more civilized than that “race gangrenée ”—the treacherous rakes,
                    mercenary slaves, and brazen strumpets of the court of Charles IL, who did their
                    best to substitute for the human passion of love (a passion which was known
                    perhaps even to palaeolithic man) the promiscuous intercourse of the beasts of
                    the field. Yet Collier leaves Wycherley unassailed, and classes Vanbrugh and
                    Congreve with Shakespeare!</p>
                <p>It was after the success of <hi rend="italic">The Plain Dealer</hi> that the
                    turning-point came in wycherley’s career. The great dream of all the men about
                    town in Charles’s time, as Wycherley’s plays all show, was to marry a widow,
                    young and handsome, a peer’s daughter if possible,—but in any event rich, and
                    spend her money upon wine and women. While talking to a friend in a bookseller’s
                    shop at Tunbridge, Wycherley heard <hi rend="italic">The Plain Dealer</hi> asked
                    for by a lady who, in the person of the countess of Drogheda, answered all the
                    requirements. An introduction ensued, then love-making, then marriage—a secret
                    marriage, for, fearing to lose the king’s patronage and the income therefrom,
                    Wycherley still thought it politic to pass as a bachelor. He had not seen enough
                    of life to learn that in the long run nothing is politic but
                    “straightforwardness.” Whether because his countenance wore a nensive and
                    subdued<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n749/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0749-0708"/> expression, suggestive of a poet who had married
                    a dowager countess and awakened to the situation, or whether because treacherous
                    confidants divulged his secret, does not appear, but the news of his marriage
                    oozed out, —it reached the royal ears, and deeply wounded the father anxious
                    about the education of his son. Wycherley lost the appointment that was so
                    nearly within his grasp, —lost indeed the royal favour for ever. He never had an
                    opportunity of regaining it, for the countess seems to have really loved him,
                    and <hi rend="italic">Love in a Wood</hi> had proclaimed the writer to be the
                    kind of husband whose virtue prospers best when closely guarded at the domestic
                    hearth. Wherever he went the countess followed him, and when she did allow him
                    to meet his boon companions it was in a tavern in Bow Street opposite to his own
                    house, and even there under certain protective conditions. In summer or in
                    winter he was obliged to sit with the window open and the blinds up, so that his
                    wife might see that the party included no member of a sex for which her
                    husband’s plays had advertised his partiality. She died at last, however, and
                    left him the whole of her fortune. But the title to the property was disputed;
                    the costs of the litigation were heavy—so heavy that his father was unable (or
                    else he was unwilling) to come to his aid; and the result of his marrying the
                    rich, beautiful, and titled widow was that the poet was thrown into the Fleet
                    prison. There he languished for seven years, being finally released by the
                    liberality of James IL,—a liberality which, incredible as it seems, is too well
                    authenticated to be challenged. James had been so much gratified by seeing <hi
                    rend="italic">The Plain Dealer</hi> acted that, finding a parallel between
                    Manly’s “manliness” and his own, such as no spectator had before discovered, he
                    paid off Wycherley’s execution creditor. Other debts still troubled Wycherley,
                    however, and he never was released from his embarrassments, not even after
                    succeeding to a life estate in the family property. In coming to Wycherley’s
                    death, we come to the worst allegation that has ever been made against him as a
                    man and as a gentleman. At the age of seventy-five he married a young girl, and
                    is said to have done so in order to spite his nephew, the next in succession,
                    knowing that he himself must shortly die and that the jointure would impoverish
                    the estate. No doubt it is true enough that he did marry the girl and did die
                    eleven days afterwards; but, if we consider that the lady he married was young
                    and an heiress (or was supposed to be an heiress), and if we further consider
                    how difficult it was for an old gallant of Wycherley’s extraordinary personal
                    vanity to realize his true physical condition, we may well suppose that, even if
                    he talked about “marrying to spite his nephew,” he did so as a cloak for other
                    impulses, such as senile desire or senile cupidity, or a blending of these
                    impulses.</p>
                <p>Wycherley wrote verses, and, when quite an old man, prepared them for the press
                    by the aid of Alexander Pope, then not much more than a boy. But,
                    notwithstanding all Pope’s tinkering, they remain contemptible. He died in
                    December 1715, and was buried in the vault of the church in Covent Garden. (τ.
