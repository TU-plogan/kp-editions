                    the province of Saxony, Prussia, is situated 55 miles to the south-west of
                    Berlin, on the Elbe, which is here spanned by a stone bridge 300 yards long, and
                    by an iron railway bridge 320 yards long. The three suburbs which adjoin the
                    town are not older than 1817. Wittenberg is interesting chiefly on account of
                    its close connexion with Luther and the dawn of the Reformation; and several of
                    its buildings are associated with the events of that time. Part of the
                    Augustinian monastery in which Luther dwelt, at first as a monk and in later
                    life as owner with his wife and family, is still preserved, and has been fitted
                    up as a “Luther museum.” The Augusteum, built in 1564-83 on the site of the
                    monastery, is now a clerical seminary. The Schlosskirche, to the doors of which
                    Luther nailed his famous ninety-five, theses in 1517, dated originally from
                    1490-99; it was, however, seriously damaged by fire during the bombardment of
                    1760, and has practically been re-built. The old wooden doors, burnt in 1760,
                    are replaced by bronze doors, bearing the Latin text of the theses. In the
                    interior of the church are the tombs of Luther, Melanchthon, and the electors
                    Frederick the Wise and John the Constant. The parish church, in which Luther
                    often preached, was built in the 14th century, but has been much altered since
                    Luther’s time. The present infantry barracks were at one time occupied by the
                    university of Wittenberg, founded in 1502, but incorporated with the university
                    of Halle in 1817. Luther was appointed professor of philosophy here in 1508; and
                    the new university rapidly acquired a considerable reputation from its connexion
                    with the early Reformers. Shakespeare makes Hamlet and Horatio study at
                    Wittenberg. The ancient electoral palace is another of the buildings that
                    suffered severely in 1760; it now contains archives. Melanchthon’s house and the
                    house of Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472-1553), who was burgomaster of Wittenberg,
                    are also pointed out. Statues of Luther and Melanchthon embellish the town. The
                    spot, outside the Elster Gate, where Luther publicly burned the papal bull in
                    1520 is marked by an oak tree. Woollen and linen-weaving, stocking-making,
                    leather-working, distilling, and brewing are carried on in Wittenberg. The
                    formerly considerable manufacture of the heavier kinds of cloth has died out.
                    The population in 1885 was 13,856; in 1816 it was 6206.</p>
                <p>Wittenberg is mentioned as early as 1180. It was the capital of the little duchy
                    of Saxe-Wittenberg (vol. xxi. p. 352), the rulers of which afterwards became
                    electors of Saxony; and it continued to be the chief town of Saxony under the
                    Ernestine electors. The capitulation of Wittenberg (1547) is the name given to
                    the treaty by which John Frederick the Magnanimous was compelled to resign the
                    electoral dignity and most of his territory to the Albertine branch of the Saxon
                    family. In 1760 the town was bombarded by the Austrians. In 1813 it was
                    refortified by command of Napoleon; but in 1814 it was stormed by the Prussians
                    under Tauentzien, who received the title of “Von Wittenberg” as a reward.
                    Wittenberg continued to be a fortress of the third class until the
                    reorganization of the German defences after the foundation of the new empire in
                    1871 led to its being dismantled.</p>
