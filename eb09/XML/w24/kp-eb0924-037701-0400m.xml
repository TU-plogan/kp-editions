                <p><label type="entry">WART</label> is a papillary excrescence of the surface, most
                    commonly of the skin, but in special circumstances also of the transitional and
                    mucous membranes. The ordinary broad and flat warts of the skin occur mostly
                    upon the hands of children and young persons; a long pendulous variety occurs
                    about the chin or neck of children who are constitutionally delicate (it used to
                    be thought a mark of scrofula) and on the scalp in adults. Both the broad
                    sessile warts of the fingers or hands and the thin hanging warts of the neck and
                    head are apt to come out in numbers at a time; a crop of them suddenly appears,
                    to disappear after a time with equal suddenness. Hence the supposed efficacy of
                    charms. A single wart will sometimes remain when the general eruption has
                    vanished. The liability to crops of warts runs in families. In after life a wart
                    on the hands or fingers is usually brought on by some irritation, often
                    repeated, even if it be slight. A special form has been observed on the hands of
                    those much occupied with anatomical dissection. Chimney-sweeps and workers in
                    coal-tar, petroleum, &amp;c., are subject to warts, which often become
                    cancerous. Ordinary innocent warts occur singly in later life on the nose or
                    lips or other parts of the face, sometimes on the tongue. Towards old age there
                    are apt to be broad and flattened patches of warts on the back, of a greasy
                    consistence and brownish colour.</p>
                <p>A wart consists essentially of a framework or groundplan of small blood-vessels
                    supported by bands of fibrous tissue, and a more or less thick covering of
                    epidermic scales. When the wart is young, the surface is a rounded and even
                    knob; as it gets rubbed and worn the surface appears cleft into thread-like
                    projecting points. The blood-vessels, whose outgrowth from the surface really
                    makes the wart, may either be in a cluster of parallel loops, in which case we
                    have the common broad and sessile wart, or the vessels may branch from a single
                    stem, making the dendriform pattern of the long, slim, and pendulous warts of
                    the chin and neck. The same two kinds of pattern occur also in warts of the
                    transitional or mucous surfaces. (For a figure of a dendriform wart, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pathology,</hi> vol. xviii. fig. 43, p. 379.) A wart of either
                    pattern is a projection of the system of cutaneous bloodvessels beyond the
                    surface. It is owing to its vascular ground-plan that a wart is liable to come
                    back after being shaved off; the vessel or vessels are cut down to the level of
                    the skin, but the current of blood is still forced into the stem, and the
                    branches tend to be thrown out beyond the surface as before. This fact has a
                    bearing on the treatment of warts. If they are shaved or snipped off, the
                    blood-vessels of the stem should be destroyed at the same time by caustic, or
                    made to shrivel by an astringent. The same end is served by a gradually
                    tightening ligature (such as a thread of elastic pulled out from an old brace)
                    round the base or neck of the wart; an ordinary thread is apt to cut too deep
                    and may cause suppuration. The best treatment is to rub an astringent, or acid,
                    or caustic substance into the surface of the wart. Glacial acetic acid may be
                    applied on the end of a glass rod, or by a camel-hair brush, care being taken
                    not to touch the adjoining skin. A solution of perchloride of iron is also
                    effective in the same way. Nitrate of silver is objectionable, owing to the
                    black stains left by it. A simple domestic remedy, often effectual, is the
                    astringent and acrid juice of the common stonecrop (<hi rend="italic">Sedum
                    acre)</hi> rubbed into the wart, time after time, from the freshly gathered
                    herb. The result of these various applications is that the wart loses its turgor
                    or firmness, shrivels up, and eventually falls off.</p>
                <p>A peculiar form of wart, known as <hi rend="italic">verrugas,</hi> occurs
                    endemically in certain valleys of the Peruvian Andes, especially in the region
                    of the Cerro de Pasco. It is believed to have been one of the causes of the
                    excessive mortality from haemorrhages of the skin among the troops of Pizarro.
                    In recent times attention was called to it by Dr Archibald Smith in 1842; in
                    1874, during the making of the Trans-Andean Railway, it caused a considerable
                    loss of life among English navvies and engineers. Strangers of the white race
                    suffer much more severely from it than the acclimatized or the natives. It is
                    sometimes epidemic and peculiarly fatal. Its endemic seats are certain deep and
                    narrow valleys traversed by a mountain stream or torrent and covered with
                    luxuriant vegetation; where the valley widens the endemic influence is no longer
                    felt. The warts may be few or many, up to several hundreds; they occur on
                    internal mucous membranes as well as on the skin. Their outbreak is preceded for
                    some weeks by a feverish state and by pains in the limbs. These symptoms
                    disappear when the warts come out; they are at first reddish spots about the
                    size of a pea, but grow to be rounded or conical excrescences as large as a
                    raspberry or filbert, or pigeon’s egg; after a time the surface becomes ragged
                    or fissured (as in an ordinary wart), especially when rubbed or chafed, and
                    blood begins to ooze, which may amount to considerable haemorrhage. Death (in
                    about 10 per cent. of cases) is due to loss of blood, or to the protracted
                    ulceration following the fall of the warts. The disease lasts usually several
                    months; but a feeble state of the system may remain long after the warts are all
                    gone. The excrescences (besides those of the internal membranes) occur in the
                    favourite situations of common warts—the fingers and back of the hand (also the
                    toes and back of the foot), the face and neck, and among the hair of the
                    head.</p>
