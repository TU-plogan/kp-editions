                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Johann Georg Walch</hi> (1693-1775) was born at
                    Meiningen, and studied at Leipsic and Jena under Olearius and Buddaeus. From
                    1716 he was professor at Jena of philosophy, rhetoric, and poetry successively,
                    and afterwards (from 1724) of theology. He married the only daughter of
                    Buddaeus, and in his learned and theological career followed in the footsteps of
                    his father-in-law. His theological position was that of a very moderate
                    orthodoxy, which had been influenced greatly by the philosophy and controversies
                    of the Deistic period. His university lectures and published works ranged over
                    the wide fields of ecclesiastical history in its various branches, particularly
                    the literature and the controversies of the church, dogmatics, ethics, and
                    pastoral theology.</p>

                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Christian Wilhelm Franz Walch</hi> (1726-1784), younger
                    brother of J. E. I. Walch, was born at Jena December 25, 1726. He was educated
                    at Jena under his father’s direction, and as early as 1745-1747 lectured in the
                    university in branches of exegesis, philosophy, and history. He then travelled
                    with his brother J. E. I. Walch for a year through the Continent, making the
                    acquaintance of the learned men of each country. On his return he was made
                    professor of theology in Jena, but in 1753 he accepted an invitation to
                    Göttingen, where he spent his life as professor of theology. He lectured on
                    dogmatics, church history, ethics, polemics, natural theology, symbolics, the
                    epistles of Paul, Christian antiquities, historical theological literature,
                    ecclesiastical law, and the fathers. His permanent place amongst learned
                    theologians rests on his works on ecclesiastical history. He here holds the
                    third place in the important trio Semler, Mosheim, Walch. Semler was much his
                    superior in originality and boldness, and Mosheim in clearness, method, and
                    elegance. But to his wide, deep, and accurate learning, to his conscientious and
                    impartial examination of the facts and the authorities at first hand, and to his
                    exact quotation of the sources and works illustrating them and careful
                    discussion of the most minute details” all succeeding historians are deeply
                    indebted. His method is critical and pragmatic, “pursuing everywhere the exact
                    facts and the supposed causes of the outward changes of history,” leaving wholly
                    out of sight the deeper moving principles and ideas which influence its course.
                    He speaks of history as consisting of “the accidental changes of accidental
                    matters.” But, although he thus failed to reach the modern standard of an
                    historian, the results of his industry and research remain as permanent
                    historical materials.</p>
                <p>His principal work was his <hi rend="italic">Entwurf einer vollständigen Historie
                    der Ketzereien, Spaltungen, und Religionsstreitigkeiten, bis auf die
                    Reformation,</hi> ll vols., Leipsic, 1762-85. It was a great advance in
                    theological liberality that he defined a heretic on the one hand as a Christian
                    and on the other as one in fundamental error. He thus claimed for the heretic a
                    place in the church, while he declined to treat as heretical such differences as
                    divided great sections of Christians. Of his other valuable works may be
                    mentioned <hi rend="italic">Entwurf einer vollständigen Historie der Römischen

                    elaborate reply just before his death.</p>

                    was for a time professor in the Kloster gymnasium of Berlin and afterwards in
