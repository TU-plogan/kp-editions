                    States of the American Union, lying between 37° 6' and 40° 38' N. lat., is
                    bounded on the N. by Pennsylvania and Maryland, on the E. and S. by Virginia,
                    and on the W. by Kentucky and Ohio, and has an area of 24,780 square miles.</p>
                <p>The form of the State is extremely irregular. It may be roughly likened to an
                    ellipse, the greatest diameter of which lies nearly north-east and south-west.
                    Its boundary upon the east and south is made up of the irregular line which
                    limited the counties which were set off from Virginia for the formation of this
                    State. Upon the west the boundary is low-water upon the further shore of the Big
                    Sandy and Ohio rivers. A long narrow strip, known as the “Panhandle,” projects
                    northward some sixty miles along the Ohio,—the boundary being the continuation
                    of the straight line which separates Ohio and Pennsylvania. To the east of this
                    the northern boundary follows Mason and Dixon’s line; then, dropping in a due
                    south direction to the “Fairfax Stone,” it follows thence easterly the course of
                    the Potomac to its junction with the Shenandoah.</p>
                <p>The entire State is mountainous or hilly, being comprised within the region known
                    as the Cumberland or Alleghany plateau. The highest land in the State is upon
                    the eastern and southern boundary, where the plateau in many places reaches
                    elevations exceeding 4000 feet. Thence the country has a general slope to the
                    north-west, and is lowest along the Ohio, where the elevation is but 600 to 800
                    feet. This plateau has been subjected to stream erosion until it has become a
                    network of narrow crooked ridges with deep gorges or narrow valleys. The height
                    of the ridges and the depth of the valleys, together with the ruggedness of the
                    country, diminish towards the north-west, until near the Ohio the hills become
                    rounded and softened in outline, and the valleys are broad and fertile.</p>

                <p>The drainage system of the State is in some respects peculiar. Although the
                    general slope is towards the north-west, the Potomac, which flows south-easterly
                    to the Atlantic Ocean, has cut its way far back into the plateau, and drains, by
                    means of numerous long branches, the north-eastern quarter of the State. The
                    remainder of the State is drained to the Ohio by means of several large branches
                    which flow in a general north-westerly direction. Heading in the south-west is
                    the Big Sandy, forming a portion of the State boundary. Fourteen miles above its
                    mouth enters the Guyandotte, and 50 miles above the Guyandotte comes the Great
                    Kanawha, one of the principal branches of the Ohio. This large and powerful
                    stream has cut its way back beyond the crest-line of the plateau, tapping
                    numerous streams in south-west Virginia and western North Carolina, so that its
                    sources are now against the Blue Ridge in the latter State. It is known in North
                    Carolina and Virginia, and in West Virginia to the Great Falls, by the name of
                    New River. In West Virginia it has numerous large tributaries—the Big and Little
                    Coal rivers, Piney, and Bluestone from the south, and the Pocotaligo, Elk,
                    Gauley, and Greenbrier from the north. The next branch of the Ohio, proceeding
                    northward, is the Little Kanawha, which empties into the Ohio at Parkersburg.
                    The north-western part of the State is drained by the Monongahela, one of the
                    two head branches of the Ohio, and its tributaries, the principal of which are
                    the Tygart’s Valley, Cheat, and Buckhannon rivers. Of these streams the Ohio is
                    navigable for river steamers at nearly all stages of water. The same may be said
                    of the Kanawha to a point near the Kanawha Falls, while the Big Sandy, the
                    Guyandotte, and the Monongahela are navigable for flat boats for long distances,
                    and these, as well as numerous other streams, are largely used for the floating
                    of lumber. All the streams of the State, and especially the smaller ones, have a
                    rapid fall, but their enormous water-power has as yet been utilized only to a
                    trifling extent.</p>
                <p>The climate is nowhere severe, although, owing to the range in elevation within
                    the State, there is a considerable range in temperature. The mean annual
                    temperature ranges from 54° to 55° F., being highest in the neighbourhood of the
                    Ohio, in the western part of the State, and lowest upon the high mountains in
                    the eastern and north-eastern portion. The maximum is rarely above 95° in any
                    portion of the State, while the minimum occasionally reaches 10° in the more
                    mountainous section. The rainfall may be given broadly at between 40 and 50
                    inches annually. It also varies with the elevation, being less in the lower
                    portions and greatest upon the high mountains.</p>
                <p>The fauna of the State is that common to the whole southern Appalachian region.
                    Much of the area being as yet in a state of nature, deer of the white-tailed
                    species are still abundant, and black bear are not unfrequently met with in the
                    more rugged and remote portions. Wild turkeys are still found in some
                    localities, and the mountains have long been a popular resort for hunters, while
                    the streams, abounding in trout, afford an equally attractive field for the
                    angler.</p>
                <p>The timber resources of the State are enormous, and a small proportion of its
                    area, amounting to only about 25 per cent., has been cleared. The remainder is
                    covered with virgin forest. This consists mainly of broad-leafed trees of the
                    most valuable sorts for lumber, such as chestnut, black walnut, cherry, ash,
                    poplar, hickory, locust, maple, oak, &amp;c. Considerable areas of white pine
                    are found in the highest portions of the plateau, being practically the only
                    original forests of this wood left in the United States. Besides these there are
                    considerable quantities of yellow pine, hemlock, spruce, and cedar scattered
                    through the State.</p>
                <p>Viewed broadly, the geological structure of West Virginia is extremely simple.
                    Practically the entire State is overlaid by nearly horizontal beds of the
                    Carboniferous formation. The coal of West Virginia forms its principal mineral
                    wealth. It is estimated that of its entire area not less than 16,000 square
                    miles are underlaid by workable beds of coal. The <hi rend="italic">Report</hi>
                    of the United States Geological Survey upon mineral resources defines the
                    general boundaries of the coal fields of the State as follows :—“The eastern
                    boundary begins at the south on the mountain range just east of the Bluestone
                    River, and proceeds east to Little Sewell Mountain;..... thence with the common
                    boundary of Nicholas and Greenbrier and of Webster and Pocahontas counties to
                    Rich Mountain in Randolph county; following this last-named ridge to Laurel
                    Mountain, the dividing line between Upshur county on the west and Randolph and
                    Barbour counties on the east, and thence with the Briery Mountain into Preston
                    county, and so on to the Pennsylvania State line.” All the area to the west of
                    this line is underlain by coal. To the east of it there are small outlying
                    patches, as in Greenbrier, Meadow Mountain, and possibly in Pocahontas, Tucker,
                    Grant, and Mineral counties, but these are unimportant as compared with the vast
                    areas in the west. In the gorge of every large stream flowing through this area
                    are seen outcropping beds of coal, easily accessible to the miner, and requiring
                    only facilities of transportation to render the mineral of commercial value. In
                    the matter of coal production the State is rapidly acquiring prominence. From a
                    production in 1873 of 600,000 tons, it reached in 1886 a production of over
                    4,000,000 tons, being exceeded by only four of the States, viz., Pennsylvania,
                    Illinois, Ohio, and Iowa. The production is limited only by the demand, as the
                    supply is almost inexhaustible. The coals of the State are of every variety
                    except anthracite, and are noted for their purity for coking, steam, and gas
                    purposes and for domestic fuel.</p>
                <p>Iron ore is abundant in various portions of the State, but is worked only to a
                    comparatively limited extent.</p>
                <p>Salt springs are found in the valley of the Kanawha and in that of the Ohio, and
                    there are extensive evaporating works in both these localities. The production,
                    however, has been retarded by the competition of those in Michigan, owing to the
                    greater cheapness of fuel and better facilities for transportation in the latter
                    locality. The production of salt in West Virginia in 1886 amounted to 250,000
                    barrels. West Virginia contains numerous valuable mineral springs, among the
                    best known of which are the Greenbrier White Sulphur springs in Greenbrier
                    county, Capon springs in Hampshire county, Irondale springs in Preston county,
                    and Red Sulphur springs and Salt Sulphur springs both in Monroe county. These
                    are well-known and popular summer resorts in the mountains, and the waters from
                    them are shipped to all parts of the United States.</p>
                <p>While the entire State may be said to be either mountainous or hilly, it contains
                    a large extent of arable land. Nearly all of the lower hill country can be
                    cultivated, while in the mountainous region there are numerous broad valleys of
                    excellent soil, and everywhere the hill and mountain sides can be cultivated if
                    the slope is not excessively steep. The tenth census (1880) reported an area of
                    10,193,779 acres of land in farms, of which 3,792,327 acres, or about one-fourth
                    the area of the State, was improved land, this being mainly in the lower and
                    less mountainous portion. The average size of farms was 163 acres, showing as
                    compared with the average 10 years earlier, viz., 214 acres, a decided decrease.
                    The value of farms and farming implements was very nearly §136,000,000. The
                    numbers of live stock upon farms, as distinguished from animals owned for
                    business purposes in cities, consisted in January 1888 of 138,231 horses, 6475
                    mules, 474,933 sheep, 432,778 hogs, 171,273 milch cows, and 780,892 other
                    cattle,—showing that the live-stock interests of the State are very large. The
                    estimated value of all farm products sold, consumed, or on hand, as returned in
                    1880, was §19,360,049. The principal agricultural products are wheat, Indian
                    corn, hay, tobacco, oats, and garden vegetables. The cereal products for 1887
                    consisted of 12,516,000 bushels of corn, 2,840,000 of wheat, and 2,531,000 of
                    oats.</p>
                <p>The manufactures, which are not extensive, are concentrated mainly at Wheeling,
                    the largest city, on the Ohio, in the northern part of the State; they consist
                    mainly of manufactures of iron and steel, glass, flouring and grist mill
                    products, lumber, and leather. There were in 1880 2375 manufacturing
                    establishments, employing a capital of §13,883,390 and 14,351 persons. The value
                    of manufactured products was §22,867,126.</p>
                <p>There are 1200 miles of completed railroads, with several branches and one trunk
                    line in process of construction. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad traverses the
                    State from Parkersburg and Bellaire on the Ohio, the two branches meeting at
                    Grafton, and running thence eastward to Washington, Baltimore, and New York. The
                    Newport News and Mississippi Valley Railroad runs across the State from the
                    mouth of the Big Sandy on the west to the Alleghanies near White Sulphur
                    springs, and thence extends to Richmond and Newport News. The Ohio River line
                    runs from Wheeling to Huntington on the Ohio. The West Virginia Central extends
                    from Piedmont on the Baltimore and Ohio line to a point in Randolph county, and
                    is now in process of construction south-westward to intersect the Newport News
                    and Mississippi Valley line. The Clarksburg and Weston, intersecting the
                    Baltimore and Ohio at Clarksburg, extends to Weston in Lewis county, and this
                    has two branches, one to Glenville in Gilmer county, and the other to Buckhannon
                    in Upshur county. The Grafton and Greenbrier Railroad, intersecting the
                    Baltimore and Ohio at Grafton, extends up the Valley river to Belington in
                    Barbour county. The Norfolk and Western Railroad, one of the main trunk lines of
                    the Atlantic States, has a part of its lines in the southern portion of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n554/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0554-0519"/> West Virginia. Railway construction is
                    exceedingly active in all parts of the State, several new lines and numerous
                    branches of existing lines being under construction and in contemplation.</p>
                <p>The State early in its history (December I8ô3) adopted a liberal system of free
                    schools. The plan is known as the township or district system,—the magisterial
                    district or subdivison of each county being taken as the unit for taxation, and
                    the general control of all the school interests of the district being placed in
                    the hands of a district board of education elected by the people, and authorized
                    among other duties to levy taxes, to determine the number of months of school
                    and the number of sub-districts, to plant and build schoolhouses, and to manage
                    the financial and other school interests of the districts. There is likewise in
                    each county a superintendent, and in the State a general superintendent. This
                    system has since been maintained and strengthened by legislative enactment till
                    from 133 schoolhouses and 431 public schools of all grades in 1865 there were in
                    1887 4587 schoolhouses in the State. In 1865 the amount expended in support of
                    free schools was $7722; this gradually increased till in 1887 the amount was
                    $1,087,674. The number of teachers employed by public appropriation was 387 in
                    1865; in 1887 it was 5106. The estimated value of schoolhouses in the State,
                    140,000 in 1865, was 2,000,000 in 1887. Thσ average attendance in 1865 was 44
                    days; in 1887 it was 108. The school system of the State is made permanent by
                    the constitutional enactment referred to, which requires that the legislature
                    shall provide by general law for a thorough and efficient system of free
                    schools. The general school system involves the education of teachers, and with
                    this object from 1867 to 1872 the legislature provided for the establishment of
                    six normal schools, which are in successful operation. In these schools tuition
                    is free to all who desire to prepare themselves for teaching. They are popular
                    among the people, and have done much to elevate the general standard of
                    education. They prescribe courses of three years; nearly all of them have
                    preparatory courses; four of them give collegiate training, and in all of them
                    the study of ancient and modern languages is optional. The school system
                    involves also what is known as the irreducible school fund. The principal, which
                    now amounts to $600,000, is permanently invested. This fund is constantly
                    augmented from sources provided by law and by voluntary contributions.</p>
                <p>The United States Government has erected public buildings for its judicial,
                    postal, and revenue departments within the State at Wheeling, Clarksburg,
                    Parkersburg, and Charleston, the capital of the State. While <hi

                    temporarily the capital, a building was erected by its citizens for the uses of
                    the State, which is now used for city purposes. The six normal schools already
                    referred to have suitable buildings at Fairmont, Glenville, Huntington, Concord,
                    Shepherdstown, and West Liberty. The hospital for the insane at Weston in Lewis

                    a deaf-mute and blind asylum at Romney in Hampshire county, a penitentiary at
                    Moundsville in Marshall county, and a university supported by the State at
                    Morgantown in Monongalia county may be mentioned among the other public
                    institutions of West Virginia.</p>
                <p>The assessed valuation of real estate in 1887 amounted to $118,753,342, and that
                    of personal property to $43,710,175; that of railroad property in 1880 was
                    $4,497,030. andin 1887 $22,797,984. The State tax is 30 cents on each hundred
                    dollars of valuation.</p>
                <p>An amendment to the constitution is now pending, by which it is proposed to
                    prohibit the sale or manufacture of intoxicating liquors. At present the laws of
                    the State—and they have been enforced with more or less of modification almost
                    since its foundation —involve the high licence system. The granting of the
                    licence is based in all cases on good character, and is subject to the
                    discretion of the county commissioners. Under the operation of these laws, and
                    by virtue of local sentiment in its enforcement, no licence has been granted
                    (and hence in effect the traffic has been prohibited) in as many as 38 of the 54
                    counties. The licence is subject to a tax fixed by the State law, and where
                    sales are to be made in incorporated villages it is subject to an additional
                    tax, which is fixed by the authorities of the incorporation.</p>
                <p>In 1880 the population of the State was 618,457. That of the principal cities
                    was—Wheeling, 30,737; Parkersburg, 6582; Martinsburg, 6335; Charleston (the
                    State capital), 4192; Grafton, 3030; and Charlestown, 2016. The coloured
                    population numbered 25,886, the foreign-born population 18,265. The increase in
                    population from 1870 to 1880 was 39 ’ 9 per cent. The proportion of native
                    whites was 93 per cent, of the whole number of whites, which is larger than that
                    of any other State in the Union. The popular vote at late elections indicates a
                    population of 800,000, and that of Wheeling, Charleston, and Parkersburg is
                    shown by local investigation to have very largely increased.</p>
                <p>The executive power is vested in a governor elected by the people for a term of
                    four years, and ineligible under the constitution for re-election. There are
                    also an auditor, a treasurer, an attorneygeneral, a secretary of state and State
                    superintendent of free schools, who with the governor constitute a board of
                    public works, and are likewise elected by the people for terms of four years,
                    except the secretary of state and a librarian (who is <hi rend="italic">ex
                    officio</hi> adjutantgeneral), who are appointed by the governor. The
                    legislative power is vested in a senate and house of delegates. The senate
                    embraces 26 members, half of whom are elected every alternate two years, for a
                    term of four years. The house of delegates consists of 66 members, who are
                    elected every two years. The legislature meets biennially, and may be convened
                    in extraordinary session by the governor, or by the concurrence of three-fifths
                    of its members. The veto power is vested in the governor, but a majority
                    concurring in each house of the legislature overrides it. The judiciary consists
                    of a supreme court of appeals, with four judges, who in case of their equal
                    division affirm the judgment of the lower court, and of circuit courts, with one
                    judge each, exercising general original power and. appellate jurisdiction over
                    magistrates or justices of the peace, and of magistrates and justices of the
                    peace, whose jurisdiction in civil cases is limited to $300, and who exercise
                    criminal jurisdiction in petty offences, and may issue warrants of arrest and
                    make preliminary examination and commit for trial in the circuit court in cases
                    of crime. The fiscal regulations of the counties are confided to a board,
                    consisting of three county commissioners. The county organization consists of
                    these commissioners, a sheriff, deputy sheriffs, a circuit court clerk, a county
                    clerk, who is recorder of deeds, wills, &amp;c., board of education, school
                    trustees, overseers of roads, a commissioner of school lands, an overseer of the
                    poor, and a commissioner of accounts. All these except the deputy sheriffs,
                    commissioner of accounts, commissioner of school lands, and overseer of the poor
                    are elected by the people.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The establishment of West Virginia as a State
                    was consummated on 20th June 1863. Its creation and admission were due to
                    conditions which existed prior to the civil war of 1861-65, to popular sentiment
                    which those conditions developed when the war was precipitated, and to the
                    exigencies of the war itself. The Alleghany Mountains had divided the State of
                    Virginia politically and commercially, and in the sentiment relating to her
                    systems of taxation, revenue, and public expenditure into a Virginia and a
                    “Western” Virginia, long before the civil conflict gave permanent result and
                    fixed an official definition to the line of demarcation between them. Even after
                    the war and the formation of the new State the title to two counties, Jefferson
                    and Berkeley, “lying east of the mountains,” was the subject of legislation and
                    contention before the courts. They were in 1870 judicially declared by the
                    supreme court of the United States to be a part of the State of West Virginia.
                    The western part of Virginia was sparsely peopled, its great forests
                    undeveloped, its vast mineral resources only partially realized, and its slave
                    interests comparatively small. The eastern section contained the larger
                    population, owned the great bulk of slave property, and exercised controlling
                    power over State affairs. The Alleghanies, dividing the two sections, in the
                    absence of transverse railroad facilities naturally sent the citizens of one
                    side with the flow of their navigable waters to western and southern markets,
                    while those of the other, moved by similar natural causes, turned to the
                    seaboard for their commercial and business intercourse. The basis of taxation,
                    the basis of representation, and the relation of the slave interests to these,
                    with the measure and distribution of public funds for works of internal
                    improvement and other questions of local concern, constituted elements of
                    continual controversy, and served to detract largely from the homogeneity of the
                    population. Early in January 1861 the legislature of Virginia, in extra session,
                    passed a bill calling a convention of the people to meet in the following month.
                    At the same election the people were to vote on the question whether the
                    separation of Virginia from the Union should be determined by the convention or
                    be submitted by the convention to the people for ratification or rejection. The
                    majority at the election in favour of submitting the question of secession to
                    the people was overwhelming, and was construed as indicating the loyal'sentiment
                    of the people of north-western Virginia. On the 17th of April, after the
                    bombardment of Fort Sumter, the convention passed an ordinance of secession, and
                    on the 24th a schedule submitting it to the people. The ordinance of secession
                    was adopted by the people of Virginia, but the majority against it in the
                    north-western part of the State was very large. A convention of the unionist
                    counties, which met at Wheeling in June, adopted an ordinance for the
                    reorganization of the State government, and in August adopted an* ordinance
                    providing for the formation of a new State, to be named “Kanawha,” comprising
                    thirty-nine specified counties, and to include other counties also named,
                    provided their vote should indicate such desire. Under this provision a number
                    of counties were afterwards added ro the original thirty-nine. At the time of
                    the vote upon the proposition to form a new State war was raging throughout its
                    proposed borders, and many of its counties had been the scene of violence and
                    blooodshed. Many citizens were in the field as soldiers on the respective sides,
                    and this fact, coupled with the general conditions, caused a small vote to be
                    polled. Of this comparatively small vote, however, a large majority was for the
                    new State, and members were elected to a constitutional convention. This
                    convention<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n555/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0555-0520"/> met at Wheeling in November, and formed a
                    constitution for the proposed new State, and designated it the State of West
                    Virginia. This constitution was submitted to the people, and adopted by an
                    overwhelming majority in April 1862. In May the legislature of the “reorganized
                    Government” of Virginia passed a bill to authorize the formation of the new
                    State out of the territory of the old State of Virginia, as indicated by the
                    recently ratified constitution, and in the same month this Act of the
                    Legislature, accompanied by its memorial and a certified copy of the
                    constitution and proceedings by which it had been adopted, was presented to
                    Congress. The subject led to grave discussion in that body, but ultimately the
                    proposed constitution was carried, with but one modification affecting the
                    freedom of children of slaves thereafter to be born within the limits of the new
                    State. A new constitution was adopted in 1872. The State of West Virginia being
                    the result of a double revolution—that of the State of Virginia against the
                    Federal Union and that of her north-western counties against the seceding State
                    of Virginia—its people are conservative and strikingly homogeneous. Even in the
                    throes of revolution declaring separation from the mother State provision was
                    made for the assumption of a just share of the old State debt, though its
                    adjustment has never yet been reached. West Virginia has no other debt. Falling
                    naturally, as did most of the border States, immediately after the war, into
                    violent proscriptions of the returning Confederate element, West Virginia was
                    one of the first of the States to modify and repeal these enactments. By the
                    election of 1870 they were abrogated for ever, and since that time the issues
                    and consequences of war have so far disappeared as to leave no perceptible trace
                    behind. (J. E. K.)</p>
