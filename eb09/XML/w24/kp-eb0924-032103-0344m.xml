                    portions lying about 30 miles apart, viz., the county (grafschaft) of Waldeck,
                    embedded in Prussian territory between the provinces of Westphalia and
                    Hesse-Nassau, and the principality (fürstenthum) of Pyrmont, farther to the
                    north, between Lippe, Brunswick, and Hanover. Waldeck, with 48,580 inhabitants,
                    comprises an area of 407 square miles, covered for the most part with hills,
                    which culminate in the Hegekopf (2807 feet). The centre is occupied by the
                    plateau of Corbach. The chief rivers are the Eder and Diemel, both of which
                    eventually find their way into the Weser. Pyrmont, only 26 square miles in
                    extent, with 8123 inhabitants, is also mountainous. The Emmer, also belonging to
                    the Weser system, is its chief stream. The united area is thus 433 square miles,
                    or about half the size of Cambridgeshire in England, and the united population
                    in 1885 was 56,703. Agriculture and cattle-rearing are the main resources of the
                    inhabitants in both parts of the principality, but the soil is nowhere very
                    fertile. Only 55½ per cent. of the area is occupied by arable land and pasture;
                    forests, one-tenth of which are coniferous, occupy 36 per cent. Rye is the
                    principal crop; but oats, potatoes, and flax are also grown in considerable
                    quantities. In 1883 the principality contained 5956 horses, 20,249 cattle,
                    66,704 sheep, 17,735 pigs, and 7332 goats. Iron, slate, and building-stone are
                    worked at various points, and, along with horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, wool, and
                    timber, form the chief exports. A few insignificant manufactures (cigars,
                    liqueurs, earthenware, linen, knitted stockings) are carried on in some of the
                    little towns, but both trade and manufactures are much retarded by the almost
                    complete isolation of the country from railways. Wildungen in the extreme south
                    of Waldeck is the terminus of a branch line, and a narrow part of Pyrmont is
                    intersected by an unimportant line.</p>
                <p>The capital and the residence of the prince is Arolsen (2442 inhabitants) in
                    Waldeck; twelve smaller “towns” and about one hundred villages are also situated
                    in the county. The only town in Pyrmont is Bad Pyrmont, with about 1500
                    inhabitants, at one time a highly fashionable watering-place on account of its
                    chalybeate and saline springs. The annual number of visitors is still estimated
                    at 13,000. Wildungen is also a spa of some repute. The <pb break="no"

                    stock, to the south of Franconian,—a difference which is distinctly marked in
                    dialect, costumes, and manners. Nearly all are Protestants. In 1880, when the
                    population was 56,522, there were 53,995 Protestants, 1576 Roman Catholics, 854
                    Jews, and 97 others.</p>
                <p>Waldeck-Pyrmont has one vote in the federal council and one in the imperial diet.
                    The constitution, dating from 1852, is a reactionary modification of one carried
                    in 1849, which in its turn had been a considerable advance upon one granted in
                    1816. The single chamber consists of fifteen members (three of whom represent
                    Pyrmont), elected indirectly for three years. In the event of the male line of
                    the present ruling family becoming extinct the female line succeeds in Waldeck,
                    but Pyrmont falls to Prussia. In terms of a treaty concluded in 1868 for ten
                    years and renewed in 1878 for a similar period, the finances and entire
                    government of Waldeck-Pyrmont are managed by Prussia, the little country having
                    found itself unable to support unassisted the military and other burdens
                    involved by its share in the North-German Confederation. The government is
                    conducted in the name of the prince by a Prussian “landes-director,” while the
                    state-officials are “Prussian subjects,” and take the oath of allegiance to the
                    king of Prussia. The prince of Waldeck reserves his whole rights as head of the
                    church, and also the right of granting pardons, and in certain circumstances may
                    exercise a veto on proposals to alter or enact laws. Education, the
                    administration of justice, and similar matters are thus all conducted on the
                    Prussian model; a previous convention had already handed over military affairs
                    to Prussia. The budget for 1886 showed a revenue of £52,530 and an expenditure
                    of &lt;£48,680. The public debt was £117,550, paying interest at 4 per cent. The
                    prince is supported by the income derived from crown-lands.</p>
                <p>The princes of Waldeck-Pyrmont are descendants of the counts of Schwalenberg, the
                    earliest of whom known to history was Wittekind, who died in 1137. His grandson
                    seems to have been the first count of Waldeck. For many centuries the original
                    possessions of the Schwalenbergs were divided among several collateral lines of
                    counts (Waldeck, Landau, Wildlingen, Eisenberg); and about 1428 Hesse obtained a
                    right of superiority over Waldeck, in return for its protection during those
                    troublous times. This right gave rise to important claims on the part of Hesse,
                    which were not finally set aside until 1847, when the German diet decided that
                    the right had come to an end with the extinction of the empire. In 1685 a <hi
                    rend="italic">pactum primogeniturae</hi> was made between the two surviving
                    lines, which took effect in 1692, when the Eisenberg branch became extinct with
                    the death of George Frederick, who had served with distinction as an imperial
                    field-marshal, and had received the title of prince. Pyrmont had also originally
                    belonged to a branch of the Schwalenberg family; but it had successively been
                    held by the counts of Lippe (from 1557) and Gleichen (from 1584), before it
                    finally fell back to Waldeck in 1625. From 1692 the lands have remained
                    undivided under the Wildlingen line, with the exception of a brief period
                    (1805-1812) when Waldeck and Pyrmont were held by two brothers. Frederick
                    Anthony Ulrich, who succeeded in 1706, was made prince by the emperor Charles
                    VI. In 1807 Waldeck was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine; and in 1814
                    it entered the German Confederation. Its first constitution was granted in 1816
                    by Prince George Henry (1813-1845). George Victor, the present prince (1888),
                    succeeded in 1845 at the age of 14, and assumed the government in 1852. The most
                    important incident in the recent history of the principality is the conclusion
                    of the above-mentioned treaty with Prussia, with whom it sided in the war
                    against Austria.</p>
