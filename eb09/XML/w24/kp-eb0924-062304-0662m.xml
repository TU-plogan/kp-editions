                    of the law of <hi rend="smallcaps">Evidence</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.},</hi>
                    and on the other is closely connected with the <hi rend="smallcaps">Jury</hi>
                    (&lt;7.v.), for the jurors were originally chosen for their knowledge or
                    presumed knowledge of the facts in dispute. The part of the Scotch juror’s oath
                    “and no truth conceal” is an <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n663/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0663-0624"/> obvious survival of the time when the juror was a
                    witness. It is only by gradual steps that the law has reached its present stage
                    in the United Kingdom and the United States. At present the disabilities of
                    witnesses are few; almost every one is a capable witness, and the main question
                    has become one of credibility rather than of capability. It was far otherwise in
                    Roman and ecclesiastical law and in the older law of England and Scotland. A
                    reference to <hi rend="smallcaps">Torture</hi> will show that in Roman and
                    mediaeval law the testimony of many persons was not admissible without the
                    application of torture. At the same time a large body of possible witnesses was
                    excluded for reasons which have now ceased to be considered expedient, and was
                    subject to rules which have long become obsolete. In Roman law witnesses must be
                    <hi rend="italic">idonei,</hi> or duly qualified. Minors, certain heretics,
                    infamous persons (such as women convicted of adultery), and those interested in
                    the result of the trial were inadmissible. Parents and children could not
                    testify against one another, nor could slaves against their masters, or those at
                    enmity with the party against whom their evidence was offered. Women and slaves
                    were under a disability to be witnesses to a will. The canon law extended the
                    disability to testify to an excommunicated person, and to a layman in a criminal
                    charge against a clerk, unless he were actually the prosecutor. In the days of
                    trial by battle a party could render a witness against him incompetent by
                    challenging and defeating him in the judicial combat. A policy similar to that
                    of Roman law was followed for centuries in England by excluding the testimony of
                    parties or persons interested, of witnesses for a prisoner, and of infamous
                    persons, such as those who had been attainted, or had been vanquished in the
                    trial by battle, or had stood in the pillory. All these were said <hi
                    rend="italic">vocem</hi><hi rend="italic">non habere.</hi> Many systems of law
                    excluded witnesses from policy of a local or temporary nature. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Women</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.ν.)</hi> were generally regarded
                    as wholly or partially incompetent. The evidence of Jews was frequently rejected
                    in Spain and other countries during the 14th and 15th centuries. In the United
                    States, while slavery was lawful, the evidence of slaves (and in some States
                    that of free persons of colour) was not received for or against whites. There
                    were in Roman law some hard and fast rules as to number. Seven witnesses were
                    necessary for a will, five for a <hi rend="italic">mancipatio</hi> or
                    manumission or to determine the question whether a person were free or a slave.
                    Five was also the number necessary under the <hi rend="italic">Liber
                    Feudorum</hi> for proving ingratitude to the lord. Two were generally necessary,
                    as in the Mosaic law, as a minimum number to prove any fact. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Unius responsio</hi><hi rend="italic">testis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >omnino</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic">audiatur</hi> are the
                    words of a constitution of Constantine. The evidence of a single witness was
                    simply <hi rend="italic">semiplena probatio,</hi> to be supplemented, in default
                    of a second witness, by torture or by reference to oath. In the canon law the
                    evidence of a notary was generally equivalent to that of two ordinary witnesses.
                    The evidence of the pope and that of a witness who simply proved baptism or
                    heresy (according to some authorities) are perhaps the only other cases in which
                    canon law dispensed with confirmatory evidence. In England one witness is as a
                    rule sufficient. But in certain cases two or more are necessary. Two must attest
                    a marriage or a will,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The absence of two witnesses does not, however, avoid a marriage as it does
                    a will. The section of 4 Geo. IV. c. 76 providing for the presence of witnesses
                    at a marriage has been held to be merely directory.</p></note> and two are
                    necessary for a conviction of perjury, treason, and some other crimes, such as
                    offences against the Act of Supremacy of Elizabeth. In the United States the
                    number necessary for the attestation of a marriage or will is not uniform in all
                    the States. Sometimes a special number has been fixed in England by statute in
                    excep tional cases. A curious Act of Richard II., passed in 1383 (6 Rie. II. st.
                    2, c. 5), fixed the number of compurgators necessary to free an accused person
                    from complicity in the peasant revolt at three or four. Corroborative evidence
                    —not necessarily the evidence of another witness, but corroboration in a
                    material particular—must in England be given to entitle the complainant or
                    plaintiff to succeed in an affiliation summons or in an action for breach of
                    promise of marriage. The evidence of an accomplice also needs confirmation, if
                    not in strict law, at least in practice. The number of witnesses had in one
                    instance in old Scotch law the curious effect of determining the punishment. By
                    the assizes of King William, the ordeal of water was undergone by the accused on
                    the oaths of three witnesses; if to them the oaths of three <hi rend="italic"
                    >seniores</hi> were added, the penalty was immediate hanging. Witnesses need not
                    now in English law be <hi rend="italic">idonei</hi> or credible, except in the
                    case of witnesses to bills of sale under the Bills of Sale Act, 1882. The
                    “credible” of the Statute of Frauds has not been repeated in the Wills Act (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Will).</hi> In the case of dishonour of a foreign bill of
                    exchange the evidence of a notary is required, and a solicitor must attest á
                    warrant of attorney, as was also required for a bill of sale from 1878 to
                    1882.</p>
                <p>The modern law of witnesses has been already treated to a considerable extent
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Evidence.</hi> It should be noticed that since the
                    date of that article a new rule of great importance has received statutory
                    sanction. The rules of the Supreme Court, 1883 (Ord. xxxvi., r. 38), enable the
                    judge in all cases to disallow any questions put in cross-examination of any
                    party or other witness which may appear to him to be vexatious and not relevant
                    to any matter proper to be inquired into in the cause or matter. It will suffice
                    here to give a brief statement of the laλv as it at present stands, rather by
                    way of supplement to what has been already said than as an exhaustive notice.
                    Witnesses may be either sworn or unsworn, either judicial or non-judicial, the
                    unsworn and uon-judicial almost coinciding. The evidence of judicial witnesses
                    may be given <hi rend="italic">viva vοeβ</hi> or by deposition or affidavit, the
                    latter being the more usual course in chancery and bankruptcy proceedings. Where
                    evidence is taken on commission, the usual course where the witness is out of
                    the jurisdiction, the questions and the witness's answers are produced in
                    writing to the court which issued the commission, it being a delegation of the
                    authority of the court. As a rule all witnesses coming before a court of
                    justice, whether to give evidence as to a fact or a professional opinion, must
                    be sworn (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Oaths).</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The giving of evidence unsworn appears to
                    have been at one time regarded as a privilege. The men of Ripon, for instance,
                    were by a charter of Athelstan to be believed on their yea and nay in all
                    disputes.</p></note><hi rend="smallcaps">To</hi> this rule certain exceptions
                    exist at common law and have been introduced by statute, the one of the most
                    importance being the law by which persons objecting to take an oath may affirm.
                    Another exception was introduced by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885, the
                    Act allowing the evidence of a child of tender years to be received without
                    oath. But to ensure a conviction such evidence must be corroborated. At common
                    law a person merely producing documentary evidence need not as a rule be sworn.
                    A witness, too, may be examined unsworn on the <hi rend="italic">voir dire,</hi>
                    as it is called, to decide the preliminary question of his competency.
                    Non-judicial witnesses are those who attest an act of unusual importance, for
                    the due execution of which evidence may afterwards be required. They are either
                    made necessary by law, as the witnesses to man·iages and wills, or used by
                    general custom, as the witnesses to deeds. In some cases the attestation has
                    become a mere form, such as the attestation of the lord chancellor to a writ of
                    summons (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Writ).</hi> Those witnesses whose evidence is
                    not received may be divided into incompetent and privileged,—classes which must
                    be carefully distinguished. The evidence of the former is wholly inadmissible;
                    that of the latter is admissible if they waive their privilege. Among the
                    incompetent witnesses are those of too tender years to understand the nature of
                    an oath, idiots and lunatics, those convicted of perjury under an Act of
                    Elizabeth (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Perjury),</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A person convicted of perjury at common law
                    is not on that account incompetent in England; his evidence may be given for
                    what it is worth. It is otherwise in the United States, see Revised Statutes, §
                    5392. In France disability to be a witness may be inflicted as part of the
                    punishment on conviction for certain crimes (see <hi rend="italic">Code</hi><hi

                    husbands or wives (except where the trial is for treason or for personal
                    injuries inflicted by one spouse against the other). The exclusion of the latter
                    class has led to much dismission<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0664-0625"/> among English lawyers. In 1878 the Criminal Code
                    Commission recommended that prisoners should be allowed to give evidence on
                    their own behalf on oath. Several recent Acts have modified in some degree the
                    rigour of the common law. The accused, or the husband or wife of the accused,
                    may give evidence on oath in certain proceedings, nominally criminal,
                    substantially of a civil nature, such as indictments for nuisance or non-repair
                    of a highway (40 Viet, and 41 Vict. c. 14). The same is the case under the
                    Merchant Shipping, Licensing, and Customs Acts, the Married Women’s Property
                    Act, 1882, the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885, the Merchandise Marks Act,
                    1887, and other Acts. Up to 1702 the prisoner was under the further disability
                    of not being able to have his witnesses examined on oath. This harsh rule,
                    borrowed from Roman law, was not abrogated in Ireland until 1711, in Scotland
                    until 1735. Where a witness is competent, he is also compellable, except the
                    king. The only privileged witnesses practically now recognized in England are
                    high officers of state, executive or judicial, and members of the legal
                    profession, who need not divulge what has been disclosed to them in professional
                    confidence. Clergy and medical men are not privileged, though attempts have
                    sometimes been made to protect disclosures to them, especially to priests in the
                    confessional. Any witness is privileged from answering questions the ansivers to
                    which might expose him to penalty or forfeiture or to a charge of adultery.
                    Lists of witnesses intended to be called by the crown must be supplied to the
                    accused in charges of <hi rend="smallcaps">Treason</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{q.v.),</hi> and are generally on the back of the indictment in ordinary cases,
                    though the prosecution is not bound to call them. In Scotland lists of the
                    witnesses are supplied in all cases, and in the United States in capital
                    charges.</p>
                <p>The mode of securing the attendance of a witness is by subpoena (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Writ)</hi> in civil actions in the High Court, by subpoena or
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Recognizance</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.υ.)</hi> before an

                    in a county court or court of summary jurisdiction. In exceptional cases
                    attendance may be secured by writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus ad
                    testificandum or</hi> by <hi rend="smallcaps">Warrant</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.
                    v.</hi>) of a secretary of state. In Scotland attendance is generally secured by
                    citation. Disobedience to a subpoena is punishable as <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Contempt of Court</hi> (q.v).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the ecclesiastical courts it was formerly punished by <hi

                    penalties of perjury. Various Acts of Parliament deal with compelling appearance
                    before committees of parliament, courts of martial, and other tribunals of a
                    special nature. A witness is protected from any action for slander for words
                    spoken in the witness box. He is also protected from arrest <hi rend="italic"
                    >eundo, morando, et redeundo.</hi> The scale of allowances to witnesses depends
                    upon orders of court made with the approval of the Treasury. It is graduated
                    according to the social position of the witnesses. (J. W†. )</p>
