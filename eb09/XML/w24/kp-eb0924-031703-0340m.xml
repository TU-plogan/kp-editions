                    one of the most distinguished of modern German historians, was born at
                    Flensburg, in the duchy of Schleswig, on October 9, 1813. He was educated at the
                    Flensburg gymnasium and the universities of Kiel and Berlin. His strong bent to
                    historical studies and the influence of Ranke early diverted him from his
                    original purpose of studying law, and while still a student he began that series
                    of researches in German mediaeval history which was to be the occupation of his
                    life. On graduating at Berlin in August 1836, Waitz went to Hanover to assist
                    Pertz in the great national work of publishing the <hi rend="italic">Monumenta
                    Germanise Historica;</hi> and the energy and learning he displayed in that
                    position won him a summons to the chair of history at Kiel in 1842. The young
                    professor soon began to take an interest in politics, and in 1846 entered the
                    provincial diet as representative of his university. His leanings were strongly
                    German, so that he became somewhat obnoxious to the Danish Government, a fact
                    which made an invitation in 1847 to become professor of history at Göttingen
                    peculiarly acceptable. The political events of 1848-49, however, delayed his
                    appearance in his new chair. When the German party in the northern duchies rose
                    against the Danish Government, Waitz hastened to place himself at the service of
                    the provisional Government. He was sent to Berlin to represent the interests of
                    the duchies there, and during his absence he was elected by Kiel as a delegate
                    to the assembly at Frankfort. Waitz was an adherent of the party who were eager
                    to bring about a union of the German states under a German emperor; and when the
                    king of Prussia declined the imperial crown the professor withdrew from the
                    assembly in disappointment, and ended his active share in public life. In the
                    autumn of 1849 Waitz began his lectures at Göttingen. His style of speaking was
                    dry and uninteresting; but the matter of his lectures was so practical and his
                    teaching so sound that students were attracted in crowds to his lecture-room,
                    and the reputation of the Göttingen historical school spread far and wide. At
                    the same time Waitz’s pen was not idle, and his industry is to be traced in the
                    list of his works and in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> of the different
                    historical societies to which he belonged. In 1875 Waitz removed to Berlin to
                    succeed Pertz as principal editor of the <hi rend="italic">Monumenta Germanise
                    Historica.</hi> In spite of advancing years the new editor threw himself into
                    the work with all his former vigour, and took journeys to England, France, and
                    Italy to collate works preserved in these countries. He died at Berlin on May
                    24, 1886. He was twice married,—in 1842 to a daughter of Schelling the
                    philosopher, and in 1858 to a daughter of General Von Hartmann.</p>
                <p>Waitz is often spoken of as the chief disciple of Ranke, though perhaps in
                    general characteristics and mental attitude he has more affinity with Pertz or
                    Dahlmann. He is an industrious and painstaking historian, who, without troubling
                    himself about the graces of style, has collected and published an immense
                    quantity of valuable and carefully sifted material. His special domain was
                    mediaeval German history, and he rarely travelled beyond it.</p>

                <p>Waitz’s chief works are— <hi rend="italic">Deutsche Verfassungs-Geschichte,</hi>
                    8 vols., Kiel, 1844-78; 2d ed., 2 vols. only, 1865-70; <hi rend="italic"

                    >Grundzüge der Politik,</hi> Kiel, 1862. Among his smaller works, which,
                    however, indicate the line of his researches, are the following :— <hi

                    1837, 3d ed., 1885; <hi rend="italic">Ueber das Leben und die Lehre des

                    Waitz took a leading part in the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Forschungen zur deutschen Geschichte,</hi> Munich, 1862 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.,</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Nordalbingische Studien,</hi> published
                    in the proceedings of the Schleswig-Holstein Historical Society, Kiel, 1844-51.
                    It is impossible here to do more than refer to his numerous and valuable
                    contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Monumenta,</hi> and to his numerous
                    papers and criticisms published in periodicals and the proceedings of historical
                    societies. A <hi rend="italic">Bibliographische Uebersicht über Waitz’s
                    Werke</hi> was published by E. Steindorff at Gottingen in 1886.</p>
                <p>Obituary notices of Waitz are to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Historische
