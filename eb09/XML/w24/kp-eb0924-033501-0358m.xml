                    was the third but eldest surviving son of Robert Walpole, M.P., of Houghton in
                    Norfolk,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The head of a

                    Archaeol. Soc.,</hi> i. 363-79.</p></note> by Mary, only daughter and heiress of
                    Sir Jeffery Burwell, of Rougham, in Suffolk. The father, a jolly old squire who
                    revelled in outdoor sport and the pleasures of the table, transmitted to his son
                    the chief traits in his own character. The future statesman was born at Houghton
                    on 26th August 1676, and was sent to Eton and to King’s College, Cambridge,
                    where he was admitted as scholar on 22d April 1696. At this time he was
                    destined, as a younger son, for the church, but his two elder brothers died
                    young and he became the heir to an estate producing about £2000 a year,
                    whereupon in May 1698 he resigned his fellowship, and was soon afterwards
                    withdrawn by his father from the university. His education lasted sufficiently
                    long, however, to enable him to gratify the tastes of the county members in
                    parliament with the usual quotations from Horace, though in classical
                    attainments he was excelled by Pulteney, Carteret, and many others of his
                    contemporaries in politics. On his father’s decease the electors of the family
                    borough of Castle Rising returned him in January 1701 to the House of Commons as
                    their representative, but after two short-lived parliaments he sought the
                    suffrages of the more important constituency of King’s Lynn (1702), and was
                    elected as its member at every subsequent dissolution until he left the Lower
                    House. From the first he took a keen interest in the business of the House, and
                    not many months passed away before his shrewdness in counsel and his zeal for
                    the interests of the Whigs were generally recognized. In March 1705, according
                    to the statement of Archdeacon Coxe, he was appointed one of the council to
                    Prince George of Denmark, the inactive husband of Queen Anne, and then lord high
                    admiral of England. Complaints against the administration of the navy were then
                    loud and frequent (Burton’s <hi rend="italic">Queen Anne,</hi> ii. 22-31), and
                    the responsibilities of his new position tested his capacity for public life.
                    His abilities proved equal to the occasion, and justified his advancement, in
                    succession to his life-long rival Henry St John, to the more important position
                    of secretary-at-war (February 1708), an office of recent creation but in time of
                    war of great responsibility, which brought him into immediate contact with the
                    duke of Marlborough and the queen. With this post he held for a short time
                    (1710) the treasurership of the navy, and by the discharge of his official
                    duties and by his skill in debate became admitted to the inmost councils of the
                    ministry. He could not succeed, however, in diverting Godolphin from the great
                    error of that statesman’s career, the impeachment of Sacheverell, and when the
                    committee was appointed for elaborating the articles of impeachment Walpole was
                    called upon to act as one of the managers for the House of Commons. On the wreck
                    of the Whig party which ensued upon this fatal mistake, Walpole shared in the
                    general misfortune, but neither cajolery nor menace could induce him to retain
                    office, and he took his place with his friends in opposition. His energies now
                    shone forth with irresistible vigour; both in debate and in the pamphlet press
                    he took up the cause of the ejected ministry, and in revenge for his zeal his
                    political opponents brought against him an accusation of personal corruption. On
                    these charges, now universally acknowledged to have proceeded from party
                    animosity, he was in the spring of 1712 expelled from the House and committed to
                    the Tower. His prison cell now became the rendezvous of the Whigs among the
                    aristocracy, while the populace heard his praises commemorated in the ballads of
                    the streets. The ignominy which the Tories had endeavoured to inflict upon him
                    was turned into augmented reputation. At the dissolution of 1713 the faithful
                    electors of King’s Lynn again placed their trust in him, and during this
                    parliament, the last summoned by Queen Anne, he took the leading part in defence
                    of Steele against the attacks of the Tories.</p>
                <p>With the accession of George, the Whigs regained their supremacy, and for nearly
                    half a century they retained the control of English politics. The prizes fell to
                    the victors, and Walpole obtained the lucrative if unimportant post of
                    paymaster-general of the forces in the administration which was formed under the
                    nominal rule of Lord Halifax, but of which Stanhope and Townshend were the
                    guiding spirits. A committee of secrecy was appointed to inquire into the acts
                    of the late ministry, and especially into the peace of Utrecht, and to Walpole
                    was entrusted the place of chairman. Most of his colleagues in office were
                    members of the House of Lords, and the lead in the Commons quickly became the
                    reward of his talents and assiduity. Halifax died, and after a short interval
                    Walpole was exalted into the conspicuous position of first lord of the treasury
                    and chancellor of the exchequer (11th October 1715). Jealousies, however,
                    prevailed among the Whigs, and the German favourites of the new monarch quickly
                    showed their discontent with the heads of the ministry. Townshend was forced
                    into resigning his secretaryship of state for the dignified exile of viceroy of
                    Ireland, but he never crossed the sea to Dublin, and the support which
                    Sunderland and Stanhope, the new advisers of the king, received from him and
                    from Walpole was so grudging that Townshend was dismissed from the
                    lord-lieutenancy (April 1717), and Walpole on the next morning withdrew from the
                    ministry. They plunged into opposition with unflagging energy, and in resisting
                    the measure by which it was proposed to limit the royal prerogative in the
                    creation of peerages Walpole exerted all his powers. This display of ability
                    brought about a partial reconciliation of the two parties among the Whigs. To
                    Townshend was given the presidency of the council, and Walpole once again
                    assumed the paymastership of the forces (June 1720). On the financial crash
                    which followed the failure of the South <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n359/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0359-0336"/> Sea scheme, the public voice insisted that he
                    should assume a more prominent place in public life. At this crisis in England’s
                    fortunes Stanhope and Craggs were seized by death, Aislabie, the chancellor of
                    the exchequer, was committed to the Tower, and Sunderland, though acquitted of
                    corruption, was compelled to resign the lead. Walpole, as first lord of the
                    treasury and chancellor of the exchequer (April 1721), became with Townshend
                    responsible for the country’s government (though for some years they had to
                    contend with the influence of Carteret), and during the rest of the reign of
                    George I. they remained at the head of the ministry. The hopes of the Jacobites,
                    which revived with these financial troubles, soon drooped in disappointment.
                    Atterbury, their boldest leader, was exiled; Bolingbroke, in dismay at their
                    feebleness, sued for pardon, and was permitted to return to his own country. The
                    troubles which broke out in Ireland over Wood’s patent for a copper coinage were
                    allayed through the tact of Carteret, who had been banished as its lord
                    lieutenant by his triumphant rivals. The Continent was still troubled with wars
                    and rumours of wars, but a treaty between England, Prussia, and France was
                    successfully effected at Hanover in 1725. England was kept free from warfare,
                    and in the general prosperity which ensued Walpole basked in the royal favour.
                    His eldest son was raised to the peerage as Baron Walpole (10th June 1723), and
                    he himself became a knight of the Bath in 1725, and was rewarded with the Garter
                    in 1726. Next year the first King George died, and Walpole’s enemies fondly
                    believed that he would be driven from office, but their expectations were doomed
                    to disappointment. The confidence which the old king had reposed in him was
                    renewed by his successor, and in the person of Queen Caroline, the discreet
                    ruler of her royal spouse, the second George, the Whig minister found a faithful
                    and life-long friend. For three years he shared power with Townshend, but the
                    jealous Walpole brooked no rival near the throne, and his brother-in-law
                    withdrew from official life to the groves of Norfolk in May 1730. Before and
                    after that event the administration was based on two principles, sound finance
                    at home and freedom from the intrigues and wars which raged abroad. On the
                    Continent congresses and treaties were matters of annual arrangement, and if the
                    work of the plenipotentiaries soon faded it was through their labours that
                    England enjoyed many years of peace. Walpole’s influence received a serious blow
                    in 1733. The enormous frauds on the excise duties forced themselves on his
                    attention, and he proposed some arrangements by which the income resulting to
                    the national exchequer from the duties on wine and tobacco might be largely
                    increased. His opponents fastened on these proposals with irresistible force,
                    and so serious an agitation stirred the country that the ministerial measure was
                    dropped amid general rejoicing. Several of his most active antagonists were
                    dismissed from office or deprived of their regiments, but their spirit remained
                    unquenched, and when Walpole met a new House of Commons in 1734 his supporters
                    were far less numerous. The Gin Act of 1736, by which the tax on that drink was
                    raised to an excessive amount, led to disorders in the suburbs of London; and
                    the imprisonment of two notorious smugglers in the Tolbooth at Edinburgh
                    resulted in those Porteous riots which have been rendered famous in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Heart of Midlothian.</hi> These events weakened his influence with
                    large classes in England and Scotland, but his parliamentary supremacy remained
                    unimpaired, and was illustrated in 1737 by his defeat of Sir John Barnard’s plan
                    for the reduction of the interest on the national debt, and by his passing of
                    the Playhouse Act, under which the London theatres are still regulated. That
                    year, however, heralded his fall from power. His constant friend Queen Caroline
                    died, and the prince of Wales, long discontented with his parents and their
                    minister, flung himself into active opposition. Many of the boroughs within the
                    limits of the duchy of Cornwall were obedient to the prince’s will, and he
                    quickly attracted to his cause a considerable number of adherents, of whom Pitt
                    and the Grenvilles were the most influential. The leading orators of England
                    thundered against Walpole in the senate, and the press resounded with the taunts
                    of the poet and pamphleteer, illustrious and obscure, who found abundant food
                    for their invectives in the troubles with Spain over its exclusive pretensions
                    to the continent of America and its claim to the right of searching English
                    vessels. The minister long resisted the pressure of the opposition for war, but
                    at the close of 1739 he abandoned his efforts to stem the current, and with a
                    divided cabinet was forced, as the king would not allow him to resign, into
                    hostility with Spain. The Tory minority had seceded from parliament, but at the
                    commencement of the session, in November 1739, they returned to their places
                    with redoubled energies. The campaign was prosecuted with vigour, but the
                    successes of the troops brought little strength to Walpole's declining
                    popularity, and when parliament was dissolved in April 1741 his influence with
                    his fellow-countrymen had faded away. His enemies were active in opposition,
                    while some of his colleagues were lukewarm in support. In the new House of
                    Commons political parties were almost evenly balanced. Their strength was tried
                    immediately on the opening of parliament. The Bossiney election went against him
                    by six votes; a member of the opposition was elected as chairman of committees
                    by a majority of four; and the ministry was twice defeated over the Westminster
                    election. The voting on the return for Chippenham was accepted as a decisive
                    test of parties, and, as Walpole was beaten on a preliminary point in connexion
                    with the return, he resolved upon resigning his places. On the 9th of February
                    1742 he was created earl of Orford, and two days later he ceased to be prime
                    minister. A committee of inquiry into the conduct of his ministry for the
                    previous ten years was ultimately granted, but its deliberations ended in
                    nought, and Walpole was allowed to spend the rest of his days in retirement at
                    Houghton. There he died 18th March 1745, and in its parish church he was buried
                    on March 25. With the permanent places, valued at £15,000 per annum, which he
                    had secured for his family, and with his accumulations in office, he had rebuilt
                    the mansion at great expense, and formed a gallery of pictures within its walls
                    at a cost of &lt;£40,000, but the collection was sold by his grandson for a much
                    larger sum in 1779 to the empress of Russia, and the estate and house of
                    Houghton, a vast and gloomy edifice described in the <hi rend="italic">Art
                    Journal</hi> for March 1887, passed to Lord Cholmondeley, the third earl having
                    married the premier’s younger daughter. Walpole was twice married,—in 1700 to
                    Catherine, eldest daughter of John Shorter, who died in 1737, having had issue
                    three sons and two daughters, and in 1738 to Maria, daughter of Thomas Skerret,
                    a lady often mentioned in the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montague.</p>
                <p>Civil wars at home and the protracted struggle with France on the Continent had
                    produced in Englishmen an intense desire for peace, and, in their remembrance of
                    the constant disputes under the previous two sovereigns over the succession to
                    the throne, the great majority of them cheerfully consented to the rule of the
                    electors of Hanover. Walpole knew the disposition of his countrymen, and he
                    gratified their tastes by consistently acting both in ecclesiastical and civil
                    affairs on the principle <hi rend="italic">quieta non movere.</hi> He had
                    profited by the lesson of the ill-fated prosecution of Sacheverell, and while he
                    was prime minister the Church of England slept in peace without fear of danger
                    from her enemies. The followers of dissent ranged themselves behind his banner,
                    but they were fed by promises rather than by actual concessions, and the wisest
                    among them were contented with permission to worship undisturbed<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n360/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0360-0337"/>. His aim ever was to maintain peace abroad and
                    quiet at home, and tho chief blot on his ministerial career is that through love
                    of office he allowed himself to be drawn into tho war with Spain. In business
                    matters he was methodical; his judgment was sound in financial affairs; and his
                    speeches were marked by clearness of expression. Pope, who loved him not, has
                    borne witness to his merits “in the happier hours of social pleasure,” but
                    neither in private nor in public life were his manners refined or his estimates
                    of men and women exalted. “All these men have their price” was his estimate of
                    members of the House of Commons, and although he gathered together at Houghton
                    many of the masterpieces of painting he was not a lover either of art or of
                    letters. All the eminent writers of the day were opposed to his rule, and at his
                    fall his jealous spirit had driven into opposition every politician of repute.
                    Great as his faults were, his character was suited to the temperament of the
                    period within which he lived, and during his tenure of office his country
                    advanced in prosperity by leaps and by bounds.</p>
                <p>His life is written by Archdeacon Coxe in three ponderous folios, and has more
                    recently been described in one volume by Mr Ewald. (W. P. C.)</p>
