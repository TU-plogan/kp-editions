                    (1693-1754), New Testament critic, was born at Basel, March 5, 1693. His father,
                    John Rudolph Wetstein, was pastor of St Leonard’s in that city, and belonged to
                    a learned family with wide ramifications. John Jacob studied the classics,
                    Hebrew, and mathematics under distinguished professors, amongst whom was one of
                    the Buxtorfs. Theology he studied under Samuel Werenfels, an influential
                    anticipator of modern scientific theology and exegesis. While still a student he
                    began to direct his attention to the special pursuit of his life—the text of the
                    Greek New Testament. A relative, John Wetstein, who was the university
                    librarian, gave him permission to examine and collate the principal MSS. of the
                    New Testament in the library, and he copied the various readings which they
                    contained into his copy of Gerard of Maestricht’s edition of the Greek text. In
                    1713 in his public examination he defended a dissertation entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Variis</hi><hi rend="italic">Novi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Testamenti Lectionibus,</hi> and sought to show that variety of
                    readings did not detract from the authority of Sacred Scripture. Wetstein paid
                    great attention also to Syriac and Talmudic Hebrew. In the spring of 1714 he
                    undertook a learned tour, which led him to Paris and England, the great object
                    of his inquiry everywhere being manuscripts of the New Testament. In Paris he
                    examined the <hi rend="italic">Codex Ephraemi,</hi> and on arriving in England
                    in August 1715 the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Alexandrinus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Codex Bezae</hi> with many others.
                    Early the next year he made the acquaintance of Bentley at Cambridge, who took
                    great interest in his textual inquiries. The great scholar induced him to return
                    to Paris to collate for him more carefully the <hi rend="italic">Codex
                    Ephraemi,</hi> Bentley having then in view a critical edition of the New
                    Testament. In July 1717 W <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> etstein returned to
                    Basel to take the office of a curate at large in his native city, a post which
                    he held for three years, at the expiration of which he exchanged it to become
                    his father’s assistant in the parish of St Leonard’s. At the same time he
                    pursued his favourite study, and lectured also in the university on New
                    Testament exegesis. It was then that he formed the resolution to prepare a
                    critical edition of the Greek New Testament. He had in the meantime broken with
                    Bentley, whose famous <hi rend="italic">Proposals</hi> appeared in 1720.
                    Wetstein was not permitted, however, to pursue his purpose without molestation.
                    The rumour got abroad that his projected text would take the Socinian side in
                    the case of such passages as 1 Timothy iii. 16, and in other ways he gave
                    occasion for the suspicion of heresy.</p>
                <p>At length in 1729 the charge of projecting an edition of the Greek Testament
                    savouring of Socinianism was formally laid against him. The end of the long and
                    unedifying trial was his dismissal, May 13, 1730, from his office of curate of
                    St Leonard’s. He then removed from Basel to Amsterdam, where a relative, John
                    Henry Wetstein, had an important printing and publishing business, from whose
                    office excellent editions of the classics were issued, and also Gerard of
                    Maestricht’s edition of the Greek Testament. Previous to his removal from Basel
                    Wetstein had commenced printing in this office an edition of the Greek
                    Testament, which was suddenly stopped for some unknown reason. At his trial the
                    first sheets of this edition were brought into court against him, though the new
                    readings which had been adopted in his text were simply those which are now
                    universally accepted. As soon as he reached Amsterdam he published anonymously
                    the <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena,</hi> which he had proposed should accompany
                    his Greek Testament, and which was republished by him, with additions, as part
                    of his great work, 1751. The next year (1731) the Remonstrants offered him the
                    chair of philosophy in their college at Amsterdam, vacated by the illness of
                    John Le Clerc, on condition that he should clear himself of the suspicion of
                    heresy. He thereupon returned to Basel, and procured a reversal (March 22, 1732)
                    of the previous decision, and readmission to all his clerical offices. But, on
                    his becoming a candidate for the Hebrew chair at Basel, his orthodox opponents
                    procured his defeat and his retirement to Amsterdam. Here the Remonstrants
                    permitted him to hold lectures in their college, which led, however, to renewed
                    opposition on the part of the Calvinistic party. At length, after much painful
                    contention, he was allowed to instruct the Remonstrant students in philosophy
                    and Hebrew on certain somewhat humiliating conditions. For the rest of his life
                    he continued professor in the Remonstrant college, declining in 1744 the Greek
                    chair at Basel. In 1746 he once more visited England, and collated Syriac MSS.
                    for his great work. At last this appeared in 1751-52, in two folio volumes,
                    under the title <hi rend="italic">Novum Testamentum Graecum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Editionis</hi><hi rend="italic">Receptae cum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lectionibus Variantibus Codicum</hi><hi rend="italic">MSS.,</hi> &amp;c. He did
                    not venture to put new readings in the body of his page, but consigned those of
                    them which he recommended to a place between the text and the full list of
                    various readings. Beneath the latter he gave a commentary, consisting
                    principally of a mass of invaluable illustrations and. parallels drawn from
                    classical and rabbinical literature, which has formed a storehouse for all later
                    commentators. In his <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi> he gave an admirable
                    methodical account of the MSS., the versions, and the readings of the fathers,
                    as well as the troubled story of the difficulties with which he had had to
                    contend in the prosecution of the work of his life. He did not long survive the
                    completion of this work. He died at Amsterdam, March 9, 1754.</p>
                <p>Wetstein’s New Testament has never been republished entire. The London printer
                    Bowyer published, in 1763, a text in which he introduced the readings
                    recommended by Wetstein; Semler republished the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prolegomena</hi> and appendix, 1764; A. Lotze commenced a new edition of the
                    work, but the <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi> only appeared (Rotterdam,
                    1831), and this “castigated.” It is generally allowed that Wetstein rendered
                    invaluable service to textual criticism by his collection of various readings
                    and his methodical account of the MSS. and other sources, and that his work was
                    rendered less valuable through his prejudice against the Latin version and the
                    principle of grouping MSS. in families which had been recommended by Bentley and
                    Bengel.</p>
