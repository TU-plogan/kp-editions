                    Gloucestershire, W. by Herefordshire, and N.W. by Shropshire. The greatest
                    length from north to south is 34 miles, and its breadth 30 miles. The area is
                    472,453 acres, or about 738 square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface and Geology.—</hi> The surface consists of very fine
                    and picturesque hills and well-watered and fruitful valleys, and the county is
                    certainly one of the fairest and most picturesque in England. Its finest hills
                    are the well-known Malvern Hills on its south-west border, the Abberley Hills
                    running north from them, the Lickey and Clent Hills in the east, and in the
                    south the Bredon Hills, which are a continuation of the Cotswolds. The principal
                    rivers are the Severn, which is navigable, and runs through the county from
                    north to south; the Stour, which joins the Severn at Stourport; the Teme, which
                    enters the county at Tenbury, receives the Kyre and the Leigh, and falls into
                    the Severn below Worcester; and the Warwickshire Avon, which joins the Severn at
                    Tewkesbury. The valley of the Severn is appropriately named the Vale of
                    Worcester, and that of the Avon the Vale of Evesham,— the latter being generally
                    considered one of the loveliest valleys in England. The rivers are well stocked
                    with fish,— salmon, trout, grayling, shad, and lampreys being found in most of
                    them.</p>
                <p>The chief geological formation of the county is the Triassic, and a line running
                    north and south through the Malvern Hills and the Forest of Wyre coalfield would
                    divide the hard and ancient Palaeozoic strata from the softer and more recent
                    Mesozoic. Black shales, of about 1000 feet thick, rest upon the Hollybush
                    sandstone near Bransill Castle; and the Silurian formation extends west of the
                    Malverns as far as Abberley. The sandstone known as May Hill exists in the
                    south-west, reaching the Herefordshire Beacon; fossils are often found in it. To
                    the west of Raggedston and Midsummer Hills the Cambrian formation extends; this
                    also is fairly rich in fossils. There is but little of the Old Red Sandstone in
                    the county, but the Carboniferous formation extends from the Forest of Wyre
                    coalfield to the Abberley Hills, and from Bewdley to the western limits of the
                    county. The Permian formation is found near Martley, Abberley, Bewdley, and the
                    Clent Hills, while red marls and sandstones of the Triassic period constitute
                    about three-fourths of the county. At Droitwich and in the Vale of Evesham
                    limestones and a bluish clay exist; and in the gravels deposited by the Severn
                    and the Avon the remains of extinct mammals have been found.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Agriculture.—</hi> The climate is generally equable
                    and healthy, and is very favourable to the cultivation of fruit, vegetables, and
                    hops, for which Worcestershire has long held a high reputation, the red marls
                    and the rich loams which are so prevalent being good both for market gardens and
                    tillage. Its agricultural production consists principally of wheat, barley,
                    beans, fruit, and hops, in the cultivation of which great care and skill are
                    employed. The large and well-stocked orchards, the picturesque hop fields, and
                    the wonderfully productive market gardens are the pride of the county, and one
                    of the most attractive objects to all visitors. According to the agricultural
                    returns for 1887, the area under cultivation was 401,936 acres, distributed as
                    follows:—corn crops, 90,735; green crops, 32,709; clover and rotation grasses,
                    31,519; permanent pasture, 232,998; flax, 2; hops, 2828; and fallow, 11,145. The
                    area under orchards was 18,687 acres; market gardens, 3525; and nursery grounds,
                    386. In 1881—the latest return—there were 18,871 acres under woods and
                    plantations. The number of horses in 1887 was 20,249, of which 14,155 were used
                    solely for agriculture; cows in milk or calf, 27,808; other cattle, 38,472;
                    sheep, 174,371, of which 75,065 were under one year; pigs, 33,695.</p>
                <p>According to the landowners’ return of 1872-3, the total number of proprietor’s
                    in the county was 21,804, possessing 441,060 acres, with a gross annual
                    estimated rental of £1,685,736. Of the owners, only 5796 possessed one acre or
                    upwards. There were also 3415 acres of waste land. The following are the names
                    of the larger landowners:—earl of Dudley, 14,699 acres; earl of Coventry,
                    13,021; Earl Beauchamp, 10,624; Lord Windsor, 8519; Harry F. Vernon, 7448; Earl
                    Somers, 6265; Lord Lyttelton, 5908; the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, 5213; R.
                    Berkeley, 4S12; Duc D’Aumale, 4604; Sir John Pakington, 4868; Lord Northwick,
                    4215; and Sir F. Winnington, 4196.</p>

                    consists of coal, iron, and salt; and a considerable number of people find
                    employment in the quarries of limestone around Pershore and Evesham, and at
                    other quarries of freestone and flagstone. There is not much mining in the
                    county; the largest number of artisans are employed <hi rend="underline">in</hi>
                    the various hardware trades, as the making of nails, at Halesowen and the
                    neighbouring villages, and of needles at Redditch, Astwood Bank, and elsewhere.
                    Glass is largely produced at Dudley and Stourbridge. Worcester is famous for its
                    porcelain, its gloves, and its coach-building, and Kidderminster for its
                    carpets. The salt works at Droitwich are as old as the Roman occupation, and
                    there are others at Stoke. There are a large variety of other trades, including
                    crate making, coke burning, alkali, vinegar, and vitriol works, button making,
                    leather staining, paper making, and tanning.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> The county is well provided with railways
                    and canals. The roads are good, and the means of intercourse and communication
                    are excellent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> Worcestershire comprises
                    five hundreds (Halfshire, Doddingtree, Oswaldslow, Pershore, and Blackenhurst),
                    the city of Worcester, and the municipal boroughs of Bewdley, Droitwich, Dudley,
                    Evesham, and Kidderminster. There are eleven market towns. The city of Worcester
                    has a separate court of quarter sessions, and a commission of the peace, and all
                    the boroughs have commissions of the peace. It is in the Oxford circuit; the
                    assizes as well as quarter sessions are held at Worcester. There is one court of
                    quarter sessions in the whole county, and there are sixteen petty sessional
                    divisions. The shire contains 243 civil parishes, and is mostly in the diocese
                    of Worcester but partly in that of Hereford. The principal places besides the
                    city of Worcester are Bewdley (population 3088 in 1881), Bromsgrove (12,813),
                    Droitwich (3761), Dudley (46,252), Evesham (5112), Halesowen (7763),
                    Kidderminster (24,270), Oldbury (18,841), Redditch (9961), Stourbridge (9757),
                    and Tenbury (2083).</p>
                <p>By the Redistribution Act of 1885, the county was divided into three
                    parliamentary boroughs and five county divisions. The boroughs, each returning
                    one member, are Dudley, Kidderminster, and Worcester; the county divisions are
                    West (Bewdley), East, South (Evesham), Mid (Droitwich), and North (Oldbury). The
                    population in 1861 was 307,397; in 1871, 338,837; and in 1881, 380,283 (males
                    184.205, females 196,078). The number of persons to an acre was 0'80, and of

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Worcestershire was not a district of much
                    importance in the days of the Roman occupation of Britain. By occupying
                    Gloucester the Romans held the valley of the lower Severn, and thence their
                    roads ran to Hereford, and not till <hi rend="italic">Uriconiurn</hi> (
                    Wroxeter) on the side of the Wrekin did they regard the Severn valley as again
                    habitable. This was due to the fact that the greater part of the district now
                    contained in Worcestershire was forest and jungle, not inviting occupation to
                    the colonist. Here and there the Romans held a military outpost, as at
                    Worcester, keeping on the east side of the river; but the west side was left to
                    the Britons, who found a home on the summits of the Malvern Hills. It was long
                    before the English invaders thought the Severn valley worthy of their arms; but
                    in the beginning of the 7th century the tribe of the Hwiccas was in possession
                    of the lands now contained in Warwickshire, Worcestershire, and Gloucestershire.
                    The Hwiccas formed part of the Mercian kingdom, and when Archbishop Theodore
                    undertook the ecclesiastical organization of England he set up at Worcester a
                    bishop of the Hwiccas, and the diocese of Worcester continued to mark the limits
                    of the Hwiccan territory till Henry VIII. founded the separate see of
                    Gloucester.</p>
                <p>The church was the main instrument of civilization in Worcestershire. The abbey
                    of Evesham was the centre of agricultural life along the valley of the Avon; the
                    priory of Malvern began the clearing of the forest which reached from the hills
                    to the Severn. Many other religious houses were spread over the county. There
                    were no great barons, as much of the land was given in early times to the
                    church, and much consisted of forest which was only slowly cleared. The bishop
                    of Worcester was the undoubted head of the district, and provided for its
                    defence. The chief historical event connected with the county in the Middle
                    Ages, the battle of Evesham, was owing to the fact that Walter de Cantilupe,
                    bishop of Worcester, was a firm friend and adherent of Simon de Montfort in his
                    opposition to the misgovernment of Henry III. When Earl Simon had seized the
                    king s person in the battle of Lewes, the chief opposition to his government was
                    raised by the lords marchers on the Welsh borders. Simon went to Hereford for
                    the purpose of reducing them to submission; but Edward’s escape from captivity
                    gave them a leader, and awakened the hopes of the royalists. Simon sent for
                    reinforcements, but his son was surprised and cut off at Kenilworth. Ignorant of
                    the fact, but afraid to wait any longer lest the passage of the Severn should be

                    territory of the bishop of Worcester, aud took up his abode in the abbey of
                    Evesham, there in 1265 he was surprised by Edward, and died fighting a hopeless
                    fight. <hi rend="superscript"> b</hi> ð</p>
                <p>As Wales became more settled, Worcester developed its trade slowly. From early
                    times the salt mines at Droitwich were worked, and a “salt-way” was made for the
                    carriage of their produce. A trade with Wales and Bristol was established, and
                    clothiers sent their wares from Bewdley and Worcester down the Severn. The
                    dissolution of the monasteries affected very seriously a district which was so
                    closely connected with the church, and it was some time before it recovered from
                    the shock which its social life then received. In the great civil war
                    Worcestershire, in common with the west of England, was Royalist, and suffered
                    considerably from the Parliamentary forces. In 1651 Charles II. with the
                    Scottish army marched to Worcester, where he was welcomed by the citizens.
                    Cromwell followed, and took up his position on the Red Hill just outside the
                    city gates. Lambert succeeded in passing the Severn at Upton, and drove back the
                    Royalist troops to the neighbourhood of Worcester, on the other side of the
                    Severn. Charles determined to take advantage of this division of the
                    Parliamentary army on the two sides of the river, and made an attack on
                    Cromwell’s camp. At first he was successful, but Cromwell was reinforced by
                    Lambert’s troops from the other side in time to drive back Charles’s foot, who
                    were not supported by the Scottish horse. Their rout was complete; Charles
                    managed to escape into the city, where he escaped in disguise, and began his
                    adventurous journey to Boscobel. Since that time Worcestershire has pursued a
                    course of peaceful development.</p>
