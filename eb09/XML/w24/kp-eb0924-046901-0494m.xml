                <p><label type="entry">WEBER’S LAW</label> is the principal generalization of that
                    branch of scientific investigation which has come to be known as
                    “psycho-physics.” According to Fechner, who has done most to prosecute these
                    inquiries and to consolidate them under a separate name, “psycho-physics is an
                    exact doctrine of the relation of function or dependence between body and soul.”
                    In other words, it is throughout an attempt to submit to definite measurement
                    the relation of physical stimuli to the resulting psychical or mental facts, and
                    forms an important department of experimental psychology. It deals with the
                    quantitative aspects of mental facts—their intensity or quantity proper and
                    their duration. Physical science enables us, at least in the case of some of the
                    senses, to measure with accuracy the objective amount of the stimulus, and
                    introspection enables us to state the nature of the subjective result. Thus we
                    are able to say whether a stimulus produces <hi rend="italic">any</hi> psychical
                    result, and can fix in that way the <hi rend="italic">minimum sensibile</hi> or
                    “threshold of consciousness” for each of the senses. In like manner (though with
                    less accuracy, owing to the disturbing nature of the conditions) we can fix the
                    sensational <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0495-0470"/> maximum, or upper limit of sensibility, in the
                    different senses, that is to say, the point beyond which no increase of stimulus
                    produces any appreciable increase of sensation. We thus determine, as Wundt puts
                    it, the limit-values between which changes of intensity in the stimulus are
                    accompanied by changes in sensation. But the central inquiry of psycho-physics
                    remains behind. Between the quantitative minimum and the quantitative maximum
                    thus fixed can we discover any definite relation between changes in the
                    objective intensity of the stimuli and changes in the intensity of the
                    sensations as estimated by consciousness? The answer of psycho-physics to this
                    inquiry is given in the generalization variously known as “Weber’s law,”
                    “Fechner’s law,” or the “psycho-physical law,” which professes to formulate with
                    exactitude the relations which exist between change of stimulus and change of
                    sensation.</p>
                <p>As we have no means of subjectively measuring the absolute intensity of our
                    sensations, it is necessary to depend upon the mental estimate or comparison of
                    two or more sensations. Comparison enables us to say whether they are equal in
                    intensity, or if unequal which is the greater and which is the less. But as they
                    approach equality in this respect it becomes more and more difficult to detect
                    the difference. By a series of experiments, therefore, it will be possible, in
                    the case of any particular individual, to determine the least observable
                    difference in intensity between two sensations of any particular sense. This
                    least observable difference is called by Fechner the “Unterschiedsschwelle,” or
                    “difference-threshold,” that is to say, the limit of the discriminative
                    sensibility of the sense in question. That such a “threshold,” or least
                    observable difference, exists is plain from very simple examples. Very small
                    increases may be made in the objective amount of light, sound, or pressure—that
                    is, in the physical stimuli applied to these senses—without the subject on whom
                    the experiment is made detecting any change. It is further evident that, by
                    means of this “Unterschiedsschwelle,” it is possible to compare the
                    discriminative sensibility of different individuals, or of different senses, or
                    (as in the case of the skin) of different parts of the same sense organ: the
                    smaller the difference observable the finer the discriminative sensibility. Thus
                    the discrimination of the muscular sense is much more delicate than that of the
                    sense of touch or pressure, and the discriminative sensibility of the skin and
                    the retina varies very much according to the parts of the surface affected.
                    Various methods have been adopted with a view to determine these <hi
                    rend="italic">minima</hi> of discriminative sensibility with an approach to
                    scientific precision. The first is that employed by Weber himself, and has been
                    named the method of just observable differences. It consists either in gradually
                    adding to a given stimulus small amounts which at first cause no perceptible
                    difference in sensation but at a certain point do cause a difference to emerge
                    in consciousness, or, <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> in gradually decreasing
                    the amount of additional stimulus, till the difference originally perceived
                    becomes imperceptible. By taking the average of a number of such results, the
                    minimum may be determined with tolerable accuracy. The second method is called
                    by Fechner the method of correct and incorrect instances. When two stimuli are
                    very nearly equal the subject will often fail to recognize which is the greater,
                    saying sometimes that A is greater, sometimes that B is greater. When in a large
                    number of trials the right and wrong guesses exactly balance one another we may
                    conclude that the difference between the two stimuli is not appreciable by the
                    sense. On the other hand, as soon as the number of correct guesses definitely
                    exceeds half of the total number of cases, it may be inferred that there is a
                    certain subjective appreciation of difference. This method was first employed by
                    Vierordt. The third method, that of average errors, is very similar to the one
                    just explained. Here a certain weight (to take a concrete example) is laid upon
                    the hand of the person experimented upon, and he is asked, by the aid of
                    subjective impression alone, to fix upon a second weight exactly equal to the
                    first. It is found that the second weight sometimes slightly exceeds the first,
                    sometimes slightly falls below it. Whether above or below is of no consequence
                    to the method, which depends solely on the amount of the error. After a number
                    of experiments, the different errors are added together, and the result being
                    divided by the number of experiments gives us the average error which the
                    subject may be calculated upon to make. This marks the amount of stimulus which
                    is just below the difference-threshold for him. This method was first employed
                    by Fechner and Volkmann. The different methods were first named, and the theory
                    of their application developed by Fechner, in his <hi rend="italic">Elemente der
                    Psychophysik</hi> (1860).</p>
                <p>These methods have been chiefly applied to determine the relation of the
                    difference-threshold to the absolute magnitude of the stimuli employed. For a
                    very little reflexion tells us that the smallest perceivable difference is not
                    an amount whose absolute intensity is constant even within the same sense. It
                    varies with the intensity of the stimuli employed. We are unable, for example,
                    to recognize slight differences in weight when the weights compared are heavy,
                    though we should be perfectly able to make the distinction if the weights
                    compared were both light. Ordinary observation would lead us, therefore, to the
                    conclusion that the greater the intensity of the original stimulus at work the
                    greater must be the increase of stimulus in order that there may be a
                    perceptible difference in the resulting sensation. E. H. Weber (1795-1878) was
                    the first (after a prolonged series of experiments on the sensations of sight,
                    hearing, and touch) to clothe this generality with scientific precision by
                    formulating the law which has since gone by his name. The purport of the law is
                    that, in order that the sensational difference may remain unchanged, the
                    increase of stimulus must maintain the same proportion to the intensity of the
                    preceding stimulus. The smallest perceptible difference is therefore not
                    absolutely the same, but it remains relatively the same, that is, it remains the
                    same fraction of the preceding stimulus. For example, if we can distinguish 16
                    oz. and 17 oz., we shall be able to distinguish 32 oz. and 34 oz. but not 32 oz.
                    and 33 oz., the addition being in each case <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 16</hi> of the preceding stimulus. This fraction (supposing it
                    to be the difference-threshold of the muscular sense) remains a constant,
                    however light or however heavy the weights compared. The law may be formulated
                    thus :—The difference between any two stimuli is experienced as of equal
                    magnitude, in case the mathematical relation of these stimuli remains unaltered.
                    Or, otherwise expressed, In order that the intensity of a sensation may increase
                    in arithmetical progression, the stimulus must increase in geometrical
                    progression. It is also expressed by Fechner in the form— The sensation
                    increases as the logarithm of the stimulus.</p>
                <p>The law has been variously interpreted. Fechner himself designated it the
                    psycho-physical law, and treated it as the fundamental formula of the relation
                    between body and mind, thus assigning to it an ontological dignity and
                    significance. But in this “psycho-physical” interpretation of his results he has
                    not had a numerous following. Wundt interprets the law in a purely
                    “psychological” sense, making it a special instance of the general law of
                    relativity which governs our mental states. Introspection can give us no
                    information as to the absolute intensity of the stimulus; for a stimulus is
                    known in consciousness <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n496/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0496-0471"/> only through its sensational resultant. Hence, he
                    argues, we can only compare one psychical state with another, and our standard
                    of measurement is therefore necessarily a relative one; it depends directly upon
                    the preceding state with which we compare the present. Others have attempted to
                    give the law a purely physical or “physiological” explanation. Instead of
                    holding with Fechner that the law expresses a recondite relation between the
                    material and the spiritual world, they prefer to regard the quantitative
                    relation between the last physical antecedent in the brain and the resultant
                    mental change as <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> one of simple proportion,
                    and to treat Weber’s law as holding between the initial physical stimulus and
                    the final action of the nerve-centres. According to this interpretation, the law
                    would be altogether due to the nature of nervous action. As a nerve, says Sully,
                    after a temporary degree of stimulation temporarily loses its sensibility, so
                    the greater the previous stimulation of a nerve the greater is the additional
                    stimulus required to produce an appreciable amount of sensation.</p>
                <p>Weber’s law, it must be added, holds only within certain limits. In the
                    “chemical” senses of taste and smell experiments are almost impossible. It is
                    not practicable to limit the amount of the stimulus with the necessary
                    exactitude, and the results are further vitiated by the long continuance of the
                    physiological effects. The same considerations apply with still more force to
                    the organic sensations, and the results in the case of temperature sensations
                    are completely uncertain. The law is approximately true in the case of sight,
                    hearing, pressure, and the muscular sense,—most exactly in the case of sound. As
                    this is the sense which affords the greatest facilities for measuring the
                    precise amount of the stimulus, it may perhaps be inferred that, if we could
                    attain the same exactitude in the other senses, with the elimination of the
                    numerous disturbing extraneous influences at work, the law would vindicate
                    itself with the same exactitude and certainty. It is further to be noted,
                    however, that even in those senses in which it has been approximately verified,
                    the law holds with stringency only within certain limits. The results are most
                    exact in the middle regions of the sensory scale; on the contrary, when we
                    approach the upper or lower limit of sensibility, they become quite
                    uncertain.</p>
