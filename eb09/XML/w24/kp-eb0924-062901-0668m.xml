                    (1759-1824), was born in 1759 at Hainrode, a little village not far from
                    Nordhausen, in the province of Hanover. His father, who was village schoolmaster
                    and organist, was in his way an enthusiast in education, and gave his son
                    whatever advantage is to be gained by the earliest possible cultivation. In time
                    the family removed to Nordhausen, and there young Wolf went to the grammar
                    school, where he soon acquired all the Latin and Greek that the masters could
                    teach him, besides learning French, Italian, Spanish, and music. This, however,
                    was in the earlier and (as he himself regarded it) the idler part of his
                    schooltime. He presently took his education into his own hands, devoted himself
                    entirely to classics, borrowed books wherever he could, and rapidly stored his
                    young and powerful memory with their contents. The precocity of his attainments
                    was only equalled by the force of will and confidence in his own powers which
                    characterized him throughout life.</p>
                <p>After two years of solitary study, at the age of eighteen, Wolf went to the
                    university of Göttingen. His first act there was a prophecy—one of those
                    prophecies which spring from the conscious power to bring about their
                    fulfilment. He had to choose his “faculty,” and chose one which then existed
                    only in his own mind, the faculty of “philology.” What is even more remarkable,
                    the omen was accepted. He carried his point, and was enrolled as he desired.</p>
                <p>Wolf’s relations with Heyne, who was then the chief ornament of Göttingen, form
                    an unpleasant chapter, which may well be passed over here. Heyne was a scholar
                    of little force or originality, but he was one of those who, by their power of
                    assimilating and transmitting the thoughts of others, often rise to the highest
                    reputation. Wolf soon left him, and fell back upon the university library, from
                    which he borrowed with his old avidity.</p>
                <p>During the years 1779-83 Wolf was a schoolmaster, first at Ilfeld, then at
                    Osterode. His success as a teacher was striking, and he found time to publish an
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Symposium,,</hi> which excited notice, and led
                    to his promotion to a chair in the Prussian university of Halle.</p>
                <p>The moment was a critical one in the history of education. The literary impulse
                    of the Renaissance was almost spent; scholarship had become dry and trivial. A
                    new school, that of Locke and Rousseau, sought to make teaching more modern and
                    more human, but at the sacrifice of mental discipline and scientific aim. Wolf
                    was eager to throw himself into the contest on the side of antiquity. In Halle
                    (1783-1807), by the force of his will and the enlightened aid of the ministers
                    of Frederick the Great, he was able to carry out his long-cherished ideas, and
                    found the science of philology. By one of England’s insular aberrations, the
                    word “philology” threatens to.be confined to the study of the forms of language.
                    Wolf defined it to be “knowledge of human nature as exhibited in antiquity.” The
                    matter of such a science, he held, must be sought in the history and education
                    of some highly cultivated nation, to be studied in written remains, works of
                    art, and whatever else bears the stamp of national thought or skill. It has
                    therefore to do with both history and language, but primarily as a science of
                    <hi rend="italic">interpretation,</hi> in which historical facts and linguistic
                    facts take their place in an organic whole. Such was the ideal which Wolf had in
                    his mind when he established tlιe philological <hi rend="italic">seminarium</hi>
                    at Halle.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n669/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0669-0630"/>
                <p>Wolf’s writings make little show in a library, and were always subordinate to his
                    teaching. During his time at Halle he published his commentary on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Leptines</hi> (1789) —which suggested to his pupil, Aug. Boeckh,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Public Economy of Athens—</hi> and a little later the <hi
                    rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi> to Homer (1795). This book, the work with which
                    his name is chiefly associated, was thrown off in comparative haste to meet an
                    immediate need. It has all the merits of a great piece of oral teaching—command
                    of method, suggestiveness, breadth of view. The reader does not feel that he has
                    to do with a theory, but with great ideas, which are left to bear fruit in his
                    mind (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Homer).</hi></p>
                <p>The Halle professorship ended tragically, and with it the happy and productive
                    period of Wolf’s life. He was swept away, and his university with him, by the
                    deluge of the French invasion. A painful gloom oppressed his remaining years
                    (1807-24), which he spent at Berlin. He became so fractious and intolerant as to
                    alienate some of his warmest friends. He gained a place in the department of
                    education, through the exertions of W. von Humboldt. When this became
                    unendurable, he once more took a professorship. But he no longer taught with his
                    old success; and he wrote very little. His most finished work, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Darstellung der Altertumswissenschaft,</hi> though published at
                    Berlin (1807), belongs essentially to the Halle time. At length his health gave
                    way. He was advised to try the south of France. He got as far as Marseilles, and
                    was laid in the classic soil of that ancient Hellenic city.</p>

                    Pattison in the <hi rend="italic">North British Revieιυ</hi> of June 1865, soon
                    (we believe) to be reprinted by the Clarendon Press. Since the date of that
