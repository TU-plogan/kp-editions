                    enjoyed in the latter half of his long life a high reputation as a poet, which
                    has been partly fixed by the compliments of Dryden and Pope. Waller is a
                    singular and piquant figure in the history of the 17th century; his relations
                    with Charles I., with the Long Parliament, with Cromwell, with Charles IL, his
                    position as a poet, as a courtier, as a privileged water-drinker among the
                    bibulous Restoration wits, form a combination that has no parallel. The
                    character might be paralleled, but the run of incidents is unique. He was born
                    at Coleshill, in Hertfordshire, March 3, 1605, and came of distinguished
                    ancestry, landed gentry, with estates in Kent and other counties, and prominent
                    places in the public service from the reign of Henry V. downwards. He inherited
                    a position of difficulty in view of the civil strife that began when he reached
                    manhood; his mother was herself an ardent Royalist, but was connected by blood
                    with Hampden and by marriage with Cromwell. His father died when he was eleven
                    years old. He entered parliament at sixteen, and sat also in the first and in
                    the third parliaments of Charles I. He was thus, as Clarendon put it, nursed in
                    parliament, and this early experience helped him to make a figure afterwards;
                    but he took no active part at the time, the chief use that he made of his
                    advantages as a courtier and a youth of fashion being to marry a wealthy city
                    heiress. With this addition to the handsome fortune left him by his father, he
                    retired to his estate at Beaconsfield and studied literature. This was about
                    1632.</p>
                <p>When he first began to write verses is a doubtful and disputed point. Clarendon
                    says that he began at an age when most men leave off, and if we put this at
                    thirty there is no published or even probable evidence to the contrary; but, on
                    the other hand, it is argued that he began at the age of eighteen, in 1623, this
                    being the date of the subject of his first poem,—Prince Charles’s escape from a
                    storm at St Andero. This earliest date must be increased by at least two years,
                    the whole point of the poem being Charles’s marriage with his queen Henrietta,
                    which took place in 1625. The exact date of his beginning acquires some interest
                    from Johnson’s dictum that he wrote as smoothly at eighteen as at eighty,
                    “smoothness” being his established merit; and the difficulty of determining the
                    date arises from his not having “gathered his sticks into a faggot” and
                    published till 1645. The incidents that furnished him with themes for his
                    peculiar artificial and decorative treatment occurred long before,—for example,
                    the duke of Buckingham’s death in 1628, the taking of Salle in 1632, the repair
                    of St Paul’s in 1633, the death of the earl of Carlisle in 1636, his courtship
                    of Lady Dorothy Sidney — “Saccharissa ”—between the death of his first wife in
                    1634 and Saccharissa’s marriage to another in 1639. But that the poems, as we
                    now have them, were written immediately after the incidents glorified in his
                    verse is an uncertain assumption, considering his elaborating habits, the
                    strongly Royalist tone of his verses on public events, and the express statement
                    of Clarendon, who was likely to have known if copies had been circulated in the
                    society of the court long before they appeared in print. If they were at least
                    retouched by him between the ages of thirty and forty, the wonder of his
                    uniformity of manner from first to last—which, after all, has been somewhat
                    exaggerated —is considerably lessened.</p>
                <p>In the struggle between king and parliament, Waller tried at first to mediate,
                    holding the king’s demands unconstitutional, but endeavouring through his
                    advisers to induce him to modify them. He made such a mark as a speaker in the
                    Short Parliament that at the opening of the Long Parliament he was chosen by the
                    Commons to conduct the impeachment of Judge Crawley for his shipmoney decision.
                    Thereafter, as the struggle became fiercer, with a view apparently to prevent
                    parliament from proceeding to extremities, he engaged in what was known as
                    Waller’s plot. The object of the plot seems to have been to restrain the extreme
                    Parliamentarians by some public declaration of moderate opinion, but it was
                    complicated with another plot, the object of which was to assist the king with
                    armed force. All Waller's relations, except his mother, were anti-Royalist, and
                    it is said that his complicity was discovered by domestic treachery. He behaved
                    with the most abject meanness when arrested by order of Pym on May 31, 1643,
                    saved himself by at once turning informer and making disclosures that were at
                    least unreserved, and was let off eventually with a fine of £10,000 and
                    banishment. It was from his exile in Paris, in 1645, that he directed his first
                    publication of poems. He lived there in high repute as a wit and a munificent
                    host till 1654, when Cromwell, at the intercession of his anti-Royalist
                    relatives, allowed him to return to England, and try to mend his impaired
                    estate. He celebrated the Protector’s greatness in a lofty panegyric, and
                    Cromwell is said to have relished his pleasant qualities as a companion. It
                    deserves to be noted, as evidence of a real admiration, that he wrote also a
                    lament “Upon the Death of the Lord Protector,” when the sincerity of his
                    panegyric was less open to question. The poem contains two famous lines of
                    bathos—</p>
                <p>Under the tropic is our language spoke</p>
                <p>And part of Flanders hath received our yoke.</p>
                <p>But otherwise it does not fall beneath the poet’s steady level.</p>
                <p>Upon the Restoration Waller hastened to express his joy, mingled with trembling,
                    “Upon His Majesty’s Happy Return,” and found little difficulty in making his
                    peace. He met the king’s complaint that his congratulation was inferior to his
                    panegyric on the Protector with the famous retort, “Poets, Sire, succeed better
                    in fiction than in truth.” He was soon on such terms with Charles that he
                    applied for the provostship of Eton; the king <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n354/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0354-0331"/> agreed, but Clarendon refused, on the ground that
                    he was a layman, and the refusal was sustained by the council. He thus failed in
                    his only application for substantial evidence of the king’s favour, but in every
                    other respect the changed state of things made his old age happy and glorious.
                    He entered parliament again, and became, Burnet says, “the delight of the House,
                    and, though old, said the liveliest things of any of them.” His witty sayings
                    were circulated through the town, and, as Johnson suspects, good things were
                    fathered on him,—a tribute to his reputation. Although a water-drinker, he was a
                    boon companion with the roystering wits, Dorset saying that “no man in England
                    should sit in his company without drinking, except Ned Waller.” Further,
                    surviving all his early contemporaries, he found himself in higher reputation
                    than ever as a poet. His poems now went through several editions, each increased
                    by new productions, though the bulk was never large. He wrote in his formed
                    eulogistic fashion on topics of the day, on St James’s Park, on Somerset House,
                    the victory over the Dutch, the queen’s birthday, the beauties, and other
                    celebrities of the time. He fitted <hi rend="italic">The Maid’s Tragedy</hi>
                    with a happier ending in rhymed couplets, assisted Dorset and Godolphin in the
                    translation of the <hi rend="italic">Pompey</hi> of Corneille, and wound up his
                    career becomingly with <hi rend="italic">Divine Poems,</hi> continuing to write
                    to the last. He died in 1687, at the age of eighty-two, and at the height of his
                    poetic reputation. Rymer of the <hi rend="italic">Foedera,</hi> the savage
                    critic of Shakespeare, wrote the epitaph for his tomb at Beaconsfield, in which
                    it is recorded that “inter poetas sui temporis facile princeps, lauream, quain
                    meruit adolescens, octogenarius haud abdicavit.” Fenton, Pope’s coadjutor in the
                    translation of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> edited and commented on his
                    poems after his death, justifying the pains bestowed by comparing him to
                    Petrarch and Malherbe.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that as a panegyrical poet, ready to overlay any subject,
                    entirely irrespective of its intrinsic worth, with a cleverly woven and
                    tastefully coloured garment of words and images, Waller deserved all the
                    admiration he received, and would be hard to beat in our literature. Fenton
                    showed true discernment in urging that his excellence lay in commendation,
                    whether or not he was right in adding that any ill-natured person could be a
                    satirist. And complimentary <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> poetry was so much in
                    fashion when poets were courted and munificently rewarded by politicians that
                    Waller’s fame from the Restoration till the time of Walpole, who dispensed with
                    the aid of complimentary poets, is easy to understand. But Mr Gosse’s recent
                    contention that Waller must be regarded as the founder of the classical school,
                    and that his influence changed the course of our literature for a century, must
                    pass as a hurried exaggeration. He was so eminently successful that he
                    influenced minor poets at the close of his life and for a generation afterwards,
                    but his range of subjects as well as his art was extremely limited, and much
                    larger and wider influences were at work. He is an example of one of the
                    tendencies, but it is absurd to represent him as a commanding influence, except
                    in a very humble field. He influenced panegyrical writing, and, inasmuch as this
                    fell in with and influenced the tendency “to dress nature to advantage,” “to
                    raise sentiments above the vulgar pitch” with the borrowed riches of genuinely
                    impassioned poetry, it might be argued that Waller’s influence extended beyond
                    his own narrow circle of aims. But his effect ou Dryden or on Pope was
                    infinitesimal. Even on the form of the favourite “classical” couplet Waller’s
                    single example cannot be held to have toki in any considerable degree. It was
                    already an established form for complimentary verse when he began to write.
                    “Waller was smooth,” it is true, but Pope at once qualifies the compliment with
                    a reference to his want of variety. And Pope is also strictly correct in
                    confining Waller’s metrical improvements to his post-Restoration verse. When we
                    place Waller’s later couplets side by side with his earlier, say <hi
                    rend="italic">The Triple Combat</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Divine Poems,</hi>
                    with <hi rend="italic">His Majesty's Escape,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The
                    Countess of Carlisle in Mourning,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Death of Lady
                    Rich,</hi> we become aware of a marked change in his metrical scheme,
                    notwithstanding the current opinion to the contrary. It is only in his later
                    couplets that he aims, under French influence, as Pope justly implies, at making
                    each distich complete in itself, varying this only with a stave of four,
                    generally with a break in the third line. His earlier couplets are less
                    monotonous, and were obviously modelled on the <hi rend="italic">Hero and
                    Leander</hi> of Marlowe and Chapman. To that noble poem, indeed, which was not
                    known in the days when Waller’s rhythm was so admired, he owed a large part of
                    his panegyrical stock-in-trade, as anybody familiar with it can trace, not
                    merely in his “classical” allusions, but also in his diction and his earlier
                    metre. As regards smoothness and balance, there are no couplets in the edition
                    of 1645 that could not be paralleled from the verses of his contemporaries,
                    George Sandys and Cowley. (W. Μ.)</p>
