                    exact place is unknown. His taste for literature early displayed itself, and by
                    the age of eighteen he had already achieved a reputation among the learned men
                    of his age. He was educated at the monastery of Reichenau, near Constance, where
                    he had for his teachers Tatto and Wettin, to whose visions he devotes one of his
                    poems. Later on in life (c. 826-829) he passed to Fulda, where he studied for
                    some time under Hrabanus Maurus before returning to Reichenau, of which
                    monastery he was made abbot in 838. There is a story, based, however, on no good
                    evidence, that Walafrid devoted himself so closely to letters as to neglect the
                    duties of his office, owing to which he was expelled from his house; but, from
                    his own verses, it seems that the real cause of his flight to Spires was that,
                    notwithstanding the fact that he had been tutor to Charles the Bald, he espoused
                    the side of his elder brother Lothair on the death of Louis the Pious in 840. He
                    was, however, restored to his monastery in 842, and died August 16, 849, on an
                    embassy to his former pupil. His epitaph was written by Hrabanus Maurus, whose
                    elegiacs praise him for being the faithful guardian of his monastery.</p>
                <p>Walafrid Strabo’s works may be divided into three classes,— theological,
                    historical, and poetical.</p>
                <p>1. The first class includes the <hi rend="italic">Glossa Ordinaria,</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This commentary was the one
                    in general use during the Middle Ages, when it went by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Glοssa</hi> simply.</p></note> a large commentary on the Bible and
                    part of the Apocrypha. This is of course to a great extent a compilation from St
                    Jerome, St Augustine, St Isidore, Bede, Hrabanus Maurus, &amp;c. Under the same
                    heading come the exposition of the first twenty Psalms, published by Pez (<hi
                    rend="italic">Anecdota Nova,</hi> iv.), and an epitome of Hrabanus Maurus’s
                    commentary on Leviticus. An <hi rend="italic">Expositio Quatuor
                    Eνangeliorum</hi> is also ascribed to Walafrid. The treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Rebus Ecclesiasticis,</hi> dedicated to Regenbert the librarian, gives not
                    only explanations and directions for the erection and embellishment of churches,
                    but also instructions as regards such questions as the method of taking the holy
                    communion and the payment of tithes. Walafrid approves of the use of images and
                    pictures in churches, “quia pictura est quaedam literatura illiterata.” He had
                    himself seen “simple folk and idiots,” whom words could hardly bring to a
                    realization of what they were told, so touched by representations of our Lord’s
                    passion that the tears ran down their faces. Last among Walafrid’s theological
                    treatises must be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">De Subversione Jerusalem
                    Tractatus.</hi></p>
                <p>2. Walafrid’s chief historical works are—(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vita Sancti Galli,</hi> which, though written nearly two centuries
                    after this saint’s death, is still the primary authority for his life, and (<hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi>) a much shorter life of St Othmar, abbot of St Gall (d.
                    759). Both these lives were based on previous ones written by Abbot Gotzbert of
                    St Gall (from 816-837).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Walafrid also edited Thetmar’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Louis the
                    Pious,</hi> prefixing a preface and making a few additions, and divided
                    Einhard’s <hi rend="italic">Vita Caroli</hi> into chapters, adding an
                    introduction.</p></note></p>
                <p>3. Walafrid’s poetical works include a short life of St Blaithmaic, a high-born
                    monk of Iona, murdered by the Danes in the first half of the 9th century; a life
                    of St Mammes; and a <hi rend="italic">Liber de Visionibus Wettin.</hi> This last
                    poem, like the two preceding ones written in hexameters, was composed at the
                    command of “Father” Adalgisus, and based upon the prose narrative of Heto, abbot
                    of Reichenau from 806 to 822. It is dedicated to Wettin’s brother Grimald. At
                    the time he sent it to Grimald Walafrid had, as he himself tells us, hardly
                    passed his eighteenth year, and he begs his correspondent to revise his verses,
                    because, “as it is not lawful for a monk to hide anything from his abbot,” he
                    fears he may be beaten with deserved stripes. In this curious vision Wettin saw
                    Charles the Great suffering purgatorial tortures because of his incontinence.
                    The name of the ruler alluded to is not indeed introduced into the actual text,
                    but " Carolus Imperator” form the initial letters of the passage dealing with
                    this subject. Many of Walafrid’s other poems are, or include, short addresses to
                    kings and queens (Lothair, Charles, Louis, Pippin, Judith, &amp;c.) and to
                    friends (Einhard, Grimald, Hrabanus Maurus, Tatto, Ebbo, archbishop of Rheims,
                    Drogo, bishop of Metz, &amp;c.). His most famous poem is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hortulus,</hi> dedicated to Grimald. It is an account of a little garden that
                    he used to tend with his own hands, and is largely made up of <pb break="no"

                    and their medicinal and other uses. Sage holds the place of honour; then comes
                    rue, the antidote of poisons; and so on through melons, fennel, lilies, poppies,
                    and many other plants, to wind up with the rose, “which in virtue and scent
                    surpasses all other herbs, and may rightly be called the flower of flowers.” The
                    curious poem <hi rend="italic">De Imagine Tetrici</hi> takes the form of a
                    dialogue.</p>
