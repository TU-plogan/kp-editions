                    mother once sang on the stage. His cousins, Josepha, Aloysia, Constanze, and
                    Sophie, daughters of Franz Anton’s brother Fridolin, attained a high reputation
                    as vocalists. Mozart, after having been cruelly deceived by Aloysia, made
                    Constanze his wife, and thus became Franz Anton’s nephew by marriage. Fridolin
                    played the violin nearly as well as his brother; and the whole family displayed
                    exceptional talent for music.</p>
                <p>Franz Anton von Weber was a man of thriftless habits and culpable eccentricity.
                    Having been wounded at Rosbach, he quitted the army, and in 1758 he was
                    appointed financial councillor to Clement August, elector of Cologne, who for
                    nine years overlooked his incorrigible neglect of duty. But the elector’s
                    successor dismissed him in 1768; and for many years after this he lived in
                    idleness at Hildesheim, squandering the property of his wife, Anna de’ Fumetti,
                    and doing nothing for the support of his children until 1778, when he was
                    appointed director of the opera at Lübeck. In 1779 the prince bishop of Eutin
                    made him his kapellmeister, and not long afterwards his wife died of a broken
                    heart. Five years later he went to Vienna, placed two of his sons under Michael
                    Haydn, and in 1785 married the young Viennese singer Genovefa von Brenner, who
                    in the following year gave birth, at Eutin, to the subject of the present
                    article—a delicate child, afflicted with congenital disease of the
                    hip-joint.</p>
                <p>On his return from Vienna, Franz Anton, finding that a new kapellmeister had been
                    chosen in his place, accepted the humbler position of “Stadt Musikant.” This,
                    however, he soon relinquished; and for some years he wandered from town to town,
                    giving dramatic performances, in conjunction with the children of his first
                    wife, wherever he could collect an audience. The effect of this restless life
                    upon the little Carl Maria’s health and education was deplorable; but, as he
                    accompanied his father everywhere, he became familiarized with the stage from
                    his earliest infancy, and thus gained an amount of dramatic experience that
                    indisputably laid the foundation of his future greatness. Franz Anton hoped to
                    see him develop into an infant prodigy, like his cousin Mozart, whose marvellous
                    career was then rapidly approaching its close. In furtherance of this scheme,
                    the child was taught to sing and place his fingers upon the pianoforte almost as
                    soon as he could speak, though he was unable to walk until he was four years
                    old. Happily his power of observation and aptitude for general learning were so
                    precocious that he seems, in spite of all these disadvantages, to have
                    instinctively educated himself as became a gentleman. His first music-master was
                    Keuschler, who gave him instruction at Weimar in 1796. In 1798 Michael Haydn
                    taught him gratuitously at Salzburg. In the March of that year his mother died,
                    like her predecessor, of chagrin. In April the family visited Vienna, removing
                    in the autumn to Munich. Here the child’s first composition—a set of “Six
                    Fughettas” —was published, with a pompous dedication to his halfbrother Edmund;
                    and here also he took lessons in singing from Valesi, and in composition from
                    Kalcher, under whom he made rapid progress. Soon after this he began to play
                    successfully in public, and his father compelled him to write incessantly. Among
                    the compositions of this period were a mass and an opera— <hi rend="italic">Die
                    Macht der Liebe und des Weins—</hi> now destroyed. A set of “Variations for the
                    Pianoforte,” composed a little later, and dedicated to Kalcher, was lithographed
                    by Carl Maria himself, under the guidance of Senefelder, the inventor of the
                    process, in which both the father and the child took great interest.</p>
                <p>In 1800 the family removed to Freiberg, where the Ritter von Steinsberg gave Carl
                    Maria the libretto of an opera called <hi rend="italic">Das Waldmädchen,</hi>
                    which the boy, though not yet fourteen years old, at once set to music, and
                    produced in November at the Freiberg theatre. The performance was by no means
                    successful, and the composer himself was accustomed to speak of the work as “a
                    very immature production”; yet it was afterwards reproduced at Chemnitz, and
                    even at Vienna.</p>
                <p>Carl Maria returned with his father to Salzburg in 1801, resuming his studies
                    under Michael Haydn, and forming a close friendship with the Chevalier Neukomm.
                    Here also he composed his second opera, <hi rend="italic">Peter Schmoll und
                    seine Nachbarn,</hi> which was unsuccessfully produced at Nuremberg<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n493/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0493-0468"/> in 1803. In that year he again visited Vienna,
                    where, though the veterans Haydn and Albrechtsberger were both receiving pupils,
                    his father preferred placing him under the Abbé Vogler, a man of kind and
                    sympathetic nature, but quite unfit to train so great a genius. Through Vogler’s
                    instrumentality Carl Maria was appointed conductor of the opera at Breslau,
                    before he had completed his eighteenth year. In this capacity he greatly
                    enlarged his experience of the stage; but he lived a sadly irregular life,
                    contracted debts which his slender salary was insufficient to defray, and lost
                    his beautiful voice through accidentally drinking a poisonous liquid used in
                    lithography,—a mishap that nearly cost him his life. These hindrances, however,
                    did not prevent him from beginning a new opera called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rübezahl,</hi> the libretto of which was based upon a well-known legend of the
                    Riesengebirge. The plot of the piece was “romantic” to the last degree, and
                    Weber worked at it enthusiastically, but it was never completed, and little of
                    it has been preserved beyond a quintett and the masterly overture, which,
                    re-written in 1811 under the title of <hi rend="italic">Der Beherrscher der
                    Geister,</hi> now ranks among its author’s finest instrumental compositions.</p>
                <p>Quitting Breslau in 1806, Weber removed in the following year to Stuttgart, where
                    he had been offered the post of private secretary to Duke Ludwig, brother of
                    Frederick, king of Würtemberg. The appointment was a disastrous one. The stipend
                    attached to it was insufficient to meet the twofold demands of the young man’s
                    new social position and the thriftlessness of his father, who was entirely
                    dependent upon him for support. Court life at Stuttgart was uncongenial to him,
                    though he yielded to its temptations. The king hated him. He fell hopelessly
                    into debt, and, worse than all, became involved in a fatal intimacy with
                    Margarethe Lang, a singer at the opera. Notwithstanding these distractions he
                    worked hard, and in 1809 re-modelled <hi rend="italic">Das Waldmädchen,</hi>
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Sylvana,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As the MS. of <hi rend="italic">Das
                    Waldmädchen</hi> has been lost, it is impossible now to determine its exact

                    theatre. But a dreadful calamity prevented its performance. Franz Anton had
                    misappropriated a large sum of money placed in the young secretary’s hands for
                    the purpose of clearing a mortgage upon one of the duke’s estates.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Spitta gives a different
                    account of the occurrence, and attributes the robbery to a servant.</p></note>
                    Both father and son were charged with embezzlement, and, on February 9, 1810,
                    they were arrested at the theatre, during a rehearsal of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sylvana,</hi> and thrown by the king’s order into prison. No one doubted
                    Weber’s innocence, but after a summary trial he and his father were ordered to
                    quit the country, and on February 27 they began a new life at Mannheim.</p>
                <p>Having provided a comfortable home for his father, and begun the composition of a
                    new comic opera, in one act, called <hi rend="italic">Abu Hassan,</hi> Weber
                    removed to Darmstadt in order to be near his old master the Abbé Vogler, and his
                    fellow-pupils Meyerbeer and Gänsbacher, with whom he lived on terms of the
                    closest intimacy. On September 16, 1810, he reproduced <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sylvana</hi> under its new title at Frankfort, but with very doubtful success.
                    <hi rend="italic">Abu Hassan</hi> was completed at Darmstadt in January 1811,
                    after many interruptions, one of which exercised a memorable influence upon his
                    later career. While reading with his friend, Alexander von Dusch, George Apel’s
                    then recently published <hi rend="italic">Gespensterbuch,</hi> he was so much
                    struck with the story of <hi rend="italic">Der Freischütz</hi> that he at once
                    began to meditate upon its transformation into an opera, and the two friends
                    actually set to work upon it then and there. But it was not until many years
                    afterwards that the idea was carried out in a practical form.</p>
                <p>Weber started in February 1811 on an extended artistic tour, during the course of
                    which he made many influential friends, and on June 4 brought out <hi
                    rend="italic">Abu Hassan</hi> with marked success at Munich. His father died at
                    Mannheim in 1812, and after this he had no settled home, until in 1813 his
                    wanderings were brought to an end by the unexpected offer of an appointment as
                    kapellmeister at Prague, coupled with the duty of entirely remodelling the
                    performances at the opera-house. The terms were so liberal that he accepted at
                    once, engaged a new company of performers, and governed them with uninterrupted
                    success until the autumn of 1816. During this period he composed no new operas,
                    but he had already written much of his best pianoforte music, and played it with
                    never-failing success, while the disturbed state of Europe inspired him with
                    some of the finest patriotic melodies in existence. First among these stand ten
                    songs from Körner’s <hi rend="italic">Leyer und Schwerdt,</hi> including “Vater,
                    ich rufe dich,” and “Lützow’s wilde Jagd”; and in no respect inferior to these
                    are the splendid choruses in his cantata <hi rend="italic">Kampf und Sieg,</hi>
                    which was first performed at Prague, December 22, 1815.</p>
                <p>Weber resigned his office at Prague, September 30, 1816, and on December 21
                    Frederick Augustus, king of Saxony, appointed him kapellmeister at the German
                    opera at Dresden. The Italian operas performed at the court theatre were
                    superintended by Morlacchi, whose jealous and intriguing disposition produced an
                    endless amount of trouble and annoyance. The king, however, placed the two
                    kapellmeisters on an exact equality both of title and salary, and Weber found
                    ample opportunity for the exercise of his remarkable power of organization and
                    control. And now he once more gave his attention to the story of <hi
                    rend="italic">Der Freischütz,</hi> which, with the assistance of Friedrich Kind,
                    he developed into an admirable libretto, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Des Jägers Braut.</hi></p>
                <p>The legend of “The Seventh Bullet,” though well known in the 17th century, and
                    probably much earlier, seems to have been first given to the world in a
                    connected form in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Unterredungen vom Reiche der
                    Geister,</hi> the second edition of which was printed at Leipsic in 1731. In
                    this version of the story the scene is laid in Bohemia, and the action referred
                    to the year 1710. Apel reproduced the legend, under the title of “Der
                    Freischütz,” in the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Gespensterbuch,</hi>
                    in 1810. Since then the story has been repeated in many varying forms, but it
                    was Apel’s version that first attracted Weber’s attention, and it was from this
                    that he and Kind together made their first sketch of the libretto, on February
                    21, 1817, though they found it necessary to increase the interest of the drama
                    by the introduction of some accessory characters, and to substitute a happy
                    ending for the fatal catastrophe of the original story. No subject could have
                    been better fitted than this to serve as a vehicle for the new art-form which,
                    under Weber’s skilful management, developed into what is now universally
                    recognized as the prototype of the true “romantic opera.” He had dealt with the
                    supernatural in <hi rend="italic">Rübezahl,</hi> and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sylvana</hi> with the pomp and circumstance of chivalry, but in neither case
                    with the unquestioning faith which alone can invest the treatment of such
                    subjects with befitting dignity. The shadowy impersonations in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rübezahl</hi> are scarcely less human than the heroine who invokes them; and
                    the music of <hi rend="italic">Sylvana</hi> might easily have been adapted to a
                    story of the 19th century. But in the master’s later operas all this is changed.
                    We cannot choose but shudder at the fiend in <hi rend="italic">Der
                    Freischütz,</hi> for the infernal apparition comes straight to us from the
                    nether world. Every note in <hi rend="italic">Euryanthe</hi> breathes the spirit
                    of mediaeval romance; and the fairies in <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> have a
                    real existence, quite distinct from the tinsel of the stage. And this it
                    is,—this uncompromising reality, even in face of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n494/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0494-0469"/> unreal,—that forms the strongest characteristic
                    of the pure “romantic school,” as Weber understood and created it. It is true to
                    nature even when dealing with the supernatural, for it treats its wildest
                    subjects in earnest, and without a doubt as to the reality of the scenes it
                    ventures to depict, or the truthfulness of their dramatic interpretation.</p>
                <p>Weber and Kind sketched the <hi rend="italic">scenario</hi> of the new opera in
                    February 1817. On March 1 the poet placed the complete libretto in the hands of
                    the composer, who wrote the first note of the music on July 2—beginning with the
                    duet which opens the second act. But so numerous were the interruptions caused
                    by Morlacchi’s intrigues, the insolence of unfriendly courtiers, and the attacks
                    of jealous critics that nearly three years elapsed before the piece was
                    completed. In the meantime the performances at the opera-house were no less
                    successfully remodelled at Dresden than they had already been at Prague, though
                    the work of reformation was far more difficult; for the new kapellmeister was
                    surrounded by enemies who openly subjected him to every possible annoyance, and
                    even the king himself was at one time strongly prejudiced against him. Happily,
                    he no longer stood alone in the world. Having, after much difficulty, broken off
                    his miserable intimacy with Margarethe Lang, he married the well-known vocalist,
                    Carolina Brandt, a noble-minded woman and consummate artiste, whose advice, even
                    on subjects connected with the new opera, was extremely valuable. The great work
                    was completed May 13, 1820, on which day Weber wrote the last note of the
                    overture,—a portion of the design which, for obvious reasons, it was his custom
                    to postpone until the rest of the music was finished. There is abundant evidence
                    to prove that he was well satisfied with the result of his labours; but he gave
                    himself no rest. He had engaged to compose the music to Wolff’s Gipsy drama, <hi
                    rend="italic">Preciosa.</hi> Two months later this also was finished, and both
                    pieces ready for the stage.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the unsatisfactory state of affairs at Dresden, it had been
                    arranged that both <hi rend="italic">Preciosa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Der
                    Freischütz—</hi> no longer known by its original title, <hi rend="italic">Des
                    Jagers Braut—</hi> should be produced at Berlin. In February 1821 Sir Julius
                    Benedict was accepted by Weber as a pupil; and to his pen we owe a delightful
                    account of the rehearsals and first performance of his master’s <hi
                    rend="italic">chef d'oeuvre. Preciosa</hi> was produced with great success at
                    the old Berlin opera-house on June 14, 1821. On June 18, the anniversary of the
                    battle of Waterloo, the opening of the new “Schauspielhaus” was celebrated by
                    the production of <hi rend="italic">Der Freischütz.</hi> Much anxiety was caused
                    by unforeseen difficulties at the rehearsals; yet, so calm was Weber’s mind that
                    he devoted his leisure time to the composition of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Concertstück</hi> in F minor—one of his finest pianoforte pieces. Until the
                    last moment his friends were anxious; the author was not; and the result
                    justified his confidence in his own powers. The success of the piece was
                    triumphant. The work was received with equal enthusiasm at Vienna on October 3,
                    and at Dresden on January 2G, 1822. Yet Weber’s position as kapellmeister was
                    not much improved by his success, though, in order to remain faithful to his
                    engagements, he had refused tempting offers at Berlin and Cassel, and, at the
                    last-named place, had installed Ludwig Spohr in a position much more
                    advantageous than his own.</p>
                <p>For his next opera Weber accepted a libretto based, by Frau Wilhelmine von Chezy,
                    on the story of <hi rend="italic">Euryanthe,</hi> as originally told in the 13th
                    century, in Gilbert de Montreuil’s <hi rend="italic">Roman de la Violette,</hi>
                    and repeated with alterations in the <hi rend="italic">Decamerone,</hi> in
                    Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline,</hi> and in several later forms. In
                    place of the ghostly horrors of <hi rend="italic">Der Freischütz,</hi> the
                    romantic element was here supplied by the chivalric pomp of the Middle Ages. The
                    libretto, though soundly abused by shallow critics, is really an exceptionally
                    good one—in one respect superior to that of <hi rend="italic">Der
                    Freischütz,</hi> inasmuch as it substitutes elaborate recitative for the spoken
                    dialogue peculiar to the German “Schauspiel” and French “opéra comique.” It is,
                    in fact, a “grand opera” in every sense of the words,—the prototype of the
                    “musical drama” perfected fifty years later by Wagner. The overture—as usual,
                    written last— presents a feature that has never been imitated. During its
                    performance the curtain temporarily rises, to exhibit, in a <hi rend="italic"
                    >tableau vivant,</hi> the scene in the sepulchral vault upon which the whole
                    story turns. This episode is now rarely presented; but Weber himself well knew
                    how much the interest of the piece depended on it. The work was produced at the
                    Kärntnerthor theatre in Vienna, October 25, 1823, and received with enthusiasm.
                    Being of a less popular character than <hi rend="italic">Der Freischütz,</hi> it
                    is not so frequently performed; but it still retains its place upon the stage,
                    and ranks among the finest “romantic operas” that have ever been written.</p>
                <p>Weber’s third and last dramatic masterpiece was an English opera, written for
                    Covent Garden theatre, upon a libretto adapted by Planché from Wieland’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Oberon.</hi> Destined for the English stage sixty years ago, this
                    was necessarily disfigured by the spoken dialogue abandoned in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euryanthe</hi>; but in musical beauty it is quite equal to it, while its
                    fairies and mermaids are as vividly real as the spectres in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Der Freischütz.</hi> Though already far gone in consumption, Weber began to
                    compose the music on January 23, 1825. Charles Kemble had offered him £1000 for
                    the work, and he could not afford to rest. He finished the overture in London,
                    at the house of Sir George Smart, soon after his arrival, in March 1826; and on
                    April 12 the work was produced with triumphant success. But it cost the composer
                    his life. Wearied out with rehearsals and performances of the opera, and
                    concerts at which he was received with rapturous applause, he grew daily
                    perceptibly weaker; and, notwithstanding the care of his kind host, Sir George
                    Smart, and his family, he was found dead in his bed on the morning of June 5,
                    1826. For eighteen years his remains rested in a temporary grave in Moorfields
                    chapel; but in 1844 they were removed and placed in the family vault at
                    Dresden.</p>
                <p>Besides his three great dramatic masterpieces and the other works already
                    mentioned, Weber wrote two masses, two symphonies, eight cantatas, and a vast
                    amount of songs, orchestral and pianoforte pieces, and music of other kinds,
                    amounting altogether to more than 250 compositions. (W. S. R.)</p>
