                <p><label type="entry">WINNIPEG</label>, capital of the province of Manitoba, in the
                    Dominion of Canada, stands at the confluence of the Red River and the
                    Assiniboine, in 49° 56' N. lat. and 97° 7' W. long., and 764 feet above the sea.
                    Its name is taken from Lake Winnipeg (Ojibway, <hi rend="italic">Win,</hi>
                    “muddy,” and W⅛&gt;i, “water ”). The waters of the Red River reach the lake 45
                    miles north of the city. For some five miles north of “the Forks,” as the
                    junction of the rivers was formerly called, lay the old Red River colony of Lord
                    Selkirk, founded in 1812 (see vol. xx. p. 315). Five fur traders’ or colonists’
                    forts have stood within the city limits:—(1) Fort Rouge (1736), of the French
                    voyageurs; (2) Fort Gibraltar (1804-15), built by the north-west traders of
                    Montreal; (3) Fort Douglas (1813-35), Lord Selkirk’s fort; (4) old Fort Garry
                    (1821-35), of Hudson’s Bay Company; and (5) new Fort Garry (1835-82). The
                    transfer of Rupert’s Land to Canada in 1870 led to the formation of the province
                    of Manitoba. Then, too, Winnipeg was begun as a village, half a mile north of
                    Fort Garry. The city is built on the prairie; a part of the site was swampy, but
                    is being well drained. The city includes both sides of the Assiniboine, but on
                    the east side of the Red River there is an independent corporation, the town of
                    St Boniface, which is virtually a suburb. St Boniface, w ith 1449 inhabitants,
                    was first settled by Lord Selkirk’s German De Meuron soldiers in 1817. The
                    growth of Winnipeg has been remarkable. Living on its site in 1871 there were
                    but 241 souls. As Canadian immigration increased the village grew, and in 1873
                    it was incorporated as a city, in the face of strenuous opposition by the
                    Hudson’s Bay Company. The census of 1881 gave the city 7985 inhabitants. In the
                    following year Winnipeg, as being the central point of the Canadian Pacific
                    Railway, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, became a place of great
                    prospective importance. An enormous rise in values took place. The population of
                    the city doubled in a few months, and the wildest speculation took place. This
                    inflation, locally known as “the boom,” caused much damage, and in the following
                    year the collapse brought down almost all the business men of the city. The
                    population diminished very rapidly, but has risen again, and is now increasing.
                    The census of 1886 gave Winnipeg 20,238 inhabitants. The city has water, gas,
                    electricity, and ample fire protection, and architecturally presents a fine
                    appearance. Main Street, which is 132 feet wide and block-paved for a mile, is
                    stated to be one of the best streets in Canada. Being on the eastern edge of the
                    prairies, which run for a thousand miles to the Rocky Mountains, and standing to
                    the west of the great Laurentian formation extending from Montreal, Winnipeg is
                    an important railway centre. The first railway to reach the city was the Pembina
                    branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which connects with the railway system
                    of the United States. This took place in December 1878. The Canadian Pacific
                    Railway has not only its main line now running through the city, but five other
                    branches radiating from this centre. Forty miles of the Hudson’s Bay Railway, to
                    run from Winnipeg to York Factory, are already completed, and the Government of
                    Manitoba is constructing (1888) an independent line to connect with the American
                    railway system, to be known as the Red River Valley Railway. The total valuation
                    of property for the city for 1887 was $19,392,410, while the exports of the port
                    of Winnipeg for the year were of the value of $816,260, with $1,929,120 of
                    imports. There are seven chartered banks, and many branches of Canadian and
                    English life assurance and loan associations are in operation. In education
                    Winnipeg is the centre of the Canadian NorthWest. The Winnipeg public and
                    secondary schools compare favourably with those of other Canadian cities, and
                    employ 50 teachers, male and female. At Winnipeg is situated the provincial
                    university, to which are affiliated four colleges,—St Boniface (Roman Catholic),
                    St John’s (Church of England), Manitoba (Presbyterian), and Manitoba medical
                    college. The university has been voted 150,000 acres of wild land by the
                    Dominion Government, and has received $85,000 of a legacy from a native of
                    Rupert’s Land. There are 24 church buildings in the city and neighbourhood. The
                    census of 1886 gives the religion of the population as follows :—Church of
                    England, 5962; Presbyterians, 5271; Methodists, 3217; Roman Catholics, 2244. The
                    societies are the historical and scientific society, and St Andrew’s, St
                    George’s, St Patrick’s, St Jean Baptiste, Scandinavian, and Hebrew national
                    societies. Masonic, oddfellows’, and temperance organizations are strong. There
                    are two hospitals, besides a children’s home and maternity hospital. The finer
                    buildings and erections are the city hall, post-office, parliament buildings,
                    governor’s residence, court-house, college buildings, Hudson’s Bay Company
                    warehouse, Westminster block, Cauchon block, and the volunteer monument of 1886
                    on the City Square.</p>
