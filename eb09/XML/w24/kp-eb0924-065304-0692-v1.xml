                <p><label type="entry">WOOL AND WOOLLEN MANUFACTURES</label>. Wool is a modified
                    form of hair, distinguished by its slender, soft, and wavy or curly structure,
                    and by the highly imbricated or serrated surface of its filaments. The numerous
                    varieties of the sheep are the most characteristic, as they are also by far the
                    most important, producers of wool; but the sheep is by no means the only animal
                    which yields wool employed for industrial purposes. The alpaca and other allied
                    fibres obtained from the alpaca and its congeners in South America (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Alpaca,</hi> vol. i. p. 597, and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Llama,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 738), the mohair yielded by the Angora goat <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">(Mohaik,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 544), and the soft woolly hair
                    of the camel are all wools of much industrial importance, while the most costly
                    wool in the world is that yielded by the Cashmere goat of the Himalayan
                    Mountains. At what point indeed it can be said that an animal fibre ceases to be
                    hair and becomes wool it is impossible to determine, because in every
                    characteristic the one class by imperceptible gradations merges into the other,
                    so that a continuous chain can be formed from the finest and softest merino to
                    the rigid bristles of the wild boar.</p>
                <p>Next to cotton, wool is the most important of all textile fibres used by mankind.
                    From the ease with which it may be made into thread, and owing to the comfort
                    derived from clothing of woollen texture, it naturally would be the textile
                    first used by mankind for clothing. The testimony of all ancient records goes to
                    prove the high antiquity of woollen textures and the early importance of the
                    sheep. The different kinds of wool and the cloth made from them in antiquity are
                    described by Pliny <hi rend="italic">(H. N.,</hi> viii. 73, 74, 190 <hi
                        rend="italic">sq.).</hi></p>
                <p>Among the arts of civilized life which the British Isles owe to the Romans not
                    the least important was the spinning and weaving of wool. The sheep certainly
                    was a domestic animal in England long before the period of the Roman occupation;
                    and it is most probable that such use was made of sheep skins and of wool as was
                    common among uncivilized races. But the Romans established a woollen factory
                    whence the occupying army was supplied with clothing, and the value of the
                    manufacture was soon recognized by the Britons, of whom Tacitus remarks, “Inde
                    etiam habitus nostri honor et frequens toga” <hi rend="italic">(Agric.,</hi> c.
                    21). The product of the Winchester looms, and the wool whence it was made, soon
                    established a reputation abroad, it being remarked that “the wool of Britain is
                    often spun so fine that it is in a manner comparable to the spider’s thread.”
                    The reputation which English wool at this early period established was
                    maintained throughout mediaeval times; and the fibre was in great demand in the
                    Low Countries and other Continental centres where skill in manufacture was
                    highly developed. There are many allusions to woollen manufactures in England in
                    early times; but altogether the native industry could not rival the products of
                    the Continent, although the troubles in various industrial centres, from time to
                    time, caused skilled workers in wool to seek an asylum in England. In the time
                    of William the Conqueror Flemish weavers settled under the protection of the
                    queen at Carlisle, but subsequently they were removed to Pembrokeshire. At
                    various periods in the reigns of succeeding monarchs further immigrations of
                    skilled Flemish weavers occurred, and they were planted at different places
                    throughout the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n693/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0693-0654"/> country. The cloth fair in the church yard of
                    the priory of St Bartholomew was instituted by Henry II.; guilds of weavers were
                    established; and the exclusive privilege of exporting woollen cloth was granted
                    to the city of London. Edward III. made special efforts to encourage woollen
                    industries according to the manner in which it was supposed in mediaeval times
                    that trade could be best encouraged. He brought weavers, dyers, and fullers from
                    Flanders; he himself wore Flemish cloth; and to stimulate native industry he
                    prohibited under pain of life and limb the exportation of English wool. Previous
                    to the time of Edward III. English wool had been in larger demand on the
                    Continent, where it had a reputation exceeded only by the wool of Spain, which
                    for ages provided Europe with the best material for cloth-making. The customs
                    duties levied on the export of wool were an important source of the royal
                    revenue, and Edward III.’s attempt to stop the trade appears to have been an
                    honest though misguided attempt to foster native manufactures. His prohibitory
                    law was, however, found to be unworkable, and the utmost that both he and his
                    successors were able to effect was to hamper the export trade by vexatious
                    restrictions and to encourage much “running” or smuggling of wool. Thus while
                    Edward III. limited the right of exporting to merchant strangers, we find that
                    Edward IV. decreed that no alien should export wool and that denizens should
                    export it only to Calais. Legislation of this kind prevailed till the reign of
                    Elizabeth, when the free exportation of English wool was permitted; and Smith,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Wool,</hi> points out that it was during
                    this reign that the manufacture made the most rapid progress in the country. In
                    1660 the absolute prohibition of the export of wool was again decreed, and it
                    was not till 1825 that this prohibitory law was finally repealed. The
                    prohibition appears to have been based on the mistaken notion that England
                    possessed a monopoly of the finest kinds of wool, and that by withholding it
                    from foreign competitors the home manufacturers would command the markets of the
                    world. The results of the prohibitory law were exceedingly detrimental: the
                    production of wool far exceeded the consumption; the price of the raw material
                    fell; wool “running” or smuggling became an organized traffic; and the whole
                    industry became disarranged. Extraordinary expedients were resorted to for
                    stimulating the demand for woollen manufactures, among which was an Act passed
                    in the reign of Charles II. decreeing that all dead bodies should be buried in
                    woollen shrouds,—an enactment which remained in the Statute Book, if not in
                    force, for a period of 120 years. On the opening up of the colonies, every
                    effort was made to encourage the use of English cloth, and the manufacture was
                    discouraged and even prohibited in Ireland.</p>
                <p>It was not without reason that the attention of monarchs and legislators was so
                    frequently directed to the woollen industries. Wool was indeed “the flower and
                    strength and revenue and blood of England,” and till the development of the
                    cotton trade, towards the end of the 18th century, the woollen industries were,
                    beyond comparison, the most important sources of wealth in the country. What the
                    actual value of the trade at any early period was it is impossible to ascertain,
                    and the estimates of wool production and the value of the manufactures in the
                    17th and 18th centuries vary widely. Towards the close of the 17th century the
                    wool produced in England was estimated to be worth £2,000,000 yearly, furnishing
                    £8,000,000 worth of manufactured goods, of which there was exported about
                    £2,000,000 in value. In 1700 the official value of woollen goods exported was
                    about £3,000,000, and in the third quarter of the century the exports had
                    increased in value by about £500,000 only. In 1774 Dr Campbell <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Political Survey of Great Britain)</hi> estimated the number of sheep in
                    England at 10,000,000 or 12,000,000, the value of the wool produced yearly at
                    £3,000,000, the manufactured products at £12,000,000, and the exports at
                    £3,000,000 to £4,000,000. He also reckoned that the industry then gave
                    employment to 1,000,000 persons. These figures, in the light of the dimensions
                    of present day industries, may appear small, but they bore a predominant
                    relationship to the other great sources of employment and trade of the period.
                    In 1800 the native crop of wool was estimated to amount to 96,000,000 lb; and,
                    import duty not being imposed till 1802, the quantity brought from abroad was
                    8,600,000 lb, 6,000,000 lb of which came from Spain. In 1825 the importation of
                    colonial wool became free, the duty leviable having been for several previous
                    years as high as 6d. per lb, and in 1844 the duty was finally remitted on
                    foreign wool also.</p>
                <p>Sheep were introduced at Jamestown in Virginia in 1609, and in 1633 the animals
                    were first brought to Boston. Ten years later a fulling mill was erected at
                    Rowley, Mass., “by Mr Rowley’s people, who were the first that set upon making
                    cloth in this western world.” The factory woollen industry was, however, not
                    established till the close of the 18th century, and it is recorded that the
                    first carding machine put in operation in the United States was constructed in
                    1794 under the supervision of John and Arthur Schofield.</p>
                <p>The prevailing colour of sheep’s wool is white, but it must not be forgotten that
                    there are races with black, brown, fawn, yellow, and grey shades of wool. For
                    manufacturing purposes generally white wool is, of course, most valuable, but
                    for the homespuns, which in earlier times absorbed the bulk of wool, natural
                    colours were in many cases desirable and used with good effect. In domestic
                    spinning, knitting, and weaving, natural colours are still largely taken
                    advantage of, as in the cases of rough yarns, Shetland knitted shawls, Highland
                    tweeds, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>As has already been indicated, the distinction between wool and hair lies chiefly
                    in the great fineness, softness, and waved delicacy of woollen fibre, combined
                    with a highly serrated surface. These peculiarities are precisely the characters
                    which give wool its distinctive value as a textile fibre, and most distinctive
                    of all is the serrated structure which specially belongs to wool and gives it
                    the important property of felting, upon which many of its applications depend.
                    The serrations of wool and the wavy structure it assumes are closely connected,
                    those wools which have the greatest number of serrations being also most finely
                    waved in structure. The appearance presented by wool under the microscope, as
                    compared with the aspect of certain other animal fibres, is shown in fig. 1
                    (compare vol. ix. p. 133). The imbrications all lie in one direction,—from the
                    root, their growing point, upwards to the apex of the fibre,—so tlιat, while a
                    lock of wool drawn between the finger and thumb from the root end outwards slips
                    quite smoothly, if drawn in the contrary direction from point to root it offers
                    a distinct resistance, and the fibre feels harsh and rough. Under the influence
                    of moisture and pressure, tangled masses of wool thoroughly interlock and mat
                    together, by the mutual clutching of the serrations of the fibres, and it is
                    thus that the shrinking and thickening of woollen textures under washing is
                    accounted for, and the capacity of cloth for felting or fulling is due to this
                    condition of the fibre. The serrations are most numerous, acute, pointed, and
                    distinct in fine merino wools, as many as 2800 per inch being counted in
                    specimens of the finest Saxony wools. In the Leicester wool of England, on the
                    other hand, which is a long bright staple, the serratures are not only much
                    fewer in number, counting about 1800, but they are also less pronounced <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n694/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0694-0655"/> in character, so that the fibre presents a
                    smoother, less waved character. In some inferior wools the serrations are not so
                    many as 500 per inch. A similar difference may be noted in the fineness of the
                    fibres. Saxony lambs’ wool has a diameter of from <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>
                    5⅛0 to <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛⅛- <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> inch,
                    whilst coarse Algerian wools may rise to a maximum diameter of about inch.</p>
                <p>Other distinguishing qualities of good wool consist in uniformity and strength of
                    fibre with freedom from tender or weak portions in its length, a condition which
                    not unfrequently arises from ill lιealth in the sheep. In ill-bred wool there
                    may also be found intermingled “kemps” or dead hairs,— straight coarse shining
                    fibres which show conspicuously among the wool, and become even more prominent
                    in the manufactured and · dyed goods. Wool also possesses a softness of touch
                    and an elasticity both in the raw and manufactured * condition which &lt;
                    distinguish it from all other fibres. In length of staple it varies very much,
                    attaining in combing wools to a length of as much as 15 to 20 inches. As a rule
                    the fine felting wools are! short in staple, these constituting carding or
                    woollen yarn wools; and the longer are lustrous and comparatively straight, and
                    thus most suitable for combing or worsted wools. The latter wools approach
                    mohair and alpaca in their characters, and they are prepared and spun by the
                    same class of machinery.</p>
                <p>The bulk of the wool of commerce comes into the market in the form of fleece
                    wool, the product of a single year’s growth, cut from the body of the living
                    animal. The first and finest clip, called lambs’ wool, may be taken from the
                    young sheep at about the age of eight months. When the animal is not shorn till
                    it attains the age of twelve or fourteen months the wool is known as hogg or
                    hogget, and it, like lambs’ wool, is fine and tapers into long thin ends. All
                    subsequently cut fleeces are known as wether wool, and possess relatively
                    somewhat less value than the first clip. Fleece wool as it comes into the market
                    is either “in the grease,” that is, unwashed, and with all tlιe dirt which
                    gathers to the surface of the greasy wool present; or it is received as “washed”
                    wool, the washing being done as a preliminary to the sheep-shearing. Skin wool
                    is that which is obtained from sheep which either die or are killed. Such wool
                    is always of inferior value and much impregnated with lime from the steeping
                    pits in the tan-yards in which the skins are first treated to soften and swell
                    the skin for facilitating the easy separation of the wool from it.</p>
                <p>The wool market is supplied from almost every quarter of the globe, and the
                    qualities and varieties of the article are exceedingly numerous. The range of
                    woollen and worsted manufactures is also very wide, and the raw material
                    suitable for one section of the trade is not at all fitted to supply other
                    sections. Much more than is the case in any other textile industry we have in
                    the woollen trades practically a series of separate and distinct industries,
                    each with its own appropriate class of raw materials. The main distinctions
                    are—(1) carding wools, in which felting properties are desirable; (2) combing
                    wools, requiring length of staple and brightness of fibre, for hard-spun
                    nonfelting worsteds; and (3) carpet and knitting wools, in which long and strong
                    if somewhat coarse staple are the essential qualities. Breeding, climate, and
                    food are the main factors in developing and rearing special races of sheep in
                    which the qualities essential for producing the raw materials of any of these
                    sections of industry are secured.</p>
                <p>For centuries the finer wools used for cloth-making throughout Europe were
                    obtained from Spain, which was the home of the famous merino breed developed
                    from races of sheep originally introduced into the Peninsula by the Romans. Till
                    early in the present century the superiority of Spanish merinos remained
                    unchallenged, but the Peninsular War and its attendant evils produced a
                    depreciation of quality concurrently with the introduction of Saxon and Silesian
                    wools, which suddenly supplanted the product of Spain, and hold the first place
                    down to the present day. The Spanish merino sheep was introduced into Saxony by
                    the elector in 1765, and by judicious crossing with the best native race
                    developed the famous electoral breed. Merinos were carried to Hungary in 1775,
                    and to France in 1776, and in 1786 Daubenton brought them to Rambouillet, whence
                    a famous race developed. In 1802 the first merinos known to have left pure
                    descendants were taken to the United States, and in 1809-10 an importation
                    (4000) of merino sheep was made. The introduction of merino blood has also
                    largely modified certain of the breeds of English sheep, and from tlιem, crossed
                    with the English breeds, Southdowns and Leicesters, have sprung the vast flocks
                    of sheep in the various Australasian colonies, which now bid fair to supply the
                    whole world witlι wools of tlιe merino class, and of the very highest
                    quality.</p>
                <p>Of colonial wools, which are now by a long way the ∣ most important supplied to
                    the British market, the best qualities come from Port Phillip, Sydney, and
                    Adelaide, the first of these being excelled in quality as a clothmaking wool by
                    the merinos of Saxony and Silesia alone. New Zealand also yields a very large
                    annual crop of wool of high quality, and the wool of Tasmania is generally of
                    fine colour, sound and uniform in staple. The Cape of Good Hope is the source of
                    a large supply of wool, much of which, lιowever, is unequal in strength and
                    somewhat kempy in character. A great proportion of tlιe wool which comes from
                    South America is seriously deteriorated by burrs, and it is of a character which
                    fits it for the worsted manufacture alone.</p>
                <p>The wools grown in tlιe L <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> nited Kingdom may be
                    separated into three classes—(1) short or carding wool; (2) long or combing
                    wool; and (3) blanket, carpet, and knitting wool. Of short wools Southdown may
                    be taken as the type and best example. It is a staple of excellent quality,
                    milling well, and suitable either for the woollen or worsted trade. The long
                    wools of greatest importance are obtained from the Lincoln and Leicester sheep.
                    These breeds yield a long fleece of remarkable lustre, and it was the possession
                    of this class of wool which gave England its high reputation in former times as
                    a wool-producing country. A similar quality of wool is also obtained from the
                    East Riding Yorkshire breed of sheep. Cheviot wool <pb break="no"

                    qualities, but is destitute of the latter’s peculiar lustre, and is shorter in
                    staple, though strong in fibre, with good milling qualities, which render it
                    valuable for the tweed manufacture. Intermediate between the long and short
                    there are several British breeds, which have been established either by crosses
                    or local conditions and treatment, the most important of these being found in
                    Shropshire, Staffordshire, and Norfolk. The carpet wools are yielded by sheep of
                    the type of the Blackface of the mountainous regions of Scotland, from which is
                    obtained a fleece of long staple but somewhat unequal qualities. Much of the
                    Highland wool is “laid,” that is, impregnated with tar, from the practice of the
                    stock-masters of smearing the animals with a mixture of tar and fat immediately
                    after shearing, with a view of protecting them from the rigours of the climate.
                    Of wools of a special character there may be noted Welsh wool, which possesses
                    properties fitting it pre-eminently for the making of the famed Welsh flannels,
                    and Shetland wool, which being very fine and soft in its nature is almost
                    entirely worked up into delicate yarns for knitting the well-known Shetland
                    shawls and other knitted work.</p>
                <p>The weight of a fleece of wool of the various breeds of sheep ranges from under 2
                    lb in the case of the small Shetland breeds up to 8 or 9 ft&gt; for the large
                    merinos and other heavy races, and in exceptional cases a heavy ram’s fleece may
                    reach so much as 15 lb; but, taken all over, sheep may be reckoned to yield on
                    an average 5 B&gt; of wool in a year.</p>
                <p>Where there is abundance of water and other con veniences it is the practice to
                    wash or half-wash sheep previous to shearing, and such wool comes into the
                    market as washed or half-washed fleece. The surface of a fleece has usually a
                    thick coating of dirt adhering to it, and in the cases of merino breeds the
                    fleece surface is firmly caked together into large solid masses, from the
                    adhesion of dirt to the wool constantly moist with the exudation from the skin
                    of the greasy yolk or “suint,” so that in an unwashed fleece nearly 30 per cent,
                    of weight may represent dirt, and about 40 per cent, the greasy suint which
                    lubricates the wool, while the pure wool is not more than one-third part of the
                    whole. The yolk forms a protective covering to the sheep, rendering the fleece
                    impervious to moisture, and while left in the wool also preserves it soft,
                    pliant, and silky to touch. It forms a kind of natural soap, consisting
                    principally of potash salts with animal oil, almost entirely soluble in cold
                    water. The following analyses of German merino wool—the variety in which suint
                    is most largely developed—illustrate the difference which may result in the
                    composition of the fibre from the simple washing of the fleece on the sheep’s
                    back :—</p>

                <p>Wool, however, which is merely washed in the rough-and-ready manner described
                    below still retains great and variable quantities of suint, &amp;c. Where
                    running streams exist, the sheep are penned by the side of the water, and taken
                    one by one and held in the stream while they are washed, one man holding and the
                    other washing. The operation is objectionable in many ways, as it pollutes the
                    stream, and it dissipates no mean amount of potash salts, valuable for manure or
                    for other chemical purposes. Sheep washing appliances are now largely employed,
                    the arrangement consisting of a pen into which the sheep are driven and
                    subjected to a strong spray of water either hot or cold, which soaks the fleece
                    and softens the dirt. This done, they are caused to swim along a tank which
                    narrows towards the exit, and just as they pass out of the pen they are caught
                    and subjected to a strong douche of pure water. After a few days the wool of a
                    washed sheep is sufficiently dry for shearing or clipping, which is thereupon
                    done.</p>
                <p>A skilful shepherd will clip the fleece from a sheep in one unbroken continuous
                    sheet, retaining the form and relative positions of the mass almost as if the
                    creature had been skinned. In this unbroken condition each fleece is rolled up
                    by itself, which greatly facilitates the sorting or stapling which all wool
                    undergoes for the separation of the several qualities which make up the
                    fleece.</p>
                <p>Sorting or stapling was formerly a distinct industry, and to some extent it is so
                    still, though frequently the work is done in the premises of the spinners.
                    Carding wools are separated and classed differently from combing wools, and in
                    dealing with fleeces from different races the classification of the sorter
                    varies. In the woollen trade short-staple wool is separated into qualities,
                    known, in descending series from the finest to the most worthless, as picklock,
                    prime, choice, super, head, seconds, abb, and breech, and the proportions in
                    which the higher and lower qualities are present are determined by the qualities
                    of the fleece or the race yielding the wool. In the worsted trade the
                    classification goes, also in descending series, from fine, blue, neat, brown,
                    breech, downright, seconds, to abb. The last three are short and not commonly
                    used in the worsted trade. The greater proportion of good English long wool will
                    be classified as blue, neat, and brown; it is only in exceptional cases that
                    more than from 5 to 8 per cent, is “fine” on the one hand, or of lower quality
                    than breech on the other. Generally speaking, the best portion of a fleece is
                    from the shoulders and side of the animal (1 in fig. 2). The wool from 2 is
                    irregular in growth, and often filled with burrs, &amp;c.; from the loin 3 it is
                    shorter of staple and coarser, characters which become increasingly pronounced
                    as we approach the tail and hind quarter 4. The belly wool 5 is short, worn, and
                    dirty, as is also the front of the throat 6, while on the head and shins 7 the
                    product is short, stiff, and straight, more like hair than wool.</p>
                <p>The sorter works at a table or frame covered with wire netting through which dust
                    and dirt fall as he handles the wool. Fleeces which have been hard packed in
                    bales, especially if unwashed, go into dense hard masses, which must be heated
                    till the softening of the yolk and the swelling of the fibres make them pliable
                    and easily opened up. When the fleece is spread out the stapler first divides it
                    into two equal sides; then he picks away all straws, large burrs, and tarry
                    fragments which are visible; and then with marvellous precision and certainty he
                    picks out his separate qualities, throwing each lot into its allotted
                    receptacle. Sorting is very far removed from being a mere mechanical process of
                    selecting and separating the wool from certain regions of the fleece, because in
                    each individual fleece qualities and proportions differ, and it is only by long
                    experience that a stapler is enabled, almost as it were by instinct, rightly to
                    divide up his lots, so as to produce even qualities of raw material.</p>
                <p>The washing which a fleece receives on the live sheep <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n696/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0696-0657"/> is not sufficient for the ordinary purposes
                    of the manufacturer. The scouring process is thus the first link in the long
                    chain of manufacturing processes through which wool passes. On the careful and
                    complete manner in which scouring is effected much depends. The qualities of the
                    fibre may be seriously injured by injudicious treatment, while, if the wool is
                    imperfectly cleansed, it will take on dye colours unevenly, and all the
                    subsequent manufacturing operations will be more or less unsatisfactory. The
                    water used should be soft and pure, both to save soap and still more because the
                    insoluble lime soap formed in dissolving soap in hard water is deposited on the
                    woollen fibres and becomes so entangled that its removal is a matter of extreme
                    difficulty. Wool washed with hard water is always harsh to the touch, and takes
                    on dye colours but unevenly, owing to the interference of unremoved lime soap.
                    In former times stale urine was a favourite medium in which to scour wool; but
                    that is now disused, and a specially prepared potash soap is the detergent
                    principally relied on. Excess of alkali has to be guarded against, since
                    uncombined caustic acts energetically on the wool fibre, and is indeed a solvent
                    of it. On this account a soap solution of too great strength leaves the wool
                    harsh and brittle, and the same detrimental result arises when the soapy
                    solution is applied too hot.</p>
                <p>In former days, when the method of hand-scouring prevailed, the wool to be washed
                    was placed with hot soap-sud in a large scouring “bowl” or vat, and two men with
                    long poles kept stirring it gently about till the detergent loosened and
                    separated the dirt and dissolved the grease. The wool was then lifted out and
                    drained, after which it was rinsed in a current of clean water to remove the
                    “scour,” and then dried. These operations are now performed by mechanical
                    agencies; and, to save soap, it is the practice to first steep the wool in
                    steepers,—tubs having a perforated false bottom in which steam is blown through
                    the wool steeped in pure water. The process removes much mechanically mixed
                    dirt, and softens the other impurities, expanding the fibres themselves, and
                    thus rendering the scouring operation easier and more expeditious. In machine
                    scouring the object aimed at is to bring all the wool equally under the
                    influence of the soapy solution, and to prevent it from matting into lumps in
                    its progress through the washing bowls. Usually the wool passes through two sets
                    of bowls, the soap solution being stronger in the first set. The wool is fed
                    into one extremity of the bowl, which is an oblong vat, by an endless apron from
                    which it passes to an immersed plate which sinks it into the hot soapy solution,
                    where the whole is thoroughly soaked. It is then carried to the opposite end of
                    the bowl, either by a series of forks or rakes with reciprocating motion, or by
                    sets of iron prongs fixed at a uniform distance on a frame to which
                    reciprocating action is communicated by eccentric mounting. These carry the wool
                    forward by gentle progression, so as not to ball it, till at the upper end it is
                    caught and squeezed between rollers to wring out part of the water from the
                    fibres, and then passed on for further drying.</p>
                <p>The more gently and uniformly the drying can be effected the better is the result
                    attained, and over-drying of wool has to be specially guarded against. By some
                    manufacturers the wool from the squeezing rollers is whizzed in a
                    hydro-extractor, which drives out so much of the moisture that the further
                    drying is easily effected. The commonest way, however, of drying is to spread
                    the wool as uniformly as possible over a framework of wire netting, under which
                    are a range of steam-heated pipes, the sides being enclosed in a framing of
                    wood. A fan blast blows air over these hot pipes, and the heated air passes up
                    and is forced through the layer of wool which rests on the netting. Unless the
                    wool is spread with great evenness it gets unequally dried, and at points where
                    the hot air escapes freely it may be much over-dried. A more rapid and uniform
                    result is obtained by the use of Petrie’s wool drier, which consists of a close
                    chamber divided into five horizontal compartments, the floors of which consist
                    of alternate fixed and movable bars. Under the chamber are a tubular heating
                    apparatus and a fan by which a powerful current of heated air is blown up the
                    side of the chamber, and through all the shelves or compartments successively,
                    passing in the path over which the wool slowly travels. The wool is entered by
                    continuous feed at one side of the chamber; the strength of the blast carries it
                    up and deposits it on the upper shelf, and by the action of the movable bars,
                    which are worked by cranks, it is carried forward to the opposite end, whence it
                    drops to the next lower shelf, and so on it travels till at the extremity of the
                    lower shelf it passes out by the delivery lattice well and equally dried.
                    Moore’s drier is a simpler and less expensive form of drying apparatus,
                    intermittent in its action. It consists of a case enclosed except as regards the
                    top, where there are openings to allow the escape of moist air. It contains two
                    tiers of steam-heated pipes, and directly over the top of each tier there is a
                    row of iron rollers of small diameter set close together. At one end of the
                    machine is a door for feeding wool into it, and at the opposite extremity is a
                    spiked drum geared to rotate at a high speed. A fixed quantity of wool is fed
                    into the machine at one time and placed on the lower series of rollers. These in
                    their rotation carry the wool forward exposed to the heat of the pipes both
                    above and below, till it reaches the drum, which, revolving rapidly, lifts it to
                    the higher range of rollers. Over these the wool is carried back, till at the
                    other end it again falls to the lower range, and so it circulates through the
                    machine till the drying is completed. To withdraw the dried wool it is only
                    necessary to raise the outlet door over the revolving drum, when it throws out
                    the contents of the machine as fast as the wool comes within its range.</p>
                <p>The dried wool, notwithstanding the several manipulations to which it has been
                    subjected, is still in the condition of matted locks, which have to be opened up
                    and the whole material brought into a uniformly free and loose condition. This
                    is effected in the Willey or teazing machine, which consists of a large drum and
                    three small cylinders mounted in an enclosed frame. The drum is armed with
                    ranges of powerful hooked teeth or spikes, and is geared to rotate with great
                    rapidity, making about 500 revolutions per minute. The smaller cylinders, called
                    workers, are also provided with strong spikes; they are mounted over the drum
                    and revolve more slowly in a direction contrary to the drum, the spikes of which
                    just clear those of the workers. The wool is fed into the drum, which carries it
                    round with great velocity; but, as it passes on, the locks are caught by the
                    spikes of the workers, and in the contest for possessing the wool the matted
                    locks are torn asunder till the whole wool is delivered in a light, free, and
                    disentangled condition.</p>
                <p>For certain classes of dirty wool, notably such as that which comes from Buenos
                    Ayres, still another preparing operation is essential at this stage—that is, the
                    removal of burrs or small persistently adherent seeds and other fragments of
                    vegetable matter which remain in the wool. Two methods of effecting this—one
                    chemical, the other mechanical—may be pursued. The chemical treatment consists
                    in steeping the wool in a dilute solution of sulphuric acid, draining off the
                    dilute acid by means of the hydro-extractor, and then immediately exposing the
                    wool to further rapid drying in a heat of about 250° F. The acid leaves the wool
                    itself uninjured, but is retained <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n697/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0697-0658"/> by the more absorbent vegetable matter, and
                    the high heat causes it to combine so energetically with the water left in the
                    burrs that the vegetable matter becomes completely carbonized. The wool is
                    thereupon washed in water rendered sufficiently alkaline to neutralize any free
                    acid which may remain, and dried. The same burrremoving effect is obtained by
                    the use of a solution of chloride of aluminium, a method said to be safer for
                    the wool and less hurtful to the attendant workmen than is the sulphuric acid
                    process. For mechanical removing of burrs, a machine something like the Willey
                    in appearance is employed. The main feature of this apparatus is a large drum or
                    swift armed with fine short spikes curved slightly in the direction in which it
                    rotates. By a series of beaters and circular brushes the wool is carried to and
                    fed on these short spikes, and in its rotation the burrs, owing to their weight,
                    hang out from the swift. The swift as it travels round is met by a series of
                    three burring rollers rotating in an opposite direction, the projecting rails of
                    which knock the burrs off the wool. The burrs fall on a grating and are ejected,
                    with, of course, a good deal of wool adhering to them, by another rotating
                    cylinder.</p>
                <p>There remains yet another preliminary operation through which wool generally has
                    to pass previous to the spinning processes. As delivered from the drying
                    apparatus the wool is bright and clean, but somewhat harsh and wiry to the touch
                    owing to the removal of the yolk which is its natural lubricant. To render it
                    properly soft and elastic, and to improve its spinning qualities, the fibre is
                    sprinkled with a percentage of oil, comparatively small quantities —by some
                    spinners none—being used for worsted wools, but a larger amount being applied in
                    the oiling of wool for woollen manufactures. The oil further has the advantage
                    of producing a certain adhesiveness of the fibre in the spinning process, and
                    thus it enables the spinner to get a more level and finer yarn, and it prevents
                    loss from the flying off of separate fibres. As the oil is a costly item, it is
                    of consequence that it should be equally distributed and used in a thrifty
                    manner, for which end various forms of oiling apparatus have been devised, which
                    sprinkle the oil in a very fine spray over thinly distributed wool carried by an
                    endless cloth under the sprinkler. Gallipoli olive oil is the best medium for
                    oiling combing wool; and for carding wool the liquid olein expressed from tallow
                    and lard in the preparation of stearin is employed with advantage.</p>
                <p>The raw material is now ready for the various spinning and other processes by
                    which it is worked into useful forms; but pure wool of one quality alone is not
                    generally used in the production of woven fabrics. For many reasons—among which
                    cheapness figures prominently— wools are blended, and to no inconsiderable
                    extent the added material consists of shoddy, mungo, or extract wools (see
                    below). Blending with cotton is also practised, and for some purposes silk and
                    wool are mixed. The question of colour as well as quality also determines
                    blending operations, natural coloured wools being frequently intermixed to
                    obtain particular shades for tweeds, knitting yarns, &amp;c. The various
                    materials to be intermixed are bedded in due proportion in separate layers over
                    each other, and passed through a teazer, from which they issue so intimately
                    intermixed that they present a uniform appearance.</p>
                <p>The processes hitherto described—although woollen manufacture has been specially
                    kept in View—are more or less essential to wool for all purposes to which it is
                    applied. But from this point the manufacturing operations diverge into three
                    main channels, which may be regarded as almost distinct textile industries.
                    First and simplest we have the felt manufacture, in which cloth is made without
                    either spinning or weaving; second is the woollen yarn and cloth manufacture,
                    embracing the preparation of carded yarns and of cloth which is so milled or
                    felted as to have the appearance of felt; and, thirdly, in the worsted yarn and
                    cloth industry combed yarn is prepared and cloth showing the yarn and pattern is
                    woven. These definitions must be taken to be accurate only in the broad general
                    acceptation.</p>
                <p>Felt is a kind of cloth made without spinning or weaving, but simply by the
                    mutual adhesion of the imbricated fibres. The peculiar property is most
                    distinctly developed in the short or carding wools, but all wool, in common with
                    mohair, alpaca, vicugna, and camel’s hair, possesses it. Felting properties are
                    also found in the hair of other animals; the rabbit, especially, supplies the
                    finer felts used for hat-making, while the beaver hat, which is the ancestor of
                    the modern dress hat, was a felt of beaver hair. Felted cloth is made by the
                    combined influence of heat, moisture, and pressure or rubbing on a uniformly
                    spread-out mass of woollen fibres. The wool is scribbled or carded out into a
                    uniform lap of extreme thinness, but of a length and breadth sufficient for the
                    size of the cloth to be made. A series of these carded laps are superimposed on
                    each other till the requisite thickness of material is attained, and generally
                    the two external laps are made of material superior to the body. The lap so
                    prepared is passed on between a series of pairs of rollers, which press against
                    each other partly immersed in a trough of water, the upper rollers being solid
                    and heavy while those under are hollow and heated by steam. To the upper rollers
                    a gentle reciprocating motion is communicated, so that the material is felted as
                    it passes on. When duly condensed, the cloth, of leathery consistence, is dyed,
                    printed, dressed, and finished, when required, like ordinary woollen cloths.
                    Felt has extensive applications, there being made from it druggets, carpets,
                    table-covers, horse-cloths, &amp;c.; the coarser varieties are used for
                    boiler-covering and other mechanical purposes.</p>
                <p>It becomes necessary here to indicate the specific distinction of woollen and
                    worsted yarns and cloth. In a general way it may be said that woollen yarns are
                    those made from short wools possessed of high felting qualities, which are
                    prepared by a process of carding, whereby the fibres are as far as possible
                    crossed and interlocked with each other, and that these cardings, though hard
                    spun on the mule frame, form a light fluffy yarn, which suits the material when
                    woven into cloth for being brought into the semi-felted condition by milling
                    which is the distinguishing characteristic of woollen cloth. On the other hand,
                    worsted yarns are generally made from the long lustrous varieties of wool; the
                    fibres are so combed as to bring them as far as possible to lie parallel to each
                    other; the spinning is done on the throstle frame, and the yarn is spun into a
                    compact, smooth, and level thread, which, when woven into cloth, is not milled
                    or felted. At all points, however, woollen and worsted yarns as thus defined
                    overlap each other, some woollens being made from longer wool than certain
                    worsteds, and worsteds being, when made from short staple wool, also carded as
                    well as combed; and occasionally worsted yarn is spun on the mule frame, while
                    milling or felting is a process done in all degrees,—woollen being sometimes not
                    at all milled, while to some worsteds a certain milling finish is given. The
                    fundamental distinction between the classes rests in the crossing and
                    interlacing of the fibres in preparing woollen yarn,—an operation confined to
                    this alone among all textiles, while for worsted yarn the fibres are treated, as
                    in the case of all other textile materials, by processes designed to bring them
                    into a smooth parallel relationship to each other.</p>
                <p>Woollen yarns, as above explained, are exclusively made by the process of
                    carding. The simple apparatus—the hand-cards—with which carding was done before
                    the introduction of machinery and factory-work consisted of square or oblong
                    pieces of board with handles, one face of the board being covered with card
                    leather, which was closely studded with fine elastic steel teeth, pointed in one
                    direction and bent as in fig. 3. These teeth were strong or fine according to
                    the nature, length, and strength of the fibre to be carded, but the finer the
                    teeth the more closely were they studded together. A quantity of teased and
                    oiled wool was placed on the surface of one card, which, taken in the left hand,
                    was held teeth upλvard on the lap of the operator, while the other card, held in
                    the right hand teeth downward, and consequently pointed in an opposite
                    direction, was drawn from end to end over it, each card thus taking up a share
                    of the wool which became entangled in its teeth. In this way, by drawing the one
                    card over the other repeatedly, the whole of the wool was ultimately separated
                    and equally distributed over the pair of cards. The wool was then stripped out
                    of the cards by drawing the teeth of one through those of the other in the
                    direction of their inclination. The carded wool thus lifted out was condensed
                    into a loose but uniform round pipe or “carding” by rolling on the back of the
                    card, and these cardings were then ready for spinning on the wheel.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n698/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0698-0659"/>
                <p>For the apparently simple operation of carding, the factory machinery is complex,
                    delicate, and very expensive. Ordinarily it consists of three carding-engines,
                    called respectively the scribbler, the intermediate, and the finisher, but
                    sometimes the intermediate is omitted. In each of these there is a complicated
                    series of card-covered cylinders of different diameters running at different
                    rates of speed, sometimes in a contrary and sometimes in the same direction,
                    which are engaged in contending with each other for the wool supplied to the
                    machine, in abstracting it altogether from their neighbours, and passing it on
                    to be again contended for and teased in the operation, and finally passed clean
                    out of the machine. A sectional illustration (fig. 4) of the first portion of a
                    “scribbler” will serve as an illustration of the whole operation from beginning
                    to end. The wool is entered to the apparatus by a travelling lattice, the supply
                    being equalized and carefully distributed by a mechanical feed. It is caught
                    between the lower two of a range of three feedrollers <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> revolving immediately behind
                    which is the “licker-in” roller <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which immediately
                    takes possession of the portion of the feed which has fallen to the share of the
                    lower or No. 1 feed-roller.</p>
                <p>The remainder of the feed is carried upward on the middle feed-roller, from which
                    it is taken by the uppermost of the three rollers <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and
                    from it the wool is delivered to the “licker-in.” In this way a certain amount
                    of preliminary blending and intermixing is accomplished. Against the licker-in
                    revolves the “angle stripper” c, the function of which is to remove the wool
                    from the former and deliver it over to the great breast cylinder, which revolves
                    at a high speed (surface-velocity about ∣ mile per minute). By the cylinder it
                    is carried on till it comes against a small roller revolving slowly in the
                    opposite direction, called “worker No. 1” <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> which
                    abstracts part of the wool, and carrying it round gives it up to the somewhat
                    smaller roller, the “stripper” <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which again delivers it
                    to the breast cylinder. Passing on it carries the wool partly to the second
                    worker/, and stripper <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> when the same operation is
                    repeated. Continuing its progress, the cylinder with its covering of wool next
                    comes in contact with the * ‘ fancy” <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> the teeth of
                    which are set so as to pass a little way into those of the cylinder. Its effect
                    is to throw the wool partly out of its teeth and prepare it for being entirely
                    removed by the “doffer” <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> which is the next roller met
                    by the cylinder, and which, like the “fancy,” revolves in a contrary direction
                    to the breast cylinder. The angle stripper <hi rend="italic">j</hi> passes the
                    wool from the doffer to the next cylinder, which is called a “swift,” and which
                    has the same workers, strippers, fancy and doffer rollers as the breast
                    cylinders. The scribbler contains three such sets of cylinders and rollers over
                    which the wool passes till it is delivered. The intermediate carding-engine has
                    two swifts, with relative workers, &amp;c., and the finisher has also two swifts
                    and a condenser. In some carding-engines the swifts are provided with more than
                    two sets of workers and strippers. This is particularly the case in a class of
                    carding-engines provided with only one swift or cylinder of very large diameter,
                    around which there are five sets of workers and strippers (fig. 5).</p>
                <p>The carded wool, as it leaves the last swift of the finisher card, is in the form
                    of a continuous equally-distributed lap. To prepare it for spinning, this lap
                    must now be divided into a series of equal strips or ribbons, and these then
                    condensed into a rounded carding or sliver sufficiently compact to bear winding
                    on a bobbin. The condenser for doing this is attached to the finisher card, and
                    consists of rings or bands of card-cloth the width of the strips to be made,
                    placed on one or on two cylinders, which rings doff the portion of the lap
                    against which they revolve and yield it up to a stripper. These strips as they
                    pass out are acted on by a pair of rubbers which, by a partly oscillating
                    motion, rub the strip into the form of a carding of rounded loose untwisted
                    fibres, which in the subsequent operation of spinning is easily drawn out to the
                    degree of tenuity required in the yarn to be made.</p>
                <p>The mule-frame employed for spinning woollen yarns is the same in principle as,
                    but in some respects modified in action from, the spinning-mule used for fine
                    counts of cotton yarn. The mule (fig. 6) consists of a stationary frame on which
                    the bobbins of sliver are placed, and of a carriage which travels back and
                    forward a distance of in all about 2 yards from the stationary frame. The
                    carriage contains in a horizontal row the spindles which give twist to the yarn
                    and wind it on the bobbins or paper tubes fixed on them; and the complicated
                    motions of the whom machine are regulated by gearing and belting from
                    head-stocks on the stationary frame. The carriage being close up to the
                    stationary frame, the ends of the slivers are passed through a pair of small
                    giving-off rollers and attached to the bobbins or tubes in the carriage. The
                    carriage then begins to travel back on its rails, the slivers being
                    simultaneously delivered to it through the rollers, at the same rate at which it
                    travels, till, say, a yard length is given out, and as the carriage has been
                    moving back the spindles have been revolving slowly so as to communicate some
                    twist to the sliver; but up to this point there has been no drawing out or
                    drafting. But now the rollers cease to give out sliver, the carriage continues
                    travelling back, and the spindles revolve at a greatly increased rate,
                    simultaneously drawing out the sliver and giving it the requisite twist, till,
                    when it comes to the end of the rails over which it runs, the yard of original
                    sliver is drawn out to 2 yards of yarn and twisted almost enough. The full twist
                    is given while the carriage remains standing at the end; then the spindles are
                    reversed two ór three times to unwind a small proportion of yarn which the
                    twisting operation leaves near the point of the bobbin; and lastly the carriage
                    is run in to the stationary frame while the spindles wind the now finished yarn
                    on the bobbins or tubes, an automatic arrangement securing due tension and the
                    proper winding of the yarn.</p>
                <p>Yarn, as delivered from the mule in woollen-spinning, or from the throstle in the
                    case of worsteds, is in the condition known as singles. For twisting the singles
                    into yarn of two or more ply it is wound on bobbins; sometimes the bobbins from
                    the spinning-frame are used direct, and placed on pegs in the twisting-frame,
                    which is a mechanism like the throstle, but without the arrangement for <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n699/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0699-0660"/> drafting. The twist is given in the reverse
                    direction from that in which the singles are spun, and thereby the single is to
                    some extent untwisted. Yarns of two-, three-, and five-ply and upwards are made;
                    these are sometimes redoubled or again twisted together. The yarn may be made up
                    of precisely the same singles; sometimes different counts or sizes of singles
                    are twisted together; in other cases the colours may be different; and yet again
                    yarns may be made of distinct fibres, such as wool and cotton, or wool and silk,
                    &amp;c. Numerous variations of the method of twisting are employed to produce
                    loops, knots, and other irregularities in the yarn, for convenience in weaving
                    and knitting fancy textures.</p>
                <p>If we adhere to the definition of worsted yarn which distinguishes it as being
                    made from wool fibres brought as far as possible into a level parallel
                    condition, we shall have to do only with two methods of manufacture,—(1) of yarn
                    from long wool by the method of drawing, gilling, and combing, and (2) of yarn
                    from medium and short staple wools, which are first carded and afterwards
                    combed. But there is commonly added a third class of worsted yarns, worsted only
                    in the sense that they are not meant for felting. These are carpet yarns and
                    lightly twisted knitting yarns, which, being meant to be full and open in
                    structure, are prepared for spinning by carding alone, precisely as in making
                    woollen yarns.</p>
                <p>The primitive method of wool-combing, and the simple implements employed till
                    comparatively recent days, when the ingenious machinery now used was invented,
                    will serve to illustrate the problem of preparing long wool for spinning. The
                    hand combs employed were studded with two—sometimes three—rows of long, smooth,
                    rounded, and sharp-pointed steel spikes. The operative was provided with a pair
                    of these combs. He had a comb-post to which he could attach them, and a comb-pot
                    or small stove in which he heated the teeth of his combs and the wool which he
                    worked. The teeth of one comb being duly heated he fixed it. in the comb-post,
                    and taking a quantity of wool previously oiled he dashed it in portions into the
                    teeth of the comb and drew it through, leaving a portion locked in the spikes,
                    and this operation he continued till the comb was well filled with wool. Then he
                    placed it in the comb-pot to heat up, while he similarly proceeded to fill the
                    teeth of the second comb, which in the meantime had been heating. With both
                    filled and duly heated, he took one comb in his left hand, laying it in his lap
                    teeth upwards, and with the other in his right he proceeded to comb out the
                    locks, beginning first at the tips and working gradually in as the fibres were
                    smoothed and opened out. In the end the combs were worked with teeth close up to
                    each other and through the entire mass, the noils or short fibre being thus
                    entirely combed out, excepting a small quantity left in the teeth which could
                    not be reached by the opposing combs.</p>
                <p>The typical modern process in worsted-yarn fabrication is that in which the
                    preparation consists in gilling and subsequent combing, as practised when long
                    wool is the staple to be treated. The object of gilling is to bring all the
                    fibres level and parallel to each other, and to prepare a uniform sliver for the
                    subsequent combing operation. The gilling-machine or gill-box (fig. 7) in its
                    essential features consists first of a pair of rollers to which the wool is fed.
                    Beyond these it is caught by rows of steel pins fixed in heavy steel bars,
                    termed fallers, which rise in close and constant succession immediately behind
                    the feed-rollers, penetrate the wool presented to them, and travel forward with
                    it towards a second pair of rollers which catch the fibre and draw it away. The
                    spike-covered fallers are so called because they travel from one to the other
                    pair of rollers, carried forward by endless screws into which they are threaded,
                    then, falling down, are returned by the action of similar screws operating in
                    the opposite direction, till just under the feedrollers they rise again to catch
                    the feed of wool, and so continue to circulate. There is thus a continuous line
                    of fallers travelling between feed-rollers and back rollers, but as the back
                    rollers revolve much more quickly than the front rollers, and also draw the wool
                    through them more rapidly than it is presented to them by the fallers, there is
                    a constant and steady drawing of wool away from the front rollers and through
                    the teeth of the fallers, and this draught tends to cause all the fibres to
                    arrange themselves in the direction in which they are being gently dragged. A
                    set of gillboxes consists of five or six machines constructed on the same
                    principle, but with the pins of the fallers finer and more closely studded as
                    the fibre travels on and as the orderly and symmetrical arrangement of the
                    sliver increases. From the first two or three machines the wool is generally
                    delivered as a broad lap, and it is similarly presented to the next, but in the
                    later boxes the product is condensed into a sliver, which is received in large
                    cylindrical tin cans. Six of these cans are brought to the front of the next
                    gill-box, and the six slivers are, in passing through, drawn into and delivered
                    as one, and, such an operation being repeated three times, it will be seen that
                    any original portion of sliver must be distributed over a great length, and in
                    this way the fibres are brought even with each other and a very level and
                    uniform strand is produced. In the original form of gill-box the fallers
                    travelled from front to back at a uniform speed, and thus all the draughting was
                    done by the rapid rotation of the back rollers. Now, by a graduated pitch in the
                    screws which carry the fallers forward, they travel at a steadily accelerated
                    rate, beginning slow, and reaching their greatest rapidity just as they deliver
                    the wool to the back rollers, which revolve still more rapidly. Thus there is
                    steady draughting throughout the whole range of the machine, and the wool is at
                    once more gently treated and more uniformly drawn out than in the old forms of
                    the machine.</p>
                <p>It will be obvious that the gill-boxes through which long wool passes, while
                    possessing the power of bringing the fibres into a smooth, equal, and regular
                    condition, do nothing in the way of selecting and separating out the long and
                    straight from the short and curly fibres which are always intermixed. To obtain
                    an even and smooth worsted yarn it is necessary to effect this separation, and
                    it is the function of the various forms of combing machine now in use to
                    separate the “top” or long fibre from the “noil” or short and broken wool, and
                    to deliver the former as a continuous sliver of uniform size. The invention of a
                    successful combing machine has been the great triumph of the modern worsted
                    industry, and the introduction of the apparatus led, as is commonly the case
                    with all great inventions, to a vast amount of dispute and litigation, and many
                    conflicting claims of merit. About 1840 at least three investigators were
                    separately at work on the problem —Mr S. C. Lister of Bradford, Mr Donisthorpe
                    of Leicester, and Μ. Heilmann of Alsace. Messrs Lister and Donisthorpe
                    conjointly secured a patent for a combing machine, in connexion with which they
                    entered into partnership, but their patent rights were successfully disputed by
                    Heilmann under a patent granted to him in 1847, and they were obliged to buy up
                    his invention for £30,000. Since that time much attention has been given to
                    combing machinery, not for wool alone, but also for spun silk and cotton; and
                    now there are many varieties of apparatus in the market for doing what not very
                    long ago was pronounced to be utterly impracticable. The three principal classes
                    of machine at present used for wool-combing are—(1) the Lister or nip machine,
                    which is most suitable for long combing wools, mohair, and alpaca; (2) the Noble
                    or circular comb, principally useful for combing shorter staple or intermediate
                    wools; and (3) the Holden or square-motion comb, which is applicable for short
                    staple wools. It is impossible here to convey a full conception of the delicate
                    almost intelligent manner in which these machines work. A principal feature of
                    them is a large ring or circle studded with rows of fine steel pins, which is
                    made to revolve horizontally within the machine. By various devices the wool is
                    fed into the teeth of the ring in a continuous series of tufts with its ends
                    overlapping the edge of the ring as it revolves. In the case of the nip machine
                    the wool is fed in by fallers as in the gillbox. The end of the sliver is caught
                    by a nip which tears a tuft through the pins of the fallers, and thus partly
                    combs it out. This tuft the nip places on the teeth of the revolving circle, by
                    which it is carried on till it comes to a pair of upright rollers revolving
                    close to the edge of the circle. These rollers catch between them the ends of
                    the long fibre and draw it out of the teeth of the circle in a continuous sliver
                    as it revolves. The Noble or circular comb is provided with three pin-studded
                    rings, one large and two small, the latter being so centred within the larger
                    ring that in rotating their outer edges just meet the inner edge of the large
                    ring which rotates around them. The tufts of wool are dabbed down over the pins
                    of the larger and smaller circles at the points where they meet, and of course
                    as they rotate the teeth immediately begin to draw apart, and the wool is
                    divided, the long fibres hanging over the edge of each circle. These fibres are
                    caught between upright <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n700/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0700-0661"/> rollers, which thus deliver four continuous
                    slivers of top, and leave the noil to be otherwise lifted out of the teeth.</p>
                <p>The sliver as delivered from the combing machine is made up into a ball by a
                    balling gill-box, behind the back rollers of which instead of a can there is a
                    large bobbin for receiving the sliver, which is wound on it in a diagonal manner
                    from the oscillating rotation given to the bobbin. Such balls of sliver then
                    undergo the operation of drawing, the purpose of which is still further to
                    equalize the strand of fibre, and to bring it into a sufficiently attenuated
                    form for spinning. The principle of drawing or draughting consists in presenting
                    the sliver to a pair of receiving rollers which pass it on to a pair of delivery
                    rollers, which rotate proportionately faster than the receivers, and to that
                    extent draw out and attenuate the sliver. Supposing the wool to pass through six
                    such drawing frames, six slivers may be fed into the first and drawn out to the
                    dimensions of one; the same may be repeated in the second, five slivers may be
                    reduced to one in the third, four to one in the fourth and fifth frames; and in
                    the roving frame, in which a little twist is given to the sliver before it is
                    wound on a bobbin, two slivers may be elongated into one. Thus we have any
                    length of sliver drawn out 6×6×5×4×4× 2 = 5760 times its original extension, and
                    with increase of frames this extension multiplies enormously. Treating the
                    slivers in nine drawing frames, we may have 8×6×5×5×5×4× 3 ×2 × 2 = 288,000 of
                    extension.</p>
                <p>Short and medium staple wools are carded before being gilled and combed. The
                    preliminary operations differ in no way from those employed for woollen yarns.
                    After carding the wool is generally washed, previous to gilling in a back
                    washer. The machine consists of two sud bowls or vats provided with immersers
                    and squeezing rollers through which the cardings are passed; then they are
                    carried round two copper cylinders internally heated by steam, from which they
                    are passed on and delivered by the fallers of a gilling apparatus.</p>
                <p>The bobbins of elongated and slightly twisted rovings are now ready for spinning
                    on the throstle spinning-frame, on -which it is simultaneously drawn out to its
                    ultimate tenuity, twisted, and wound on a bobbin. The drawing out is done
                    practically by the same device as the drafting of sliver in the drawing-frame.
                    The bobbins of rove are placed on pegs on the frame slightly canted forward, so
                    that the roving as drawn off comes away at right angles from the bobbin. The
                    rovings pass first between a pair of rollers, and are carried on and supported
                    by small carrier rollers till they reach a front pair of rollers, the upper of
                    which is covered with leather and the lower grooved or furrowed. The space
                    between the back and front pairs of rollers, termed the ratch, is that in which
                    the final drawing is effected, and the amount of attenuation effected is
                    dependent on the relatively faster rate at which the front rollers rotate as
                    compared with the back pair. Immediately the slender cord has passed the front
                    pair of rollers, twist is imparted to it by the spindle working either on the
                    old flyer principle, on the cup principle, or with the more recent ring and
                    traveller. See also <hi rend="smallcaps">Yarn.</hi> The doubling and subsequent
                    treatment of worsted singles are the same as in the case of woollen yarn singles
                    from the mule frame.</p>
                <p>The term shoddy was formerly one of some opprobrium in connexion with woollen
                    manufactures, but the substance is now frankly recognized as a material of great
                    utility for many purposes when body and warmth are more essential than toughness
                    or elasticity. Shoddy consists of rags and shreds of stockings, flannels, and
                    other softworsted fabrics torn and reduced to such fragments of the original
                    fibre as can be made by the operation. Mungo is a similar preparation made from
                    rags, and from shreds and clippings of milled woollen cloths, being divided into
                    new mungo made from tailor’s waste, and old mungo from rags of all degrees of
                    degradation. Extract wool is that which is recovered from rags of various cloths
                    in which cotton and wool are variously woven together. The wool is freed from
                    the cotton by the same chemical or carboning process which is employed in
                    freeing dirty wool from burrs, viz., by treating the union fabric with a
                    solution of sulphuric acid and heating it in a stove, when the acid
                    energetically attacks and chars the vegetable fibre, leaving the wool unharmed.
                    Shoddy and mungo are prepared by dusting the rags and fragments, classifying
                    them according to colour and quality, picking out seams, oiling the material,
                    and then passing it into a machine significantly called the “devil,” which
                    literally rends the rags, &amp;c., to fragments, which look more like dust than
                    fibres, by the exceedingly rapid rotation of a swift or large cylinder armed
                    with powerful iron spikes, with equally strong toothed rollers revolving in an
                    opposite direction. Into the same category with these come the flocks formed in
                    the various processes of finishing cloth, which are, of course, even shorter
                    than the others. Indeed the shoddy manufacturers hold that “anything long enough
                    to have two ends” is sufficient for manufacturing purposes. The shoddy trade was
                    begun in Batley, Yorkshire, by Mr Benjamin Law in 1813, and, notwithstanding the
                    disfavour with which it was long viewed, it prospered and developed till the
                    shoddy district of Batley, Dewsbury, and their surroundings became the centre of
                    a great and prosperous branch of the woollen trade entirely dependent on these
                    disintegrated materials. It is said that as much as 125,000,000 lb of shoddy
                    material is now yearly worked up into cloth in England alone. Shoddy, &amp;c.,
                    cannot be used without a due proportion of natural-length wool, usually
                    one-third of pure wool being employed in spinning shoddy yarn; but sometimes as
                    much as 80 per cent, of the finished cloth consists of shoddy. It finds its way
                    into a very large proportion of woollen goods, but its use is detrimental where
                    tenacity and wear are required. For linings, rugs, wraps, and heavy friezes,
                    pilots, druggets, blankets, &amp;c., in which bulk and warmth more than
                    wear-resisting qualities are required, it is suitable, and it also makes into
                    good light milled cloth for ladies' jackets. Shoddy is practically a new source
                    of textile material; its employment is a utilization of waste, and furnishes
                    cheap serviceable textures.</p>
                <p>For the dyeing and weaving of woollen and worsted fabrics the reader is referred
                    to the separate articles relating to these processes. But a piece of
                    cloth—woollen cloth especially—as it comes from the loom is very far from being
                    a finished product. Indeed the most characteristic operations in woollen-cloth
                    manufacture are subsequent to the weaving stage. Woollen cloth from the loom,
                    called “roughers,” has an irregular, slack aspect, very different from the same
                    web when it comes to be sold as, say, broad-cloth. The web as it leaves the loom
                    is still saturated with the oil with which it was sprinkled before spinning, and
                    impregnated with the size applied to the yarn to give it tenacity and
                    consistency in weaving. To remove these it is scoured with hot soap-sud in a
                    trough having a convex bottom, and fitted with wooden mallets which are made to
                    fall obliquely against the cloth. After being scoured in this way, it is
                    stretched in a frame for burling or perching, an operation which consists in
                    going carefully over the whole web, picking out all burrs and knots in the
                    texture, and darning up holes and open spots which it may show.</p>
                <p>Fulling is the one process which is specially distinctive of woollen
                    textures,—its results being shown in the highest degree in broadcloths,
                    doeskins, and other like goods. Every one knows how flannels, blankets, and
                    hosiery tend to contract with frequent washing, gaining in thickness and
                    solidity what they lose in extension and. elasticity; such shrinking is greatly
                    accelerated when woollen articles are much rubbed in very hot water. This
                    shrinking or fulling is, as already explained, the result of the serrated wavy
                    structure of wool. The operation of fulling or milling is performed in the
                    fulling stocks, or in the more modern millingmachine; but, by whatever agency
                    carried out, the effect is always the same. The old method of fulling by the
                    stocks is wasteful of power, and the blows the stocks give tend sometimes .to
                    tear the cloth, drawbacks from which the milling-machine is comparatively free.
                    The cloth to be fulled is well saturated with hot soap and water, and either
                    worked under the falling weight of the stocks or pressed and rubbed between
                    rollers in the milling-machine while so heated and soaped. The more prolonged
                    the operation the more does the material shrink up and thicken, and a piece of
                    cloth may even be milled till it is reduced to half its original length and
                    breadth. The degree of fulling is a distinctive feature of many different
                    varieties of cloth. In the treatment of broad-cloth, doeskins, meltons, and all
                    nap-finished cloth, the milling is carried so far that the fibres become densely
                    matted, obliterating the appearance of weave, and giving the piece more the
                    aspect of felt than of cloth. Fabrics such as Venetian cloths, and diagonals,
                    &amp;c., to which no pile-finish is given, are milled only to the extent of
                    solidifying and increasing the substance and strength of the texture, and tweeds
                    are only very slightly felted to give them a dressed Surface. On the conclusion
                    of the fulling operation the goods are scoured to free them from soap, which is
                    very simply done by gradually supplanting the soap-sud with pure water, which is
                    tepid at first but is gradually cooled by additions till in the end the cloth is
                    being worked in pure cold water.</p>
                <p>The cloth that is taken from the fulling-machine must immediately be stretched
                    uniformly in all directions by hooks on a frame, so that it may dry evenly
                    without wrinkle or curl. The frame may be placed in a hot-air chamber to hasten
                    the drying, or the cloth may be allowed to dry under ordinary atmospheric
                    conditions. In this operation a pile or nap is raised on the surface of milled
                    cloth. The raising of the pile is effected by the agency of the flower-head of
                    the teasle <hi rend="italic">(Dipsacus</hi><hi rend="italic">fullonum'),</hi>
                    which forms a conelike spike covered with imbricated scales. These “scales end
                    in sharp, recurved hooks, possessed of high elasticity, combined with just
                    sufficient stiffness for the work they have to do. The use of these hooked
                    teasles is to scratch the surface of the milled cloths, and getting entangled
                    with minute surface fibres break these or pull out their ends, and so raise over
                    the whole surface a fine but unequal nap. Formerly the teasles were set together
                    in a flat frame, and by hand the workmen brushed them in a uniform manner over
                    the whole surface of the tightly stretched cloth. But this laborious handicraft
                    has long been superseded by the use of the gig-mill or dressing-machine. This
                    apparatus consists of a cylinder made to rotate at a high rate of speed. The
                    surface of the cloth to be raised is, in a state of uniform tension, brought in
                    contact with the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n701/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0701-0662"/> revolving cylinder. An automatic arrangement
                    in the machine regulates the lightness or closeness of contact of cloth and
                    teasles. The myriads of elastic hooks scratch the entire surface, disengaging
                    and opening up short fibres, and thus covering the whole with a nap. There are,
                    however, several varieties of pile desired in dressing woollen cloths, and a
                    pile may be raised in a certain class of fabrics for a purpose quite the
                    opposite of that for which other piles are formed. Thus in cloth dressing the
                    object is to get a glossy and smooth nap which quite covers and conceals the
                    underlying structure, while tweeds and similar goods are teasled with the view
                    òf ultimately removing all pile from the surface and leaving the pattern of the
                    cloth well defined and free from all hairiness. Pile-dressed fabrics are raised
                    by the wet method: that is, the cloth to be operated upon in the
                    dressing-machine is first damped, and the nap so produced lies smooth, flat, and
                    level in one direction, covering the surface in much the same way as short hairs
                    cover the skin of an animal. Cloth raised dry, on the other hand, throws its
                    fibre ends straight out from the cloth, the action indeed being a kind of
                    combing-up of all the more loose and open surface fibres so as to prepare them
                    for being entirely cropped or shorn off in order to leave the fabric with a
                    clean, bare surface. Metallic teasles have frequently been suggested and to some
                    extent employed as a substitute for the vegetable product, but hitherto such
                    devices have not proved quite satisfactory.</p>
                <p>The operation of cropping was also formerly a handicraft, the worker using a huge
                    pair of shears, and the employment demanded much dexterity and skill to produce
                    a uniform smooth pile or a well-cleaned surface. It is now done with equal
                    rapidity and certainty by a machine which in principle is the same as the
                    lawn-mower. It consists of a cylinder armed with a series of helical knives or
                    cutters, the cylinder revolving with great velocity against the smooth stretched
                    surface of the cloth, partly cutting away and partly tearing off the tips of the
                    projecting fibres which come within the range of its ledger-blades. Four hundred
                    years before the practical introduction of this helical cropping machine, it was
                    invented and proposed for modern use by Leonardo da Vinci.</p>
                <p>With the view of giving lustre to the finished cloth, it is, when taken from the
                    cropping machine and brushed on the brushing machine to remove the flocks
                    produced in shearing, wound tightly round a huge drum, and boiled, or rather
                    immersed in water heated to from 160° to 180° F., for three or four hours. It is
                    then unwound, the ends are reversed, winding first on the roller the end which
                    was on the outside in the previous boiling, and again boiled. Finally it is
                    pressed in an hydraulic press, in which the cloth is heated either by the
                    introduction of hot iron-plates between the folds or by forcing steam through it
                    in the press, this last process adding to the solidity and smoothness of the
                    cloth and developing the lustre characteristic of a well-finished fabric.</p>
                <p>The range and variety of cloths and other textures made from wool are exceedingly
                    great. Under the heading of cloth manufactures, there may be enumerated, of
                    piled cloths, broad-cloth, doeskins, cassimeres, meltons, beavers, and friezes.
                    Of cloths milled and cropped bare there are Venetians, sataras, and diagonals,
                    which differ in the arrangements of warp and weft in the weaving. Tweeds, which
                    form an important item, are cloths only slightly felted, raised dry, cropped,
                    and pressed. The variety of worsted cloths is still greater, embracing says,
                    serges, sateens, repps, merinos, mousselaines-de-laine, tartans, camlets,
                    Russell cords, coburgs, lastings, delaines, and Orleans cloth. Hosiery forms a
                    manufacture apart, as do also the processes of making carpets, blankets,
                    flannels, shawls, rugs, and wrappers, curtain-cloths, and alpaca and mohair
                    textures.</p>
                <p>As an illustration of the advantages which have resulted from the application of
                    machinery to the many and complicated processes of cloth manufacture, it has
                    been calculated by Μ. Alcan that, whereas in the 17th century the labour of more
                    than 10,000 men was needed to produce in one day a ton of cloth from a ton of
                    wool, that amount of work now can be done in one day by about 1900.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> -</hi> Wherever civilized mankind dwell there is found wool
                    production, with more or less of woollen manufacture. This fact notwithstanding,
                    the cultivation of wool tends to become increasingly associated with special
                    localities, and from age to age different regions enter into competition as
                    sources of wool, and the great sources of supply correspondingly change their
                    position. Neglecting the produce of Britain, which probably has not varied to
                    any notable extent during the century, though its movement as an article of
                    export has developed greatly in that interval, we may bπefly note the vast
                    developments which have taken place in some sources of supply. In 1800 most of
                    the wool, other than that from <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> ° <hi

                    the Cape of Good Hope has grown from about 30,000 ìb in 1820 to 61,250,000 lb in
                    1886. The growth and fluctuation in the imports from these and other regions are

                <p>Particular districts have attained a predominant hold on certain branches of the
                    manufacture, and with great tenacity the industries have clung for long periods
                    to the districts which have succeeded in establishing a reputation for the
                    branches they cultivated. In this way the manufacture of superfine broad-cloths
                    has been long associated with the West of England, specially with Wiltshire and
                    Gloucestershire, and in that district the trade in fine cloth is still chiefly
                    centred. In point of quantities produced, however, and of persons employed, the
                    West Riding of Yorkshire woollen cloth districts far outstrip the West of
                    England, and are the true centres of all industries connected with wool. Of
                    woollen cloths of all kinds the towns of Leeds and Huddersfield are the most
                    important producers. The shoddy trade has been specially developed at Batley and
                    Dewsbury, and the numerous manufactures of worsted have their principal centre
                    in Bradford and the populous district surrounding it. Norwich, at one time the
                    capital of worsted manufactures, and a large producer of shawls, thanks to the
                    immigration of Flemings, has entirely lost its supremacy, probably owing to the
                    superior coal facilities of Yorkshire, but it is yet the seat of no
                    inconsiderable worsted manufacture. The hosiery trade is developed chiefly in
                    and around Leicester, and at Kilmarnock the allied knitting of bonnets is a
                    specialty. Flannels and blankets are associated with W ales; the carpet trade
                    belongs principally to Kidderminster, Halifax, Glasgow, and Kilmarnock. Shawls
                    are made in Paisley, Alva, and Alloa in Scotland, knitting-yarns being a largely
                    developed industry in the two last-mentioned towns. Tweeds are the special
                    industry of Hawick, Galashiels, Dumfries, and Aberdeen, and also form an
                    important part of the manufactures of Leeds. (J. PA. )</p>
