                    (1730-1795), the most distinguished of English manufacturers of pottery. Many
                    members of the Wedgwood family had been established as potters in Staffordshire
                    throughout the 17th century, but their productions were in no way remarkable.
                    Josiah, born in 1730, was the youngest child of Thomas Wedgwood, who owned a
                    thriving pottery in Burslem. At a very early age he distinguished himself by
                    keen powers of observation and love for all that was curious and beautiful. Soon
                    after the death of his father in 1739, Josiah, then scarcely ten years of age,
                    was taken away from school and set to learn the art of moulding or “throwing”
                    clay pottery, at which he soon became extraordinarily skilful. In 1744 he was
                    apprenticed to his eldest brother, who had succeeded to the management of his
                    father’s pottery; and in 1751, when the term of his apprenticeship had expired,
                    Josiah Wedgwood became manager of the neighbouring Alder pottery, with a very
                    moderate salary. In 1759 he started as an independent potter at the Ivy-House
                    works in Burslem, and soon introduced many improvements among the simple classes
                    of pottery which were then made in Staffordshire. Soon, however, Wedgwood’s
                    tastes were turned in an archaeological direction by the increasing interest
                    then taken in Greek or (as they were then called) Etruscan vases. His enthusiasm
                    was specially aroused by the illustrations in Comte de Caylus’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Recueil d' Antiquités</hi> (1752-67); aided by this work he began
                    to attempt to copy Greek designs, and in later years he was further assisted by
                    loans of vases from the fine collection of Greek pottery possessed by Sir
                    William Hamilton. In 1769 Wedgwood opened new potteries on a larger scale at
                    Etruria in Staffordshire, having entered into partnership with Thomas Bentley of
                    Liverpool, a man of great taste and culture, and in all respects a kindred
                    spirit. Many able artists, and among them the young Flaxman, were engaged to
                    design and model reliefs, busts, and other designs for the Wedgwood and Bentley
                    pottery; and in a short time the productions of their kilns were widely sold and
                    highly esteemed in all the chief countries of Europe. After Bentley’s death in
                    1780, Wedgwood became sole owner of the Etruria pottery till 1790, when he took
                    some of his sons into partnership.- His chief artistic feat was perhaps the
                    production of an accurate copy in clay of the celebrated glass Portland vase;
                    reproductions of this were sold at £50 a piece, and about 50 copies—not all of
                    equal merit—were produced during Wedgwood’s lifetime. In 1764 Josiah married his
                    cousin Sarah Wedgwood. He died on January 3, 1795, in the 65th year of his age,
                    leaving to his children a well-earned fortune of more than half a million.</p>
                <p>Josiah Wedgwood was a mail of the highest moral worth, and skilled in many
                    branches of knowledge. He was the intimate friend of Dr Erasmus Darwin and other
                    distinguished men of science. For the chief characteristics of the Wedgwood
