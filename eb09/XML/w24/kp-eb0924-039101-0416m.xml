                <p><label type="entry">WASPS</label>. The order <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi>
                    is divided into two sub-orders, the <hi rend="italic">Terebrantia</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Aculeata.</hi> The latter is subdivided into several
                    sub-sections, one of which, the <hi rend="italic">Diploptera</hi> (Latreille),
                    includes all the true wasps.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Diploptera</hi> are in their turn divided into three
                    families—(1) the <hi rend="italic">Vespidae,</hi> (2) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eumenidae,</hi> and (3) the <hi rend="italic">Masaridae,</hi> which together
                    comprise some 1000 different species. They are characterized by their wings,
                    which are present in both sexes and also in the neuters, being longitudinally
                    folded when at rest. The antennae are usually elbowed, and contain twelve or
                    thirteen joints; in some cases they are clavate. A pair of notched faceted eyes
                    are present, and three ocelli in the top of the head. The mouth-parts are
                    arranged for sucking, but have not reached that degree of perfection found
                    amongst the bees. Hence wasps cannot obtain the sugary secretion from
                    deeply-seated nectaries, and their visits to flowers are confined to such as are
                    shallow or widely opened; they particularly frequent the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Umbelliferae.</hi> The maxillae are elongated, and compressed, the maxillary
                    palp six-jointed. The labium bears a tongue which is glandular at the tip; the
                    paraglossae are linear. The labial palp has three or four joints. The thorax is
                    oval, and its sides prolonged backward to the base of the wings. The fore wing
                    has two or three submarginal cells. The legs are not provided with any
                    adaptations for collecting pollen. The abdomen is sometimes pedunculate, its
                    anterior segment being drawn out into a long stalk, which connects it with the
                    thorax. The females and the neuters are armed with a powerful sting. The usual
                    colour of these insects is black, relieved to a greater or less degree by spots
                    and patches of yellow or buff.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Diploptera</hi> may be subdivided into two groups in
                    accordance with the habits of life of the insects comprising the section. One of
                    the groups includes the family <hi rend="italic">Vespidae,</hi> which is
                    composed of social wasps, and includes the hornet <hi rend="italic">( Vespa
                    crabro)</hi> and the common wasp (<hi rend="italic">V. vulgaris).</hi> The other
                    group contains two smaller families, the <hi rend="italic">Eumenidae</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Masaridae,</hi> the members of which are solitary in their
                    mode of life.</p>
                <p>Family I. <hi rend="italic">Vespidae.—</hi> In addition to their social habits
                    the members of this family are characterized by certain structural features. The
                    anterior wings have three submarginal cells. The antennae have thirteen joints
                    in the males and twelve in the females; the claws of the tarsi are simple; the
                    anterior four tibiae have two spines at the tip; the abdomen is but rarely
                    pedunculated, and the posterior segments are often very contractile.</p>
                <p>The members of this family approximate very closely to bees in their social
                    manner of life. The communities are composed of males, females, and neuters or
                    workers. The latter are females in which the ovary remains undeveloped; they
                    resemble the perfect female in external appearance, but are slightly smaller.
                    Unlike the bees’, the wasps’ community is annual, existing for one summer only.
                    Most of the members die at the approach of autumn, but a few females which have
                    been fertilized hibernate through the winter, sheltered under stones or in
                    hollow trees. In the spring and with the returning warm weather the female
                    regains her activity and emerges from her hiding-place. She then sets about
                    finding a convenient place for building a nest and establishing a new colony.
                    The common wasp (<hi rend="italic">V. vulgaris)</hi> usually selects some burrow
                    or hole in the ground, which, if too small, she may enlarge into a chamber
                    suitable for her purpose. She then commences to build the nest. This is
                    constructed of small fibres of old wood, which the wasp gnaws, and kneads, when
                    mixed with the secretion from the salivary glands, into a sort of papier-mâché
                    pulp. Some of this is formed into a hanging pillar attached to the roof of the
                    cavity, and in the lower free end of this three shallow cup-like cells are hung.
                    In each of these an egg is laid. The foundress of the society then continues to
                    add cells to the comb, and as soon as the grubs appear from the first-laid eggs
                    she has in addition to tend and feed them.</p>
                <p>The grubs are apodal, thicker in the middle than at either end; the mandibles
                    bear three teeth; the maxillae and labium are represented by fleshy tubercles.
                    The body, including the head, consists of fourteen segments, which bear lateral
                    tubercles and spiracles. They have no anus. They are suspended with the head
                    downwards in the cells, and require a good deal of attention, being fed by their
                    mother upon insects which are well chewed before they are given to the larvae,
                    or upon honey. At the same time the mother is enlarging and deepening the cells
                    in which they live, building new cells, and laying more eggs, which are usually
                    suspended in the same angle of each cell. The development within the egg takes
                    eight days.</p>
                <p>After about a fortnight the grubs cease to feed, and, forming a silky cover to
                    their cells, become pupae. This quiescent stage lasts about ten days, at the end
                    of which period they emerge as the imago or perfect insect. The silky covering
                    of the cell is round or convex outwards; and to leave the cell the insect either
                    pushes it out, when it opens like a box lid, or gnaws a round hole through it.
                    As soon as the cell is vacated it is cleaned out and another egg deposited. In
                    this way two or three larvae occupy successively the same cell during the
                    summer. The first wasps that appear in a nest are neuters or workers, and these
                    at once set to work to enlarge the comb, and feed the larvae, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The material which forms the substance of the nest is usually dried wood, worked
                    by the mandibles of the wasp, with the addition of its salivary secretion, into
                    a pulp, which can easily be moulded whilst moist; it dries into a substance of a
                    papery appearance, but possessing considerable tenacity. Sometimes paper itself,
                    such as old cartridge cases, is used. The combs are arranged horizontally; each
                    contains a single layer of cells opening downwards. The second comb is suspended
                    from the first by a number of hanging pillars which are built from the point of
                    union of three cells. The space between two combs is just sufficient to allow
                    the wasps to cross each other. The combs are roughly circular in outline, and
                    increase in size for the first four or five layers, after which they begin to
                    decrease; the whole is covered by a roughly made coating of the same papery
                    substance which composes the combs. This at first forms a cap-shaped protection,
                    but as each comb is built it is continued down until finally it forms a roughly
                    spherical covering for the whole, but not giving any support to the combs, which
                    are independent of it. The covering is pierced by apertures for the passage of
                    the wasps. The cells are hexagonal at their mouths, but above become more
                    rounded in their cross section.</p>
                <p>During the first half of the summer only workers are produced, but, as fruit
                    ripens and food becomes more abundant, fully developed females and males appear,
                    the latter from parthenogenetically developed eggs of the later broods of
                    workers. The males and females are larger than the workers, and require larger
                    cells for their development; these are usually kept apart from one another and
                    from those of the workers. The males may be distinguished by their longer
                    antennae, by the more elongated outline of their body, and by the absence of a
                    sting.</p>
                <p>In a favourable season, when the weather is warm and food plentiful, a nest may
                    contain many thousands of cells full of wasps in various stages of development;
                    and, as each cell is occupied two or three times in the course of a <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n417/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0417-0392"/> summer, those authorities who put the number of
                    the members of the community as high as 30,000 are probably not far wrong.</p>
                <p>At the approach of autumn the society begins to break up; the males fertilize the
                    females whilst flying high in the air. They then die, often within a few hours.
                    The workers leave the nest, carrying with them any grubs that remain in the
                    cells, and both soon perish. The nest is entirely deserted. The females which
                    have been fertilized creep into crevices under stones or trees, or hide amongst
                    moss, and hibernate until the warmth of the following spring induces them to
                    leave their hiding-places and set about founding a new community.</p>
                <p>There are altogether seven species of <hi rend="italic">Vespa</hi> met with in
                    Britain. <hi rend="italic">V. vulgaris,</hi> the common or ground wasp, <hi
                    rend="italic">V. rufa,</hi> the red wasp, distinguished by its reddish-yellow
                    legs, and <hi rend="italic">V. germanica,</hi> the German wasp, with three black
                    spots upon its first abdominal segment, are classed together as ground wasps.
                    They build their nests in burrows in the ground, but this is not an invariable
                    rule; they may be distinguished from the tree wasps by the first joint in the
                    antennae of the female being black. The tree wasps build stouter nests upon
                    branches of trees; the first joint of the antennae of the females is yellow in
                    front. The tree wasps are <hi rend="italic">V. arborea, sylvestris,
                    norwegica,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">crabro.</hi></p>
                <p>The hornet, <hi rend="italic">V. crabro,</hi> is the largest species occurring in
                    Great Britain. They have a more distinctly red colour than the common wasp, and
                    a row of red spots upon each side of the abdomen. They occur much more rarely
                    than the common wasp, and appear to be almost confined to the southern half of
                    England. Their nests resemble those described above, but are larger; they are
                    found in hollow trees or deserted outhouses. Their communities are smaller in
                    number than those of wasps.</p>
                <p>The hornet, where it occurs in any number, does a considerable amount of damage
                    to forest trees, by gnawing the bark off the younger branches to obtain material
                    for constructing its nest. It usually selects the ash or alder, but sometimes
                    attacks the lime, birch, and willow. Like the wasp, it does much damage to
                    fruit, upon the juices of which it lives. On the other hand, the wasp is useful
                    by keeping down the numbers of flies and other insects. It catches these in
                    large numbers, killing them with its jaws and not with its sting. It then tears
                    off the legs and wings, and bears the body back to its nest as food for the
                    larvae. Wasps also act to some extent as flower fertilizers, but in this respect
                    they cannot compare with bees; they visit fewer flowers, and have no adaptations
                    on their limbs for carrying off the pollen.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Vespa</hi> is very widely spread; it contains over
                    forty species, distributed all over the world. Some of the largest and
                    handsomest come from eastern Asia. <hi rend="italic">V. mandarina</hi> of China
                    and Japan, and <hi rend="italic">V. magnifica</hi> of the East Indies and Nepal,
                    measure 2 inches across the wings; <hi rend="italic">V. orientalis,</hi> found
                    in Greece, Egypt, and the East, builds its nest of clay.</p>
                <p>The only other genus of <hi rend="italic">Vespidae</hi> which is found in Europe
                    is <hi rend="italic">Polistes,</hi> which occurs in the countries bordering the
                    Mediterranean. The colonies of this genus are much smaller than those of <hi
                    rend="italic">Vespa.</hi> Each nest consists of a single tier of cells in the
                    form of a round plate, supported in the middle by a single stalk. This comb is
                    sometimes vertical, the cells then being horizontal or slightly oblique. Some of
                    the members of this genus store up honey, which in the case of a South-American
                    species is poisonous, from the nature of the flowers from which it is gathered.
                    The members of this genus have a slender body; the thorax is more oblong than in
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Vespa,</hi> the palps stouter, and the abdomen more
                    distinctly pedunculate.</p>
                <p>Indies, has many structural features in common with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eumenidae,</hi> but the character of its communities, and its nest, which is
                    very small, justify its position amongst the social wasps.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Icaria,</hi> common in Australia and the East Indies,
                    builds very small nests, of two or three rows of cells, hanging on one side from
                    a stalk.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Synoeca</hi> is a South-American genus, which builds large
                    nests, sometimes 3 feet in length, closely applied to the branch of a tree; they
                    never contain more than one layer of cells, which are horizontally placed. The
                    whole nest is built of coarse material, chiefly small pieces of bark; and there
                    is only one opening, at the lower end.</p>
                <p>Another South-American genus, <hi rend="italic">Chartergus,</hi> makes a tough
                    nest, pendant from boughs of trees, and opening to the exterior below by a
                    median aperture. The combs are arranged, somewhat like funnels, inside one
                    another, but with spaces between. The apex of each comb is pierced by a hole for
                    the wasps to pass from one gallery to another.</p>
                <p>The nest of <hi rend="italic">Tatua,</hi> which occurs in Mexico and South
                    America, is also pendant, but the combs are horizontal; the opening from the
                    exterior is at the side, and the passage from one gallery to another is also
                    lateral.</p>
                <p>The external appearance of the nest of <hi rend="italic">Nectarina,</hi> found in
                    Brazil and other parts of South America, resembles that of the common wasp, but
                    is rougher. Internally the combs are arranged concentrically, more or less
                    parallel with the external covering which affords them support.</p>
                <p>The members of the two remaining families, the <hi rend="italic">Eumenidae</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Masaridae,</hi> resemble one another in their solitary
                    mode of life; only males and females exist,—no workers or neuters being
                    found.</p>
                <p>Family IL <hi rend="italic">Eumenidae.—</hi> Solitary species, with three
                    submarginal cells in the fore wing; antennae with thirteen joints in the male,
                    twelve in the female; abdomen sometimes pedunculate, posterior segments
                    contractile. In the foregoing structural features the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eumenidae</hi> resemble the <hi rend="italic">Vespidae,</hi> but they differ in
                    having bifid claws on their tarsi, and the four anterior tibiae have but one
                    spine at the tip. The mandibles are elongated, and form a kind of rostrum, in
                    this respect approaching the <hi rend="italic">Fossores.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Eumenes coarctata</hi> is the only British species of this genus. The female is
                    half an inch long, the male somewhat shorter. The abdomen is connected with the
                    thorax by a long peduncle. The colour is black, relieved by spots of yellow. It
                    constructs small spherical cells of mud, which are found attached to stems of
                    plants, very generally to the heath. At first the cell opens to the exterior by
                    means of a round pore; one egg is deposited in each cell, and a store of honey
                    as food for the larva when hatched; the cell is then closed with mud. The larva
                    of some species are carnivorous, and then the food supply stored up in the cell
                    consists of caterpillars and other insect larvae which have been paralysed by
                    the parent wasp stinging them through the cerebral ganglion; when the larva of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Eumenes</hi> emerges from the <hi rend="italic">egg</hi>
                    it sets upon these and devours them.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Odynerus</hi> contains a very large number of
                    species, found in all parts of the world. The members of this genus are about
                    the size of a fly, and they differ from <hi rend="italic">Eumenes</hi> in having
                    a sessile abdomen. Some of the species construct their cells in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n418/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0418-0393"/> sand heaps, lining them with agglutinated grains
                    of sand; others live in cavities of trees lined with the same material, whilst
                    others build their nests of mud. Like some of the species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eumenes,</hi> they store up paralysed Lepidopterous and Chrysomeleous larvae as
                    food for their carnivorous grubs.</p>
                <p>Family III. <hi rend="italic">Masaridae.—</hi> The members of the third family,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Masaridae,</hi> are sharply distinguished by the
                    possession of only two submarginal cells in the fore wing. Their antennae are
                    frequently clavate, particularly so in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Celonites</hi>; they are twelve-jointed, but as the terminal joints are almost
                    fused they appear to be composed of only eight joints. The wings are not so
                    completely folded as in the other two families, and the abdomen is but slightly
                    contractile. The maxilke are short and their palps very small, with but three or
                    four joints.</p>
                <p>The number of genera comprised in this family is small; none occur in Britain,
                    but in southern Europe some species are found. They make their nest in cavities
                    in the earth, generally in a bank, and construct an irregular gallery leading
                    down to it.</p>
                <p>During hot fine summers wasps cause a good deal of loss to market gardeners and
                    fruit growers. During this time of year they live almost exclusively upon the
                    sweet juices of ripe fruit, occasionally carrying off small particles of the
                    flesh. At the same time they have not entirely lost their carnivorous tastes,
                    for they frequently attack the meat in butcher’s shops, but render compensation
                    by killing and carrying off to feed their grubs considerable numbers of
                    blow-flies. Wasps also perform an important service in keeping down the numbers
                    of caterpillars. The larvae are almost exclusively carnivorous, living upon
                    insects captured by their parents and reduced by them to a pulp before being
                    given to the young. During the spring the first broods that appear live largely
                    upon honey; and this forms the staple food of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polistes</hi> throughout their whole life.</p>
                <p>In attempting to rid a district of wasps, unless the nest can be taken, there is
                    little good in killing stray members of the community. On the other hand, the
                    killing of wasps in early spring probably means that the formation of a nest and
                    the production of a society whose members are counted by thousands is in each
                    case prevented.</p>
                <p>The number of wasps is kept down by numerous enemies. The most effective of these
                    live in the nests and devour the larvae; among them are two species of beetle,
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhipiphorus paradoxus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lebia
                    linearis.</hi> Two species of <hi rend="italic">Ichneumon,</hi> a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Anthomyia,</hi> and the larva of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Volucella</hi> also infest the nests of wasps and prey upon the grubs. The
                    last-named is also found in beehives. In the tropics some species are attacked
                    by fungi, the hyphae of which protrude between the segments of the abdomen, and
                    give the wasp a very extraordinary appearance. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. e.
