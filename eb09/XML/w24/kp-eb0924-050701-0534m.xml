                    of Australia that lies to the west of 129° E. long., forming considerably more
                    than one-third of the whole, has an area of 1,060,000 square miles, is 1400
                    miles in length and 850 in breadth, and has a coast-line of 3500 miles. It is
                    divided into five districts—Central, Central Eastern, South-Eastern, North, and
                    Kimberley. The Central or settled district, in the soutli-west, is divided into
                    twenty-six counties. Apart from the coast lands, the map presents almost a
                    blank, as the major portion is practically a dry waste of stone and sand,
                    relieved by a few shallow salt lakes. The rivers of the south are small,— the
                    Blackwood being the most considerable. To the north of this are the Murray, the
                    well-known Swan, the Moore, the Greenough, and the Murchison. The last is 400
                    miles long. Sharks Bay receives the Gascoigne (200 miles long), with its
                    tributary the Lyons. Still farther north, where the coast trends eastward, the
                    principal rivers are the Ashburton, the Fortescue, and the De Grey. Kimberley
                    district to the north-east has some fine streams,—the Fitzroy and Ord and their
                    tributaries, on some of which (the Mary, Elvira, &amp;c.) are the gold-fields,
                    250 miles south of Cambridge Gulf. The Darling mountain range is in the
                    soutli-west, Mount William reaching 3000 feet; in the same quarter are
                    Toolbrunup (3341 feet), Ellen’s Peak (3420), and the Stirling and Victoria
                    ranges. Gardner and Moresby are flat-topped ranges. Mount Elizabeth rises behind
                    Perth. Hampton tableland overlooks the Bight. In the north-west are Mount Bruce
                    (4000 feet), Augustus (3580), Dalgeranger (2100), Barlee, Pyrton, and the
                    Capricorn range. Kimberley has the Leopold, M'Clintock, Albert Edward, Hardman,
                    Geikie, Napier, Lubbock, Oscar, Mueller, and St George ranges. The lake district
                    of the interior is in the Gibson and Victoria deserts from 24° to 32° S. The
                    lakes receive the trifling drainage of that low region. Almost all of them are
                    salt from the presence of saline marl.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> With little or uo cold anywhere, the heat of
                    summer over the whole area is considerable. Western Australia differs from the
                    country to the east in having no extensive ranges to collect vapour, while the
                    trade winds blow off the dry land instead of from the ocean; for these two
                    reasons the climate is very dry. Thunderstorms often supply almost the only
                    rainfall in the interior. The south-western corner, the seat of settlements, is
                    the only portion where rains can be depended on for cultivation; but even there
                    few places have a rainfall of 40 inches. As one goes northward the moisture
                    lessens. The north-west and all the coast along to Kimberley, with most of that
                    district, suffer much from dryness. The north-east comes in summer within the
                    sphere of the northwest monsoons, though just over the low coast-range few
                    showers are known. The south coast, exposed to polar breezes, with uninterrupted
                    sea, has to endure lengthened droughts. In the Swan river quarter the rainfall
                    is in winter, being brought by north-west winds, and summer days have little
                    moisture. While the south wind cools the settled region, it comes over the
                    parched interior to the northern lands. The hot wind of Swan river is from the
                    east and north-east; but it is from the south in summer to Kimberley and the
                    north-west. In one season the land breeze is hot, in another cool, but always
                    dry. In the year 1885 Perth had a rainfall of 29 inches with an evaporation of
                    66. The temperature ranged from 34° to 109° in the shade. In 1885 there fell 32⅗
                    inches on 100 days, while Albany had 32 on 138 days, Augusta 46 on 122 days, and
                    York less than 18 on 81 days. Geraldton port received the same as York, but on
                    63 days, while Cossack, the pearl port of the north-west, had but 9½ on 18 days
                    throughout the year. Northampton showed 21¾, Beverley 14¾, and Eucla 9 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 9</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> inches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The base of Western Australia is of granite and
                    its kindred formations, which underlie Silurian or more ancient rocks. Not only
                    are the principal elevations so composed, but throughout the vast extent of bare
                    and sterile land eastward and inland granite is most prominent, rising through
                    recent deposits in knobs and tables onward into South Australia. It is the rock
                    of the Australian desert. The great lake district is a depression, with a
                    granite floor permeated with igneous veins, surrounded by isolated hills and
                    ranges of the Primary and metamorphic rocks. King George’s Sound and the
                    mountains around are granite, as also are disjointed ranges northward to Sharks
                    Bay. The streams in the north-west, as well as the Lyons and Gascoigne, take
                    their rise among the old igneous and Palaeozoic formations. Kimberley is full of
                    similar rocks. The upper Irwin has garnetiferous granite. Granite, both on the
                    south and western shores, supports the recent deposits of calcareous and
                    arenaceous material. The horizontal sandstone of the interior and the
                    flat-topped hills of sandstone rest upon the granite. The arid region around
                    Sharks Bay, glistening with limestone and sand, has the ancient stone for a
                    foundation, upon which coralline forms built their reefs. All sorts of
                    metamorphic rocks prevail in the Leopold, Weld, and other ranges of Kimberley.
                    Quartz veins are common in the hills. Cambridge Gulf is lined with quartzose
                    grit embodying rock crystal, and the Blackwood river with gneiss. Porphyry
                    appears at York, ou the Murchison, and elsewhere. Blue slate occurs on the
                    Canning at Champion Bay, and on Hampton Plains. Carboniferous rocks are present
                    near the Irwin, Canning, Fitzroy, and Murchison. Mr Hardman traced them
                    north-east over 1500 square miles, bearing coal plants. Secondary formations are
                    rare: a deposit of Oolite 400 feet thick is reported from the Murchison.
                    Tertiary beds of limestone are more plentiful, generally seen near the coast;
                    others of a coralline nature are more recent. Arenaceous limestone cliffs rise
                    two to four hundred feet along the southern shore for hundreds of miles, and
                    similar stone is seen at the junction of the Fitzroy and the Margaret. The
                    spiriferous sandstone on the Denison Plains of Kimberley, like that of the
                    Moresby range, is doubtless Palaeozoic. The desert sandstone, so easily
                    decomposed to furnish moving sand-dunes, is regarded as Miocene by Prof. Tate.
                    Freemantle stands upon a recent calcareous sandstone. Roeburne is similarly
                    situated. The soutli-west abounds in calcareous accretions. Cape Arid stops with
                    its granite the progress of Tertiary beds. Tertiary agates and jaspers occur on
                    the Ord and the Ashburton. Three terraces lead from the calcareous mud of the
                    north-west shore to the granite of Mount Brace. Nuyt’s Land is probably
                    Pliocene. Volcanic rocks of various ages have burst through other formations,
                    from Kimberley down to King George’s Sound. Basalt runs under the limestone of
                    Bunbury, and even rises in pillars; it is in scoriaceous dykes at King Sound.
                    Columnar greenstone occurs about Cape Leeuwin and Cape Naturaliste, while
                    greenstone dykes yield copper in the Champion Bay district. There is a sort of
                    Giant’s Causeway at Géographe Bay. Dampier Archipelago, Nickol Bay, the sources
                    of the Fortescue and the De Grey, Glenelg river, Camden harbour, Mount Waterloo,
                    Fitzroy river, and the gold field all show traces of volcanic action. Of the
                    geology of three-fourths of the colony, however, we know scarcely anything. The
                    presence of a new carbonaceous mineral called cliftonite has been recently
                    determined by Mr L. Fletcher in a meteorite brought by the Rev. Mr Nicholai from
                    Western Australia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> The earliest mines were of lead and copper in
                    Victoria district, the ore being sent to Geraldton, the port of Champion Bay, 30
                    miles from the Northampton mines of silver, lead, and copper. Berkshire valley
                    has in addition plumbago, the Irwin antimony, and Woongong silver. The Geraldine
                    lead and silver ores were first worked in 1845, and produced £43,000 in 1878.
                    Wheal Fortune and Tortura mines are of silver-lead; Gelira, Wheel Alpha, and
                    Narra Narra of copper. Iron ores are abundant; they are magnetic at Mount
                    Magnet. Coal has not yet been found in any quantity. Carboniferous rocks are
                    seen in several places, and fair specimens of coal have been obtained. A
                    semi-bituminous mineral near the Swan and the Murray yields a pale oil, which
                    would serve to varnish wood. Gold, long looked for, has been found in Kimberley;
                    and diggers rushed to the country about the Margaret, Mary, and Elvira rivers.
                    The majority did not find returns equal to expenditure; but auriferous quartz of
                    great richness has been reported recently. The proclaimed gold-field lies
                    between 16° and 19½ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> S., 126° and 129° E. Building
                    stone is found of many varieties.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture. —</hi> This was once confined to the Swan river
                    quarter, but is rapidly extending northward in Victoria district, where the land
                    is free of timber, though the rainfall is very light. In Kimberley tropical
                    produce, especially sugar, cotton, spices, and rice, can be readily raised. The
                    south-west is essentially a farming country, but the soil is generally sandy. In
                    1886 86,248 acres were in crop (hay 25,718; wheat, 24,043; barley, 5185; oats,
                    1766; maize, 171; potatoes, 356; green forage, 1075; vines, 649). No settlement
                    has a finer variety of fruits, and both wine and raisins are being exported. The
                    cottage homesteads are surrounded with pleasant gardens, vineyards, and
                    orchards.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Live Stock.—</hi> Timber was too thick in the old settlement
                    for flocks and herds; the squatting districts are eastward of the dividing range
                    and north of the Swan. The want of water both eastward and northward stops
                    progress, but sheep stations are established in oases of reputed eastern
                    deserts. The north-west, in spite of drought, is a favourite locality for
                    squatters; but the better-watered Kimberley is regarded as the most hopeful. At
                    the beginning of 1887 129,219,079 acres of the available country were leased by
                    6469 persons, at the rental of £73,863, averaging a little over half a farthing
                    an acre. The horses numbered 38,360; cattle, 88,254; sheep, 1,809,071; pigs,
                    24,655; goats, 5301. Some parts, chiefly in the soutli-west, are troubled with
                    poison plants. Borings in ill-watered places, as the southern and central
                    districts, furnish water for stock. The Angora goat has been a success there.
                    Rabbits already begin to trouble squatters. In proportion to inhabitants,
                    Western Australia has advanced in pastoral pursuits beyond its neighbours,
                    excepting in the quality of stock and the get-up of wool. Of 678,400,220 acres
                    in the colony only 1,851,742 are alienated, though 130,000,000 are leased out by
                    Government. The land laws are liberal. Lessees have pre-emptive rights over
                    parts of runs at 5s. per acre, within a certain period. Inferior land is much
                    cheaper. Kimberley leases are for not less than 50,000 acres at 10s. rent per
                    1000 acres,—this being the best pastoral country. A certain limited amount of
                    stock is required according to acreage and district. Poisoned land can be leased
                    for twenty-one years at £1 rent per 1000 acres, when the area is granted free if
                    it be fenced and the poison plants eradicated; a licence, for that term, of such
                    land, costs one-eighth of that rent. The break-up of the extensive original
                    grants is still essential to further progress.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flora.</hi> —Judged by its vegetable forms, Western Australia
                    would seem to be older than eastern Australia, South Australia being of
                    intermediate age. Indian relations appear on the northern side, and South
                    African on the western. There are fewer Antarctic and Polynesian representatives
                    than in the eastern colonies. European forms are extremely scarce. Compared with
                    the other side of Australia, a third of the genera on the south-west are almost
                    wanting in the south-east. In the latter, 55, having more than ten species each,
                    have 1260 species; but the former has as many in 55 of its 80 genera. Of those
                    55, 36 are wanting in the south-east, and 17 are absolutely peculiar. There are
                    fewer natural orders and genera westward, but more species. Baron Von Mueller
                    declared that “nearly half of the whole vegetation of the Australian continent
                    has been traced to within the boundaries of the Western Australian territory.”

                    south-east. Cypress pines abound in the north, and ordinary pines in Rottnest
                    Island. Sandalwood <hi rend="italic">(Santalum cygnorum)</hi> is exported. The

                <p>The timber trees of the soutli-west are almost unequalled. Of the Eucalypts, the

                    marsupial character, <hi rend="italic">Diprotodon</hi> being allied to the
                    wombat and kangaroo. Nail-bearing kangaroos are in the north-west; the banded
                    one, size of a rabbit, is on Sharks Bay. Nocturnal phalangers live in holes of
                    trees or in the ground. Carnivorous <hi rend="italic">Phascogalae</hi> are found
                    in soutli-west. There are three kinds of wombat. The rock-loving marsupial <hi
                    rend="italic">Osphranter</hi> is only in the north-east, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perameles bougainvillei</hi> at Sharks Bay. The dalgyte or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Petrogale lagotis</hi> is at Swan river and <hi rend="italic">Hypsiprymnus</hi>
                    in the south. The colony has only two species of wallabies to five in New South
                    Wales. The <hi rend="italic">Halmaturus</hi> of the Abrolhos is a sort of
                    wallaby; a very elegant species is 18 inches long. The pretty <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dromicia,</hi> 6 inches long, lives on stamens and nectar, like the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tarsipes,</hi> having a brush at the tip of its tongue; its tail
                    is prehensile. The hare-like <hi rend="italic">Lagorchestes fasciatus</hi> is a
                    great leaper. The <hi rend="italic">Hapalotis</hi> of the interior has nests in
                    trees. Beaver rats and other small rodents are troublesome, and bats are
                    numerous. The dingo is the wild dog. The platypus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ornithorhynchus)</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Echidna</hi> are the only
                    forms of the <hi rend="italic">Monotremata.</hi> The seal, whale, and dugong
                    occur in the adjacent seas.</p>
                <p>The west is not so rich as the east of Australia in birds. Many forms are absent
                    and others but poorly represented, though some are peculiar to the west. The
                    timbered south-west has the greatest variety of birds, which are scarce enough
                    in the dry and treeless interior. Of lizards the west has 12 genera not found in
                    eastern Australia. Of snakes there are but 15 species to 3 in Tasmania and 31 in
                    New South Wales. While the poisonous sorts are 2 to 1 in the east, they are 3 to
                    1 in the west. The turtle is obtained as an article of food. The freshwater
                    fishes are not all like those of the east. They include the mullet, snapper,
                    ring fish, guard fish, bonita, rock cod, shark, saw fish, parrot fish, and
                    cobbler. Under the head of fisheries may be mentioned the pearl oyster, which is
                    dived for by natives at Sharks Bay; the trepang or bêche-de-mer is also met with
                    in the north. Insects are well represented, especially <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diptera.</hi><hi rend="italic">Trade and Commerce.—</hi> Safe harbours are few,
                    and hundreds of miles of the coast-line are without shelter for a vessel. The
                    coasting traffic, until recently, was confined to the south-west, from the Sound
                    to Victoria district; but wool is now shipped at the north-west, as well as
                    pearls, while wool, pearl shells, hides, tallow, and gold are claiming attention
                    in the tropical north-east. The imports for 1886 amounted to £758,011, of which
                    £347,915 came from the United Kingdom, and £396,871 from other British
                    possessions, principally the neighbouring colonies and India. The exports
                    reached £630,392,—the main items being wool (£322,578), shells (£104,964),
                    guano, timber, sandalwood, pearls, lead, copper, manna gum, and gold. Of these
                    exports, £505,331 went to Great Britain, and £92,716 to other British ports.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Industries.—</hi> The pastoral industry occupies the first
                    place. Fisheries are taking an important position (pearl shell, bêche-demer, and
                    preserved or tinned fish). Mandurah, at the mouth of the Murray, and Freemantle
                    have preserving sheds for mullet and snapper. Guano beds are worked to much
                    advantage at the Lacepede Isles. Salt is produced largely at Rottnest Island.
                    Raisins are dried, and the oil of castor trees is expressed. The mulberry tree
                    succeeds well, and sericulture is making progress. Dugong oil is got from Sharks
                    Bay. Honey and wax are becoming valuable exports; from the abundance of flowers
                    the hives can be emptied twice a year. Manna and gums of various kinds are among
                    the resources of the country. Among the wines made are the Riesling, Burgundy,
                    Sweetwater, Hock, and Fontainebleau.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roads and Railways.—</hi> Excellent roads were made during the
                    period of convict labour. The northern railway from Northampton mines to Port
                    Geraldton is 35 miles long. The eastern line is from Freemantle through Perth to
                    Guildford (20 miles) and to Beverley (90 miles). A concession of 12,000 acres
                    per mile is bringing the rail from York nortlnvard to Victoria district, and
                    from Beverley southward to Albany on King George’s Sound. Communication between
                    the several ports is conducted by steamers, which have been aided by a state
                    subsidy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> Western Australia is a crown colony,
                    administered by a governor, his executive council, and a legislative council
                    partly nominated by the governor. The colonial revenue for 1887 amounted to
                    £461,322, the expenditure to £456,897.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> As in other colonies, the denominational
                    system formerly prevailed; but lately an effort has been made to have public
                    schools on a broader basis. The state in 1886 granted £7505 for 3169 scholars in
                    the public schools, and £1415 for 1339, principally Roman Catholics, in the
                    assisted schools. The Perth <hi rend="italic">Inquirer</hi> was the first
                    newspaper; there are now 11 in the colony.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> Of the 42,000 inhabitants 7000 are in Perth,
                    the capital, 5000 in Freemantle, 1000 at Albany, 900 at York. Some trouble from
                    the aborigines was experienced by settlers at first, but now many of them are
                    useful upon stations, making good shepherds. A successful mission for natives
                    has been conducted for many years at New Norcia, about 80 miles north of Perth,
                    by Spanish monks.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Both the western and northern coasts of the
                    colony are pretty accurately laid down on maps said to date from 1540 to 1550,
                    where the western side of the continent terminates at Cape Leeuwen. The
                    discovery of the coast may be attributed to Portuguese and Spanish navigators,
                    who were in the seas northward of Australia as early as 1520. The next visitors,
                    nearly a century later, were the Dutch. Edel explored northward in 1619, and De
                    λVitt in 1628. The “Guide Zeepaard” in 1627 sailed along the south coast for
                    1000 miles, the territory being named Nuyt’s Land. Tasman made a survey of the
                    north shore in 1644, but did not advance far on the western border. Dampier was
                    off the north-west in 1688 and 1696, naming Sharks Bay. Vancouver entered King
                    George’s Sound in 1791. The French, under D’Entrecasteaux, were off Western
                    Australia in 1792; and their commodore Baudin, of the “Géographe” and
                    “Naturaliste,” in 1801 and 1802 made important discoveries along the western and
                    north-western shores. Captain Flinders about the same time paid a visit to the
                    Sound, and traced Nuyt’s Land to beyond the South Australian boundary. Freycinet
                    went thither in 1818. Captain King surveyed the northern waters between 1818 and
                    1822.</p>
                <p>The earliest settlement was made from Port Jackson, at the end of 1825. Owing to
                    a fear that the French might occupy King George’s Sound, Major Lockyer carried
                    thither a party of convicts and soldiers, seventy-five in all, and took formal
                    British possession, though Vancouver had previously done so. Yet the Dutch had
                    long before declared New Holland, which then meant only the western portion of
                    Australia, to be Dutch property. This convict establishment returned to Sydney
                    in 1829. In 1827 Captain Stirling was sent to report upon the Swan river, and
                    his narrative excited such interest in England as to lead to an actual free
                    settlement at the Swan river. Captain Freemantle, R.N., in 1827 took official
                    possession of the whole country. Stirling’s account stimulated the emigration
                    ardour of Sir F. Vincent, and Messrs Peel, Macqueen, &amp;c., who formed an
                    association, securing from the British Government permission to occupy land in
                    Western Australia proportionate to the capital invested, and the number of
                    emigrants they despatched thither. In this way Mr Peel had a grant of 250,000
                    acres, and Colonel Latour of 103,000. Captain (afterwards Sir James) Stirling
                    was appointed lieutenant-governor, arriving June 1, 1829. The people were
                    scattered on large grants. The land was poor, and the forests heavy; provisions
                    were at famine prices; and many left for Sydney or Hobart Town. The others
                    struggled on, finding a healthful climate, and a soil favouring fruits and
                    vegetables, whilst their stock grazed in the more open but distant quarters. The
                    overland journey of Eyre from Adelaide to King George’s Sound in 1839-40,
                    through a waterless waste, discouraged settlers; but Grey’s overland walk in
                    1838 from Sharks Bay to Perth revealed fine rivers and good land in Victoria
                    district, subsequently occupied by farmers, graziers, and miners. Commanders
                    Wickham and Stokes about that time made discoveries on the northern coast. Roe
                    was an active explorer, aud Austin in 1854 investigated the country to the
                    eastward. F. H. Gregory traced the Gascoigne in 1857, and made known superior
                    land to the north-west about Nickol Bay four years later. Austin in 1864 saw a
                    good future for the Glenelg district, previously described by Grey. A. Gregory
                    was at the north-east in 1856, and J. Forrest in 1870 proved the way along the
                    south coast to be no hopeless desert. Giles crossed from the east. Major
                    Warburton in 1873 had severe trials with his camels before reaching De Grey
                    river from the east. The Messrs Forrest suffered much in another attempt to
                    penetrate the eastern barren country. A. Forrest had a successful tour in 1877
                    through the Kimberley province; two years later he made the connexion between
                    Kimberley and the north-west. The difficulties of the settlers had compelled
                    them to seek help from the British treasury, in the offer to accept convicts.
                    These came in 1850; but transportation ceased in 1868, in consequence of loud
                    protests from the other colonies. Seeking responsible government, the settlers
                    were told in 1888 that, if this were granted for the southern part, the north
                    would still be retained as a crown colony. The discoveries of lead and copper,
                    and lately of gold, must increase the working community; while the newly opened
                    pastures have brought in a great accession of stockholders. Settlers are
                    arriving from South Australia and other colonies, so that the prospects of
                    Western Australia are brightening. (J. BO.)</p>
