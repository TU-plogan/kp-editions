                    inhabitants of the sea, very abundant in the tropical zone, less so in the
                    temperate, and disappearing altogether on the confines of the Arctic and
                    Antarctic Circles. Their body is generally compressed, like that of a carp,
                    covered with smooth (cycloid) scales; they possess one dorsal fin only, the
                    anterior portion of which consists of numerous spines. Many wrasses are readily
                    recognized by their thick lips, the inside of which is sometimes curiously
                    folded, a peculiarity which has given to them the German name of “lip-fishes.”
                    The dentition of their jaws consists of strong conical teeth, of which some in
                    front, and often one at the hinder end of the upper jaw, are larger than the
                    others.</p>
                <p>But the principal organs with which they crush shell-fish, crustaceans, and other
                    hard substances are the solid and strongly-toothed pharyngeal bones, of which
                    the lower are coalesced into a single flat triangular plate. The majority of
                    wrasses are beautifully coloured, exhibiting extraordinarily varied patterns of
                    permanent pigmentary colours, as well as evanescent reflexions of the scales.
                    All of them are surface fishes, living close to the shore or coralbanks. Rocky
                    parts of the coast overgrown with seaweed are their favourite haunts in the
                    temperate, and coral-reefs in the tropical seas. Some 450 species of wrasses
                    (including Parrot-Wrasses) are known, chiefly from the tropics; some grow to a
                    large size and are esteemed as food, whilst others, like the British species,
                    are small and but rarely eaten.</p>
                <p>Of the British wrasses the Ballan Wrasse <hi rend="italic">(Labrus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">maculatus)</hi> and the Striped or Red Wrasse or Cook <hi
                    rend="italic">(Labrus</hi><hi rend="italic">mixtus)</hi> are the most common.
                    Both belong to the genus <hi rend="italic">Labrus,</hi> in which the teeth stand
                    in a single series, and which has a smooth edge of the praeoperculum and only
                    three spines in the anal fin. The ballan wrasse is the larger, attaining to a
                    length of 18 inches, and, it is said, to a weight of 8 ïb; its colours are
                    singularly variegated, green or brownish, with red and blue lines and spots; the
                    dorsal spines are twenty in number. The cook wrasse offers an instance of
                    well-marked secondary sexual difference,—the male being ornamented with blue
                    streaks or a blackish band along the side of the body, whilst the female has two
                    or three large black spots across the back of the tail. This species possesses
                    only from sixteen to eighteen spines in the dorsal fin. The Goldsinny or
                    Corkwing <hi rend="italic">(Crenilabrus melops)</hi> is much more frequent on
                    the southern coasts of England and Ireland than farther north, and rarely
                    exceeds a length of 10 inches. As in other wrasses, its colours are beautiful,
                    but variable; but it may be readily distinguished from the two preceding species
                    by the toothed edge of the praeoperculum. The three other British wrasses are
                    much scarcer and more local, viz., Jago’s Goldsinny <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ctenolabrus ruρestris),</hi> with a large black spot on the anterior dorsal
                    spines, and another on the base of the upper caudal rays; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acantholabrus pallowi,</hi> which is so rarely captured that it lacks a
                    vernacular name, but may be easily recognized by its five anal spines and by the
                    teeth in the jaws forming a band; and the Rock-Cook <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Centrolabrus</hi><hi rend="italic">exoletus),</hi> which also has five anal
                    spines, but has the jaws armed with a single series of teeth.</p>
                <p>On the Atlantic coasts of the Northern States of North America the wrasses are
                    represented by the genus <hi rend="italic">Tautoga,</hi> which is distinct from
                    the European forms. The only species of this genus, known by the names of Tautog
                    or Blackfish, is a fish of considerable economic value, being much esteemed as
                    food. It is caught in great numbers, and generally sold of a weight of about 2
                    lb.</p>
