                    described by Izaak Walton in his <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of Sir Henry, a
                    typical English family of wealthy landed gentry, keeping up a connexion with the
                    court, but avoiding the risks of factious ambition, often holding offices of
                    high trust, but always prudently declining the highest. Henry, the youngest of
                    four sons, was sent to school at Winchester, and thence to Oxford (New College
                    and afterwards Queen’s). At the age of twenty-two, with a high academic
                    reputation for wit and scholarship, he was sent abroad to complete his
                    education, and spent eight years in France, Spain, and Germany, making
                    acquaintance with men of learning as well as courtiers, a general favourite.
                    Returning to England at the age of thirty, he sought political employment, and
                    became one of the secretaries of Essex. On the fall of Essex he made his escape
                    from England and took refuge at Florence, where he employed his leisure in
                    writing a sketch of “the state of Christendom.” While he was at Florence the
                    grand-duke discovered a plot against King James, and Wotton was sent to Scotland
                    with the information and a casket of antidotes. King James was so charmed with
                    the emissary that on his accession to the English throne he at once offered
                    Wotton ambassadorial employment. He might have had the embassy to Spain, but
                    this he prudently declined, and chose instead the easier duty of managing
                    relations with Venice and the German states. After twenty years of diplomatic
                    service he craved and obtained the post of provost of Eton in 1624. He had
                    studied and written not a little at odd times during his active life, and when
                    he settled at Eton he intended to write a life of Luther; but in this and other
                    large literary projects he never got beyond the stage of collecting materials.
                    In his fifteen years’ provostship he set an example of careful, dignified, and
                    gracious supervision; and his wit, wisdom, courtesy, and benignity are well
                    represented in the <hi rend="italic">Reliquiae Wottianae,</hi> published with
                    Walton’s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> in 1651. Two of his witticisms are
                    immortal,—his definition of an ambassador as “an honest man sent to lie abroad
                    for the good of his country,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The full story of this witticism is given in Walton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Life.</hi></p></note> and his advice to a young diplomatist to
                    tell the truth, and so puzzle and confound his adversaries, He died in 1639.</p>
