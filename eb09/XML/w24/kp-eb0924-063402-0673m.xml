                    1471-1530), cardinal, was born at Ipswich, and seems to have been the eldest
                    son, as perhaps he was the eldest of all the four known children, of Robert
                    Wolsey and his wife Joan. The name Wolsey, spelt Wulcy by both Robert and
                    Thomas, is a diminutive of Wulf, that is, Wolf, and clearly proves their descent
                    from those Teutonic folk who gave names to two English counties, to the southern
                    one of which the Wolseys belonged. Simple repetition has made it commonly
                    believed that Robert Wolsey was to trade a butcher. The assertion was first set
                    afloat by enemies of the great cardinal, and was intended to be disparaging. The
                    probability, however, seems to be that he was really a grazier, and perhaps also
                    a wool merchant. He certainly belonged to the better class of merchants, was
                    connected with wealthy people, and himself died possessed of lands and property
                    in and about Ipswich. Fairly trustworthy tradition points to a house in St
                    Nicholas Street there as occupying the site of his own dwelling. According to
                    Fiddes, supported as to the year by Cavendish, Wolsey’s birth happened in March
                    1471, thouglι contemporary evidence would place it some years later. His
                    education began doubtless at the grammar school of his native town, where he
                    showed himself an apt scholar. That reputation was fully sustained when he
                    passed to Magdalen College, Oxford, for he took his B.A. degree at the early age
                    of fifteen, whence he was known as “the boy bachelor.” He became M.A. with such
                    credit and distinction that he had conferred upon him a fellowship and the
                    mastership of the grammar school attached to his college, of which last in 1498
                    we find him bursar. The whole course of college training was scholastic; it
                    strengthened and trained the intellect for actual life. Wolsey is said to have
                    been deeply versed in the subtleties of Aquinism; certain it is he remained
                    wholly unaffected by the Greek revival of the Renaissance, and looked but
                    indifferently upon its followers. From arts he went on to the study of divinity,
                    in which the unfriendly Polydore Virgil is compelled to admit he was “not
                    unlearned,” but of which he did not become bachelor till 1510. That there was in
                    fact, from whatever cause, some delay in Wolsey’s taking orders is evidenced by
                    his father’s will, made on the last day of September 1496, probably just before
                    his death. That instrument appointed Joan sole legatee, and directed “that if
                    Thomas my son be a priest within a year next after my decease” he, or, failing
                    him, another priest, should be paid ten marks, equal to about £60 present money,
                    for a year’s singing of masses “for me and my friends.”</p>
                <p>Among Wolsey’s pupils at Magdalen school were three sons of the marquis of
                    Dorset. So well was the marquis satisfied with the progress of his children that
                    he invited Wolsey to spend with him the Christmas holidays of what must have
                    been the year 1499. When Wolsey returned to Oxford it was with the presentation
                    to the quiet Somerset parish of Lymington. In the October following he was
                    inducted. He had not been long placed when a neighbouring squire, Sir Amias
                    Paulet, put him in the stocks. The cause of this indignity is not clear; but it
                    was remembered and resented with all the keenness attaching to an injustice
                    suffered. Fifteen years after, as soon as he became lord chancellor, Wolsey
                    summoned Paulet before him, administered a severe rebuke, and ordered him not to
                    leave London without licence. From then till 1523 Paulet’s name disappears from
                    the state papers, where previously its occurrence had been frequent. In
                    September 1501 Dorset died, and that event finally decided Wolsey to quit
                    Lymington. Paulet’s proceeding had not affected Wolsey’s character, for he now
                    became one of the private chaplains of Henry Dean, archbishop of Canterbury. But
                    any hopes he may have founded on this appointment were soon blighted by the
                    death of Dean in February 1503. Dean’s executors, of whom the chief was the
                    favoured servant of Henry VII., Sir Reginald Bray, deputed the carrying out of
                    his instructions respecting his funeral to ΛVolsey and another chaplain. Through
                    Bray, probably, W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> olsey next obtained a
                    chaplaincy with another favourite agent of Henry’s, Sir Richard Nanfan,
                    deputylieutenant of Calais. Nanfan was an old man; and so excellent did Wolsey’s
                    business capacity prove that the knight soon entrusted to him the whole work of
                    the deputyship. In 1505 Nanfan resigned and returned to England to pass his
                    latter days in peace; but so thoroughly had his chaplain gained his esteem that,
                    “through his instant labour and especial favour,” Wolsey became chaplain to
                    Henry VII. himself, and when in 1506 Sir Richard died Wolsey was one of his
                    executors.</p>
                <p>Henry was a cold master, and did not offer much opportunity for making way in his
                    favour, but Wolsey immediately set himself to win the approval of the leading
                    privy councillors, Bishop Fox and Sir Thomas Lovell. As usual he succeeded. And
                    he retained their friendship to the last,—his relations with Fox being perhaps
                    the most beautiful episode in all Wolsey’s life. Through their recommendation he
                    began his political life by a mission, probably in 1507 and to the emperor
                    Maximilian. According to Cavendish, who gives Wolsey himself as his authority,
                    not only was the embassy performed in the extraordinarily short space of about
                    eighty hours, but Wolsey took upon him to add to his instructions some items
                    which he afterwards found the king had sent after him. The expedition and bold
                    intelligence displayed established him in the king’s good opinion. Other
                    missions ensued, one of them to Scotland in the spring of 1508, all executed to
                    the royal satisfaction. Under Henry high ecclesiastical promotion came by
                    political service. On the 2d February 1509 Wolsey, who by this time held several
                    minor preferments, was collated to the deanery of Lincoln. Within three months
                    Henry died and his son came to the throne. Already had W <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi> blsey ingratiated himself with the young Henry, and almost at once
                    commenced his unprecedentedly rapid rise to power. Lymington having been
                    resigned by July, he in October received a grant of The Parsonage, part of the
                    forfeited property of Sir Richard Empson; and another month brought him the
                    office and title by which he was chiefly known for the next four years, that of
                    king’s almoner. From that time forward <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0674-0635"/> his history becomes entwined with the annals of
                    his country, where all that concerns the statesman must be sought.</p>
                <p>On the 20th November 1511 his signature as a privy councillor first occurs. The
                    council was composed of two parties,—the old officials, chiefly ecclesiastics
                    and headed by Fox, who favoured peace, and the old nobility, led by Surreý, who
                    advocated a spirited policy, even at the risk of war. Friendship and his cloth
                    naturally attached wolsey to the former, thereby giving rise to that family
                    hatred of the Howards -which pursued him to the end of his life. Fox had long
                    been anxious to withdraw from political life, and he now gradually shifted his
                    state duties on to the willing, able, and younger shoulders of Wolsey. Nor was
                    Wolsey’s opportunity of distinguishing himself long in coming. An expedition
                    against Guienne in 1512 had effected nothing and returned in disgrace. This only
                    roused Henry’s pride and persistence, and he resolved to invade France from the
                    north in the following year. The organization of the necessary force he
                    committed to Wolsey. Churchman though he was, Wolsey succeeded to admiration.
                    The royal army crossed the Channel, fought what French wit styled the Battle of
                    Spurs, and took Thérouanne and Tournai, while at home Surrey won the bloody
                    battle of Flodden. Success had crowned Wolsey’s labours and covered his royal
                    master with glory. Wolsey’s favour with Henry was confirmed. Rewards came thick
                    and fast. On the capture of Tournai, Henry named Wolsey to the bishopric of that
                    see, which just then fell vacant; but the English nomination was never ratified
                    by the pope, who in the end issued bulls promoting the French nominee Guillard.
                    Despite this miscarriage Wolsey was not long in being a bishop. In the
                    succeeding January (1514) the see of Lincoln lost its episcopal head, and next
                    month the new pope Leo X. confirmed Wolsey’s appointment to it. The preferment
                    proved but temporary; for in July Cardinal Bainbridge, archbishop of York, was
                    poisoned at Rome, and on the 5th August Wolsey was raised to his place.</p>
                <p>Two days later Wolsey brought to a triumphant termination his first great effort
                    in diplomacy, and made with Louis XII. of France a treaty which really undid the
                    notorious league of Cambrai, defeated Ferdinand of Spain with his own weapons,
                    and left England, for the moment, the first power in Europe. Wolsey thereby
                    began a new era in English politics. Since its origin with the Norman Conquest
                    English foreign policy had been bounded by the horizon of France. It had been
                    dynastic and insular. Wolsey made it European by taking the empire, Italy, and
                    Spain into his calculations. He deliberately set himself to preserve the balance
                    of power in Europe as a means of raising his country from a third to a first
                    rate state. And that end he accomplished solely by diplomacy founded on the
                    successes of 1513, which impressed on Continental statesmen a sense of England’s
                    power and thus gave to Wolsey’s succeeding diplomacy a weight it would not
                    otherwise have commanded and which it never afterwards lost. The character of
                    the policy accounts for its fluctuations: as the scales turned, so was Wolsey
                    compelled to vary his pressure.</p>
                <p>The year 1515 brought him two new honours. For years Warham, archbishop of
                    Canterbury, had desired to be released from the lord chancellorship, and Henry
                    had repeatedly urged Wolsey to accept it. Wolsey naturally shrank from adding to
                    his already arduous duties; but both Warham and the king became so urgent that
                    he at last yielded. By patent dated 21st December he assumed the post, and at
                    once threw himself into its work with his accustomed vigour, dispensing justice
                    and introducing reforms with fearless impartiality. The second dignity, the
                    cardinalate, was obtained through the active intervention of Henry himself, and
                    only by the most threatening arguments did the king overcome the fears and
                    reluctance of Leo. On the 10th September Wolsey was elected cardinal sole. The
                    bearer of the red hat and ring arrived in London in November, and on Sunday the
                    18th Wolsey was installed amidst all the ceremonial magnificence which he valued
                    not only for his own sake but for his king’s. By similar strong measures was
                    wrung from Leo the legateship, an office Wolsey sought in order to carry out
                    ecclesiastical reforms. In 1518 Leo, ostensibly on account of a crusade, sent
                    legates to the four chief courts of Europe. Campeggio, the legate to England,
                    was allowed to reach Calais, where his further progress was stopped till the
                    pope had joined Wolsey with him. Next year Wolsey was appointed sole legate for
                    a year, and, finally, in 1524, following several extensions, he became legate
                    for life, after receiving unusual powers. In virtue of this commission he
                    erected a court and instituted reformations by which he incurred much odium. In
                    1518 he received the see of Bath and Wells <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">commendavi,</hi> which in 1523 he resigned for Durham, replaced in
                    turn by Fox’s bishopric of Winchester in 1529. At the conclusion of the Calais
                    conference in 1521, Henry recompensed him with the rich abbacy of St Albans,
                    held, like the episcopates, <hi rend="italic">in commendam.</hi> From these and
                    other sources he received immense revenues, which were almost entirely devoted
                    to state purposes or national objects. He was prime minister of Henry, and in
                    his income as in his master’s there was no distinction between public and
                    private money. Vast sums were used in founding his college at Ipswich and
                    Cardinal College at Oxford, now known as Christ Church, which formed but part of
                    a splendid scheme of national education, a scheme ultimately ruined by the greed
                    of the king. Even what was expended on his own resplendent establishment
                    redounded to the honour of his king and country. His was an age when power and
                    pomp were more closely connected than they are now, and Wolsey’s power was
                    extraordinary. “He is in great repute,” reported the unfriendly Venetian
                    ambassador Giustinian; “seven times more so than if he were pope.” No wonder,
                    then, that he cared but little to fill the papal chair. When, in 1522, and again
                    in 1523, his candidature for the papacy came to nothing, he was not
                    disappointed. And, if in 1529, on the illness of Clement VII., he showed himself
                    seriously anxious on the subject, it was in all likelihood that he might compass
                    Henry’s will respecting divorce from Catherine, and prevent that rupture with
                    the apostolic see which he foresaw would result from papal opposition.</p>
                <p>Wolsey’s favour with the king had been founded on success, and it fell by
                    failure. In the region of politics one diplomatic victory had followed another.
                    The balance had been firmly held between Francis I. and the emperor Charles V.,
                    an enterprise rendered memorable by the splendours of the Field of the Cloth of
                    Gold (1520), planned and directed by Wolsey, and amidst which the Middle Ages
                    passed away. Suddenly across his minister’s diplomatics Henry dragged the
                    question of the divorce, and everything had to be sacrificed to its
                    accomplishment. Seeing too clearly how much, both personal and national,
                    depended on attaining Henry’s desire, Wolsey strove his very uttermost to
                    further a design to which he was himself opposed, stooping to the most
                    discreditable and unworthy means. But the decision lay with Pope Clement, who
                    was in the power of Charles V., Catherine’s nephew, and all Wolsey’s efforts
                    were in vain. Vain, too, were all attempts to intimidate Catherine herself. A
                    collusive suit was begun before Wolsey by which she was to be condemned unheard;
                    she got word of it and thwarted the plan by demanding counsel. A commission was
                    obtained from the pope for Campeggio and Wolsey to try the cause in England
                    (1529); she appeared before the legatine court at Blackfriars only <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n675/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0675-0636"/> to appeal to Rome, and thither under imperial
                    pressure Clement revoked the case. It was plain Wolsey had failed, and all
                    Henry’s wrath burst out against his too faithful servant. He pointedly employed
                    a secretary, and Wolsey’s occupation was gone. Wolsey’s foreign policy and
                    domestic reforms had united against him every party and class in the nation,
                    while at the same time he bore the blame of Henry’s mistakes and extravagance.
                    So long, however, as his royal master remained true to him he could defy all
                    hostility. But now that the king, too, had turned against him his sole support
                    had given way, and the hungry pack of enemies was unloosed. On the 20 th
                    September Henry parted from Wolsey without any sign of displeasure, but they
                    parted for the last time. Anne Boleyn and her uncle Norfolk were Wolsey’s bitter
                    foes. By Anne’s sway over Henry Wolsey was kept from the royal presence while
                    Norfolk plotted his ruin. On the 17th October, at the king’s command, Wolsey
                    delivered up the great seal to Norfolk and the base ungrateful Suffolk. He was
                    deprived of his dignities, his goods were confiscated, and, surrendering York
                    Place, he retired to Esher. The Court of King’s Bench found him guilty in a
                    praemunire, and sentenced him to imprisonment, while a bill precluding his
                    restoration to power or dignities reached the Commons. The bill was dropped, but
                    not till February 1530 did Henry grant him a full pardon and restore him to the
                    archbishopric of York, on condition that he resigned Winchester and St Albans.
                    Dreading his proximity to the king, his enemies procured his banishment into his
                    diocese. Thither he went in April, and won the hearts of the people by his
                    simplicity of life and graciousness of manner. His foes were alarmed; his death
                    alone could quiet their fears. He was preparing to be installed archbishop on
                    Monday, 7th November, when on the 4th he was arrested at Cawood Castle by the
                    earl of Northumberland for high treason. On the way south, at Sheffield Park,
                    Nottinghamshire, he was met by Sir William Kingston, keeper of the Tower, and at
                    last Wolsey knew his doom. Long years of toil, anxiety, and the ceaseless
                    vexations of his cruel enemies had shattered his health, and some pears sufficed
                    to bring on dysentery, which was unskilfully treated, and aggravated by
                    Kingston’s appearance. Nevertheless he set out, and by three stages reached
                    Leicester abbey on Saturday the 26th. “Father abbot,” he said, as the convent
                    with its head came out to receive him, “I am come hither to leave my bones among
                    you.” He felt that he was dying. Kingston assisted him upstairs, and he at once
                    went to bed. Vomiting and faintings came on, and he rapidly sank, yet his last
                    moments were spent in speaking to Kingston of the objects of his life’s best
                    energies, his king and country. At eight o’clock on the morning of the 29th he
                    died; and within twenty-four hours was buried in a rude coffin all that remained
                    of the genius who made possible the glories of Elizabeth and the British empire
                    of to day. He left two children, born before he became a bishop, of “one Larke’s
                    daughter,”—a son who went by the name of Thomas Winter and was an ecclesiastic,
                    and a daughter who passed as Dorothy Clansey and was a nun.</p>
