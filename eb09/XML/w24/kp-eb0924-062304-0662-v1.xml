                <p><label type="entry">WITNESS</label>, in law, is a person who gives or might give
                    evidence in a court of justice. The law of witnesses is on the one hand a branch
                    of the law of <hi rend="smallcaps">Evidence</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.},</hi>
                    and on the other is closely connected with the <hi rend="smallcaps">Jury</hi>
                    (&lt;7.v.), for the jurors were originally chosen for their knowledge or
                    presumed knowledge of the facts in dispute. The part of the Scotch juror’s oath
                    “and no truth conceal” is an <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0663-0624"/> obvious survival of the time when the juror
                    was a witness. It is only by gradual steps that the law has reached its present
                    stage in the United Kingdom and the United States. At present the disabilities
                    of witnesses are few; almost every one is a capable witness, and the main
                    question has become one of credibility rather than of capability. It was far
                    otherwise in Roman and ecclesiastical law and in the older law of England and
                    Scotland. A reference to <hi rend="smallcaps">Torture</hi> will show that in
                    Roman and mediaeval law the testimony of many persons was not admissible without
                    the application of torture. At the same time a large body of possible witnesses
                    was excluded for reasons which have now ceased to be considered expedient, and
                    was subject to rules which have long become obsolete. In Roman law witnesses
                    must be <hi rend="italic">idonei,</hi> or duly qualified. Minors, certain
                    heretics, infamous persons (such as women convicted of adultery), and those
                    interested in the result of the trial were inadmissible. Parents and children
                    could not testify against one another, nor could slaves against their masters,
                    or those at enmity with the party against whom their evidence was offered. Women
                    and slaves were under a disability to be witnesses to a will. The canon law
                    extended the disability to testify to an excommunicated person, and to a layman
                    in a criminal charge against a clerk, unless he were actually the prosecutor. In
                    the days of trial by battle a party could render a witness against him
                    incompetent by challenging and defeating him in the judicial combat. A policy
                    similar to that of Roman law was followed for centuries in England by excluding
                    the testimony of parties or persons interested, of witnesses for a prisoner, and
                    of infamous persons, such as those who had been attainted, or had been
                    vanquished in the trial by battle, or had stood in the pillory. All these were
                    said <hi rend="italic">vocem</hi><hi rend="italic">non habere.</hi> Many systems
                    of law excluded witnesses from policy of a local or temporary nature. <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Women</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.ν.)</hi> were generally
                    regarded as wholly or partially incompetent. The evidence of Jews was frequently
                    rejected in Spain and other countries during the 14th and 15th centuries. In the
                    United States, while slavery was lawful, the evidence of slaves (and in some
                    States that of free persons of colour) was not received for or against whites.
                    There were in Roman law some hard and fast rules as to number. Seven witnesses
                    were necessary for a will, five for a <hi rend="italic">mancipatio</hi> or
                    manumission or to determine the question whether a person were free or a slave.
                    Five was also the number necessary under the <hi rend="italic">Liber
                        Feudorum</hi> for proving ingratitude to the lord. Two were generally
                    necessary, as in the Mosaic law, as a minimum number to prove any fact. <hi
                        rend="italic">Unius responsio</hi><hi rend="italic">testis</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">omnino</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >audiatur</hi> are the words of a constitution of Constantine. The evidence
                    of a single witness was simply <hi rend="italic">semiplena probatio,</hi> to be
                    supplemented, in default of a second witness, by torture or by reference to
                    oath. In the canon law the evidence of a notary was generally equivalent to that
                    of two ordinary witnesses. The evidence of the pope and that of a witness who
                    simply proved baptism or heresy (according to some authorities) are perhaps the
                    only other cases in which canon law dispensed with confirmatory evidence. In
                    England one witness is as a rule sufficient. But in certain cases two or more
                    are necessary. Two must attest a marriage or a will,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The absence of two witnesses does not,
                            however, avoid a marriage as it does a will. The section of 4 Geo. IV.
                            c. 76 providing for the presence of witnesses at a marriage has been
                            held to be merely directory.</p></note> and two are necessary for a
                    conviction of perjury, treason, and some other crimes, such as offences against
                    the Act of Supremacy of Elizabeth. In the United States the number necessary for
                    the attestation of a marriage or will is not uniform in all the States.
                    Sometimes a special number has been fixed in England by statute in excep tional
                    cases. A curious Act of Richard II., passed in 1383 (6 Rie. II. st. 2, c. 5),
                    fixed the number of compurgators necessary to free an accused person from
                    complicity in the peasant revolt at three or four. Corroborative evidence —not
                    necessarily the evidence of another witness, but corroboration in a material
                    particular—must in England be given to entitle the complainant or plaintiff to
                    succeed in an affiliation summons or in an action for breach of promise of
                    marriage. The evidence of an accomplice also needs confirmation, if not in
                    strict law, at least in practice. The number of witnesses had in one instance in
                    old Scotch law the curious effect of determining the punishment. By the assizes
                    of King William, the ordeal of water was undergone by the accused on the oaths
                    of three witnesses; if to them the oaths of three <hi rend="italic"
                        >seniores</hi> were added, the penalty was immediate hanging. Witnesses need
                    not now in English law be <hi rend="italic">idonei</hi> or credible, except in
                    the case of witnesses to bills of sale under the Bills of Sale Act, 1882. The
                    “credible” of the Statute of Frauds has not been repeated in the Wills Act (see
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Will).</hi> In the case of dishonour of a foreign bill
                    of exchange the evidence of a notary is required, and a solicitor must attest á
                    warrant of attorney, as was also required for a bill of sale from 1878 to
                    1882.</p>
                <p>The modern law of witnesses has been already treated to a considerable extent
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Evidence.</hi> It should be noticed that since the
                    date of that article a new rule of great importance has received statutory
                    sanction. The rules of the Supreme Court, 1883 (Ord. xxxvi., r. 38), enable the
                    judge in all cases to disallow any questions put in cross-examination of any
                    party or other witness which may appear to him to be vexatious and not relevant
                    to any matter proper to be inquired into in the cause or matter. It will suffice
                    here to give a brief statement of the laλv as it at present stands, rather by
                    way of supplement to what has been already said than as an exhaustive notice.
                    Witnesses may be either sworn or unsworn, either judicial or non-judicial, the
                    unsworn and uon-judicial almost coinciding. The evidence of judicial witnesses
                    may be given <hi rend="italic">viva vοeβ</hi> or by deposition or affidavit, the
                    latter being the more usual course in chancery and bankruptcy proceedings. Where
                    evidence is taken on commission, the usual course where the witness is out of
                    the jurisdiction, the questions and the witness's answers are produced in
                    writing to the court which issued the commission, it being a delegation of the
                    authority of the court. As a rule all witnesses coming before a court of
                    justice, whether to give evidence as to a fact or a professional opinion, must
                    be sworn (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Oaths).</hi><note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The giving of evidence unsworn appears to

                            nay in all disputes.</p></note><hi rend="smallcaps">To</hi> this rule
                    certain exceptions exist at common law and have been introduced by statute, the
                    one of the most importance being the law by which persons objecting to take an
                    oath may affirm. Another exception was introduced by the Criminal Law Amendment
                    Act, 1885, the Act allowing the evidence of a child of tender years to be
                    received without oath. But to ensure a conviction such evidence must be
                    corroborated. At common law a person merely producing documentary evidence need
                    not as a rule be sworn. A witness, too, may be examined unsworn on the <hi
                        rend="italic">voir dire,</hi> as it is called, to decide the preliminary
                    question of his competency. Non-judicial witnesses are those who attest an act
                    of unusual importance, for the due execution of which evidence may afterwards be
                    required. They are either made necessary by law, as the witnesses to man·iages
                    and wills, or used by general custom, as the witnesses to deeds. In some cases
                    the attestation has become a mere form, such as the attestation of the lord
                    chancellor to a writ of summons (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Writ).</hi> Those
                    witnesses whose evidence is not received may be divided into incompetent and
                    privileged,—classes which must be carefully distinguished. The evidence of the
                    former is wholly inadmissible; that of the latter is admissible if they waive
                    their privilege. Among the incompetent witnesses are those of too tender years
                    to understand the nature of an oath, idiots and lunatics, those convicted of
                    perjury under an Act of Elizabeth (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Perjury),</hi><note

                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0664-0625"/> among English lawyers. In 1878 the Criminal
                    Code Commission recommended that prisoners should be allowed to give evidence on
                    their own behalf on oath. Several recent Acts have modified in some degree the
                    rigour of the common law. The accused, or the husband or wife of the accused,
                    may give evidence on oath in certain proceedings, nominally criminal,
                    substantially of a civil nature, such as indictments for nuisance or non-repair
                    of a highway (40 Viet, and 41 Vict. c. 14). The same is the case under the
                    Merchant Shipping, Licensing, and Customs Acts, the Married Women’s Property
                    Act, 1882, the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885, the Merchandise Marks Act,
                    1887, and other Acts. Up to 1702 the prisoner was under the further disability
                    of not being able to have his witnesses examined on oath. This harsh rule,
                    borrowed from Roman law, was not abrogated in Ireland until 1711, in Scotland
                    until 1735. Where a witness is competent, he is also compellable, except the
                    king. The only privileged witnesses practically now recognized in England are
                    high officers of state, executive or judicial, and members of the legal
                    profession, who need not divulge what has been disclosed to them in professional
                    confidence. Clergy and medical men are not privileged, though attempts have
                    sometimes been made to protect disclosures to them, especially to priests in the
                    confessional. Any witness is privileged from answering questions the ansivers to
                    which might expose him to penalty or forfeiture or to a charge of adultery.
                    Lists of witnesses intended to be called by the crown must be supplied to the
                    accused in charges of <hi rend="smallcaps">Treason</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >{q.v.),</hi> and are generally on the back of the indictment in ordinary
                    cases, though the prosecution is not bound to call them. In Scotland lists of
                    the witnesses are supplied in all cases, and in the United States in capital
                    charges.</p>
                <p>The mode of securing the attendance of a witness is by subpoena (see <hi

                    secured by citation. Disobedience to a subpoena is punishable as <hi

                    offender liable to the penalties of perjury. Various Acts of Parliament deal
                    with compelling appearance before committees of parliament, courts of martial,
                    and other tribunals of a special nature. A witness is protected from any action
                    for slander for words spoken in the witness box. He is also protected from
                    arrest <hi rend="italic">eundo, morando, et redeundo.</hi> The scale of
                    allowances to witnesses depends upon orders of court made with the approval of
                    the Treasury. It is graduated according to the social position of the witnesses.
