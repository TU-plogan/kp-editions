                <p><label type="entry">WRIT</label>, in law, is a formal commission from the crown
                    or other supreme executive officer to an inferior executive officer or to a
                    private person, enjoining some act or omission. The word represents the Latin
                        <hi rend="italic">brevis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">breve</hi> (both forms
                    are found, the latter more commonly), so called, according to Bracton, from its
                    shortly expressing the intention of the framer, “quia breviter et paucis verbis
                    intentionem proferentis exponit.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>It is perhaps doubtful whether <hi rend="italic"
                                >intentio</hi> is here used in its ordinary sense or in the
                            technical signification which it bore as a part of the Roman <hi
                                rend="italic">formula</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Roman Law,</hi>
                            vol. XX. p. 707-8).</p></note> The <hi rend="italic">breve</hi> can be
                    traced back as far as the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Theodosianus</hi> (438 A.D.), where one of its meanings is that of an
                    official report or letter. It bears a similar meaning in some of the

                    present borne by the writ of English law. The <hi rend="italic">breve
                        testatum,</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Liber Feudorum</hi> was an
                    instrument in writing made on the land at the time of giving seisin by the lord
                    to the tenant, and attested by the seals of the lord and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >pares curiae</hi> or other witnesses. In England such witnesses were part
                    of the inquest, and joined in the verdict in case of disputed right until 12
                    Edw. II. st. 1, c. 2. The <hi rend="italic">breve testatum</hi> in England
                    developed into the <hi rend="smallcaps">Feoffment (&lt;∕.u),</hi> later into the
                    deed of grant (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Real Estate)</hi>; in Scotland into the
                    charter, and later into the disposition. In canon law <hi rend="italic"
                        >breve</hi> denoted a letter under the pope’s seal. In old English
                    ecclesiastical law a brief meant letters patent issued out of Chancery to
                    churchwardens or other officers for the collection of money for church purposes.
                    Such briefs were regulated by 4 Anne c. 14, but are now obsolete, although they
                    are still to be found named in one of the rubrics in the communion service of
                    the Book of Common Prayer. In English legal practice brief now denotes the
                    written instructions put into the hands of counsel to form the basis of his
                    case. It was probably so called from its at first being only a copy of the
                    original writ. Such a brief is in Scotland called a memorial.</p>
                <p>The writ in English law still occupies a very important position, which can
                    scarcely be understood without a sketch of its history. To a certain extent this
                    history has already been given under <hi rend="smallcaps">Pleading,</hi> for the
                    whole theory of pleading depends in the last resort upon the writ. Writ or <hi
                        rend="italic">breve</hi> was at first used in a less technical sense than
                    that which it afterwards assumed: thus in the <hi rend="italic">Leges
                        Henrici</hi><hi rend="italic">Primi</hi> it simply means a letter from the
                    king, and in the Assize of Clarendon (1166) <hi rend="italic">imbreviari</hi>
                    means to be registered. It became formalized by the reign of Henry II., and
                    precedents are given by Glanvill. The writ process was at that date the
                    foundation of all civil justice in the king’s court, and of much in the lower
                    courts, and was a profitable source of revenue to the exchequer. Every writ had
                    to be purchased <hi rend="italic">{breνe</hi><hi rend="italic">perquirere</hi>
                    was the technical term). This purchase developed in later times into the payment
                    of a fine to the king where the damages were laid above £40. The usual scale was
                    6s. 8d. for every 100 marks claimed. In suing out a writ of covenant, the basis
                    of the proceedings in levying a fine (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Entail),</hi> the
                    king was entitled to his <hi rend="italic">primer fine, i.e.,</hi> one-tenth of
                    the annual value of the land concerned. The sale of writs was forbidden by Magna
                    Charta and other statutes in certain cases, especially that of the writ <hi
                        rend="italic">de odio</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >atia</hi> in favour of the liberty of the subject. A solicitor was so
                    called because his original duty was to solicit or sue out a writ and take the
                    due proceedings by paying the proper fine. The costs of a writ purchased were
                    first allowed to a successful demandant by the Statute of Gloucester, 6 Edw. I.
                    c. 1. Through the Norman period the prerogative of issuing writs seems to have
                    been undisputed. Glanvill’s precedents did not exhaust all possible forms, for
                    in the time of Bracton, in the 13th century, it was still possible to frame new
                    writs at the pleasure of the crown. The Provisions of Oxford in 1258 put an end
                    to this by enacting that the chancellor should not seal anything out of course
                        <hi rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> any writ for which there was no precedent) by
                    the will of the king, but that he should do it by the council. In 1285 the
                    Statute of Westminster the Second, 13 Edw. I. st. 1, c. 24, re established the
                    power of the crown within certain limits, that is, in causes of action in a
                    similar case falling under the same law <hi rend="italic">{in</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">consimili casu cadente</hi><hi rend="italic">sub</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">eodem</hi><hi rend="italic">jure)</hi> as those for which
                    precedents of Writs already existed in the Chancery (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Trespass, Trover).</hi> These precedents were at an early date recorded in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Registrum</hi><hi rend="italic">Brevium,</hi> called by
                    Sir Edward Coke the oldest book in the common law. Apart from the powers given
                    by the statute, new writs could only be issued by the authority of parliament,
                    and writs are sometimes found set out in statutes, especially in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Statutum</hi><hi rend="italic">Walliae,</hi> 12 Edw. I. c. 7,
                    where precedents of the most usual writs will be found. The Statute of
                    Westminster the Second itself contained precedents of the writ of formedon and
                    of many others. The original flexibility of the writ was thus limited within
                    comparatively narrow bounds. The right to the issue of the writ determined the
                    right of action. So essential was the writ that it was a legal axiom in Bracton
                    that no one could sue at law without a writ, and it was called by Coke, in his
                    introduction to Littleton, “the heartstrings of the common law.” As such it
                    occupied an important place in some of the leading statutes dealing with
                    constitutional rights. The Statute of Marlbridge, 52 Hen. III. c. 22, forbade a
                    lord to distrain his freeholders to answer for their freeholds, or for anything
                    touching their freeholds, without the king’s writ. By 25 Edw. III. st. 5, c. 4,
                    it was accorded, asserted, and stablished that none should be taken by petition
                    or suggestion made to the king or his council unless by indictment or
                    presentment in due manner or by process made by writ original at the common law.
                    42 Edw. III. c. 3 provided that no man should be put to answer without
                    presentment before justices, or matter of record, or by due process and writ
                    original according to the old law of the land. Both these statutes were recited
                    and the general principle confirmed by 16 Car. I. c. 10. Uniformity of procedure
                    was secured by 27 Hen. VIII. c. 24, by which all writs were to be in the king’s
                    name in a county palatine or liberty, but tested by those who had the county
                    palatine or liberty. It was not until 1731 that, by virtue of 4 Geo. II. c. 26,
                    writs were framed in the English language. They had previously been in Latin;
                    this accounts for the Latin names by which a large number are still known. The
                    writ was issued from the common law side of the Chancery, and was in the special
                    charge of the manager and petty bag offices. Though issuing from the king’s
                    Chancery, it did not necessarily direct the trial of the question in the king’s
                    court. In whatever court it was returnable, it called in the aid of the sheriff
                    as executive officer. It was either addressed to him or, if addressed to the
                    party alleged to be in default, it concluded with a threat of constraint by the
                    sheriff in the event of disobedience, generally in those terms, “et, nisi
                    feceris, vicecomes de N. faciat ne amplius clamorem audiam pro defectu
                    justitiae.” If the writ was returnable in the county court or the lord’s court,
                    the sheriff or the lord sat as the deputy of the king, not by virtue of his
                    inherent jurisdiction. The writ was not necessary for the initiation of
                    proceedings in these courts or before the justices in eyre (who sat as judges of
                    the county court),<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                            distinction between the royal and local courts was not perhaps at all
                            times very strictly drawn. Thus in the <hi rend="italic">Leges
                                Ηenriei</hi><hi rend="italic">Primi,</hi> c. 31, the county court is

                        >regis.</hi></p></note> but a custom seems to have grown up of suing out a
                    writ from the king where the claim was above 40s. Cases were transferred from
                    the lord’s court to the county court by writ of <hi rend="italic">tolt</hi> (so
                    called because it removed, <hi rend="italic">tollit,</hi> the case), from the
                    latter to the king’s court by writ of <hi rend="italic">pone</hi> (so called
                    from its first word). By Magna Charta the power of bringing a suit in the king’s
                    court in the first instance by writ of <hi rend="italic">praecipe</hi> was taken
                    away, and the writ was thenceforth only returnable in the king’s court where the
                    tenant held of the king ⅛ <hi rend="italic">capite,</hi> or where the lord had
                    no court or abandoned his right. Hence it became a common form in the writ of
                    right to allege that the lord had renounced his court <hi rend="italic">{dominus
                        remisit</hi><hi rend="italic">curiam)</hi> so as to secure trial in the
                    king’s court. Besides being used for the trial of disputes, writs addressed to
                    sheriffs, mayors, commissioners, or others were in constant use for financial
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n735/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0735-0694"/> and political purposes, <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.g.,</hi> for the collection of fifteenths, scutage, tallage, àc., for
                    summons to the council and later to parliament, and for recalling a parliament,
                    the last by means of the rarely occurring writ <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">revocatione</hi><hi rend="italic">parliamenti.</hi></p>
                <p>There were several divisions of writs (excluding those purely financial and
                    political), the most important being that into original and judicial, the former
                    (tested in the name of the king) issued to bring a suit before the proper court,
                    the latter (tested in the name of a judge) issued during the progress of a suit
                    or to enforce judgment. Original were either optional, <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> giving an option of doing a certain act or of showing cause why
                    it was not done, beginning with the words <hi rend="italic">praecipe
                        quod</hi><hi rend="italic">reddat,</hi> the principal example being the writ
                    on which proceedings in a common recovery (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Entail)</hi>
                    were based, or peremptory, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> calling on a person to
                    do a certain act, beginning with the words <hi rend="italic">si</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">A fecerit te securum.</hi> Original were also either <hi
                        rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">cursu</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >magistralia,</hi> the former those fixed in form and depending on
                    precedent, the latter those framed by the masters in Chancery under the powers
                    of the Statute of Westminster the Second. They were also either general or
                    special, the latter setting forth the grounds of the demand with greater
                    particularity than the former. By 5 Geo. II. c. 27 special writs were confined
                    to causes of action amounting to £10 or upwards. There was also a division of
                    writs into writs of right <hi rend="italic">(ex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >debito</hi><hi rend="italic">justitiae),</hi> such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >habeas corpus,</hi> and prerogative writs <hi rend="italic">(ex
                        gratia),</hi> such as <hi rend="italic">mandamus</hi> (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Prerogative).</hi> Coke and other authorities mention
                    numerous other divisions, but those which have been named appear to be the
                    principal.</p>
                <p>The most interesting form of writ from the historical point of view was the writ
                    of right <hi rend="italic">(breve de recto),</hi> called by Blackstone “the
                    highest writ in the law,” used at first for debt and other personal claims,
                    afterwards confined to the recovery of real estate as the writ of right <hi
                        rend="italic">par excellence.</hi> It was so called from the words <hi
                        rend="italic">plenum rectum</hi> contained in it, and was the remedy for
                    obtaining justice for ouster from or privation of the freehold. By it property
                    as well as possession could be recovered. It generally lay in the king’s court,
                    as has been said, by virtue of a fictitious allegation. In that case it was
                    addressed to the sheriff and was called a writ of right close. It was also a
                    writ of right close where the lands in dispute were held in antient demesne.
                    When addressed to the lord and tried in his court, it was generally a writ of
                    right patent. After the appearance of the tenant the demandant in a writ of
                    right counted, that is, claimed against the tenant according to the writ, but in
                    more precise terms, the writ being as it were the embryo of the future count.
                    The trial was originally by battle (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Trial),</hi> but in
                    the reign of Henry II. an alternative procedure was introduced, interesting as
                    the earliest example of the substitution of something like the <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Jury</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> system for the
                    judicial combat. A writ <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">magna assisa
                        eligenda</hi> was directed to the sheriff commanding him to return four
                    knights of the county and vicinage to the court, there to return twelve other
                    knights of the vicinage to try upon oath the question contained in the writ of
                    right (technically called the <hi rend="italic">mise).</hi> This mode of trial
                    was known as trial by the grand assize. Generally the whole of the sixteen
                    knights were sworn, though twelve was a sufficient number. The last occasion of
                    trial by the grand assize was in 1835. But long before that date possessory had
                    from their greater convenience tended to supersede proprietary remedies, and in
                    most cases the title was sufficiently determined by the assizes of other kinds,
                    especially that of novel disseisin and later by proceedings in ejectment (see
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Possession).</hi> The oath of the champion on
                    proceedings in a writ of right where the alternative of the judicial combat was
                    accepted was regulated by statute, 3 Edw. I. c. 4L The writ of right is also
                    interesting as being the basis of the law of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Limitation</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> By the Statute of Merton, 20
                    Hen. III. c. 8, no seisin could be alleged by the demandant but from the time of
                    Henry II. By 3 Edw. I. c. 39 the time was fixed at the reign of Richard I., by
                    32 Hen. VIII. c. 2 at sixty years at the most. There were other writs of right
                    with special names, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the writ of right by the custom
                    of London for land in London, the writ of right of advowson, brought by the
                    patron to recover his right of presentation to a benefice, and the writs of
                    right of dower and <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >rationabili</hi><hi rend="italic">parte,</hi> the latter brought by
                    coparceners or brothers in gavelkind. There were also writs in the nature of a
                    writ of right, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> formedon, brought by a reversioner
                    on discontinuance by a tenant in tail and given by the Statute <hi rend="italic"
                        >De Donis</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Entail)</hi>; escheat, brought by
                    the lord where the tenant died without an heir; <hi rend="italic">ne
                        injuste</hi><hi rend="italic">vexes,</hi> to prohibit the lord from exacting
                    services or rents beyond his due; <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >nativo habendo,</hi> to recover the inheritance in a villein; and the
                    little writ of right close according to the custom of the manor, to try in the
                    lord’s court the right of the king’s tenants in antient demesne.</p>
                <p>Up to 1832 an action was (except as against certain privileged persons, such as
                    attorneys) commenced by original writ, and writ practically became the
                    equivalent of action, and is so used in old books of practice, such as Booth on
                        <hi rend="italic">Real Actions.</hi> The law was gradually altered by
                    legislation and still more by the introduction of fictitious proceedings in the
                    common law courts, to be described later, by which the issue of the original
                    writ was suspended, except in real actions, which were of comparatively rare
                    occurrence. The original writ is no longer in use in civil procedure, an action
                    being now in all cases commenced by the writ of summons, a judicial writ, a
                    procedure first introduced in 1832 by 2 Will. IV. c. 39. In the following year
                    an immense number of the old writs were abolished by 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 27. An
                    exception was made in favour of the writ of right of dower, writ of dower <hi
                        rend="italic">unde nihil</hi><hi rend="italic">habet,</hi><hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Quare Impedit</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> and <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Ejectment</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> and of the
                    plaints for free bench and dower in the nature of writs of right. Ejectment was
                    remodelled by the Common Law Procedure Act, 1852; the other writs and plaints
                    remained up to the Common Law Procedure Act, 1860, by which they were abolished.
                    Other writs which have been superseded by simpler proceedings, generally by
                    ordinary actions, are those of the four assizes of novel disseisin, <hi

                        >warraηtia chartae</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Warranty).</hi> The number
                    of writs was so large that any exhaustive list of them is almost impossible, but
                    a few of those of more special interest which have become obsolete may be
                    shortly mentioned. <hi rend="italic">Admeηsuratio</hi> lay against persons
                    usurping more than their share of property. It was either <hi rend="italic"
                        >dotis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pasturae,</hi> the latter, like the Scotch
                    “souming and rouming,” being the remedy for surcharge of common. <hi
                        rend="italic">Alias</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pluries</hi> writs were
                    issued when a previous writ had been disobeyed. <hi rend="italic">Attaint</hi>
                    lay to inquire by a jury of twenty-four whether a jury of twelve had given a
                    false verdict. It was superseded in the 16th century by the practice of setting
                    aside a verdict or granting a new trial, and was finally abolished by 6 Geo. IV.
                    c. 50. <hi rend="italic">Audita querela</hi> was a means of relieving a
                    defendant by a matter of discharge occurring after judgment. After having been
                    long practically superseded by stay of execution it was finally abolished by the
                    rules made under the Judicature <pb break="no"

                        latitat,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quominus</hi> are interesting as showing
                    the extraordinary mass of fictitious allegation in the old procedure of the
                    common law courts before 1832. By <hi rend="italic">capias ad respondendum</hi>
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pluries</hi> the
                    Court of Common Pleas was enabled to take cognizance of an action without the
                    actual issue of an original writ. The <hi rend="italic">capias</hi> was a
                    judicial writ issued to follow an original writ of trespass <hi rend="italic"
                        >quia clausum</hi><hi rend="italic">fregit.</hi> The issue of the original
                    writ and after a time the issue of the <hi rend="italic">capias</hi> became mere
                    fictions, and proceedings commenced with the issue of another writ called <hi
                        rend="italic">capias testatum.</hi> On return of the writ the plaintiff
                    elected to proceed with a cause of action other than trespass, and the real
                    merits of the case were eventually reached in this tortuous manner. After being
                    served with the <hi rend="italic">capias</hi> the defendant was bound to put in
                    common or special bail, the former being sufficient in all but exceptional
                    cases. Here again there was a fiction, for his common bail were John Doe and
                    Richard Roe. The same fictitious pair also appeared on the side of the plaintiff
                    as his pledges for the due prosecution of his action. By <hi rend="italic"
                        >latitat</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quominus</hi> the Courts of King’s Bench
                    and Exchequer respectively assumed jurisdiction by a further series of fictions
                    over ordinary civil actions. The writ of <hi rend="italic">latitat,</hi>
                    following the bill of Middlesex, itself in later times generally a fiction,
                    alleged that the defendant was in hiding out of Middlesex, after committing a
                    trespass <hi rend="italic">quia clausum,</hi><hi rend="italic">fregit,</hi> for
                    which he was in the custody of the king’s marshal in the Marshalsea prison. The
                    real cause of action was then stated in what was called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >αc</hi><hi rend="italic">etiam</hi> clause. Writs filed in the King’s Bench
                    and Common Pleas were in the custody of an officer of each court called the <hi
                        rend="italic">custos brevium.</hi> The writ of <hi rend="italic"
                        >quominus</hi> alleged that the plaintiff was the king’s debtor and that
                    through the defendant’s default he was unable to discharge the debt. <hi
                        rend="italic">Deceit</hi> or <hi rend="italic">disceit</hi> lay for the
                    redress of anything done deceitfully in the name of another, but was especially
                    used to reverse a judgment in a real action obtained by collusion. <hi
                        rend="italic">Distraint of knighthood</hi> was a mode of obtaining money for
                    the crown by the exercise of the prerogative of forcing every one who held a
                    knight’s fee under the crown to be knighted or to pay a fine. The earliest
                    extant writ was issued in 1278. It was abolished by 16 Car. L c. 20. <hi
                        rend="italic">Entry</hi> was a possessory remedy against one alleged to hold
                    land unlawfully. It was divided into a large number of kinds, and was the
                    subject of much of the old real property learning. The ones most commonly
                    occurring were the writs of entry in the <hi rend="italic">per</hi> and in the
                        <hi rend="italic">post,</hi> the former alleging, the latter not, the title
                    of the heir from the original disseisor. When writ had come to be equivalent in
                    meaning to action, one of the divisions of possessory actions was into writs of
                    entry and writs of assize. A special writ of entry for dower was given by 6 Edw.
                    I. c. 7. <hi rend="italic">Excommunicato capiendo</hi> was the authority for
                    arresting an excommunicated person and detaining him until he was reconciled to
                    the church, when he was liberated by the writ <hi rend="italic">de
                        excommunicato</hi><hi rend="italic">deliberando.</hi> These proceedings were
                    abolished and the writ <hi rend="italic">de contumace</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >capiendo</hi> substituted by 57 Geo. III. c. 127 (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Excommunication).</hi><hi rend="italic">Haeretico</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >comburendo</hi> was issued on certificate of conviction for heresy by the
                    ecclesiastical court. A case of burning two Arians under this writ occurred as
                    lately as the reign of James I. It was abolished by 29 Car. II. c. 9. <hi
                        rend="italic">Homine replegiando,</hi> mainprize, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >odio</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">atia</hi> (or <hi
                        rend="italic">bono et malo)</hi> were all ancient means of securing the
                    liberty of the subject, long superseded by the more effective procedure of <hi
                        rend="italic">habeas corpus.</hi> The last of the three enjoined the sheriff
                    to inquire whether a committal on suspicion of murder was on just cause or from
                    malice and ill-will. It was regulated by Magna Charta and the Statute of
                    Westminster the Second, but, having been abused to the advantage of sheriffs, it
                    was taken away by 28 Edw. III. c. 9. <hi rend="italic">Nisi</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">prius</hi> was given by the Statute of Westminster the Second,
                    13 Edw. I. c. 30. Its place is now taken by the commission of <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Nisi Prius</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.). Orando pro</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">rege</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >regno,</hi> before the present Book of Common Prayer, enjoined public
                    prayers for the high court of parliament. <hi rend="italic">Privilege</hi>
                    commanded the release of a prisoner entitled to privilege of parliament. <hi
                        rend="italic">Protection</hi> was given for enabling a man to be quit of
                    suits brought against him while absent beyond seas. It was dealt with by a large
                    number of old statutes, but none has been issued since 1692. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rebellion</hi> was a means of enforcing obedience to the process of the
                    Court of Chancery. In modern procedure attachment takes its place. <hi
                        rend="italic">Rege inconsulto</hi> commanded judges of a court not to
                    proceed in a case which might prejudice the king until his pleasure should be
                    known. <hi rend="italic">Replevin</hi> was a survival of the most archaic law.
                    The procedure consisted of writ on writ to an almost unlimited extent. It
                    originally began by the issue of a writ of replevin or <hi rend="italic"
                        >replegiarifacias.</hi> The case might be removed from the county court to a
                    superior court by writ of <hi rend="italic">recordari</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >facias</hi><hi rend="italic">loquelam.</hi> If the distrainor claimed a
                    property in the goods distrained, the question of property or no property was
                    determined by a writ <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >proprietate</hi><hi rend="italic">probanda,</hi> and, if decided in favour
                    of the distrainor, the distress was to be returned to him by writ <hi
                        rend="italic">de retomo</hi><hi rend="italic">habendo.</hi> If the goods
                    were removed or concealed, a writ of <hi rend="italic">capias in withernam</hi>
                    enabled the sheriff, after due issue of <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">pluries</hi> writs, to take a second distress in place of the
                    one removed. It is said that the question whether goods taken in <hi
                        rend="italic">ινithernam</hi> could be replevied was the only one which the
                    Admirable Crichton found himself unable to answer. For the modern practice, see

                    It lay where two parsons contended for a church, and one of them entered with a
                    great number of laymen and kept out the other by force. As lately as 1867 an
                    application for the issue of the writ was made to the Chancery Court of the
                    Bermuda Islands, but refused on the ground that the writ was obsolete, and that
                    the same relief could be obtained by injunction. On appeal this refusal was
                    sustained by the privy council.</p>

                    central office of the Supreme Court, or the office of the clerk of the crown in
                    Chancery, provision having been made by the Great Seal (Officers) Act, 1874, and
                    the Judicature (Officers) Act, 1879, for the transfer on the next vacancy of the
                    duties of the clerk of the petty bag to those officers. By the latter Act the
                    record and writ clerks, previously officers of the Chancery Division, were
                    abolished. By 40 and 41 Vict. c. 41 the wafer great seal or the wafer privy seal
                    may be attached to writs instead of the impression of the great or privy seal.
                    The judicial writs issue chiefly, if not entirely, from the central office, with
                    which tlíe old crown office was incorporated by the Act of 1879. The crown

                <p>In local civil courts, other than county courts, writs are usually issued out of
                    the office of the registrar, or an officer of similar jurisdiction. By 35 and 36
                    Vict. c. 86 writs of execution from such courts for sums under £20 may be
                    stamped or sealed as of course by the registrar of a county court, and executed
                    as if they had issued from the county court. In county court practice the <pb

                        rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> corresponds generally to the writ of the Supreme
                    Court. Most of the present law on the subject of writs is contained in the Rules
                    of the Supreme Court, 1883, Ord. xlii.-xliv., and in the Crown Office Rules,
                    1886. Both sets of rules contain numerous precedents in their schedules. By Ord.
                    ii. r. 8 of the rules of 1883 all writs (with certain exceptions) are to be
                    tested in the name of the lord chancellor, or, if that office be vacant, in the
                    name of the lord chief justice. The main exceptions are those which occur in
                    crown practice, which are tested by the lord chief justice. The writ of error
                    bears the tests of the king or queen, “witness ourselves.” Before the issue of
                    most writs a <hi rend="italic">praecipe,</hi> or authority to the proper offices
                    to issue the writ, is necessary. This is of course not to be confounded with the
                    old original writ of <hi rend="italic">praecipe.</hi> Writs affecting land must
                    generally be registered in order to bind the land (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Registration).</hi> A writ cannot as a rule be served on Sunday (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Sunday).</hi> Some of the more important modern writs
                    (other than those of an extrajudicial nature) may be shortly noticed. <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Habeas Corpus, Mandamus,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Prohibition</hi> (yg ’.u.) have been already treated. Writs are generally,
                    unless where the contrary is stated, addressed to the sheriff. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Abatement</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nocumento amovendo</hi> enjoins the
                    removal of a nuisance iu pursuance of a judgment to that effect. <hi
                        rend="italic">Ad quod damnum</hi> is for the purpose of inquiring whether a
                    proposed crown grant will be to the damage of the crown or others. It is still
                    in use, and recent examples will be found in the <hi rend="italic">London
                        Gazette.</hi> If the inquiry be determined in favour of the subject, a
                    reasonable fine is payable to the exchequer by 27 Edw. I. st. 2. <hi
                        rend="italic">Attachment</hi> is issued as a means of supporting the dignity
                    of the court by punishment for contempt of its orders (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Contempt of Court).</hi> Since the Judicature Acts a uniform practice has
                    been followed in all the branches of the High Court, and a writ of attachment
                    can now only be issued by leave of the court or a judge after notice to the
                    party against whom it is to be issued. <hi rend="italic">Capias</hi>: the old
                    writs of <hi rend="italic">capias ad satisfaciendum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >capias utligatum</hi> may still bo used, but their importance has been much
                    diminished since the alterations made in the law by the Debtors Act, 1869, and
                    the abolition of civil outlawry (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Outlaw).</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Certiorari</hi> is a writ in very frequent use, by which the
                    proceedings of an inferior court are brought up for review by the High Court. In
                    general it lies for excess of jurisdiction as <hi rend="italic">mandamus</hi>
                    does for defect. The Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, makes the writ no longer
                    necessary where a special case has been stated by a court of quarter sessions.
                        <hi rend="italic">Delivery</hi> enforces a judgment for the delivery of
                    property without giving the defendant (unless at the option of the plaintiff)
                    power to retain it on payment of the assessed value. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Distringas</hi> lay to distrain a person for a crown debt or for his
                    appearance on a certain day. Its operation has been much curtailed by the
                    substitution of other proceedings by 28 and 29 Vict. c. 104, and the rules of
                    the Supreme Court. It now seems to lie only against inhabitants for non-repair
                    of a highway. <hi rend="italic">Distringas</hi><hi rend="italic">nuper</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">vicecomitem</hi> is a writ calling on an ex-sheriff to account
                    for the proceeds of goods taken in execution. <hi rend="italic">Elegit</hi> is
                    founded on the Statute of Westminster the Second, and is so named from the words
                    of the writ, that the plaintiff has chosen <hi rend="italic">(elegit)</hi> this
                    particular mode of satisfaction. It originally ordered the sheriff to seize a
                    moiety of the debtor’s land and all his goods, save his oxen and beasts of the
                    plough. By 1 and 2 Vict. c. 110 the <hi rend="italic">elegit</hi> was extended
                    to include the whole of the lands, and copyholds as well as freeholds. By the
                    Bankruptcy Act, 1883, an <hi rend="italic">elegit</hi> no longer applies to
                    goods. <hi rend="italic">Error,</hi> the only example of an original writ
                    remaining, was at one time largely used in both civil and criminal proceedings.
                    It was abolished in civil procedure by the Common Law Procedure Act, 1852, and
                    proceedings in error by the rules made under the Judicature Act, 1875. A writ of
                    error to the Queen’s Bench Division still lies in criminal cases, though it is
                    rarely brought, for it only lies for mistakes appearing on the record, and
                    recent legislation has given large powers of amending such mistakes. The fiat of
                    the attorney-general is necessary before it can be sued out. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>t depends on several statutes, commencing in 1344, and is specially mentioned in
                    the Statute of Provisors of Edward III., 25 Edw. III. st. 6. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Extent</hi> is the writ of execution issued by the crown for a crown debt
                    of record. The sale of chattels seized under an extent takes place under a writ
                    of <hi rend="italic">venditioni exponas.</hi> A crown debtor is entitled to an
                        <hi rend="italic">extent in aid</hi> against a person indebted to him. Where
                    a crown debtor has died a writ reciting his death, and so called <hi
                        rend="italic">diem</hi><hi rend="italic">clausit</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >extremum,</hi> issues against his property. <hi rend="italic">Fieri
                        facias</hi> is.the ordinary writ of execution on a judgment commanding the
                    sheriff to levy the sum, interest, and costs on the personal property of the
                    party. Where the sheriff has not sold the goods, <hi rend="italic">venditioni
                        exponas</hi> issues to compel him to do so. Where the party is a beneficed
                    clergyman, the writ is one of <hi rend="italic">fieri facias de bonis</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">ecclesiasticis</hi> or of <hi rend="italic"
                        >sequestrari</hi><hi rend="italic">facias</hi> (addressed to the bishop).
                    The latter writ also issues in other cases of an exceptional nature, as against
                    a corporation and to seize a pension. It is addressed to commissioners, not to
                    the sheriff. <hi rend="italic">Habere facias possessionem</hi> is given to the
                    owner of a tithe or rent charge, enabling him to have possession of the lands
                    chargeable therewith until arrears due to him are paid (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Tithes).</hi><hi rend="italic">Indicavit</hi> is still nominally grantable
                    under the Statute <hi rend="italic">De Conjunctim Fcoffatis</hi> of 34 Edw. I.,
                    and is a particular kind of prohibition granted to the patron of an advowson.
                        <hi rend="italic">Inquiry</hi> issues for the assessment of damages by the
                    sheriff or his deputy. It represents to some extent the old writ of <hi
                        rend="italic">justicies,</hi> and the later writ of trial allowed by 3 and 4
                    Will. IV. c. 42, but is narrower in its operation, for under the last-named
                    writs the whole case or issues under it could be tried. Before an inquiry the
                    liability has been already established. <hi rend="italic">Levari facias</hi> is
                    the means of levying execution for forfeited recognizances (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Recognizanct).</hi> The Bankruptcy Act, 1883, abolished it
                    in civil proceedings. <hi rend="italic">Ne</hi><hi rend="italic">exeat
                        regno</hi> was at one time issued by virtue of the prerogative to prevent
                    any person from leaving the realm, a form of restraint of liberty recognized by
                    parliament in 5 Rie. II. c. 2. It has now become a means of preventing a debtor
                    from quitting the kingdom, and so withdrawing himself from the jurisdiction of
                    the court with out giving security for the debt. There is some doubt whether it
                    has not been impliedly superseded by the powers given by Ord. lxix. of the Rules
                    of the Supreme Court. <hi rend="italic">Non omittas</hi> is for executing
                    process by the sheriff in a liberty or franchise, where the proper officer has
                    neglected to do so. It rested originally chiefly upon the Statute of Westminster
                    the Second, c. 39, and is now regulated by the Sheriffs Act, 1887, which repeals
                    the previous enactment. <hi rend="italic">Possession</hi> (also called <hi
                        rend="italic">assistance)</hi> enjoins the sheriff to give possession of
                    land to the party entitled thereto under a judgment for such possession. In
                    admiralty, where the judgment is for possession of a ship, the writ is addressed
                    to the marshal. <hi rend="italic">Procedendo</hi> is the converse of
                    prohibition. It directs the lower court to proceed with the case. It also lies
                    to restore the authority of commissioners suspended by <hi rend="italic"
                        >supersedeas. Restitution</hi> restores property, either real or personal,
                    after the right to it has been judicially declared. Thus it lies on behalf of
                    the owner of real property under the statutes of forcible entry and of personal
                    property under the Larceny Act, 1861. <hi rend="italic">Significavit,</hi> once
                    a writ, appears since 57 Geo. III. c. 127 to be merely a notice. It is a part of
                    the proceedings against a person disobeying the order of an ecclesiastical
                    court, and consists in a notification to the crown in Chancery of the
                    disobedience. Thereupon a writ <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >contumace</hi><hi rend="italic">capiendo</hi> issues for his arrest. On his
                    subsequent obedience or satisfaction, a writ of <hi rend="italic"
                        >deliverance</hi> is granted. Precedents of these writs are given in the Act
                    named. <hi rend="italic">Subpaena</hi> is the ordinary means of securing the
                    presence of a witness in court, and is addressed to the person whose attendance
                    is required. It is so called from its containing the words “and this you are not
                    to omit under the penalty of £100,” &amp;c. The <hi rend="italic">subpaena</hi>
                    may be either <hi rend="italic">ad testificandum,</hi> to give evidence, or <hi
                        rend="italic">duces tecum,</hi> to produce documents, &amp;c., or both
                    combined. By special order of a judge under 17 and 18 Vict. c. 23 a <hi
                        rend="italic">subpaena</hi> may be issued from any court in England,
                    Scotland, or Ireland to compel the attendance of a witness out of the juris»
                    diction. <hi rend="italic">Summons</hi> is the universal means of commencing an
                    action in the High Court. It is addressed to the defendant, and may be either
                    generally or specially indorsed with a statement of the nature of the claim
                    made. The latter form of indorsement is allowed in certain cases of debt or
                    liquidated demand, and gives the plaintiff the great advantage of entitling him
                    to final judgment in default of appearance by the defendant, and even in spite
                    of appearance unless the defendant can satisfy a judge that he has a defence or
                    ought to be allowed to defend. No statement of claim is necessary in case of a
                    specially indorsed writ, the indorsement being deemed to be the statement. The
                    writ may be issued out of the central office or out of a district registry, and
                    the plaintiff may name on his writ the division of the High Court in which he
                    proposes to have the case tried. There are special rules governing the issue of
                    writs in probate and admiralty actions. The writ remains in force for twelve
                    months, but may be renewed for good cause after the expiration of that time.
                    Service must be personal, unless where substituted service is allowed, and in
                    special cases, such as actions to recover land and admiralty actions. Service
                    out of the jurisdiction of a writ or notice of a writ is allowed only by leave
                    of the court or a judge. Notice of the issue of a writ, and not the writ itself,
                    is served on a defendant who is neither a British subject nor in British
                    dominions. The law is contained in the Rules of the Supreme Court, especially
                    Ord. ii,-xi. and xiv. <hi rend="italic">Supersedeas</hi> commands the stay of
                    proceedings on another writ. It is often combined with <hi rend="italic"
                        >procedendo,</hi> where on a <hi rend="italic">certiorari</hi> the High
                    Court has decided in favour of the jurisdiction of the inferior court. It is
                    also used for removing from the commission of the peace, and for putting an end
                    to the authority of, any persons acting under commission from the crown. <hi
                        rend="italic">Venire facias</hi> is the first proceeding in outlawry,
                    calling upon the party to appear. Under the old practice a <hi rend="italic"
                        >venire facias de novo</hi> was the means of obtaining a new trial. <hi
                        rend="italic">Ventre</hi><hi rend="italic">inspiciendo</hi> appears still to
                    be competent, and is a curious relic of antiquity. It issues on the application
                    of an heir presumptive in order to determine by a jury of matrons whether the
                    widow of a deceased owner of lands be with child or not. Almost exactly the same
                    proceeding was known in Roman law under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >interdictum</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >inspiciendo</hi><hi rend="italic">ventre,</hi> the praetor sending five
                    women to make a report.</p>

                <p>The principal writs of a non-judicial nature relate to parliament or some of its
                    constituent elements. Parliament is summoned by the king’s writ issued out of
                    Chancery by advice of the privy council. The period of forty days once necessary
                    between the writ and the assembling is now by 15 and 16 Vict. c. 23 reduced to
                    thirty-five days. Writs of summons are issued to the lords spiritual and
                    temporal before every new parliament. Those to Irish representative peers are
                    regulated by the Act of Union, those to archbishops and bishops by 10 and 11
                    Vict. c. 108. New peerages are no longer created by writ, but the eldest son of
                    a peer is occasionally summoned to the House of Lords in the name of a barony of
                    his father’s. Earl Percy, the eldest son of the duke of Northumberland, was so
                    summoned in 1887, and sits as Baron Lovaine (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Peerage).</hi> With respect to election of members of the House of Commons,
                    the procedure differs as the election takes place after a dissolution or on a
                    casual vacancy. After a dissolution the writ is issued, as already stated, by
                    order of the crown in council. For a single election the warrant for a new writ
                    is issued during the session by the speaker after an order of the house made
                    upon motion; during the recess by the speaker’s authority alone, under the
                    powers given by 24 Geo. III. sess. 2, c. 26, 21 and 22 Vict. c. 110, and 26
                    Vict. c. 20. The warrant is addressed to the clerk of the crown in Chancery for
                    Great Britain, to the clerk of the crown and hanaper of Ireland. A <hi
                        rend="italic">supersedeas</hi> to a writ has sometimes been ordered where
                    the writ was improvidently issued. The time allowed to elapse between the
                    receipt of the writ and the election is fixed by the Ballot Act, 1872, sched. 1,
                    at nine days for a county or a district borough, four days for any other
                    borough. The writ is to be returned by the returning officer to the clerk of the
                    crown with the name of the member elected endorsed on the writ. Sched. 2 gives a
                    form of the writ, which is tested, like the writ of error, by the queen herself.
                    The returning officer is the sheriff in counties and counties of cities (such as
                    Chester), generally the mayor in cities and boroughs, and the vice-chancellor in
                    universities (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Parliament).</hi> Other writs for
                    election are those for <hi rend="smallcaps">Convocation</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(q.v.),</hi> which is by 25 Hen. VIII. c. 19 summoned by the archbishop of
                    the province on receipt of the king’s writ, and for election of coroners,
                    verderers of royal forests, and some other officers whose office is of great
                    antiquity. The writ <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">coronatore
                        eligendo,</hi> addressed to the sheriff, is specially preserved by the
                    Coroners Act, 1887.</p>
                <p>Offences relating to writs are dealt with by the Criminal Law Consolidation Acts
                    of 1861; larceny by 24 and 25 Vict. c. 96, s. 30; forgery by 24 and 25 Vict. c.
                    98, s. 27. The maximum penalty is seven years’ penal servitude.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> Writ is a more extensive term than in England.
                    Writs are either judicial or extrajudicial, the latter including deeds and other
                    instruments,—as, for instance, in 42 and 43 Vict. c. 44, and in the common use
                    of the phrase “oath or writ” as a means of proof. In the narrower English sense
                    both “writ” and “brieve” are used. The brieve was as indispensable a part of the
                    old procedure as it was in England, and many forms are given in <hi
                        rend="italic">Regiam Majestatem</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Quoniam</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Attachiamenta.</hi> It was a command issued in the king’s
                    name, addressed to a judge, and ordering trial of a question stated therein. Its
                    conclusion was the will of the summons (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Will,
                        Summons).</hi> In some cases proceedings which were by writ in England took
                    another form in Scotland. For instance, the writ of attaint was not known in
                    Scotland, but a similar end was reached by trial of the jury for wilful
                        error.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An example
                            occurring in the reign of James VI. will be found in Pitcairn’s <hi

                    The English writ of <hi rend="italic">ηe exeat regno</hi> is represented by the
                        <hi rend="italic">meditatio</hi><hi rend="italic">fugae</hi> warrant. Most
                    proceedings by brieve, being addressed to the sheriff, became obsolete after the
                    institution of the Court of Session, when the sheriffs lost much of that
                    judicial power which they had. enjoyed to a greater extent than the English
                    sheriff (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sheriff).</hi> The executive functions of the
                    English sheriff are performed by the messengers-at-arms. An English writ of
                    execution is represented in Scotland by diligence, chiefly by means by warrants
                    to messengers-at-arms under the authority of signet letters in the name of the
                    king. The brieve, however, has not wholly disappeared. Brieves of tutory, terce,
                    and division are still competent, but not in use. Other kinds of brieve have
                    been superseded by simpler procedure, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the brieve of
                    service of heirs by 10 and 11 Vict. c. 47, for which a petition to the sheriff
                    was substituted by that Act and 31 and 32 Vict. c. 101. The brieve of cognition
                    of insane persons is now the only one of practical importance. The old brieves
                    of furiosity and idiotey were abolished, and this new form was introduced by the
                    Act last named. Writs <hi rend="italic">eo nomine</hi> have been the subject of
                    much recent legislation. The writs of <hi rend="italic">capias, habeas,
                        certiorari,</hi> and extent were replaced by other proceedings by 19 and 20
                    Vict. c. 56. The writ of <hi rend="italic">clare</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >constat</hi> was introduced by 21 and 22 Vict. c. 76. It and the writs of
                    resignation and confirmation (whether granted by the crown or a subject
                    superior) were regulated by 31 and 32 Vict. c. 101. By the same Act crown writs
                    are to be in the English language, and registered in the regis ter of crown
                    writs. They need not be sealed unless at the instance of the party against whom
                    they are issued. Writs of progress (except crown writs, writs of <hi
                        rend="italic">clare</hi><hi rend="italic">constat,</hi> and writs of
                    acknowledgment) were abolished by 37 and 38 Vict. c. 94. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >clare constat</hi> writ is one granted by the crown or a subject superior
                    for the purpose of completing title of a vassal’s heirs to lands held by the
                    deceased vassal. Where the lands are leasehold the writ of acknowledgment under
                    20 and 21 Vict. c. 26 is used for the same purpose. By 40 and 41 Vict. c. 40 the
                    form of warrant of execution on certain extracts of registered writs is amended.
                    Extracts of registered writs are to be equivalent to the registered writs
                    themselves. Writs registered in the register of sasines for preservation only
                    may afterwards be registered for preservation and execution. By 22 Geo. II. c.
                    48, passed for the purpose of assimilating the practice of outlawry for treason
                    in Scotland to that in use in England, the court before which an indictment for
                    treason or misprision of treason is found, is entitled on proper cause to issue
                    writs of <hi rend="italic">capias,</hi> proclamation, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >exigent.</hi> Many writs are by the Stamp Act, 1870, chargeable with a duty
                    of five shillings. In some respects the proceedings in parliamentary elections
                    differ from those in use in England. Thus the writ in university elections is
                    directed to the vice-chancellors of Edinburgh and Glasgow respectively, but not
                    to those of St Andrews and Aberdeen, and there is an extension of the time for
                    the return in electionsr for Orkney and Shetland, and for the Wick burghs.
                    Representative peers of Scotland were by the Act of Union to be elected after
                    writ issued to the privy council of Scotland. On the abolition of the privy
                    council a proclamation under the great seal was substituted by 6 Anne, c.
                    23.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> Writs in United States courts are by Act
                    of Congress to be tested in the name of the chief justice of the United States.
                    By State laws writs are generally bound to be in the name of the people of the
                    State, in the English language, and tested in the name of a judge. Writs of
                    error have been the subject of much legislation by the United States and by the
                    States. In New York writs of error and of <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">exeat</hi> have been abolished. Writs as parts of real actions
                    have been generally superseded, but in Massachusetts a writ of entry on
                    disseisin is still a mode of trying title. Writs of dower and of estrepement are
                    still in use in some States. By the law of some States, <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.g.,</hi> New Jersey, writs of election are issued to supply casually
                    occurring vacancies in the legislature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Authorities.—</hi> The importance of the wτlt in procedure led
                    to the compilation of a great body of law and precedent at an early date. In
