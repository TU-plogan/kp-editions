                    mainland by a narrow strait, the Solent and Spithead. The island is, roughly
                    speaking, diamond-shaped, the shorter diameter, from north to south, measuring
                    13 miles, and the longer, from east to west, 23 miles. The area is 92,931 acres,
                    or about 145 square miles. The most prominent feature in its physical geography
                    is a range of high chalk downs running from east to west across the centre of
                    the island, and terminating in the Culver and Freshwater cliffs respectively.
                    This range is broken through in the centre by the valley of the Medina, which
                    flows due north and is the only river of consequence in the island; it is
                    navigable up to Newport. A second smaller range of chalk downs .occurs in the
                    south near Ventnor. Along the south coast, extending from St Catherine Point to
                    Ventnor, there is the remarkable district known as the Undercliff, celebrated
                    for its wild and romantic beauty and for its mild climate. It is sheltered from
                    the north by a line of high cliffs. North of the central chalk range the country
                    is for the most part flat and well-wooded. Parkhurst Forest, where* timber is
                    grown for the use of the British navy, is 3000 acres in extent. The geology of
                    the island affords within a small area abundant opportunities for studying many
                    different formations. The uppermost of the strata represented in the island is
                    the Eocene, and the lowest the Wealden. All the strata between these two may be
                    studied in good sections, and very numerous and interesting fossils may be
                    collected. The various Eocene beds are exhibited along <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n597/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0597-0562"/> the north coast, and may also be studied to great
                    advantage in White Cliff and Alum Bays. In the neighbourhood of Gurnet Bay there
                    is a very remarkable bed, containing beautifully-preserved remains of insects
                    and spiders. In Alum Bay, in the extreme west, the strata are vertically
                    disposed, and consist of a very curious series of coloured sands and clays. Here
                    also the junction between the Eocene and the underlying Chalk is admirably
                    shown. The central range of chalk downs is part of the northern slope, and the
                    downs behind the Undercliff are part of the southern slope of a lesser
                    anticlinal axis, the upper portion of the Chalk strata having been denuded in
                    such a way as to expose the underlying Greensand, of which the greater portion
                    of the southern half of the island is composed. The Greensand formation may best
                    be studied in the cliff section from Atherfield Point to Rocken End. Beneath the
                    Greensand the Wealden is exposed in the section from Brook to Atherfield, and
                    also, to a much less extent, in Sandown Bay. The Wealden strata have yielded
                    abundant fossil remains of extinct reptiles <hi rend="italic">(Iguanodon),</hi>
                    especially in the neighbourhood of Brook and Cowleaze Chines; and at Brook Point
                    an extensive fossil forest exists, being the remains of a great raft of timber
                    floated down and deposited in estuarine mud at the mouth of a great river. At
                    Brook also the characteristic Wealden mollusk, <hi rend="italic">Unio
                    valdensis,</hi> occurs abundantly.</p>
                <p>The climate is mild, and relaxing, and enjoys the reputation of being peculiarly
                    salubrious. In winter and spring, however, the east winds are very trying, and
                    in summer the heat is at times very great. The climate of the Undercliff is
                    especially mild, and a large consumption hospital (the Royal National Hospital
                    for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest), arranged on ιhe cottage principle,
                    has been established here. Partly owing to the mildness of the climate, and
                    partly to the beauty of the scenery, the island has long been a favourite resort
                    of tourists, and λvithin recent years several fashionable watering-places have
                    sprung up. Of these the principal are Cowes, at the mouth of the Medina, the
                    headquarters of the Royal Yacht Squadron, Ryde (11,461 inhabitants in 1881),
                    Bembridge, Sandown, Ventnor (5739), Shanklin (1780), Freshwater (2809), and
                    Yarmouth (787). Newport (9357), on the Medina, is the capital of the island, but
                    is comparatively little frequented by visiters. Hitherto many parts of the
                    island have been more or less inaccessible owing to the deficiency of railways;
                    but it is being rapidly opened up, and a railway is now in course of
                    construction between Newport, Carisbrooke, Yarmouth, and Freshwater. There are
                    few industries in the island. The population is chiefly agricultural, a large
                    proportion of the land being devoted to sheepgrazing. Fishing is also carried on
                    to a considerable extent on the south coast,—lobsters, crabs, and prawns being
                    plentiful. Oyster cultivation has been attempted in the Medina, in Brading
                    Harbour, and in the Newtown river. At Cowes shipbuilding is carried on, and on
                    the Medina there are cement-works. In the towns, however, the chief occupation
                    of the inhabitants consists in providing for the wants of the summer visiters;
                    in winter very little business is done. The island is divided into two
                    liberties, East and West Medina, excluding the two boroughs of Newport and Ryde;
                    and it forms one petty and special sessional division of the county. Until 1885
                    there was one member of parliament for the island and one for the borough of
                    Newport; now, however, there is only one member for the whole island.
                    Episcopally the island has for many centuries belonged to the see of Winchester.
                    In 1881 the population was 73,633, as against 66,219 in 1871.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The Isle of Wight (Roman <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vectis)</hi> was originally inhabited by Celts, and was conquered for the
                    emperor Claudius by Vespasian in 43. The Romans remained in possession for four
                    centuries. In 530 it was conquered by Cerdic and Cymric and added to the kingdom
                    of W essex. Later on it again became free from the control of Wessex and
                    remained independent until the inhabitants of their own accord submitted to
                    Edward, the son of Alfred. William the Conqueror gave the island as an
                    independent lordship to William Fitz-Osborne, but it was again forfeited to the
                    crown on the rebellion of his son, the earl of Hereford. Henry I. gave the
                    lordship to Richard de Redvers, in whose family it remained until 1293, when
                    Isabella de Fortibus, the lady of the island, sold it to Edward I. Richard II.
                    again appointed a lord of the island, and the office continued until the
                    reign.of Henry VII., when it was finally abolished. From that date onwards the
                    government has been vested in a captain or governor, whose office is now
                    honorary. Charles I. was confined in Carisbrooke Castle for some time in 1649.
                    The antiquities include the British pit villages near</p>
                <p>Rowborough, the Celtic tumuli on several of the chalk downs, the long stone at
                    Mottistone, the Roman villas near Brading and Carisbrooke, the ruins of Quarr
                    Abbey, and numerous ancient churches. Carisbrooke Castle, almost in the centre
                    of the island, is a fine old ruin built upon the site of an ancient British
                    stronghold. The British fortifications were probably occupied as a camp by the
                    Romans under Vespasian, and they were subsequently held by the Saxons, who made
                    the high mound known as the keep. The inner walls of the castle were erected in
                    the 11th century, and the outer defences were constructed in the reign of
                    Elizabeth. The Roman villa near Brading contains some beautiful and
                    well-preserved examples of tesselated pavements; that at Carisbrooke is smaller
                    and not so interesting.</p>
