                    heir. The great men of the duchy did homage to the child, and a year later
                    (1035) his father’s death left <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0610-0575"/> him to make good his claim. Anarchy was the
                    natural result of a minority. William’s life was on more than one occasion in
                    danger and several of his guardians perished in his service. At the earliest
                    possible age he received knighthood from the hands of Henry I. of France, and
                    speedily began to show signs of his capacity for government. In 1042 he insisted
                    that the “truce of God” should be proclaimed and observed in Normandy. When he
                    was about twenty years old, his authority was threatened by a general
                    conspiracy, which spread through the western half of his duchy. An attempt was
                    made to seize him at Valognes, and he only escaped by riding hard all night to
                    his own castle at Falaise. Bessin and Cotentin, the most Norman parts of
                    Normandy, rose in rebellion. William sought and obtained aid from King Henry,
                    and completely defeated the rebels at Val-es-Dunes near Caen (1047). The battle
                    was but a combat of horse, but it decided the fate of the war and left William
                    master of his duchy. The debt which he owed to Henry was repaid next year. War
                    broke out between Geoffrey, count of Anjou, and Henry (1048), and William came
                    to his suzerain’s assistance. Alençon, one of the chief border fortresses
                    between Normandy and Maine, which had received an Angevin garrison, was captured
                    by the duke. The inhabitants had taunted him with his birth, and William, who
                    had dealt leniently with the rebels after Val-es-Dunes, took a cruel revenge.
                    Soon afterwards Domfront, another important border fortress, fell into his
                    hands.</p>
                <p>In 1051 William visited England (see vol. viii. p. 289)∙. Two years later he
                    married Matilda, daughter of Baldwin, earl of Flanders, and a descendant of
                    Alfred. The marriage had been forbidden by a council at Rheims as uncanonical,
                    and was opposed by Lanfranc, prior of Bee. This produced a quarrel between
                    Lanfranc and William, who ravaged the lands of the abbey and ordered the
                    banishment of its prior. Lanfranc, however, soon came to terms with the duke,
                    and engaged to obtain a dispensation from Rome, which, however, was not granted
                    till 1059. Strengthened by this alliance with Flanders, William showed himself
                    more than a match for all his enemies. Henry, who had hitherto been for the most
                    part friendly, now turned against him. After the suppression of some isolated
                    revolts, William was threatened in 1054 by a great confederacy. His dominions
                    were invaded by the forces of the French king, in combination with those of
                    Geoffrey of Anjou, Theobald of Blois, and others. William remained at first on
                    the defensive; then, falling suddenly on one of the French armies at Mortemer,
                    in the north-eastern corner of his duchy, he cut it to pieces. This blow put an
                    end to the war; Henry made peace (1055) and William took the opportunity of
                    extending his dominions in a southerly direction. He built fresh fortresses and
                    exacted homage from Count Geoffrey of Mayenne. In 1058 Henry and Count Geoffrey
                    made a final effort to crush their dangerous neighbour; but the effort failed,
                    like those which preceded it. William again allowed the allies to enter and
                    ravage his territory; but, while the French army was crossing the Dive at
                    Varaville, he attacked and completely destroyed their rear-guard, which was cut
                    off from the van by the advancing tide. Henry again made peace, and soon
                    afterwards died (1060). The death of Geoffrey of Anjou in the same year relieved
                    William of his most formidable rival for the possession of Maine. Herbert
                    Wake-Dog, the lawful ruler of that territory, who had been dispossessed by
                    Geoffrey, recovered his dominions on the latter’s death. He at once “commended”
                    himself to William, thus making the duke his heir. On his death in 1063 William
                    took possession of Le Mans and the county of which it was the capital,—an
                    acquisition which extended his southern frontier nearly to the Loire, almost
                    severed Brittany from the rest of</p>
                <p>France, and paved the way for the subsequent junction with Anjou.</p>
                <p>It was apparently soon after this event, in the year 1064, that Harold, then earl
                    of Wessex, visited Normandy. For the relations between him and William which
                    grew out of this visit, see <hi rend="smallcaps">England,</hi> vol. viii. pp.
                    290-291. When Harold was elected and crowned king of England (1066), William’s
                    first step was to send an embassy to him demanding the fulfilment of his
                    promise. The purport of the demand is as uncertain as that of the pledge; but,
                    whatever it was, Harold rejected it. The duke thereupon summoned a council of
                    his supporters, who advised him to call together an assembly representing the
                    whole duchy. This assembly, a typical feudal parliament, met at Lillebonne.
                    While acting together it appears to have opposed the scheme for the conquest of
                    England which William laid before it, but its members were won over singly. He
                    then made a compact with Tostig, the banished brother of Harold; he came to
                    terms with the emperor Henry; he conciliated Philip, king of France, by offering
                    to hold England as his vassal; and—most important of all—he obtained the
                    sanction of Rome. Pope Alexander II. not only issued a bull declaring William to
                    be the rightful heir to the throne, but sent him a ring and a banner as symbols
                    that the blessing of heaven was on his claim. Embarking at St Valéry, William
                    landed on 28th September at Pevensey. The battle of Senlac or Hastings (14th
                    October 1066) was a decisive victory for the duke of Normandy; but it took five
                    years more to complete the conquest of England.</p>
                <p>Early in 1067 William made a progress through the eastern and central parts of
                    his new dominions. All that had as yet submitted to him was comprised in the old
                    kingdoms of Wessex and East Anglia, and a small portion of Mercia. He at once
                    secured his hold over these districts by the erection of fortresses in London,
                    Norwich, and elsewhere. He received homage from the great men; he confiscated
                    the lands of those who had resisted him; and, while keeping a large number of
                    manors for himself, he granted others to his followers. Even those who had not
                    resisted were regarded as having legally forfeited their title and had to submit
                    to a re-grant on less advantageous terms. In March 1067 William returned to
                    Normandy, taking with him as hostages the earls Eadwine, Morkere, and Waltheof.
                    The revolts which broke out in the north and south-west compelled him to return
                    to England in December. Early in 1068 he marched on Exeter, as the centre of the
                    western revolt. He took the town and built a castle, after which he subdued
                    Cornwall, and then marching northward forced Bristol to submit. In the summer of
                    1068 there was a general rising of the north, of which Eadgar was the nominal
                    head; but Eadwine and Morkere were the moving spirits. The insurgents were aided
                    by Malcolm, king of Scotland. William had, however, only to show himself in
                    order to put down the insurrection. He journeyed northward, by way of Warwick
                    and Nottingham, to York, received the submission of Eadwine, Morkere, and
                    Malcolm, and returned by way of Lincoln and Cambridge. His march was accompanied
                    by heavy confiscations, and great castles, rising in places of vantage, rendered
                    the Norman power at once visible and secure. In the spring of 1069 a fresh
                    revolt, broke out. Robert of Comines, the newly appointed earl of
                    Northumberland, was slain at Durham; a Danish fleet entered the Humber, and a
                    Danish army, joined by Eadgar and Waltheof, seized and burned York. The sons of
                    Harold attacked Devon, while other isolated outbreaks took place in the west.
                    These were speedily put down by William’s lieutenants; and in the autumn the
                    king himself, going northward a second time, recovered York and harried
                    Northumberland with ruthless deliberation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n611/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0611-0576"/>. Returning to keep Christmas at York, he set out
                    again in January 1070 to oppose Malcolm, who had crossed the border in aid of
                    the insurgents. He forced Waltheof to submit, and drove the Scottish king back
                    into his own country; then, marching over pathless fells in the depth of
                    -winter, he reached Chester, took the town, and founded another castle.
                    Northumbria, exhausted and ruined, gave up the struggle, and the omission of the
                    northern counties from the Domesday survey throws a grim light on the
                    completeness of the Conquest. In one district only, the fens of Cambridgeshire,
                    where Hereward still held out, the spirit of resistance survived. In April 1071
                    William arrived at Cambridge and commenced a regular blockade. Advancing
                    cautiously by means of a causeway through the fens, he entered Ely in October,
                    and therewith the last flicker of independence died out. The conquest of England
                    was completed. To guard against any fresh incitements to rebellion from
                    Scotland, William in 1072 invaded that country and forced Malcolm to do him
                    homage,—an event which had an important effect on the subsequent relations of
                    the two countries.</p>
                <p>Henceforward such trouble as William met with came, not from the English, but
                    from his Norman vassals or his own family. In 1073 the citizens of Le Mans took
                    advantage of his absence to set up a “commune,” and invited Fulk of Anjou to
                    protect them. William was soon in the field, this time assisted by English
                    troops. He harried the country, recovered Le Mans, and made an advantageous
                    peace with the count. By a skilful compromise he recognized Fulk as overlord of
                    Maine, but kept actual possession of the district, for which his son Robert did
                    homage. A year later a formidable revolt broke out in England. Two of William’s
                    great vassals, Ralph, earl of Norfolk, and Roger, earl of Hereford, rebelled,
                    and a Danish fleet, probably in alliance with them, appeared in the Humber.
                    William returned at once to England and put down the insurrection. A great
                    meeting of the witan was summoned to try Roger and Waltheof, for the latter,
                    though he took no part in the rebellion, had undoubtedly been privy to it. Roger
                    was imprisoned for life and Waltheof was condemned to death. This was the last
                    instance of opposition to William in England; but the remaining ten years of his
                    life were occupied with almost continuous troubles on the Continent. In 1076 he
                    was engaged in a war with Brittany, which the interference of Philip of France
                    forced him to bring to an unsuccessful conclusion. Next year he quarrelled with
                    his son Robert. Matilda took the young man’s side against her husband, and
                    Philip lent him his assistance. In 1080 William was at open war with his son.
                    While besieging him at Gerberoi he received a wound and was forced to raise the
                    siege. A temporary reconciliation followed, soon to give way to another and a
                    final quarrel. Three years later Matilda died, and troubles thickened upon
                    William. A rebellious vassal, Hubert of Beaumont, seems to have held him at bay
                    for nearly three years. Rival claims to Vexin, a district on the eastern
                    frontier of Normandy, involved him in another war with France. He was growing
                    old and weary, and, as he lay sick at Rouen in the summer of 1087, the French
                    army harried his territories with impunity. When he had recovered sufficiently
                    to take the field, he invaded Vexin and burned the town of Mantes. But his
                    horse, plunging in the burning cinders, inflicted on him an internal injury
                    which proved his death-wound. He was carried to St Gervais, where, on 9th
                    September 1087, he died. His body was conveyed to Caen and buried in the great
                    minster which he had built.</p>
                <p>The career of William as a warrior and conqueror occupies of necessity the
                    largest space in his life; but his fame as a statesman and administrator is not
                    less than that which he won on the battlefield. This is not the place to discuss
                    the results of the Conquest, but the policy of the Conqueror in regard to church
                    and state cannot be overlooked. An orthodox churchman, a supporter of union
                    under the successor of Peter against the schismatic tendencies of the English
                    Church, he nevertheless repelled any claim on the part of Rome to interference
                    with his political sovereignty. He allowed Peter’s pence to be collected, but
                    refused to pay tribute to the pope. While recognizing him as head of the church,
                    he declined to hold his kingdom as his vassal, nor would he permit papal bulls
                    to enter England or excommunications to be issued against any of his subjects
                    without his leave. He controlled all appointments to important ecclesiastical
                    dignities; he made laws for the church; he dealt justice to ecclesiastics, high
                    and low, in his own courts. At the same time he had no desire to humiliate the
                    church; on the contrary, he sought to elevate it to a higher position in the
                    state, to make it a more potent agent of civilization. A weaker statesman might
                    have seen his own advantage in encouraging the rivalry between Canterbury and
                    York; William strengthened the church by forcing the younger to give way to the
                    elder see. With the same object, that of increasing the efficiency of
                    ecclesiastical organization, he severed the temporal and spiritual jurisdictions
                    and furthered the enforcement of clerical celibacy. Finally, the trust which he
                    reposed in Lanfranc from the time of his appointment to the see of Canterbury in
                    1070 shows not only his insight into character but his respect for the head of
                    the English Church.</p>
                <p>In regard to temporal affairs William was rather an administrator than a
                    lawgiver. His reign is not marked by a series of legislative acts like those of
                    Henry II. or Edward I.; but his work was the indispensable preliminary to
                    theirs, for a strong monarchy was the first requisite of the state. To establish
                    the power of the crown was William’s principal care. The disintegrating
                    tendencies of feudalism had already been visible under the Anglo-Saxon kings.
                    William, while he established fully developed feudalism as a social,
                    territorial, and military system in his new dominions, took measures to prevent
                    it from undermining his own authority. He scattered the estates of his great
                    vassals, so as to hinder them from building up provincial principalities; he
                    maintained the higher popular courts against the encroachments of manorial
                    jurisdictions; he prevented the claims of feudal lordship from standing between
                    himself and the mass of his subjects by exacting an oath from every landholder
                    at the meeting on Salisbury plain; finally, by the great survey which resulted
                    in Domesday Book he not only asserted his right to make a general inquisition
                    into property, but laid the firm basis of knowledge which was indispensable to
                    centralized government and taxation. The care which he took to maintain English
                    laws and institutions is part of the same policy. . He balanced the two
                    nationalities over which he ruled, and obliged each to depend upon him as its
                    leader or protector against the other. He ruled as an English king; his feudal
                    council was the witenagemot with a new qualification; but at the same time he
                    was lord of the land as no king had been before him, and he enjoyed not only all
                    the income of his predecessors but in addition all the dues which came to him as
                    feudal sovereign. He was thus perhaps the strongest and most absolute monarch
                    that has ever sat upon the English throne.</p>
                <p>In character William was stern, self-reliant, and imperious in a high degree. He
                    was not naturally cruel; but he was ruthless if it served his purpose, and could
                    take pitiless vengeance for an insult or a wrong. He was too strong to prefer
                    deceit when force would serve as well, but his diplomacy was subtle and
                    guileful, and no scruple turned him aside from his aim. His temper, originally
                    forgiving, was soured by opposition towards the end of his life, and his
                    tyrannical tendencies were strengthened by the long exercise of uncontrolled
                    power. His passionate devotion to the chase is only too clearly shown in the
                    harshness of his forest laws. In private life he displayed domestic virtues, and
