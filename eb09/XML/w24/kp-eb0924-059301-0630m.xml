                    (1714-1782), English landscape painter, was born at Penegoes, Montgomeryshire,
                    where his father was a clergyman, on 1st August 1714. His early taste for art
                    was observed by a relative of his mother, Sir George Wynne, who in 1729 sent him
                    to London to study under Thomas Wright, a little-known portrait painter of the
                    time, by whom he was instructed for six years. He then started on his own
                    account, and was soon in a good practice. Among his commissions was a
                    full-length of the prince of Wales and the duke of York, painted for their
                    tutor, the bishop of Norwich. Examples of his portraits may be studied in
                    Greenwich Hospital, in the Garrick Club, and in various private collections. In
                    1749 Wilson visited Italy, where he spent six years. He had previously executed
                    some landscapes, but it was now that the advice of Zuccarelli and Joseph Vernet
                    decided him to adopt this department of art exclusively. He studied Claude and
                    Poussin, but retained his own individuality, and produced some admirable views
                    of Rome and the Campagna. In 1755 he returned to England, and became one of the
                    first of English landscape painters. Niobe, one of his most powerful works, was
                    exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1760. On the establishment of the Royal
                    Academy in 1768 he was appointed one of the original members, and he was a
                    regular contributor to its exhibitions till 1780. He frequently executed
                    replicas of his more important subjects, repeating some of them several times;
                    in the figures which he introduced in his landscapes he was occasionally
                    assisted by Mortimer and Hayman. During his lifetime his landscapes were never
                    widely popular; his temper was consequently embittered by neglect, and so
                    impoverished was he that he was obliged to seclude himself in an obscure,
                    half-furnished room in Tottenham Court Road, London. In 1776, however, he
                    obtained the post of librarian to the Academy; and by the death of a brother he
                    acquired a small property near Llanferras, Denbighshire, to which he retired to
                    spend his last days, and where he died suddenly in May 1782. After his death his
                    fame increased, and in 1814 about seventy of his works were exhibited in the
                    British Institution. The National Gallery, London, contains nine of his
                    landscapes.</p>
                <p>The works of Wilson are skilled and learned compositions rather than direct
                    transcripts from nature. His landscapes are treated with great breadth, and with
                    a power of generalization which occasionally led to a disregard of detail. They
                    are full of classical feeling and poetic sentiment; they possess noble qualities
                    of colour, and of delicate silvern tone; and their handling is vigorous and
                    easy, the work of a painter who was thoroughly master of his materials.</p>
