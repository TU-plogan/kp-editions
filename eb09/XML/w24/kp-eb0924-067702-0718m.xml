                    modern zoological classification; it is constantly applied to several phyla of

                    other. By Linnaeus the Latin equivalent “Vermes” was applied to the modern

                    >Cligochaeta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polychaeta,</hi> which have been shortly

                    earthworm and its immediate allies. The earthworm belongs to the order <hi
                    rend="italic">Oligochaeta,</hi> which also includes a number of freshwater
                    forms; these latter <hi rend="italic">Cligochaeta</hi> have been distinguished
                    as “<hi rend="italic">Limicolae”</hi> from the earthworms or <hi rend="italic"
                    >“TermcolaeP</hi> There are, however, no structural peculiarities of any
                    importance which absolutely distinguish the terrestrial from the aquatic forms.
                    Earthworms are, it is true, characterized by the simplicity of their setae, by
                    the absence of cilia upon the body, by the thickness of the body-wall, which
                    implies an increased thickness of the muscular layers, and by the thickness of
                    the intersegmental septa, particularly in the anterior region of the body. All
                    these structural modifications, however, are so obviously connected with the
                    density of the medium in which they live tlιat they cannot be held to be of
                    primary importance. On the other hand, there is no deep-seated anatomical
                    character which distinguishes earthworms from the freshwater <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cligochaeta.</hi> An article on earthworms must therefore necessarily include
                    an account of the aquatic and mud-inhabiting <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cligochaeta.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cligochaeta</hi> range in size from a few lines to several
                    feet in length; the large earthworm from the Cape Colony <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Microchaeta rappi)</hi> measures 5 or 6 feet in length when fully extended. On
                    the whole the terrestrial forms (earthworms) are larger than the aquatic forms.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Cligochaeta</hi> are found all over the globe, but at
                    present no details of value can be given as to their distributional <pb

                    type="authorial"><p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Acanthodrilus</hi> is almost
                    entirely Antarctic in its range. It occurs in Patagonia, S. Georgia, Kerguelen’s
                    Land, New Zealand, Cape of Good Hope and other parts of Africa, Madagascar, and
                    New Caledonia. <hi rend="italic">Perichaeta</hi> is characteristic of the Old
                    and New World tropics, particularly of the former; in the Old World it ranges
                    from India to China and Japan, and through the Indian Islands to Australia and
                    New Zealand. Australia has the peculiar genera <hi rend="italic">Megascolides,
                    Notoscolex,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Crÿptodrilus,</hi> but the greatest
                    number of peculiar genera are found in the Neotropical region. In Europe the
                    most characteristic genera are <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Allolobophora;</hi> these are found in most other parts of the
                    world, but it is possible that they have been accidentally imported.</p></note>
                    As might be imagined from their soft perishable bodies, nothing is known
                    respecting the distribution of the <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> in past
                    time.</p>
                <p>The most prominent characteristic of the <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta,</hi> as
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Chaetopoda</hi> generally, is the segmentation of the
                    body: the body is divided into a series of segments or metameres, which resemble
                    each other most closely in the lowest forms. This metamerism is seen externally
                    in the presence of transverse furrows, corresponding with the internal divisions
                    of the body cavity, and in the disposition of the setae. The mouth opens into
                    the first segment, which is usually unprovided with setae; in front of the mouth
                    is a preoral lobe; this latter is aborted in some <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta
                    {Urochaeta, Thamnodrilus).</hi><hi rend="italic">BodyWall.—</hi> In all <hi
                    rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> three layers can be distinguished in the
                    body-wall—(1) an outer epidermis, which secretes a delicate cuticle, (2) a
                    circular muscle layer, (3) a longitudinal muscle layer. Within the last-named is
                    the peritoneal lining of the caelom.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Clitellum.—</hi> During sexual maturity certain of the segments
                    of the body in <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus</hi> and other earthworms undergo a
                    change in appearance which is caused by the development of several layers of
                    unicellular glands beneath the epidermis. Among the <hi rend="italic">‘ ‘
                    Limicolae” {e.g., in Limnodrilus, Rhynchelmvs, Enchytraeidae)</hi> the clitellum
                    is, on the contrary, furnished with an epidermal layer only one cell thick; some
                    of these cells become large and glandular. In these points <hi rend="italic"
                    >Criodrilus</hi> agrees with earthworms. The secretion of these glands may form
                    the cocoon in which the eggs are deposited, but it appears to be also used to
                    attach individuals together*during copulation. The clitellum is universal among
                    the <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta.</hi><hi rend="italic">Monili-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gaster</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Criodrilus</hi> were for some
                    time considered as an exception to this rule, but a clitellum has recently been
                    demonstrated in these two genera by Bourne (17)<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These figures refer to the “Literature,” p.
                    684.</p><p/></note> and Benham (7). The clitellum in earthworms never occupies
                    less than two segments, and in <hi rend="italic">Trigaster</hi> it extends over
                    twenty-seven.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Setae. —</hi> These are universally found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oligochaeta,</hi> but differ in their shape, as well as in their
                    number and arrangement, in different families. In the majority of forms the
                    setae are disposed in four longitudinal rows; the setae in each of these rows
                    may be comparatively numerous <hi rend="italic">{Naidomorpha),</hi> or may be
                    limited to two <hi rend="italic">Lumbriculidae</hi> and many earthworms). In <hi
                    rend="italic">Acanthodrilus multi-poms</hi> and other earthworms the eight setae
                    are no longer in pairs, but separated by nearly equivalent intervals. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Urochaeta</hi> (fig. 1, D) and <hi rend="italic">Diachaeta</hi>
                    each segment has also eight setae, but these are disposed more or less
                    alternately in successive segments. In the former of these two genera, as also
                    in <hi rend="italic">Eudrilus,</hi> peculiar structures of a chitinous nature
                    exist between the individual setae of a segment; these are similar to certain
                    structures described in <hi rend="italic">Anachaeta</hi> by Vejdovsky (15) as
                    abortive setae; their presence in <hi rend="italic">Urochaeta</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Eudrilus</hi> may indicate that the number of setae in these worms
                    has been reduced from a continuous circle round each segment, such as exists in
                    the family <hi rend="italic">Perichaetidae</hi> (fig. 1, C). Among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Naidomorpha</hi> there are delicate hair-like setae which pass by
                    numerous intermediate forms into setae with a bifurcate extremity; in many
                    limicolous forms, as in earthworms, the setae are simple in form, ending in a
                    slightly curved extremity. The setae are developed in the interior of cells of
                    ectodermic origin; special muscles effect their movements.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Caelom.—</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta,</hi> like
                    other Annelids, have a caelom which is formed by the excavation of paired
                    mesoblastic somites; the intersegmental septa represent the walls of each two
                    adjacent somites; the dorsal and ventral mesenteries, which in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Archi∙ annelida</hi> suspend the gut from the body-wall, are
                    largely absent in the <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta,</hi> the cavities of each
                    pair of somites becoming continuous. Traces of the dorsal mesentery are met with
                    in some forms; in almost all the ventral mesentery persists to a great extent in
                    a sheet which suspends the ventral blood-vessel from the intestine.</p>
                <p>The caelom communicates with the exterior by the nephridia and ducts of the
                    reproductive organs and by certain dorsally-placed pores. These latter are
                    sometimes present only on the head segment <hi rend="italic">{Criodrilus</hi>
                    and many aquatic genera), sometimes on the body segments also <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Enchytraeida)</hi>; .in the majority of earthworms they appear to exist only
                    on the body segments, and the first one does not usually appear before the third
                    and fourth segment. In <hi rend="italic">Pon-todrilus</hi> and a few other
                    species the dorsal pores are entirely absent. The caelom is lined with a
                    peritoneum, the cells of which exhibit different characters in different parts
                    of the body. The intestine is covered with a layer of large cells containing
                    numerous granules; this cellular investment was originally described as hepatic,
                    but it is now known to have no relation to the alimentary tract. The
                    investigations of Kükenthal (16) show that these cells are concerned with the
                    excretory function.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nervous System.—</hi> This consists of (1) a pair of cerebral
                    ganglia connected by a circumaesophageal ring with a chain of ventral ganglia
                    arranged in pairs—a pair to each segment; (2) a system of small ganglia and
                    nerves arising from the cerebral ganglia and innervating the anterior part of
                    the alimentary tract; and (3) two lateral ganglionated cords, which have a
                    special interest for those who believe that the segmented worms are the
                    Invertebrate group from which the <hi rend="italic">Chordata</hi> (including the
                    <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata)</hi> have sprung. The discovery of Eisig (“Die
                    Capitelliden,” <hi rend="italic">Naples Monographs),</hi> that this lateral cord
                    is on both sides connected with segmentally aιτanged sense-organs in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Capitellidae,</hi> is an additional argument for considering this
                    lateral system as the homologue of the lateral line in fishes.</p>
                <p>The nervous system of <hi rend="italic">Aeolosoma</hi> is probably degenerate; it
                    consists merely of a pair of cerebral ganglia, which are situated in the
                    procephalic lobe in connexion with the epidermis. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ctenodrilus</hi> the nervous system, like that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archiannelwla</hi> (see below), is imbedded in the epidermis throughout its
                    whole extent. In the higher forms, in fact in all the remaining <hi
                    rend="italic">Oligochaeta,</hi> the central nervous system has lost its
                    primitive connexion with the epidermis. Moreover, in these forms the cerebral
                    ganglia, originally developed in the procephalic lobe, have moved back, and may
                    lie as far back as in the fourth segment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vascular System.—</hi> All the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oligochaeta</hi> possess, in addition to the corpusculated fluid of the cce1om,
                    a system of closed vessels which in the higher forms attains to a very highly
                    developed condition. This vascular system contains in nearly all the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oligochaeta,</hi> as in the <hi rend="italic">Polychaeta</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Hirudinea,</hi> a red-coloured fluid, which has been proved to
                    owe its coloration to haemoglobin, and in which are suspended corpuscles. <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeolosoma</hi> has a colourless pseudhaemal fluid. In the lower
                    forms the walls of the blood-vessels are excessively delicate, and contain no
                    muscles; in the higher forms <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lumbricus)</hi> the blood-vessels are furnished with muscular tissue as well as
                    with an epithelial lining. The cells of the latter give rise to the corpuscles
                    of the blood, which consist of little more than the nucleus.</p>
                <p>The simplest form of vascular system occurs in <hi rend="italic">Aeolosoma</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Cteηodrilus.</hi> The alimentary tract is surrounded with
                    a network of blood capillaries, which in the oesophageal region unite to form a
                    dorsal vessel; this passes along the oesophagus, but is situated between the
                    walls of the intestine and its covering of peritoneal cells; beneath the
                    cerebral ganglia the dorsal vessel gives off a branch on either side; these
                    unite with a ventral vessel, which passes beneath the intestine, and gives off
                    branches toit, which arc regularly arranged in pairs. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Enchytraeidae</hi> the dorsal vessel is also restricted to the anterior
                    segments of the body, and originates from a blood sinus in the walls of the
                    alimentary tract. The dorsal vessel gives off anteriorly two branches which
                    unite to form the ventral vessel; three pairs of slender vessels, a pair to each
                    segment, originate from the dorsal vessel, and are connected with these two
                    branches. In all the higher <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> there is
                    reticulum of blood capillaries developed in the walls of the alimentary<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0720-0679"/> canal, but the dorsal vessel, although connected
                    with this network, does not originate from it, but passes from end to end of the
                    body. The dorsal vessel is also connected with the ventral vessel by paired
                    trunks, which are segmentally disposed, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a pair to
                    each segment. In the <hi rend="italic">Naidomorpha</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lumbriculidae,</hi> the vascular system consists only of these parts, together
                    with some few branches which penetrate the layers of the body-wall and reach to
                    the epidermis. Among earthworms the vascular system is more complex; our
                    knowledge of the details of the circulation in certain tropical genera <hi
                    rend="italic">(Urochaeta, Pontodrilus)</hi> is due to Perrier, and but little of
                    importance has been added to his descriptions. The circulation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lumbricus</hi> is known principally from the investigations of
                    D’Udekem, Claparède, and recently of Horst. In <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus</hi>
                    there are three longitudinal trunks (fig. 3) which run from end to end of the
                    body—(1) dorsal, (2) supranervian, (3) subnervian. The dorsal vessel is
                    connected with the supranervian by seven pairs of stout trunks in the outer part
                    of the body; from the dorsal vessel in front of the last of these originates on
                    either side a lateral longitudinal vessel which passes along the sides of the
                    oesophagus and gives off branches to it. In the intestinal region the dorsal
                    vessel is connected by branches with the capillary network of the intestine, and
                    also directly by lateral branches with the subnervian vessel; the latter gives
                    off branches to the body-walls. The majority of earthworms possess in addition a
                    small vessel running above the alimentary canal, but below the dorsal vessel;
                    this is especially concerned with the blood supply of the alimentary tract, and
                    in the intestinal region it runs in the interior of the typhlosole; the presence
                    of this supra-intestinal trunk was first noted by Perrier, who also discovered
                    that more or fewer of the large contractile “hearts” of the anterior segments
                    are connected with this vessel as well as with the dorsal vessel. The subnervian
                    vessel is absent in <hi rend="italic">PontodrUus</hi> and other genera. The
                    immense development of the integumental capillary system is characteristic of
                    earthworms, and is no doubt to be explained by the much greater thickness of the
                    body-wall; it has been already stated that among the lower <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oligochaeta</hi> the integumental capillary system is present though feebly
                    developed. In some genera of earthworms the capillaries penetrate the epidermic
                    layer, as in some of the aquatic genera and in many leeches. It has been
                    recently stated by Sarasin that these epidermic capillaries open by pores on to
                    the exterior. That the vascular system of <hi rend="italic">Aeolosoma</hi>
                    represents a primitive condition is shown by the investigations of Vejdovsky
                    (15) into the development of <hi rend="italic">Rhynchelmis.</hi> In this worm
                    the dorsal vessel is at first only visible in the anterior region of the body,
                    where it lies upon the oesophagus below the peritoneal covering of the latter;
                    posteriorly it communicates with a blood sinus surrounding the intestine; this
                    stage exactly corresponds to the adult <hi rend="italic">Aeolosoma,</hi> and the
                    blood is also colourless; subsequently the dorsal vessel becomes connected with
                    the ventral by a few lateral trunks; this stage is retained in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Enchylraeiclae.</hi> Moreover, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chloraemidae</hi> a similar condition exists (Horst, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zool.</hi><hi rend="italic">Anzeig.</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> viii. p. 12),
                    and in the larval <hi rend="italic">Terebellα.</hi><hi rend="italic">Excretory
                    Organs.—</hi> It has been recently shown by Vejdovsky (15) that the <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">Polychaeta, Gephyrea, αηHHirudineα,</hi> possess temporary
                    larval excretory tubules as well as the definitive nephridia. These organs have
                    been found in <hi rend="italic">Rhynchelmis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Nais,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Chaetogaster,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aeolosoma.</hi> In the
                    first mentioned type they appear as a pair of fine tubes with a ciliated lumen,
                    without any apparent internal aperture; they run on either side of the pharynx,
                    and each opens by a pore placed at the side of the mouth. In the young asexually
                    produced individual of <hi rend="italic">Nais,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Chaetogaster,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aeolosoma</hi> similar organs are to
                    be seen. The permanent excretory organs consist in the majority of <hi
                    rend="italic">Oligochseta</hi> of three parts:—(1) a funnel-shaped expansion
                    furnished with cilia, opening into the body cavity; (2) a coiled glandular tube;
                    and (3) a terminal vesicle furnished with muscular layers, and opening on to the
                    exterior of the body. The latter section may be absent, and in the relative
                    proportions of the different parts as well as in certain details of their
                    structure there are great differences. As a general rule, the funnel lies in a
                    segment anterior to that which bears the external pore; but in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phιtellus</hi> Perrier states that the whole organ lies in one segment. In the
                    majority of forms there are not more than a single pair of nephridia to each
                    segment (except in <hi rend="italic">Perichaeta,</hi> &amp;c. ). In the
                    limicolous <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> nephridia are generally wanting in
                    the anterior segments of the body, and disappear in those which contain the
                    generative ducts when the latter are developed; in the terricolous forms, on the
                    other hand, the nephridia usually commence in the second or third segment. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ctenodril·us</hi> is remarkable for the fact that it only
                    possesses a single pair of nephridia, the funnel of which is situated on the
                    anterior side of the first dissepiment; but in no form are these organs entirely
                    wanting. The glandular part of the organ consists, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hirudinea</hi> and most Platyhelminths, of a row of cells placed end to end,
                    which are perforated by the lumen; the lumen of the tubule is therefore, as was
                    first discovered by Claparède, <hi rend="italic">intra-</hi> cellular; in this
                    particular the nephridia of the <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> differ from
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">Polychaeta,</hi> where the walls of the duct are
                    made up of rows of cells, the lumen therefore being inter-cellular.<note

                    the intercellular lumen preceded the intracellular.</p></note> While in the
                    greater number of <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> the lumen of the tubule is
                    simple and unbranched, in <hi rend="italic">Chaetogaster</hi> fine branches are
                    given off, which ramify in the substance of the cells; this is an important
                    point of resemblance to the nephridia of the <hi rend="italic">Hirudinea,</hi>
                    where Vejdovsky and Bourne (Q. <hi rend="italic">J. M. S.,</hi> 1884) have
                    described a similar branching of the duct. The glandular part of the nephridium
                    is often, as in <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus,</hi> differentiated into two parts;
                    the anterior section is composed of more delicate cells, the posterior of larger
                    and more glandular cells; the lumen is furnished with cilia. The external
                    surface of the organ is frequently covered with rounded cells of a glandular
                    appearance, which are to be looked upon as modified peritoneal cells; in certain
                    cases <hi rend="italic">{e.g., Pontodrilus</hi> and many <hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> il</hi><hi rend="italic">Limicolae")</hi> those cells form a solid
                    mass in the interior of which are concealed the windings of the excretory
                    tubule. Special dilatations of the tubule are occasionally met with, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhynchelmis·,</hi> and, among leeches, <hi rend="italic">Clepsine,
                    Pontobdella,</hi> &amp;c., show a similar dilatation, which, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhynchelmis,</hi> comes immediately after the funnel. The terminal
                    section of the nephridium, the “contractile” vesicle, is more marked among
                    earthworms than in the “<hi rend="italic">Limicolae "</hi>; it is lined by a
                    delicate layer of cells and furnished with muscular fibres; in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urobenus</hi> (Benham, 7), as well as in many other species, this region of the
                    nephridium is very largely developed, and is furnished with a long sac-like
                    diverticulum. The differences in structure between the various parts of the
                    nephridium are due to their different origin: the funnel is formed independently
                    of the glandular tubule, though both take their origin from the mesoblast; the
                    contractile vesicle is invaginated from the ectoderm.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Λcαηthodrilus multiporus</hi> Beddard found that the number
                    of nephridial pores in the anterior region of the body to each segment was more
                    than 100. In <hi rend="italic">Typhaeus</hi> an almost identical arrangement
                    exists, and in <hi rend="italic">Perichaeta</hi> (Beddard, 4). In the last-named
                    genus, as well as in an Australian form, <hi rend="italic">Megascolides</hi>
                    (Spencer, 12), the nephridial system forms a continuous network of tubules,
                    uninterrupted by the septa. In <hi rend="italic">Acanthodrilus</hi> the network
                    of each segment is independent. In this genus, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perichaeta,</hi> there are numerous ciliated funnels in each segment.</p>
                <p>The relation of the nephridia of the <hi rend="italic">Chaetopoda</hi> to those
                    of the Platyhelminths, on the one hand, and to those of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hirudinea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gephyrea</hi> are variously interpreted.
                    It has been proved that in <hi rend="italic">Polygordius,</hi> many <hi
                    rend="italic">Chaetopoda,</hi> and many <hi rend="italic">Hirudinea</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gephyrea,</hi> the larvae, like those of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oligochaeta,</hi> possess excretory organs, which are constructed on the type
                    of the nephridia in Platyhelminths. This is at any rate the case with <hi
                    rend="italic">Polygordius,</hi> the Chaetopod larva, and the larva of <hi
                    rend="italic">Echiuηιs</hi>; in all these types the nephridia are paired
                    branched tubes, which open separately on to the exterior; they have, however, no
                    internal openings, the flagellate cells of the Platvhelminth, with their single
                    flagellum and funnel-shaped perforation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n721/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0721-0680"/>, being absent. The larval excretory organs of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Hirudinea,</hi> like these of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oligochaeta</hi> referred to above, are to be looked upon as in a more
                    rudimentary condition; they are unbranched, and are sometimes without an
                    external orifice. Moreover, essentially similar organs are found in the larval
                    mollusc. In many of the abovecited examples it is certain that the larval
                    excretory organs have no connexion with the permanent excretory organs; they
                    atrophy before the latter appear. Hatchek, however, has stated that there is a
                    connexion between the larval and permanent excretory organs in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polygordius·,</hi> doubts have been thrown upon this observation by some who
                    believe that the facts already cited showed (1) that the excretory system of <hi
                    rend="italic">Annelida</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hirudinea</hi> is a new
                    formation, while (2) the excretory system of their Platyhelminth ancestors is
                    represented by the transitory excretory system of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annelida,</hi> which has therefore naturally no connexion with the permanent
                    excretory system. This view has the merit of explaining the presence of
                    apparently similar structures (t.e., the larval nephridia) in such diverse types
                    as <hi rend="italic">Mollusca,</hi><hi rend="italic">Hirudinea,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gephyrea,</hi> and is perhaps further supported by the high
                    development of the larval excretory organ in the active larvae of <hi
                    rend="italic">Polygordius, Echiurus,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chaetopoda,</hi> and its rudimentary character in the embryo <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oligochaeta.</hi> It follows from this that the permanent nephridia of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chaetopoda</hi> are new structures, unless the views of Bergh (18)
                    be accepted, who would derive these organs from the generative ducts of the
                    Platyhelminths.</p>
                <p>Against this hypothesis may be urged (1) the unlikelihood of a new formation of
                    excretory organs in Annelids, and the probability of these organs being really
                    homologous with those of their Platyhelminth ancestors, and (2) the fact that
                    the larval excretory organs of <hi rend="italic">Polygordius, Polychaeta,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hirudinea</hi> are
                    connected with the permanent system or at least are not in any way replaced by
                    the permanent excretory system; in the <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> the
                    larval excretory organs appear comparatively late, and the segment occupied by
                    them never gives rise to a pair of permanent nephridia.</p>
                <p>The following facts lead to another hypothesis, which is in many respects more
                    acceptable.</p>
                <p>A connexion between the nephridia of consecutive segments has been recently
                    stated by Wilson to occur in the embryo <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus.</hi> Meyer
                    and Cunningham have observed the same in <hi rend="italic">Terebella.</hi>
                    Vejdvosky (15) has recorded in <hi rend="italic">Anachaeta bohemica</hi> a
                    connexion between the nephridia of the 21st and 22d segments, and moreover the
                    first pair of nephridia has two internal funnels. In the leech <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poηtobdella</hi> the nephridia (Bourne, <hi rend="italic">Q. J. Min. Sti.,</hi>
                    1884) form a network, the internal funnels and external apertures alone being
                    arranged metamerically. The presence of numerous external pores to each segment
                    in certain earthworms, and the continuity of nephridia of adjacent segments are
                    facts to be referred to the same category. Eisig’s discovery of the presence of
                    many nephridia in each of the segments of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Capitellidae,</hi> which are connected together, is also, like the other facts
                    referred to, in harmony with the supposition that the excretory system of <hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">λ</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e Annelida</hi> has been directly derived from that of the
                    Platyhelminths somewhat as follows. The excretory system is at first, as in the
                    Platyhelminth, a continuous system, opening by numerous apertures into the body
                    cavity by a single orifice ora pair of orifices on to the exterior. Secondary
                    external apertures are then formed, which are irregular in their disposition
                    (these actually occur in certain Platyhelmin ths), and more or less numerous;
                    this condition is largely retained in <hi rend="italic">Acanthodrilus</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Perichaeta;</hi> the secondary external apertures as well as
                    the internal apertures then become reduced in number and metamerically arranged;
                    this condition occurs in <hi rend="italic">Poηtobdella</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Terebella,</hi> and to a very limited extent in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anachaeta.</hi> The connexion between the nephridial system of succession
                    segments then disappears, and the characteristic Annelid excretory system is
                    arrived at.</p>

                    proctodaeal invagination; the rest of the alimentary canal is hypo-blastic. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Aeolosoma</hi> the pharynx is restricted to the first segment
                    of the body, a condition which is seen in the embryonic stages of 2 <hi

                    followed by the narrow oesophagus, which leads, in the fourth segment, into the
                    intestine; the intestine is at first wide, but afterwards becomes narrower; the
                    whole alimentary canal is ciliated. In the higher types the pharynx occupies
                    several serments, and is preceded by a buccal cavity, the epithelium of which is
                    not ciliated; in many <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta (e.g., Enchytraeus)</hi> the
                    pharynx is protrusιble. It is frequently furnished with glands, which are of two
                    kinds, and probably not morphologically comparable. In many <hi rend="italic"
                    >L·nchytraeidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Baidomorpha</hi> certain of the
                    anterior segments contain glands attached to the anterior faces of the
                    intersegmental septa; these have been termed septal glands. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anachaeta</hi> there are on!y two pairs of these glands, but four in <hi
                    rend="italic">Pachydrilus</hi>; the glands ol each side of the body are
                    connected by a continuous longitudinal duct which opens into the pharynx.
                    Similar glands appear to occur in most <hi rend="italic">Lumbricidae</hi> in the
                    form of unicellular glands attached to the pharynx.</p>
                <p>Another series of glandular structures are connected with the pharynx, which have
                    been termed by Vejdovsky salivary glands; these are found in the <hi

                    open into the hinder end of the pharynx at each side by a single duct; since
                    these glands agree iiι their minute structure with nephridia, which are not
                    found in the segments which contain the glands, it is probable that they
                    represent slightly metamorphosed nephridia (Vejdovsky). Among earthworms <hi

                    (glandes à mucosité, Perrier), which are larger and more complicated than the
                    nephridia, though their structure is the same; in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acanthodrilus</hi> these glands open into the buccal cavity; in <hi

                    body on the one hand, and into the caelom by several funnels (Beddard). It is
                    possible that they are the homologues of the salivary glands in the <hi

                <p>The oesophagus is ciliated in the lower forms, but among earthworms cilia appear
                    to be limited to that section of the oesophagus which lies behind the gizzard.
                    The intestine, however, appears to be ciliated in all the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oligochaeta.</hi> There is thus a gradual diminution in the ciliation of the
                    alimentary tract in passing from the lower to the higher forms. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeolosoma</hi> the whole canal from mouth to anus is ciliated.
                    When the buccal cavity first appears it is lined with a cuticle, and has no
                    cilia. The pharynx loses its cilia in the <hi rend="italic">Enchytraeidae,</hi>
                    while the rest of the alimentary tract is ciliated. Among earthworms the cilia
                    are partially wanting in the oesophagus, while the intestine is lined with a
                    ciliated epithelium.</p>
                <p>In some <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> the oesophagus is furnished with a
                    muscular dilatation, which is usually termed gizzard. This organ first makes its
                    appearance among the <hi rend="italic">Naidomorpha,</hi> but is absent from
                    other genera of “<hi rend="italic">LimicolaeP</hi> It is, on the contrary,
                    present in nearly all earthworms; the gizzard is lined with a tall columnar
                    epithelium, which secretes a specially thickened cuticle, and the muscular
                    layers are enormously increased. In <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus</hi> the gizzard
                    lies at the posterior end of the oesophagus, but in all other· earthworms it is
                    succeeded as well as preceded by a section of oesophagus, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mais.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus,</hi> as well as in many
                    other genera of earthworms, the gizzard occupies two segments, and the septum
                    dividing these segments has disappeared, or is at most represented by a few
                    bands of muscle, which bind down the gizzard to the bodywall. On the other hand,
                    in some earthworms as well as in the <hi rend="italic">Naidomorpha</hi> the
                    gizzard only occupies one segment. In <hi rend="italic">Digaster</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Trigaster</hi> there are, as the names of these genera imply, two
                    or three separate gizzards, while in <hi rend="italic">Moniligaster</hi> there
                    are four or five. In <hi rend="italic">Trigaster</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moniligaster</hi> each gizzard only occupies a single segment; it is possible
                    that the single gizzard of <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus,</hi> &amp;c., which
                    occupies two segments, is due to the fusion of two separate gizzards lying in as
                    many consecutive segments.</p>
                <p>The oesophagus in most earthworms is furnished with from one to six pairs of
                    glandular diverticula, which arc known as ‘ ‘ calciferous glands” or “glands of
                    Morren.” Those glands produce a calcareous secretion.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The intestine is wider than the oesophagus, but has much the same structure; in

                    surrounded by a layer of circular and longitudinal muscular fibres. A remarkable
                    peculiarity distinguishes the intestine of the majority of earthworms; this is a
                    longitudinal fold on the dorsal side which projects into the lumen of the
                    intestine, and which is known as the “typhlosole” (fig. 3, i)∙. A typhlosole

                    developed within the testes, but in special receptacles, the seminal reservoirs
                    (seminal vesicles, vesiculae seminales). These structures frequently enclose the
                    testes, with which they have been confounded by many writers. By the earlier
                    writers the seminal reservoirs were regarded as ovaries; this opinion was due to
                    the numerous parasitic Gregarines which these organs contain; the encysted
                    parasites were mistaken for ova. In <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus terrestris,</hi>
                    &amp;c. (Bergh), there is a single median reservoir, which encloses the testes,
                    the funnels of the vasa deferentia, and the nerve cord in each of segments 9 and
                    10; with these are connected three pairs of lateral outgrowths situated
                    respectively in segments 8, 10, and 11. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Allolobophora</hi><hi rend="italic">foetida</hi> there are four pairs of
                    isolated seminal reservoirs in segments 8, 9, 10, and 11; there is no median
                    unpaired portion; and the testes as well as the vasa deferentia lie freely in
                    the body cavity; the first two pairs lie on the posterior septa of their
                    segments, and open by an aperture into the cavity of the segment behind; the
                    last two pairs lie upon the anterior septa of their segments, and open into the
                    cavity of the segment in front. In all cases the seminal reservoirs are formed
                    as outgrowths of the septa. The cavity of the seminal reservoirs is broken up by
                    anastomosing trabeculae, in the interstices of which the spermatozoa undergo
                    their development. There is very great variety among earthworms in the number
                    and arrangement of the seminal reservoirs, but there is no form known in which
                    they are absent. In <hi rend="italic">Uroehaeta, Typhaeus, Titanus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Diachaeta</hi> there appear to be only a single pair, which are of
                    great length. In <hi rend="italic">Diachaeta</hi> (Benham) they occupy 26

                    the7¾h/cÄaeto,where the ripe spermatozoa arc either set free by a rupture of the

                    however, may be slightly modified in relation to this function. These ducts are
                    termed vasa deferentia; they invariably open freely into the body cavity, and

                    acquire a secondary relation with the testes by way of the seminal reservoirs;

                    the testes.</p>
                <p>In their simplest form (in many <hi rend="italic">Enchytraeidae)</hi> the vasa
                    deferentia consist of a single pair of convoluted tubes, which open by a wide
                    funnel-shaped aperture into one segment, while the external aperture is situated
                    in the following segment. Very generally in those <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oligochaeta</hi> the funnel-shaped expansion is continued into a wide
                    cylindrical tube, which narrows abruptly on passing through the intersegmental
                    septum into a slender tube; the walls of both sections of the vas deferens are
                    formed of cylindrical ciliated cells; the external aperture is often surrounded
                    by several rows of large glandular cells. Among a large number of the lower <hi
                    rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> there is a single pair of vasa deferentia, which
                    occupy in the same way two segments; the internal funnel-shaped aperture opens
                    into one segment, while the greater part of the tube and the external orifice
                    are situated in the following segment. A further complication is, however,
                    introduced in the form of a glandular terminal organ, which opens on to the
                    exterior by one extremity, and communicates with the vas deferens at the other.
                    In <hi rend="italic">Stylaria lacustris</hi> this organ is pear-shaped,
                    narrowing towards the external aperture; it is lined by a layer of cylindrical
                    glandular cells, outside of which is a layer of muscular fibres; the whole organ
                    is covered by large peritoneal cells of a glandular appearance. This organ is
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">atrium</hi>; the vas deferens, which is short, only
                    curved (not convoluted), opens by one end into the broad extremity of the
                    atrium, and terminates in a ciliated funnel, which has this peculiarity that it
                    does not lie in the segment in front, but in the same segment (in the 6th) as
                    the atrium; it is, however, closely applied to the intersegmental septum of

                    non-glandular portion, which can be everted during copulation.</p>
                <p>The reproductive ducts of the <hi rend="italic">Tubificidae</hi> are still

                    rend="italic">rivulorum</hi> the structure of the atrium at an early stage is
                    like that of <hi rend="italic">Stylaria</hi>; a simple globular or pear-shaped
                    atrium is formed as an invagination of the integument; later this is
                    differentiated into two parts, as in <hi rend="italic">Chaetogaster</hi>; an
                    additional structure is, however, developed in the form of a group of
                    unicellular glands, collectively termeα me prostate, which open into the
                    glandular distal region of the atrium; in the adult <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tubifex</hi> the proximal section of the atrium is developed into a ρrotrusible
                    penis; this is surrounded by a second invagination of the integument, which
                    forms a penis sheath and part of the penis proper. The glandular part of the
                    atrium (vesicula seminalis) is ciliated, but cilia are wanting in the penis. In

                    seminalis, into which open the vas deferens and the prostate, forms a globular
                    chamber distinct from the remainder of the atrium.</p>
                <p>Another type of efferent apparatus is found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lumbriculidae.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Stylodrilus</hi> there is a single
                    pair of atria, which have much the same stnιcture as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stylαria,</hi> but the proximal end of the organ is less glandular and can be
                    everted as a penis. With each atrium, however, are connected two vasa
                    deferentia; one of these opens by a funnel-like expansion into the segment in
                    front, the other passes back into the segment behind that which contains the
                    atrium, and after again perforating the septum opens by a funnel-shaped
                    expansion into the atrial segment. Among earthworms <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moniligaster,</hi> as already stated, is furnished with an efferent apparatus
                    exactly comparable to that of the lower “<hi rend="italic">LimicolaeP</hi> In
                    other genera the same divisions can be recognized in the efferent apparatus,
                    which may also be single or double. In all earthworms, however, with the
                    exception of <hi rend="italic">Moniligaster,</hi> the internal funnels are
                    situated several segments in front of the external pore, instead of being placed
                    in the next segment. This is the case also with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ocnerodrilus</hi> (Eisen), a form usually referred to the <hi rend="italic

                    >Moniligaster,</hi> in which there is a single vas deferens on each side. In all
                    others there are a pair of vasa deferentia on each side, which open by separate
                    funnels into two consecutive segments (10th and llth); the vasa deferentia open
                    on to the exterior by a common pore; they may become united into a single tube
                    in the segment behind that which contains the posterior funnel <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Lumbricus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Perichaeta), or</hi> one or two segments

                <p>The structure of the vasa deferentia and the funnels corresponds to that of the
                    lower <hi rend="italic">Oligoehaeta,</hi> except that the funnels are usually
                    much plicated. In <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Uroehaeta,</hi> &amp;c., the vasa deferentia open directly on to the exterior;
                    in other types, however, an atrium can be recognized. The most primitive form of
                    these organs (in some respects) is seen in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eudrilus</hi> (Beddard, 3); the two vasa deferentia open into the interioι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> of a glandular organ, which is probably the homologue
                    of the atrium; this organ is divided into two parts by a longitudinal septum,
                    but is covered by continuous layers of muscles; it communicates with two
                    muscular tubes, also covered by a continuous layer of muscle, which unite into a
                    single muscular penis, which is probably eversible. The penis, like the atrium,
                    is lined by a single layer of non-ciliate cells; the cells of the glandular
                    portion are non-ciliate, and are arranged in two layers; the penis projects into
                    the interior of a cavity open to the exterior; this corresponds to the penis
                    sheath of the <hi rend="italic">Naidomorpha.</hi> With the penis sheath (“bursa
                    copulatrix,” Perrier) is also connected a small rigid diverticulum with muscular
                    walls.</p>
                <p>It is not certain whether the partial longitudinal division of the atrium and.
                    vesicula represents the partial fusion of the primitively distinct atria or the
                    commencing separation into two parts of a single atrium; the latter alternative,
                    on the whole, is the more probable.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Perichaeta, Acaηthodrilus,</hi> &amp;c., certain glandular
                    bodies are connected with the termination of the vas deferens, which have been
                    termed “prostates.” These glands are of two kinds: (1) in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acan∙ thodrilus, Pontodrilus,</hi> &amp;c., they consist of a single somewhat
                    convoluted tube of uniform diameter; (2) in <hi rend="italic">Perichaeta,</hi>
                    &amp;c., they have a racemose lobulated appearance. It is probable that these
                    structures are homologous. The prostates of <hi rend="italic">Perichaeta</hi>
                    (fig. 5, F) are made up of numerous ductules, which are connected with groups of
                    cells that have the character of unicellular glands; each cell· is connected by
                    a long stalk with the termination of the ductule; in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acanthodrïlas,</hi> &amp;c., the prostate is lined by a double layer of cells
                    which surround a central lumen; the innermost layer of cells are narrow and
                    columnar, the outer layer are large pear shaped glandular cells. The difference
                    between the two organs is this: in <hi rend="italic">Perichaeta</hi> the
                    glandular cells have become segregated into groups, while the lumen of the gland
                    is branched. In at least one species of <hi rend="italic">Perichaeta</hi> both
                    these differences from <hi rend="italic">Acanthodrilus</hi> are less marked.</p>
                <p>The so-called prostates of <hi rend="italic">Acanthodrilus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Pontodrilus</hi> agree in their minute structure with the vesicula
                    seminalis of <hi rend="italic">Eudrilus,</hi> and they open on to the exterior,
                    like the corresponding structures in <hi rend="italic">Perichaeta,</hi> by a
                    thick-walled muscular tube; the vas deferens, however, is connected in <hi
                    rend="italic">Pontodrilus</hi> with the muscular part of the atrium, and not
                    with the vesicula; the condition of the efferent apparatus is therefore a more
                    modified one. In <hi rend="italic">Typhaeus</hi> this modification is carried
                    still further: the vas deferens enters the bodywall independently of the
                    vesicula and atrium, and only joins the latter below the epidermis just before
                    its opening on to the exterior. It V ejdovsky be right in interpreting the
                    so-called receptaculum seminis of <hi rend="italic">Ocnerodrilus</hi> (Eisen) as
                    the atrium, the relations of the several parts of the efferent system in this
                    worm are much the same as in <hi rend="italic">Typhaeus.</hi> In <hi
                    rend="italic">Acanthodrilus</hi> (fig. 5, II) the two pairs of atria open on to
                    the 17th and 19th segments respectively: the vasa deferentia open on to the 18th
                    independently of them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">{d) Genital Setae.—</hi> It is commonly the case among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oligoehaeta</hi> that the setae upon the clitellum, in the
                    neighbourhood of the spermathecae and the male sexual apertures, undergo a
                    certain amount of modification. Thus in <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus</hi> the
                    setae in these regions of the body are longer and more slender than the setae
                    elsewhere (Hering); in <hi rend="italic">Uroehaeta</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thamnodrilus</hi> the setae upon the clitellum are ridged. Analogous
                    modifications are found in <hi rend="italic">Nais</hi> and other <hi
                    rend="italic">“Limicolae."</hi> The function of these setae is probably, as
                    Lankester has suggested, to assist in attaching the worms together during
                    copulation. Before the individual is mature these setae are absent, and the
                    ordinary setae occupy their place; when the clitellum is developed the ordinary
                    setae drop out, and are replaced by the genital setae (Vejdovsky).</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Acanthodrilus, Typhaeus,</hi> and some species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Perichaeta</hi> the apertures of the atria are furnished with a
                    thin-walled muscular diverticulum in which are found a bundle of extraordinarily
                    long setae; these can be protruded through the sexual orifice and may possibly
                    serve to assist in the transference of the sperm to the spermathecae of another
                    individual. These setae may be termed “penial” setae (Lankester) (fig. 2, <hi

                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Female Reproductive Apparatus—{a) Ovaries.—</hi> The
                    ovaries of <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus</hi> were first discovered by D’Udekem;
                    they consist of a pair of minute pear-shaped bodies attached to the anterior
                    septum of the 13th segment (fig. 4, 0}; their position exactly corresponds to
                    that of the testes, and like those organs they are covered by a delicate layer
                    of flattened peritoneal cells. In <hi rend="italic">Perichaeta</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Acanthodrilus,</hi> where the testes are prolonged into numerous
                    digitate processes, the ovaries have an identical form; finally, the contents of

                    Corresponding to the seminal reservoirs are a pair of outgrowths from the
                    posterior side of the septum which separates segments 13-14; the ripe or nearly
                    ripe ova are stored in these receptacles. Their presence in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lumbricus</hi> was first discovered by Hering. They have the same structure as
                    the seminal reservoirs; their cavity is similarly divided by anastomosing
                    trabeculae; and they have been proved by Bergh (19) to originate in the same
                    way. In <hi rend="italic">Moniligaster</hi> (Horst) these bodies are of large
                    size, and therefore resemble more closely the seminal reservoirs. They are
                    generally present in earthworms. Among the <hi rend="italic">Naido-morpha</hi>
                    organs are met with which appear to resemble the receptacula. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Stylaria lacustris</hi> a pair of delicate sacs are developed in
                    the same segment as that which contains the ovaries; in these the ova undergo
                    their development; the extremity of the sac encircles the ovary, so that the ova
                    can readily find their way into it. This organ is, however, compared by
                    Vejdovsky (15) to the delicate peritoneal covering of the ovary in <hi
                    rend="italic">Lumbricus,</hi> and more particularly to a tube-like projection of
                    this peritoneal covering at the free extremity of the ovary where the ripe ova
                    are found.</p>
                <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Oviduct.—</hi> The oviducts in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lumbricus</hi> are two minute trumpetshaped bodies composed of a single layer
                    of ciliated cells; the funnel-shaped expansion opens into the 13th segment; the
                    tube perforates the mesentery, and opens on to the exterior in the 14th segment.
                    The mouth of the oviduct is in close relation with the aperture of the
                    receptaculum ovorum into the same segment. In most earthworms a pair of oviducts
                    of similar structure have been recognized; in <hi rend="italic">Perichaeta</hi>
                    the two oviducts open by a common pore situated in the median ventral line of
                    the 14th segment. The apertures of the oviducts are, with the exception of <hi
                    rend="italic">Moniligaster</hi> (Horst) and <hi rend="italic">Allιιrus</hi>
                    (Beddard, 5), invariably placed in front of the male generative'pores. Among the
                    “limicolous” forms oviducts have been described in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhynchelmis, Phreoryctes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phreαtothrix</hi>; in
                    these genera, however, the oviducts consist of little more than the funnel which
                    is sessile on the ventral body-wall of the 11th segment, and opens on to the
                    exterior in the groove between this and the following segment; in <hi
                    rend="italic">Phreoryctes,</hi> Beddard (6), there are two pairs of oviducts
                    entirely contained in one segment. It is important to note that in <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhynchelmis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phreatoihrix</hi> the
                    female pore is behind the male pore, while in earthworms (except <hi
                    rend="italic">Moniligaster, Allurus)</hi> it is in front. Among the lower <hi
                    rend="italic">Oligoehaeta</hi> oviducts are absent; their place is taken in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Enchytraeidae</hi> and others by a pair of slit-like orifices
                    placed on the clitellar segment behind the apertures of the vasa deferentia.
                    That these pores represent the external orifices of the oviducts in the higher
                    forms is shown by the following considerations: (1) their position behind the
                    male pores; (2) the probability urged by Vejdovsky that the clitellar segment
                    really represents three fused segments, in which case the oviducal pores are
                    really one segment behind the male efferent pores; (3) the remarkable analogy
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Cyclostomata</hi> among fishes, where the abdominal
                    pores act as oviduct (Weber, <hi rend="italic">Zeitsch.f. wiss. Zook,</hi>

                    the interior is divided by trabeculae into numerous compartments; directly
                    continuous with each ovary is a contorted tube which passes through the septum
                    into the 13th segment, and then again passes through the septum, and opens on to
                    the exterior in the 14th segment, in common with a large spermathecal pouch and
                    a small glandular body. The oviduct opens by a wide mouth into the interior of
                    the ovary, and is lined throughout with a ciliated epithelium; it is covered by
                    layers of muscular fibres, which are continuous with those of the ovary. The
                    continuity of the ovary and its duct is unknown in any other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oligochaeta,</hi> but is analogous to the condition of the ovaries and their
                    ducts in the leeches. It is possible that the muscular wall of the ovary is to
                    be regarded as an hypertrophy of the peritoneal covering of the ovary in <hi
                    rend="italic">Lumbricus,</hi> &amp;c., and that this has involved the ovi duct;
                    or the muscular coat of the ovary may be regarded as the receptaculum ovorum,
                    which, as in <hi rend="italic">Stylariα,</hi> is developed in the same segment
                    as the ovary; this supposition is strengthened by the fact that the oviduct
                    traverses the septum between the 13th and 14th segments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spermathecae.—</hi> Of these organs there are from one to eight
                    pairs; they consist of spherical or pear-shaped vesicles, often furnished with
                    accessory diverticula. They receive the semen during copulation and by their
                    epithelium is fabricated the generally chitinous spermatophore in which the
                    spermatozoa are enveloped, and in which they are conveyed to the neighbourhood
                    of the clitellum of another individual.</p>
                <p>The genital ducts have been compared with nephridia by many writers: there is not
                    only a considerable anatomical resemblance, but a developmental similarity; the
                    vasa deferentia (and the oviducts ?), like the nephridia, consist of a funnel,
                    of a more or less elongated tubule, and of a distal vesicular part. The <hi
                    rend="italic">intra</hi> cellular duct of the nephridium and the <hi
                    rend="italic">inter</hi> cellular duct of the vas deferens may be explained by
                    the different functions which the organs perform.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The difference between the nephridia and
                    genital ducts in this respect cannot be regarded as being of importance; the

                    rend="italic">oligochaeta</hi> in having an intercellular lumen. Lang, moreover,
                    has shown (“Die Polycladen,” <hi rend="italic">Naples Monographs)</hi> that in
                    some Planarians the reproductive ducts, like the nephridia, may have an
                    intracellular lumen.</p></note> The spermathecae, on the other hand, are
                    comparable to the vesicle of the nephridium, which is formed in both cases by an
                    ectodermic ingrowth. The fact that the funnel and the tubule in both cases are
                    developed independently, but both from the mesoblast, is a striking point of
                    similarity between the vasa deferentia and oviducts and the nephridia. The
                    belief of Claparède that in the <hi rend="italic">“Limicolae”</hi> the genital
                    ducts were the homologues of nephridia, but not in the “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Terrieolaef</hi> was based upon the erroneous assumption that nephridia are
                    absent in the genital segments of the former. This has been shown by Vejdovsky
                    to be an error: nephridia are present at first in the genital segments, but
                    degenerate and disappear when the genital ducts are formed. Moreover, enough has
                    been already said to prove the extreme unlikelihood of a non-homology between
                    the generative ducts in earthworms and those in the “limicolous” forms.
                    Lankester put forward the theory that there were primitively two pairs of
                    nephridia in each segment, each series being connected with one of the pairs of
                    setae; the genital ducts were supposed to be the remains of one series which had
                    aborted, except in the genital segments. This theory was at first espoused by
                    Perrier, who found that the nephridia were sometimes connected with one series
                    of setae and sometimes with the other, and sometimes <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Plutellus)</hi> alternated from segment to segment, opening in one segment by
                    the ventral and in another by the dorsal setae; these facts appeared to show
                    that one or other of the two series of nephridia was partially or entirely
                    retained in different genera. In his later publications Perrier was not inclined
                    to attach much weight to this hypothesis, inasmuch as it did not satisfactorily
                    refer the genital ducts to one or other of the presumed double series of
                    nephridia; the apertures of the genital ducts and nephridia were found
                    occasionally to coincide at the same pair of setae.</p>
                <p>The discovery that each segment of a worm may contain numerous nephridial pores
                    disposes of any <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> difficulties as to the homology
                    between nephridia and genital ducts, though the question is far from being
                    settled.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Classification and Affinities.—</hi> It has already been stated
                    that the <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> form a group which cannot be
                    subdivided into <hi rend="italic">Limieolae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Terricolae</hi> as was proposed by Claparède. The genera of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oligochaeta</hi> have been arranged in families by Vejdovsky (14), to whom the
                    reader is referred for a classification, which is satisfactory as regards the
                    “limicolous” forms, and some of the families <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,
                    Lumbricidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Perichaetidae)</hi> of earthworms. Since
                    that time, how ever, a large number of new genera and species of earthworms have
                    been described, which cannot at present be satisfactorily arranged. Perrier
                    divided earthworms into three groups :—(1) <hi rend="italic">Preclitellians
                    {e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Lumbricus),</hi> where the male pores are situated
                    in front of the clitellum; (2) <hi rend="italic">Iηtraclitellians {e.g.,
                    Eudrilus),</hi> where the male pores are within the clitellum; and (3) <hi
                    rend="italic">Postclitellians {e.g., Pcrichaeta),</hi> where the male pores open
                    behind the clitellum. Advancing knowledge has shown this classification to be
                    untenable, for two principal reasons: first, because it separates some species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Acanthodrilus</hi> which are postclitellian from others
                    which are intraclitellian, and it separates the intraclitellian <hi
                    rend="italic">Megascokx</hi> from the postclitellian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pcrichaeta,</hi> between which genera there are numerous points of affinity;
                    and, secondly, because this classification is based on the assumption that
                    earthworms can be considered as a group apart from other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oligochaeta,</hi> whereas it is now impossible to draw any line of division
                    between any two such groups.</p>
                <p>The simplest forms of <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> are the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeolosoma</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ctenodrilus. Aeolosoma</hi>
                    has a “head,” consisting of one segment which contains the pharynx. The nervous
                    system consists of cerebral ganglia, which are placed in the first segment, and
                    retain connexion with the epiblast; the apparent absence of a ventral nervous
                    cord is in all probability to be looked upon as evidence of degeneration. The
                    body possesses considerable traces of the primitively continuous ciliation; upon
                    the head are a pair of ciliated pits. In all these particulars, as well as in
                    the characters of the vascular system, <hi rend="italic">Aeolosoma</hi> agrees
                    with <hi rend="italic">Ctenodrilus</hi>; the latter form has, however, a ventral
                    nerve cord, which, like the cerebral ganglia, is lodged in the epidermis. In
                    most of these points <hi rend="italic">Aeolosoma</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ctenodrilus</hi> resemble larval forms of the higher <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oligochaeta.</hi> The reproductive organs of <hi rend="italic">Ctenodrilus</hi>
                    are not known, but those of <hi rend="italic">Aeolosoma</hi> are constituted on
                    the Oligochaetous plan. These two genera are also closely allied to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Archiannclida,</hi> of which a short description is appended, as
                    they are not treated elsewhere in this λvork.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Aeolosoma</hi> therefore retains certain Archiannelid
                    characters, but is to be referred to the <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> on
                    account of—(1) the limitation of the reproductive glands to two segments and the
                    presence of special efferent testicular ducts; (2) the paired arrangement of the
                    setae bundles, which agree in their structure with those of other <hi
                    rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi>; and (3) the relative complication of the
                    nephridia, as compared with <hi rend="italic">Archiamηelida.</hi></p>
                <p>The affinities of <hi rend="italic">Ctenodrilus</hi> are not so plain; but, in
                    the absence of any knowledge respecting the generative organs, it is impossible
                    to refer them definitely to the. <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> or to the

                    ancestral form from which both the <hi rend="italic">Polychaeta</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> have been derived. Their structure, which bears
                    out this supposition, suggested the name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Polygordius</hi> is found on the northern and southern coasts
                    of Europe; it is a small slender worm, varying in length (according to the
                    species) from 30 m. to 1 decim. The segmentation is hardly marked externally.
                    The head segment is divided as in the <hi rend="italic">Chaetopoda</hi>
                    generally into a prostomium and a peristomial ring; the prostomium gives rise to
                    two tentacles. On either side of the prostomium is a ciliated pit, which is of
                    special interest, as it occurs on the one hand among the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Nemertines</hi> (g ’.u), and on the other among certain <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polychaeta {e.g., Ophelidae),</hi> and in the lowly organized Oligochaet <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeolosoma.</hi> Cilia are found in certain species in the
                    neighbourhood of the mouth and on the anal segment.</p>
                <p>The ciliation of the body is more marked in <hi rend="italic">Protodrilus,</hi>
                    where there is a continuous ventral groove lined by cilia; there are rings of
                    cilia also on each segment. The partial ciliation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polygordius</hi> is to be derived from this by reduction. Certain <hi
                    rend="italic">Oligochaeta</hi> retain traces of the primitive ciliation of the
                    body <hi rend="italic">{e.g., Aeolosoma).</hi></p>
                <p>There are no traces of setae in <hi rend="italic">Polygordius</hi> or its allies.
                    The segmentation of the body, although hardly marked externally, is very clearly
                    marked internally; the body-cavity is divided by successive septa into a series
                    of segments; there is no such fusion of the anterior segments as is met with
                    among the <hi rend="italic">Polychaeta</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oligochaeta,</hi> and the segments are less differentiated among themselves
                    than is usually the case in the higher <hi rend="italic">Chaetopoda.</hi> The
                    head segment contains the pharynx, which is limited to this segment; the
                    nephridia, which consist of simple tubes (probably but not certainly formed of a
                    chain of “drain-pipe” cells, as in <hi rend="italic">Oligochaeta)</hi> are found
                    in all the segments except the first and last. The nephridia do not lie freely
                    within the caelom, but in the thickness of the parietal peritoneum; the funnel
                    only just opens into the cavity of the segment preceding that which bears the
                    external pore; that is to say, it is chiefly contained within the thickness of
                    the septum.</p>

                <p>In having the form of simple sinuous (not coiled) tubes, and in lying within the
                    peritoneum, the nephridia are in a very archaic condition; the same thing occurs
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Capitellidae</hi>; in the higher Annelids the nephridia
                    lie within the coelom, and are usually much coiled and complicated in
                    structure.</p>
                <p>The vascular system consists of a dorsal and a ventral trunk, which traverse the
                    thickness of the dorsal and ventral mesenteries. The development of these
                    vessels shows that their cavity is continuous with the blastocaele, and is not a
                    secondary canalization of a solid chain of mesoblast cells, as is so commonly
                    the case in the <hi rend="italic">Annelida.</hi> The two trunks communicate in
                    every segment except the last two or three by two lateral vessels, one on each
                    side; each of these latter gives off a caecal tube running backwards along the
                    somatic peritoneum. Thus the vascular system undergoes but little modification
                    in different segments. In <hi rend="italic">Protodrilus</hi> the bloodvessels
                    have no walls, and therefore permanently retain a condition which is found in
                    the young <hi rend="italic">Polygordius</hi> before the adjacent mesoblast cells
                    have become differentiated into an extremely delicate membrane. The condition of
                    the vascular channels in <hi rend="italic">Polygordius</hi> represents that of
                    the larval <hi rend="italic">Polychaela</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oligoehaeta</hi> before the special muscular walls have been formed. <hi

                <p>The digestive tube consists of only a single layer of ciliated cells covered by a
                    single layer of peritoneal cells, and is therefore in an embryonic condition as

                    >Oligo-chaeía.</hi> It is, however, specialized into a pharynx, oesophagus, and
                    intestine. The nervous system is extremely simple, and lies in the thickness of
                    the epidermis, thus presenting an embryonic character, which is, however, met
                    with in certain <hi rend="italic">Polychaela.</hi></p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Polygordius</hi> the cerebral mass is situated in the

                    cord which is single and median, and shows no trace of ganglionic enlargements.
                    In <hi rend="italic">Protodrilus</hi> there are two ventral cords, while in <hi
                    rend="italic">Histriodrilus</hi> there are a series of ganglionic swellings. A

                    side is the mouth, which leads into an alimentary canal opening at the posterior
                    end of the body; at the apical region is an ectodermic thickening.</p>
