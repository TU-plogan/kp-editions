                    speech and darker complexion. The Wallon domain comprises the four provinces of
                    Hainault, Namur, Liége, and Luxemburg, besides about one-third of Brabant. It
                    forms a nearly regular right-angled triangle, with apex at Maestricht within the
                    Dutch frontier, and base stretching along the French frontier in a
                    south-easterly direction, from the neighbourhood of Lille to Longwy at the
                    soutli-west corner of German Luxemburg. It coincides almost exactly with the
                    section of the Meuse basin comprised within Belgian territory, and has a total
                    area of 6000 square miles, or about one-half of the kingdom, with a population
                    (1886) of 2,780,000, or considerably less than half of the entire Belgian
                    population. But from the following figures it is evident that the Romance is
                    steadily gaining on the Flemish (Teutonic) section and will soon be in a
                    majority. In 1830 the Wallon population numbered 1,360,000 as against 1,860,000
                    Flemish; in 1866 the corresponding figures were 2,040,000 and 2,406,000; and in
                    1886 they were 2,780,000 and 3,060,000.</p>
                <p>This north-eastern extremity of ancient Gaul, originally inhabited by the
                    Aduatici, Eburones, Tungri, and other Belgic nations, was reduced by Caesar (51
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> and early brought within the sphere of Roman
                    culture. Hence the Latin language was already too firmly established to be
                    supplanted by the Teutonic when the country was occupied in the 5th century by
                    the Franks previous to their conquest of the more central provinces. But about
                    the same time Roman institutions and speech were entirely supplanted in the more
                    open low-lying districts of western Belgium by the same Franks penetrating from
                    the east, and by the roving Saxon and Frisian tribes arriving by sea on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Litus Saxonicum.</hi> Since that time the two elements have
                    remained, without much further change, in close proximity, or separated only by
                    intervening strips of “marches” or border-lands formed by the uncleared forest
                    formerly known as the <hi rend="italic">Silva Carbonaria.</hi></p>
                <p>The Wallons, allowing for inevitable intermingling, especially towards the German
                    frontier, are thus Romanized Gauls, lineal representatives of the ancient
                    Belgae, in a much truer sense than their Flemish neighbours, although accepting
                    from them this name of “Wallon,” that is, <hi rend="italic">Welsh</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Foreign,</hi> just as the Saxon intruders in Britain imposed the
                    same designation on its primitive inhabitants. Their Gallic descent is shown
                    specially in their much darker complexion, as clearly established by the
                    anthropological statistics collected by Dr Beddoe.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In Namur, a central point of the Wallon
                    domain, the proportion of dark eyes is 47 and of dark hair 57⋅5 per cent. as
                    compared with 24 and 20 respectively in Mechlin, a corresponding central point
                    in the Flemish domain.</p></note> In other respects the Wallons contrast
                    favourably with the Teutonic-speaking populations of Belgium. They are
                    physically a stronger race, more bony, angular, and taller, and also more
                    long-lived and exempt from disease, as shown by the much lower death-rate in the
                    province of Namur (18 per 1000) than in West Flanders (25 per 1000). The cause
                    of this superiority has been attributed by some writers to a greater inherent
                    vitality of the Wallons, but by others with more probability to their greater
                    general comfort, and particularly to the more salubrious climate of their
                    elevated and more hilly territory. In mediaeval times the Flemings were
                    certainly far superior in wealth, culture, and public spirit. But the great
                    centres of industry have since been shifted from Bruges and Ghent (Flanders) to
                    Liége and Namur, and the Wallons now take the lead in all these respects,—in
                    fact, in everything except music, painting, and the fine arts generally.</p>
                <p>The Wallon language is a very marked dialect of the Langue d’Oïl (Northern
                    French), betraying strong affinities to the neighbouring idioms of Picardy and
                    Lorraine, but still distinct from both. Being little cultivated, and possessing
                    no literary standard, it has developed several varieties, the chief of which
                    are—(1) the <hi rend="italic">Liégeois,</hi> current throughout the districts
                    bordering on Rhenish Prussia, and largely affected by German influences; (2) the
                    <hi rend="italic">Namurois</hi> of the central districts and the Ardennes, with
                    several local patois; (3) the <hi rend="italic">Hennuyer</hi> of Hainault and
                    the western districts, so named from the town of Hennuyères, where it is spoken
                    with the greatest purity. But since French has been accepted as the written
                    standard and the official language of the whole kingdom Wallon is gradually
                    receding from the large towns and assuming more and more the character of a
                    purely rural patois. It possesses no literary remains of any consequence, and
                    its earliest extant monument appears to be the “Declaration des Provost, Juret,
                    Eskievin de Valenchienes” of the year 1256.</p>
