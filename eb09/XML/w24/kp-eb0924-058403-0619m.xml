                    when Amalric came to the throne (17th February 1163), and did not return till
                    late in 1166 or early in 1167. As a child he had seen Ralph, the patriarch of
                    Antioch, who died about 1141-42; he remembered the fall of Edessa (December
                    1144); and he seems to call himself a contemporary historian from the accession
                    of Baldwin III., an event which he dates 10th November 1142 <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Hist. Per. Transmarin.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> xvi., pref.,
                    and xix. 4, 12). Unfortunately the chapter (xix. 12) which relates to his own
                    early life has been excised or omitted from every MS. of his great work now
                    extant,—a remark which holds good, not only for the original Latin, but also for
                    the 13th-century French translation. William was appointed archdeacon of Tyre at
                    the request of Amalric on 31st August 1167. Next summer he was despatched on an
                    embassy to the emperor Manuel. At the time of the disastrous campaign against
                    Damietta (October—December 1169) he had to take refuge at Rome from the
                    “unmerited anger” of his archbishop. About. 1170 he was appointed tutor to
                    Amalric’s son Baldwin, afterwards Baldwin IV. A very few months after Baldwin’s
                    accession William was made chancellor of the kingdom (c. October 1174), and less
                    than a year later (13th June 1175) was consecrated archbishop of Tyre. The
                    former office he still held in 1182. He belonged to the commission which
                    negotiated with Philip of Flanders in 1177; and in the following October (1178)
                    he was one of six bishops sent to represent the Latin Church of the East at the
                    Lateran Council (19th March 1179). He returned home by way of Constantinople,
                    where he stayed seven months (October 1179-April 1180) with Manuel. This is his
                    last authentic appearance in history; but we know from his own works that he was
                    writing his <hi rend="italic">History</hi> in 1182 (xix. 20), and that it breaks
                    off abruptly at the end of 1183 or the beginning of 1184. Some fifty years later
                    his first continuator accused Heraclius, patriarch of Jerusalem, of having
                    procured William’s death at Rome. This story, however, seems to be pure legend;
                    nor perhaps is much more credit to be attached to the theory that identifies him
                    with the archbishop of Tyre sent over to Europe to preach a new crusade in 1188.
                    It is true that Matthew Paris speaks of Henry H.’s receiving the cross from the
                    hands of “Willelmus episcopus Tyrensis”; but more contemporary writers omit the
                    Christian name, while others write it Josce or Joscius.</p>
                <p>If not the greatest, William of Tyre is at least among the greatest, of mediaeval
                    historians. His <hi rend="italic">Historia Rerum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">Partibus Transmarinis Gestarum</hi> is the main
                    authority for the Latin kingdom of the East between 1127, where Fulcher of
                    Chartres leaves off, and 1184, where Ernoul takes up the narrative. It was
                    translated into French in the 13th century, or possibly before the end of the
                    12th. A little later it was united to Ernoul ’ s chronicle or that of Bernard
                    the Treasurer, and continued in more than one form to 1249, 1261, or 1275. In
                    this shape the combined histories form the <hi rend="italic">Livre d’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Outremer</hi> quoted by Joinville (cxvii. § 77),—the standard
                    mediaeval account of the exploits of the Frankish warriors in the East.
                    William’s own work consists of twenty-two books and a fragment (one chapter and
                    a preface) of book xxiii. It extends from the preaching of the first crusade by
                    Peter the Hermit and Urban II. to the end of 1183 or the beginning of 1184. Like
                    William’s other work, the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">Orientalibus Principibus,</hi> it was undertaken at
                    the request of Amalric, who was himself a lover of history and supplied the
                    author with Arabic MSS.; but, whereas the latter book (now unfortunately lost)
                    was mainly based upon the writings of a certain “Seith, the son of Patrick <hi
                    rend="italic">(Patricii),</hi> patriarch of Alexandria,” of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia Transmarina</hi> its author remarks, “In this work we
                    have had no guide, whether Greek or Arab, but have had recourse to traditions
                    only, save as regards a few things that we have ourselves seen.” The
                    “traditions” here spoken of must be taken to include the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gesta</hi><hi rend="italic">Francorum</hi> of Tudebode, Raymund of Agiles,
                    Fulcher of Chartres, and, above all, Albert of Aix. It is only with the
                    accession of Baldwin I., even if so early as this, that William’s claim to
                    originality can fairly be sustained; and even here his narrative, till towards
                    the close of book xiii., is based upon that of Fulcher. From this point William
                    of Tyre is indebted to no other historian. Of the remaining books two are
                    devoted to the reign of Fulk (xiv.-xv.), three to that of Baldwin III.
                    (xvi.-xviii. ), two to that of Amalric, and the rest to that of Baldwin IV.</p>
                <p>No mediaeval writer, except perhaps Giraldus Cambrensis, possesses William’s
                    power of delineating the physical and mental features of his heroes. Again, very
                    few had his instinctive insight into what would be of real value to future ages:
                    genealogy, topography, archaeology, social life (political and ecclesiastical),
                    military matters and naval, all find a due exposition in his pages. It is hardly
                    too much to say that from his work alone a fairly detailed map of the Levant, as
                    it was in the 12th century, might be constructed; and it is impossible to praise
                    too highly the scrupulous fidelity with which he defines nearly all the
                    technical terms (whether relating to land or sea) of which he makes use. His
                    chief fault is in the matter of chronology, where indeed he is not unfrequently
                    at discord with himself. In the later books his information, even as regards
                    what was taking place beyond the Nile or the Euphrates, as well as in Europe, is
                    singularly exact. Nor did he consider any trouble too severe if by its means he
                    might attain to the truth. Though a man of great learning and almost certainly
                    acquainted with Arabic and Greek, he is as ready to enliven his pages with a
                    country proverb as to embellish them with quotations from Cicero, Virgil, Ovid,
                    or Plato. He was a prelate of pious character, inclined to see the judgment of
                    God on the iniquities of his fellow-countrymen in every disaster that overtook
                    his native land and every Saracen success.</p>
