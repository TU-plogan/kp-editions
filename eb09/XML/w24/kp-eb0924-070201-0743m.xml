                    church of St Pierre le Jeune in Strasburg, and died there in 1845. Madame Wurtz,
                    after the death of her husband, remained at Strasburg with her brother Theodore,
                    and after his death lived with her son Adolphe in Paris till her own death in
                    1878.</p>
                <p>Wurtz was educated first at Wolfisheim and afterwards at the Protestant gymnasium
                    of Strasburg. There he obtained several prizes, but seems rather to have
                    disappointed his father, who said he would never turn out anything
                    extraordinary. He took special interest in those studies which bore upon nature;
                    in 1828 he took part in a botanical class with excursions, which developed his
                    taste for natural science.</p>
                <p>His education owed more perhaps to his home circle than to the school. His
                    learned and pious father, his more generally cultured uncles, and the circle of
                    friends attracted by them opened to him a wide view of what there is for a man
                    to know. His holidays were mostly spent at the house of a grand-aunt at Rothau,
                    where he learned to know the hills and woods of Alsace, and amused himself in
                    the spinning, weaving, bleaching, and printing works in the neighbourhood. In
                    1834 he left the gymnasium with the degree of bachelier-ès-lettres. His father
                    seems to have wished him to devote himself to the church. But he had already
                    made his choice. For some time he had fitted up a sort of laboratory in the
                    washing-house, and had there repeated the experiments he had seen performed in
                    the class-rooms of the gymnasium. His father took no interest in science, but
                    consented to his study of medicine as next best to theology. He went through his
                    studies conscientiously, and passed all his examinations with credit, but of
                    course devoted himse!f specially to the chemical side of his profession. In 1839
                    he was appointed superintendent of practical chemistry in the faculty of
                    medicine under Professor Cailliot. He graduated as M.D. 13th August 1843, the
                    title of his thesis being “On Albumin and Fibrin.” He then went for a year to
                    Giessen, to study under Liebig. There he made the acquaintance of Hofmann,
                    Strecker, and Kopp. On leaving Giessen he went to Paris, where he worked in
                    Dumas’s private laboratory, and in 1845 was appointed assistant to Dumas in the
                    École de Médecine. In 1847, on his presentation of a thesis “On Pyrogenic
                    Bodies,” he was appointed “professor aggrégé,”and in 1849 he gave the lectures
                    on organic chemistry in place of Dumas. His laboratory in the École Pratique de
                    la Faculté de Médecine was very inconvenient and ill fitted up; he therefore, in
                    1850, along with Dollfus and Verdeil, who had just returned to Paris from
                    Giessen, opened a private laboratory in the Rue Garancière. The adventure was
                    successful in a scientific sense as long as it lasted; but unfortunately the
                    three chemists had neglected to secure fixity of tenure, the house was sold, and
                    they had to retire and sell their furnishings. The same year Wurtz was appointed
                    professor of chemistry in the Institut Agronomique, then founded at Versailles.
                    But here also the want of fixity was felt. Louis Napoleon abolished the Institut
                    in 1852. In 1853 Dumas resigned the chair of organic chemistry in the faculty of
                    medicine; at the same time the chair of mineral chemistry and toxicology became
                    vacant by the death of Orfila; the two chairs were united, and Wurtz was
                    appointed to the post thus constituted. In 1866 he was made dean of the faculty
                    of medicine, and used his influence for the rearrangement and reconstruction of
                    the buildings devoted to scientific teaching. In 1874 he persuaded the
                    Government to found a chair of organic chemistry at the Sorbonne, and resigned
                    his office of dean, retaining the title of honorary dean. At the Sorbonne he had
                    a smaller but better prepared audience than at the</p>
                <p>École de Médecine. But he had great difficulty in persuading the Government to
                    build him a suitable laboratory, and indeed did not live to see the new
                    laboratory opened. He was appointed senator in 1881. He was one of the founders
                    of the Chemical Society of Paris, of which he was the first secretary, and was
                    three times president. He was elected member of the Academy of Sciences in 1867,
                    in succession to Pelouze. He was vice-president in 1880 and president in the
                    following year. He died, after a short illness, May 12, 1884. Wurtz was an
                    honorary member of nearly every scientific society in Europe. In 1878 he gave
                    the Faraday lecture of the Chemical Society of London, and in 1881 was awarded
                    the Copley medal by the Royal Society of London. Through life he remained warmly
                    attached to the church of his fathers, and took a practical interest in its
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>Wurtz’s work is chiefly to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie
                    et</hi><hi rend="italic">de Physique,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Comptes
                    Rendus,</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin de la</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Société Chimique.</hi> The following is a short outline of his most important
                    discoveries. First, with respect to the constitution of hypophosphorous and
                    phosphorous acids, he showed that the salts of these acids all contain the
                    elements of water, and proposed formulae for them, in which the salt radical is
                    represented as containing hydrogen. These formulae, translated, of course, into
                    the modern language, which Wurtz did so much to introduce, are still used as the
                    best representations of the constitution of these salts. In the course of this
                    investigation he discovered the curious and interesting compound cuprous
                    hydride. He also discovered sulphophosphoric acid and the oxychloride of
                    phosphorus. His next great work was on cyanuric acid. He discovered the cyanic
                    ethers (R-N = C = O), and from them obtained the mono-alkyl ureas. From the
                    cyanic ethers he produced a class of substances which opened the way into a new
                    field of organic chemistry. On treating these ethers with caustic potash he
                    obtained potassium carbonate and an ammoniacal vapour. These vapours he soon
                    recognized as ammonia, in which an equivalent of hydrogen had been replaced by
                    methylium, CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, or ethylium, C <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. By acting on the cyanic ethers with his
                    new bases he obtained the dialkyl ureas. In 1855 he reviewed the various
                    substances that had been obtained from glycerin, and came to the conclusion that
                    glycerin is a body of alcoholic nature formed on the type of three molecules of
                    water, as common alcohol is on that of one. This speculation led him in 1856 to
                    the discovery of the glycols, alcoholic bodies similarly related to the type of
                    two molecules of water. This discovery he worked out very thoroughly, in
                    investigations on oxide of ethylene and the polyethylenic alcohols. The
                    oxidation of the glycols led him to homologues of lactic acid, and to a
                    discussion of the constitution of the latter. On this question a controversy
                    arose with Kolbe, in the course of which many important facts were discovered,
                    and valuable additions were made to chemical theory. In 1867 Wurtz obtained
                    neurine synthetically, by the action of trimethylamine on glycol-chlorhydrine.
                    In 1873 he discovered aldol, CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>-CH(OH)-CH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-CHO, and pointed out its double character as at once an
                    alcohol and an aldehyde.</p>
                <p>His investigations on the olefines had led him to the discovery of the peculiar
                    behaviour of the substance called by him chlorhydrate of amylene and of its
                    analogues, when the temperature of their vapour is raised. The gradual passage
                    from a gas of approximately normal vapour density to one of half the normal
                    density was used by him as a powerful argument in favour of the opinion that
                    abnormal vapour densities, such as those of sal-ammoniac and pentachloride of
                    phosphorus, are to be explained by dissociation. By experiments at low
                    temperatures and pressures he obtained nearly the normal density in the case of
                    the pentachloride of phosphorus, and showed how the dissociation depends on the
                    temperature and pressure. He took an active part in the discussion as to the
                    dissociation of the vapour of hydrate of chloral, in which H. Sainte-Claire
                    Deville and Μ. Berthelot were his chief opponents. By well-chosen experiments he
                    brought to light the facts involved, and stated the case for dissociation in a
                    very clear and to most minds very convincing way.</p>

                    France. In 1868 he began, with the assistance of many French chemists, the
