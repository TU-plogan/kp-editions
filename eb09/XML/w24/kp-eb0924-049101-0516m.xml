                    which recalls the fact that it is the residence of a grand-duke and his court,
                    and it still retains an indescribable atmosphere of refinement, dating from its
                    golden age, when it won the titles of “poets’ city” and “the German Athens.”
                    Weimar has now no actual importance, though it will always remain a literary
                    Mecca. It is a peaceful little German town, abounding in excellent educational,
                    literary, artistic, and benevolent institutions; its society is cultured, though
                    perhaps a little narrow; while the even tenour of its existence is undisturbed
                    by any great commercial or manufacturing activity. The population in 1885 was
                    21,565; in 1782, six years after Goethe’s arrival, it was about 7000; and in
                    1834, two years after his death, it was 10,638.</p>
                <p>The reign of Goethe’s friend and patron, the grand-duke Charles Augustus
                    (1775-1828), represents accurately enough the golden age of Weimar; though even
                    during the duke’s minority, his mother, the duchess Amalia, had begun to make
                    the little court a focus of light and leading in Germany. The most striking
                    building in Weimar is the extensive palace, erected for Charles Augustus under
                    the superintendence of Goethe in 1789- 1803, in place of one burned down in
                    1770. This building, with the associations of its erection, and its “poets’
                    rooms,” dedicated to Goethe, Schiller, Herder, and Wieland, epitomizes the
                    characteristics of the town. The main interest of Weimar centres in these men
                    and their more or less illustrious contemporaries; and, above all, Goethe, whose
                    altar to the “genius hujus loci” still stands in the ducal park, is himself the
                    genius of the place, just as Shakespeare is of Stratford-on-Avon, or Luther of
                    Wittenberg. Goethe’s residence from 1782 to 1832 (now opened as a “Goethe
                    museum,” with his collections and other reminiscences), the simple
                    “garden-house” in the park, where he spent many summers, Schiller’s humble
                    abode, where he lived from 1802 till his death in 1805, and the grand-ducal
                    burial vault, where the two poets rest side by side, are among the most
                    frequented pilgrim resorts in Germany. Rietschel's bronze group of Goethe and
                    Schiller (unveiled in 1857) stands appropriately in front of the theatre (much
                    altered in 1868) which attained such distinction under their combined auspices.
                    Not far off is the large and clumsy parish church, built about 1400, of which
                    Herder became pastor in 1776; close to the church is his statue, and his house
                    is still the parsonage. Within the church are the tombs of Herder and of Duke
                    Bernhard of Weimar, the hero of the Thirty Years’ War. The altar-piece—a
                    Crucifixion—is said to be the masterpiece of Lucas Cranach, whose house is
                    pointed out in the market-place. Wieland, who came to Weimar in 1772 as the
                    duke’s tutor, is also commemorated by a statue, and his house is indicated by a
                    tablet. Among the other prominent buildings in Weimar are the library,
                    containing 200,000 volumes and a valuable collection of portraits, busts, and
                    literary and other curiosities; the museum, built in 1863-68 in the Renaissance
                    style; the ancient church of St James, with the tombs of Lucas Cranach and
                    Musaeus; and the townhouse, built in 1841. Various points in the environs of
                    Weimar are also interesting from their associations. Separated from the town by
                    the park, laid out in the so-called English style by Goethe, is the chateau of
                    Belvedere, built in 1724. To the north-east is Tiefurt, often the scene of
                    al-fresco plays, in which the courtiers were the actors and the rocks and trees
                    the scenery; and to the north-west is the chateau of Ettersburg, another
                    favourite resort of Charles Augustus and his court.</p>
                <p>The history of Weimar, apart from its brilliant record at the end of the 18th and
                    the beginning of the 19th century, is of comparatively little interest. The town
                    is said to have existed in the 9th century, and in the 10th to have belonged to
                    a collateral branch of the family of the counts of Orlamiinde. About 1376 it
                    fell to the landgraves of Thuringia, and in 1440 it passed to the electors of
                    Saxony. In 1806 it was visited by Napoleon, whose half-formed intention of
                    abolishing the duchy was only averted by the tact and address of the duchess
                    Luise. The Muses have never left Weimar. Since 1860 it has been the seat of a
                    good school of painting, represented by the landscape painters Preller,
                    Kalckreuth, and Max Schmidt, and the historical painters Pauwels, Heumann, and
                    Verlat. The frequent residence here also of the Abbé Liszt, from 1848 till his
                    death in 1886, has preserved for Weimar quite an important place in the musical
                    world.</p>
