                    (1684-1721), French painter, was born at Valenciennes in 1684. Thrown on his own
                    resources at an early age, the boy went moneyless and <pb break="no"

                    struggle, he succeeded in getting work with a painter of saints for country
                    customers, who assigned to Watteau, the future limner of gallant feastings, the
                    repetition of dozens of St Nicholas. The saint brought him food and shelter, and
                    in his few holidays Watteau sketched and drew. From this shop he passed to the
                    studio of Gillot, whose influence helped him to follow the true direction of his
                    own special gifts, but he left him, finding employment with Audran the
                    decorator, then at work in the Luxembourg. Then Watteau quarrelled with Audran
                    and went his way, fancying that Audran had blamed his first picture, the
                    Departing Regiment, out of jealousy; and, flushed with success (for he had sold
                    the work), he went off to show himself in his native Valenciennes. There Watteau
                    produced a second work, a Regiment Halting, which also sold in Paris, so thither
                    he returned, and, welcomed by the celebrated Crozat, received fresh inspiration
                    from his taste and the study of his immense collections. In 1709 he competed for
                    the great prize, and, standing only second, applied for a crown pension to
                    enable him to go to Italy. As proofs of his deserts, he carried to the Academy
                    his first two pictures. His cause was warmly espoused by De la Fosse, and he was
                    instantly made an associate of that body, becoming a full member in 1717. His
                    diploma picture, Embarkation for the Isle of Venus, is now in the Louvre.
                    Suffering always from lung disease, and of a highly nervous temperament, Watteau
                    was, however, unfitted to live and work with others, and, in spite of his
                    professional success and his assured reputation, he held himself apart, ill at
                    ease with himself and seldom happy in his work, which suffered in sympathy with
                    his changing moods. A visit to London further disturbed his health, and in 1721
                    he returned to Paris, establishing himself for a while in the house of his
                    friend Gersaint, the picture dealer, for whom he painted a sign-board which had
                    an extraordinary success (a fragment in the collection Schwitzer). Hoping to
                    find rest and some alleviation to his increasing sufferings from country air, he
                    accepted a lodging at Nogent, in the house of M. Lefebvre, which had been
                    obtained for him through his constant friend the abbé Haranger, canon of St
                    Germain l’Auxerrois. At Nogent, shortly after his arrival, on 18th July 1821,
                    Watteau died, having bequeathed to the abbé, to Gersaint, to M. Henin, and to M.
                    Julienne the vast quantity of drawings which constituted almost the whole of his
                    fortune.</p>
                <p>No greater contrast can be found than that which Watteau’s work presents to the
                    painful condition under which he lived his life, a contrast such as that which
                    the boyish glee of Caldecott’s designs showed in comparison to the physical
                    misery against which his gallant spirit made so brave a stand. Watteau sought
                    refuge, as it were, from his bodily pain in that fairyland which he created,
                    where the pompous art of the “Grand Siècle” still cumbered the ground. His work,
                    always conceived in a poetical spirit, lived in spite of the artificial
                    atmosphere of the mock pastoral style of the day, and lives in virtue of the
                    exquisite precision of his observation and of the extraordinary brilliancy and
                    lightness of his art.</p>
