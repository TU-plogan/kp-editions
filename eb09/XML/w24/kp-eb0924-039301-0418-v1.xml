                <p><label type="entry">WASTE</label> (<hi rend="italic">Vastum)</hi> is used in law
                    in several senses, of which four are the most important. (1) Waste of a manor is
                    that part of a manor subject to rights of common, as distinguished from the
                    lord’s demesne (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Commons, Manor).</hi> (2) Year, day,
                    and waste was a part of the royal prerogative, acknowledged by the statute <hi
                        rend="italic">De Praerogativa Regis.</hi> The king had the profits of
                    freehold lands of those attainted of felony and petit treason and of fugitives
                    for a year and a day with a right of committing waste in sense (3) thereon.
                    After the expiration of a year and a day the lands returned to the lord of the
                    fee. Attainder for felony being now abolished, the right has ceased to exist
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Felony Treason).</hi> (3) The most usual signification
                    of the word is “any unauthorized act of a tenant for a freehold estate, not of
                    inheritance or for any lesser interest, which tends to the destruction of the
                    tenement, or otherwise to the injury of the inheritance” (Pollock, <hi
                        rend="italic">Law of Torts,</hi> p. 285). Waste is either voluntary or
                    permissive. Voluntary waste is by act of commission, as by pulling down a house,
                    cutting down trees, opening new quarries or mines (though not continuing the
                    working of existing ones), or doing anything which may destroy evidence, such as
                    conversion of arable into meadow land. Permissive waste is by act of omission,
                    such as allowing buildings to fall out of repair. A fermor, by the Statute of
                    Marlbridge, 52 Hen. III. c. 23, may not commit waste without licence in writing
                    from the reversioner. The same statute mentions a form of waste which has long
                    become extinct, viz., exile <hi rend="italic">(exilium),</hi> or the
                    impoverishment of villeins or tenants at will on an estate. In case a tenant for
                    life or for any smaller interest holds (as is often the case by the terms of a
                    will or settlement) without impeachment of waste, his rights are considerably
                    greater, and he may use the profits <hi rend="italic">salva rerum
                        substantia</hi> (to use the language of Roman law). For instance, he may cut
                    timber in a husband-like manner and open mines, but he may not commit what is
                    called equitable waste, that is, pull down or deface the mansion or destroy
                    ornamental timber. Acts of equitable waste were, before 1875, not cognizable in
                    courts of common law, but it is now provided by the Judicature Act, 1873, § 25
                    (3), that in the absence of special provision to that effect an estate for life
                    without impeachment of waste shall not confer upon the tenant for life any legal
                    right to commit equitable waste. Removal of fixtures, which would be <hi
                        rend="italic">prima facie</hi> waste, is recognized by the law to a limited
                    extent (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fixtures).</hi> A copyholder may not commit
                    waste unless allowed by the custom of the manor (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Copyhold).</hi> Various remedies for waste have been given to the
                    reversioner at different periods of law. At common law only single damages seem
                    to have been recoverable. This was altered by the legislature, and for some
                    centuries waste was a criminal or quasi-criminal offence. Magna Charta enacted
                    that a guardian committing waste of the lands in his custody should make amends
                    and lose his office. The Statute of Marlbridge made a fermor committing waste
                    liable to grievous amerciament as well as to damages, and followed Magna Charta
                    in forbidding waste by a guardian. The Statute of Gloucester, 6 Edw. I. c. 5,
                    enacted that a writ of waste might be granted against a tenant for life or years
                    or in courtesy or dower, and on being attainted of waste the tenant was to
                    forfeit the land wasted and to pay thrice the amount of the waste. In addition
                    to the writ of waste the writ of estrepement (said to be a corruption of <hi
                        rend="italic">exstirpamentum)</hi> lay to prevent injury to an estate to
                    which the title was disputed. Numerous other acts dealt with remedies for waste.
                    The writ of waste was superseded at common law by the mixed action of waste,
                    itself abolished by 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 27, and the action of trespass on the
                    case (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Tort, Trespass).</hi> The Court of Chancery also
                    established a jurisdiction by suit or injunction, especially to restrain
                    equitable waste. At present proceedings may be taken either by action for
                    damages, or by application for an injunction, or by both combined, and either in
                    the Queen’s Bench or Chancery Division. By the Judicature Act, 1873, § 25 (8),
                    the old jurisdiction to grant injunctions to prevent threatened waste is
                    considerably enlarged. The rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, Ord. xvi. r. 37,
                    enable a representative action to be brought for the prevention of waste. In
                    order to obtain damages or an injunction, substantial injury or danger of it
                    must be proved. In England only the High Court (unless by agreement of the
                    parties) has jurisdiction in questions of waste, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n419/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0419-0394"/> but in Ireland the civil bill courts and
                    courts of summary jurisdiction have co-ordinate authority to a limited extent.
                    The law of waste as it affects ecclesiastical benefices will be found under <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Dilapidations.</hi> (4) Waste of assets or <hi
                        rend="italic">devastavit</hi> is a squandering and misapplication of the
                    estate and effects of a deceased person by his executors or administrators, for
                    which they are answerable out of their own pockets as far as they have or might
                    have had assets of the deceased. The legal liability of the representatives of
                    the deceased is recognized by 30 Car. II. c. 7 and 4 W. and M. c. 24.</p>
                <p>In Scots law waste is not used as a technical term, but the respective rights of
                    fiar and liferenter are much the same as in England. The latter, however, has
                    not the right of continuing the working of existing mines unless the deed
                    specially confers it upon him. Interdicts have in strong cases been granted
                    against the sale of ornamental timber.</p>
                <p>In the United States, especially in the western States, many acts, such as the
                    felling of timber, are not considered waste which would be waste in England. In
                    some States waste is a cause of forfeiture; in some it gives a right to treble
                    damages. The writ of estrepement is still in use.</p>
