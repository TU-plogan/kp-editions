                    rend="smallcaps">Wellesley), Marquis of</hi></label> (1760-1842), eldest son of
                    the first earl of Mornington, an Irish peer, and eldest brother of the duke of
                    Wellington, was born June 20, 1760. He was sent to Eton, where he was
                    distinguished as an excellent classical scholar, and to Christ Church, Oxford.
                    By his father’s death in 1781 he became earl of Mornington, taking his seat in
                    the Irish House of Peers. In 1784 he entered the English House of Commons as
                    member for Beeralston. Soon afterwards he was appointed a lord of the treasury
                    by Pitt, with whom he rapidly grew in favour. In 1793 he became a member of the
                    board of control over Indian affairs; and, although he was best known to the
                    public by his speeches <pb break="no"

                    gaining the acquaintance with Oriental affairs which made his rule over India so
                    wonderfully effective from the moment when, in 1797, he accepted the office of
                    governor-general. Wellesley seems in a peculiar manner to have caught Pitt’s own
                    large political spirit during the years of his intercourse with him from 1793 to
                    1797. With equally profound conviction of the antagonism between the French
                    republic and the interests of Great Britain all over the world, he had gained
                    the same habit of dealing with political affairs in vast combinations and on the
                    broadest survey. That Pitt and Wellesley had consciously formed the design of
                    acquiring a great empire in India to compensate for the loss of the American
                    colonies has not been proved; but the rivalry with France, which in Europe
                    placed England at the head of coalition after coalition against the French
                    republic and empire, made Wellesley’s rule in India an epoch of enormous and
                    rapid extension of English power. On the journey outwards he formed, after a
                    discussion at the Cape with officials and soldiers returning home, the design of
                    annihilating French influence in the Deccan. Soon after his landing, in April
                    1798, he learnt that an alliance had actually been formed between Tippoo Saib
                    and the French republic. Wellesley resolved to anticipate the action of the
                    enemy, and ordered preparations for war. The invasion of Mysore followed in
                    February 1799, and the campaign was brought to a rapid close by the capture of
                    Seringapatam (see <hi rend="smallcaps">India</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Wellington).</hi> In 1803 the restoration of the peshwa was taken in hand,
                    which proved the prelude to the great Mahratta war against Sindhia and the raja
                    of Berar. The result of these wars and of the treaties which followed them was
                    that French influence in India was extinguished, that forty millions of
                    population and ten millions of revenue were added to the British dominions, and
                    that the powers of the Mahratta and all other princes were so reduced that
                    England became the really dominant authority over all India. Nor was Wellesley’s
                    rule distinguished only by conquest. He was an excellent administrator, and
                    sought to provide, by the foundation of the college of Fort William, for the
                    training of a class of men adequate to the great work of governing India. In
                    connexion with this college he established the governor-general’s office, to
                    which civilians who had shown great talent at the college were transferred, in
                    order that they might learn something of the highest statesmanship in the
                    immediate service of their chief. A free-trader, like Pitt, he endeavoured to
                    remove some of the restrictions on the trade between England and India. Both the
                    commercial policy of Wellesley and his educational projects brought him into
                    hostility with the court of directors, and he more than once tendered his
                    resignation, which, however, public necessities led him to postpone till the
                    autumn of 1805. He reached England just in time to see Pitt before his death. On
                    the fall of the coalition ministry in 1807 Wellesley (an English peer from 1797
                    and marquis in the peerage of Ireland from 1799) was invited by George III. to
                    join the duke of Portland’s cabinet, but he declined, pending the discussion in
                    parliament of certain charges brought against him in respect of his Indian
                    administration. Resolutions condemning him for the abuse of power were moved
                    both in the Lords and Commons, but defeated by large majorities. In 1809
                    Wellesley was appointed ambassador to Spain. He landed at Cadiz just after the
                    battle of Talavera, and endeavoured, but without success, to bring the Spanish
                    Government into effective co-operation with his brother, who, through the
                    failure of his allies, was compelled to retreat into Portugal. A few months
                    later, after the duel between Canning and Castlereagh and the resignation of
                    both, Wellesley accepted the post of foreign secretary in Perceval’s cabinet. He
                    held this office until February 1812, when he retired, partly from
                    dissatisfaction at the inadequate support given to Wellington by the ministry,
                    but also because he had become convinced that the question of Catholic
                    emancipation could no longer be kept in the background. From early life
                    Wellesley had, unlike his brother, been an advocate of Catholic emancipation,
                    and with the claim of the Irish Catholics to justice he henceforward identified
                    himself. On Perceval’s assassination he refused to join Lord Liverpool’s
                    administration, and he remained out of office till 1821, criticizing with
                    severity the proceedings of the congress of Vienna and the European settlement
                    of 1814, which, while it reduced France to its ancient limits, left to the other
                    great powers the territory that they had acquired by the partition of Poland and
                    the destruction of Venice. He was one of the peers who signed the protest
                    against the enactment of the Corn Laws in 1815. In 1821 he was appointed to the
                    lord-lieutenancy of Ireland. Catholic emancipation had now become an open
                    question in the cabinet, and Wellesley’s acceptance of the viceroyalty was
                    believed in Ireland to herald the immediate settlement of the Catholic claims.
                    The Orange faction were incensed by the firmness with which their excesses were
                    now repressed, and Wellesley was on one occasion mobbed and insulted. But the
                    hopes of the Catholics still remained unfulfilled. Lord Liverpool died without
                    having grappled with the problem. Canning in turn passed away; and on the
                    assumption of office by Wellington, who was opposed to Catholic emancipation,
                    his brother resigned the lordlieutenancy. He had, however, the satisfaction of
                    seeing the Catholic claims settled in the next year by the very statesmen who
                    had declared against them. In 1833 he resumed the office of lord-lieutenant
                    under Earl Grey, but the ministry fell a few months later, and, with one short
                    exception, Wellesley did not further take part in official life. His old age,
                    which was vigorous and animated to the last, was occupied with literary and
                    classical pursuits. He died on September 26, 1842. He had no successor in the
                    marquisate, but the earldom of Mornington and minor honours devolved on his
                    brother William, Lord Maryborough, on the failure of whose issue in 1863 they
                    fell to the second duke of Wellington.</p>
