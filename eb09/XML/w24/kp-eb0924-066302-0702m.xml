                    malignant pustule was observed upon the skin; but, on the other hand, in not a
                    few cases without any external manifestation, symptoms of blood-poisoning, often
                    proving rapidly fatal, suggested the probability of other channels for the
                    introduction of the disease.</p>
                <p>In 1880 the occurrence of several such cases among woolsorters at Bradford,
                    reported by Dr Bell of that town, led to an official inquiry by the Local
                    Government Board, and an elaborate investigation into the pathology of the
                    disease was at the same time conducted at the Brown Institution, London, by
                    Professor Greenfield.</p>
                <p>Among the results of this inquiry it was ascertained— (1) that the disease
                    appeared to be identical with that known by the name of splenic fever or anthrax
                    occurring among sheep and cattle; (2) that in the blood and tissues of the body
                    was found in abundance, as in the disease in animals, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bacillus</hi><hi rend="italic">anthracis,</hi> which is held to be the
                    infecting agent in communicating the malady; and (3) that the skins, hair, wool,
                    &lt;tc., of animals dying of splenic fever retain this infecting organism,
                    which, under certain conditions, finds ready access to the bodies of the
                    workers.</p>
                <p>Two well-marked forms of this disease are recognized, external anthrax and
                    internal anthrax. In external anthrax the infecting agent is accidentally
                    inoculated into some portion of skin, the seat of a slight abrasion, often the
                    hand, arm, or face. A minute swelling soon appears at the part, and develops
                    into a vesicle containing serum or bloody matter, and varying in size, but
                    seldom larger than a shilling. This vesicle speedily bursts, and leaves an
                    ulcerated or sloughing surface, round about which are numerous smaller vesicles
                    which undergo similar changes, and the whole affected part becomes hard and
                    tender, while the surrounding surface participates in the inflammatory action,
                    and the neighbouring lymphatic glands are also inflamed. This condition, termed
                    malignant pustule, is frequently accompanied with severe constitutional
                    disturbance, in the form of fever, delirium, perspirations, together with great
                    prostration and a tendency to death from septicaemia, although on the other hand
                    recovery is not uncommon. It was repeatedly found that the matter taken from the
                    vesicle during the progress of the disease, as well as the blood in the body
                    after death, contained the <hi rend="italic">bacillus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >anthracis,</hi> and when inoculated into small animals produced rapid death,
                    with all the symptoms and post-mortem appearances characteristic of splenic
                    fever.</p>
                <p>In internal anthrax there is no visible local manifestation of the disease, and
                    the infecting material appears to gain access to the system from the air charged
                    with it, as in rooms where the contaminated wool or hair is unpacked, or again
                    during the process of sorting. The symptoms usually observed are those of rapid
                    physical prostration, with a small pulse, somewhat lowered temperature (rarely
                    fever), and quickened breathing. Examination of the chest reveals inflammation
                    of the lungs and pleura. In some cases death takes place by collapse in less
                    than one day, while in others the fatal issue is postponed for three or four
                    days, and is preceded by symptoms of blood-poisoning, including rigors,
                    perspirations, extreme exhaustion, &amp;c. In some cases of internal anthrax the
                    symptoms are more intestinal than pulmonary, and consist in severe exhausting
                    diarrhoea, with vomiting and rapid sinking. Recovery from the internal variety,
                    although not unknown, is more rare than from the external, and its most striking
                    phenomena are its sudden onset in the midst of apparent health, the rapid
                    development of physical prostration, and its tendency to a fatal termination
                    despite treatment. The post-mortem appearances in internal anthrax are such as
                    are usually observed in septicaemia, but in addition evidence of extensive
                    inflammation of the lungs, pleura, and bronchial glands has in most ca es been
                    met with. The blood and other fluids and the diseased tissues are found loaded
                    with the <hi rend="italic">bacillus</hi><hi rend="italic">anthracis,</hi> and
                    inoculation experiments, such as those already referred to, produced similar
                    results.</p>
                <p>Treatment in this disease appears to be of but little avail, except as regards
                    the external form, where the malignant pustule may be dealt with early by strong
                    caustics to destroy the affected textures. For the relief of the general
                    constitutional symptoms, quinine, stimulants, and strong nourishment appear to
                    be the only available means. As preventive measures in woollen manufactories,
                    the disinfection of suspicious material, or the wetting of it before handling,
                    is recommended as lessening the risk to the workers.</p>
