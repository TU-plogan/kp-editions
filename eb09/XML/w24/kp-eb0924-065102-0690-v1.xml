                                >Higera</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Higere,</hi> and to this may
                            plausibly be traced “Hickwall,” now-a-days used in some parts of the
                            country, and the older “Hickway,” corrupted first into “Highhaw,” and,
                            after its original meaning was lost, into “Hewhole,” which in North
                            America has been still further corrupted into “Highhole” and more
                            recently into ‘ ‘ High-holder.” Another set of names includes “Whetile”
                            and “Woodwale,” which, different as they look, have a common derivation
                            perceptible in the intermediate form “Witwale.” The Anglo-Saxon <hi

                            identical in meaning with that commonly applied to
                        Woodpecker.</p><p/></note> More than 300 species of Woodpecker have been
                    described, and they have been very variously grouped by systematists; but all
                    admit that they form a very natural Family <hi rend="italic">Picidae,</hi> which
                    according to the view taken in this series of articles belongs to the Order <hi

                    them still higher as <hi rend="italic">Saurognathae.</hi> They are generally of
                    bright particoloured plumage, in which black, white, brown, olive, green,
                    yellow, orange, or scarlet—the last commonly visible on some part of the
                    head—mingled in varying proportions, and most often strongly contrasted with one
                    another, appear; while the less conspicuous markings take the form of bars,
                    spangles, tear-drops, arrow-heads, or scales. Woodpeckers inhabit most parts of
                    the world, with the exception of Madagascar and the Australian Region, save
                    Celebes and Flores; but it may be worth stating that no member of the group is
                    known to have occurred in Egypt.</p>
                <p>Of the three British species, the Green Woodpecker, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gecinus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Picus viridis,</hi> though almost unknown
                    in Scotland or Ireland, is the commonest, frequenting wooded districts, and more
                    often heard than seen, its laughing cry (whence the name “Yaffil” or “Yaffle,”
                    by which it is in many parts known), and undulating flight afford equally good
                    means of recognition, even when it is not near enough for its colours to be
                    discerned. About the size of a Jay, its scarlet crown and bright yellow rump,
                    added to its prevailing grass-green plumage, make it a sightly bird, and hence
                    it often suffers at the hands of those who wish to keep its stuffed skin as an
                    ornament. Besides the scarlet crown, the cock bird has a patch of the same
                    colour running backλvard from the base of <pb break="no"

                            or some more barbarously “moustachial,” Considering that moustaches
                            spring from above the mouth, and have nothing to do with the mandible or
                            lower jaw, no term could be more misleading.</p></note> Woodpeckers in
                    general are very shy birds, and to observe the habits of the species is not
                    easy. Its ways, however, are well worth watching, since the ease with which it
                    mounts, almost always spirally, the vertical trunks and oblique arms of trees as
                    it searches the interstices of the bark for its food, flying off when it reaches
                    the smaller or upper branches—either to return to the base of the same tree and
                    renew its course on a fresh line, or to begin upon another tree near by—and the
                    care it shews in its close examination, will repay a patient observer. The nest
                    almost always consists of a hole, chiselled by the birds’ strong beak, impelled
                    by very powerful muscles, in the upright trunk or arm of a tree, the opening
                    being quite circular, and continued as a horizontal passage that reaches to the
                    core, whence it is pierced downward for nearly a foot. There a chamber is
                    hollowed out in which the eggs, often to the number of six, white, translucent,
                    and glossy, are laid with no bedding but a few chips that may have not been
                    thrown out.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It often
                            happens that, just as the Woodpecker’s labours are over, a pair of <hi

                            take possession of the newly-bored hole, and, by conveying into it some
                            nesting-furniture, render it unfit for the rightful tenants, who thereby
                            suffer ejectment, and have to begin all their trouble again. It has been
                            stated of this and other Woodpeckers that the chips made in cutting the
                            hole are carefully removed by the birds to guard against their leading
                            to the discovery of the nest. The present writer has had ample
                            opportunity of observing the contrary as regards this species and, to
                            some extent, the Pied Woodpecker next to be mentioned. Indeed there is
                            no surer way of finding the nest of the Green Woodpecker than by
                            scanning the ground in the presumed locality, for the tree which holds
                            the nest is always recognizable by the chips scattered at its
                        foot.</p></note> The young are not only hatched entirely naked, but seem to
                    become fledged without any of the downy growth common to most birds. Their first
                    plumage is dull in colour, and much marked beneath with bars, crescents, and
                    arrowheads.</p>
                <p>Of generally similar habits are the two other Woodpeckers which inhabit
                    Britain—the Pied or Greater Spotted, and the Barred or Lesser Spotted
                    Woodpecker— <hi rend="italic">Bendrocopus major</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D.
                        minor—</hi> each of great beauty, from the contrasted white, blueblack, and
                    scarlet that enter into its plumage. Both of these birds have an extraordinary
                    habit of causing by quickly-repeated blows of their beak on a branch, or even on
                    a small bough, a vibrating noise, louder than that of a watchman’s rattle, and
                    enough to excite the attention of the most incurious. Though the Pied Woodpecker
                    is a resident in Britain, its numbers receive a considerable accession nearly
                    every autumn.</p>
                <p>The three species just mentioned are the only Woodpeckers that inhabit Britain,
                    though several others are mistakenly recorded as occurring in the country—and
                    especially the Great Black Woodpecker, the <hi rend="italic">Picus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">martius</hi> of Linnaeus, which must be regarded as the type
                    of that genus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                            climbed trees, not only Woodpeckers, but for the <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    Green Woodpecker in size, and except for its red cap is wholly black. It is
                    chiefly an inhabitant of the fir forests of the Old World, from Lapland to
                    Galicia, and across Siberia to Japan.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            this country is on record that will bear strict investigation, and the

                    generally known as the Logcock, an equally fine species, but variegated with

                    inhabit Canada and the United States there is here room to mention only a
                    few.</p>
                <p>First of these is the Californian Woodpecker, <hi rend="italic">Melanerpes
                        formicivorus,</hi> which has been said to display an amount of providence
                    beyond almost any other bird in the number of acorns which it collects and, as
                    shewn in the accompanying figure, fixes tightly in holes which it purposely
                    makes in the bark of trees, and thus “a large pine forty or fifty feet high will
                    present the appearance of being closely studded with brass nails, the heads only
                    being visible.” An extraordinary thing is that this is not done to furnish food
                    in winter, for the species migrates, and after journeying a thousand miles or
                    more only returns in spring to the forests where its supplies are laid up. It
                    has been asserted that the acorns thus stored are always those which contain a
                    maggot, and, being fitted into the sockets prepared for them cup-end foremost,
                    the enclosed insects are unable to escape, as they otherwise would, and are thus
                    ready for consumption by the birds on their return from the south. But this
                    statement has again been contradicted, and moreover it is alleged that these
                    Woodpeckers follow their instinct so blindly that “they do not distinguish
                    between an acorn and a pebble,” so that they “fill up the holes they have
                    drilled with so much labor, not only with acorns but occasionally with stones”
                    (c∕. Baird, Brewer, and Ridgway, <hi rend="italic">North American Birds,</hi>
                    ii. pp. 569-571).</p>
                <p>The next North-American form deserving notice is the genus <hi rend="italic"
                        >Colaptes,</hi> represented in the north and east by <hi rend="italic">C.
                        auratus,</hi> the Goldenwinged Woodpecker or Flicker, in most parts of the

                    characteristics by having the shafts of its quills red instead of yellow. It is
                    curious, however, that, in the valleys of the upper Missouri and Yellowstone
                    rivers, where the range of the two kinds overlaps, birds are found presenting an
                    extraordinary mixture of the otherwise distinctive features of each, and these
                    birds have been described as hybrids. It would be premature to say whether this
                    view be correct or not, and in regard to it Dr Coues has well remarked <hi
                        rend="italic">{Birds of the Northwest,</hi> p. 294), “that it is only in
                    virtue of missing links we are enabled to predicate species in any case,”
                    thereby indicating the possibility (not entertained for the first time) that
                    these supposed hybrids are examples of the more generalized form of <hi

                    will the desired end be reached, for Macgillivray, who furnished Audubon with
                    elaborate descriptions of parts of the structure of several North-American
                    forms, found considerable differences to exist between species which can hardly
                    be but nearly allied. Some of the most striking of these differences often lie
                    in the form and development of the hyoid bones, and of the muscles which work
                    the extensile tongue. Unhappily the subject does not seem to have been pursued
                    by any other investigator; but it may be mentioned that some limited researches
