                    about twelve years of age he was sent to the school of St Mary de Crypt,
                    Gloucester, where on account of his skill in elocution he was chosen to perform
                    in a piece acted before the corporation of the school. He also became very fond
                    of reading plays, a circumstance which probably had considerable influence on
                    his subsequent career, for his eloquence was essentially dramatic in its
                    character. At the age of fifteen he was taken from school to assist his mother
                    in the public-house, and for a year and a half was a common drawer. He then
                    again returned to school to prepare for the university, and in 1733 entered as a
                    servitor at Pembroke College, Oxford. There he came under the influence of the
                    Methodists (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Wesley),</hi> and entered so
                    enthusiastically into their practices and habits that he was attacked by a
                    severe illness, which compelled him to return to his native town. His sincere
                    and enthusiastic piety attracted the notice of Dr Benson, bishop of Gloucester,
                    who ordained him deacon on 20th June 1736. Having in the following week returned
                    to Oxford and taken his degree, he began an evangelizing tour in Bath, Bristol,
                    and other towns, his eloquence at once attracting immense multitudes. In 1736 he
                    was invited by Wesley to go out as a missionary to Georgia, and went to London
                    to wait on the trustees. Before setting sail he preached in some of the
                    principal London churches, and so rapidly did the fame of his eloquence spread
                    that crowds began to assemble at the church doors long before daybreak. Several
                    of the sermons which he then preached were published “at the request of the
                    hearers.” On 28th December 1737 he embarked for Georgia, which he reached on 7th
                    May 1738. After three months’ residence there he returned to England to receive
                    priest’s orders, and to raise contributions for the support of an orphanage. He
                    was, however, coldly received by the clergy generally, and began to preach in
                    the open air. At Bristol his addresses to the colliers soon attracted crowds,
                    which were latterly estimated to exceed 20,000 persons. Whitefield’s voice was
                    so powerful that it penetrated to the utmost limits of the crowd. His fervour
                    and dramatic action held them spell-bound, and his homely pathos soon broke down
                    all barriers of resistance. “The first discovery of their being affected,” he
                    says, “was by seeing the white gutters made by their tears, which plentifully
                    fell down their black cheeks.” In 1738 an account of Whitefield’s voyage from
                    London to Georgia was published without his knowledge. In 1739 he published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> from his arrival in Savannah to his return to
                    London, and also his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> from his arrival in London
                    to his departure thence on his way to Georgia. As his embarkation was further
                    delayed for ten weeks he published <hi rend="italic">A Continuation of the Rev.
                    Mr Whitefield's Journal during the time he was delayed in England by the
                    Embargo.</hi> His unfavourable reception in England by the clergy led him to
                    make reprisals. To Dr Trapp’s attack on the Methodists he published in 1739 <hi
                    rend="italic">A Preservative against Unsettled Notions,</hi> in which the clergy
                    of the Church of England were rather bitterly denounced; he also published
                    shortly afterwards <hi rend="italic">The Spirit and Doctrine and Lives of our
                    Modern Clergy,</hi> and a reply to a pastoral letter of the bishop of London in
                    which he had been attacked. In the same year appeared <hi rend="italic">Sermons
                    on Various Subjects</hi> (2 vols.), the <hi rend="italic">Church Companion, or
                    Sermons on Several Subjects,</hi> and a recommendatory epistle to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Thomas Halyburton.</hi> He again embarked for America in
                    August 1739, and remained there two years, preaching in all the principal towns.
                    While there he published <hi rend="italic">Three Letters from Mr
                    Whitefield,</hi> in which he referred to the “mystery of iniquity” in Tillotson,
                    and asserted that that divine knew no more of Christ than Mohammed did.</p>
                <p>During his absence from England Whitefield found that a divergence of doctrine
                    from Calvinism had been introduced by Wesley; and notwithstanding Wesley’s
                    exhortations to brotherly kindness and forbearance he withdrew from the Wesleyan
                    communion. Thereupon his friends built for him near Wesley’s church a wooden
                    structure, which was named the Tabernacle. In 1741, on the invitation of Ralph
                    and Ebenezer Erskine, he paid a visit to Scotland, commencing his labours in the
                    Secession meetinghouse, Dunfermline. But, as he refused to limit his
                    ministrations to one sect, the Seceders and he parted company, and without their
                    countenance he made a tour through the principal towns of Scotland, the
                    authorities of which in most instances presented him with the freedom of the
                    burgh, in token of their estimate of the benefits to the community resulting
                    from his preaching. From Scotland he went to Wales, where on 14th November he
                    married Mrs James, a widow. The marriage was not a happy one. On his return to
                    London he preached to the crowds in Moorfields during the Whitsun holidays with
                    such effect as to attract nearly all the people from the shows. After a second
                    visit to Scotland, June to October 1742, and a tour through England and Wales,
                    1742-44, he embarked in August 1744 for America, where he remained till June
                    1748. On his return to London he found his congregation at the Tabernacle
                    dispersed; and his circumstances were so depressed that he was obliged to sell
                    his household furniture to pay his orphan-house debts. Having, however, made the
                    acquaintance of the countess of Huntingdon, he soon found his pecuniary affairs
                    on a better footing. The countess appointed him one of her chaplains, built and
                    endowed Calvinistic Methodist chapels in various parts of the country, and
                    erected a college for the training of candidates for the ministry. The remainder
                    of Whitefield’s life was spent chiefly in evangelizing tours in Great Britain,
                    Ireland, and America. It has been stated that “in the compass of a single week,
                    and that for years, he spoke in general forty hours, and in very many sixty, and
                    that to thousands.” Ou his return from America to England for <pb break="no"

                    forcibly impressed Wesley, who wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> “He
                    seemed to be an old man, being fairly worn out in his Master’s service, though
                    he had hardly seen fifty years.” When health was failing him he placed himself
                    on what he called “short allowance,” preaching only once every week day and
                    thrice on Sunday. In 1769 he returned to America for the seventh and last time.
                    He was now affected by a severe asthmatic complaint; but to those who advised
                    him to take some rest, he answered, “I had rather <hi rend="italic">wear</hi>
                    out than <hi rend="italic">rust</hi> out.” He died on the 30th September 1770 at
                    Newbury, New England, where he had arrived on the previous evening with the
                    intention of preaching next day. In accordance with his own desire he was buried
                    before the pulpit in the Presbyterian church of the town where he died.</p>
                <p>Whitefield, says Lecky, “was chiefly a creature of impulse and emotion. He had
                    very little logical skill, no depth or range of knowlege, not much
                    self-restraint.” He possessed neither Wesley’s organizing power, nor his
                    personal authority and influence. His one talent was his gift of popular
                    oratory, the secret of which was his command of clear and direct English, his
                    remarkable elocutionary and dramatic skill, and his passionate fervour and
                    simple pathos. His printed works convey a totally inadequate idea of his
                    oratorical powers, and are all in fact below mediocrity. They appeared in a
                    collected form in 1771-72 in seven volumes, the last containing <hi
