                <p>A unit of length is the distance between two points defined by some natural or
                    artificial standard, or a multiple of that. For instance, in Britain the unit of
                    the yard is defined by the distance between two parallel lines on gold studs
                    sunk in a bar of bronze, when at 62° F., which bar is preserved in the Standards
                    Office. There are other units, such as the inch, foot, mile, &amp;c.; but, as
                    these are aliquot parts or multiples of the yard, there is no separate standard
                    provided for them. A unit is an abstract quantity, represented by a certain
                    standard, and more or less perfectly by copies of the standard.</p>
                <p>A unit of mass is the matter of a standard of mass, or a multiple of that. For
                    instance, in Britain the unit of the pound is defined by a piece of platinum
                    preserved in the Standards Office.</p>
                <p>A unit of weight is the attractive force exerted between a unit of mass and some
                    given body at a fixed distance,— this force being the weight of the unit in
                    relation to the given body, or any other body of equal mass.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The word weight has in common
                    use two meanings,—(1) the force exerted between the earth and a body, and (2) a
                    mass which is weighed against other bodies. In scientific use, however, weight
                    means only a property of matter by which it is most convenient to compare the
                    relative amounts of masses.</p></note> Usually the given body is the earth, and
                    the distance a radius of the earth. For instance, the unit of weight in Britain
                    is the attraction between the earth and the standard pound when that is placed
                    at sea-level at London, in a vacuum. For astronomical comparisons the unit of
                    mass is the sun, and a unit of weight is not needed.</p>
                <p>Standards of length are all defined on metal bars at present in civilized
                    countries. Various natural standards have been proposed, such as the length of
                    the polar diameter of the earth (inch), the circumference of the earth (metre)
                    in a given longitude, a pendulum vibrating in one second at a fixed distance
                    from the earth, a wave of light emitted by an incandescent gas, &amp;c. But the
                    difficulty of ascertaining the exact value of these lengths prevents any
                    material standard being based upon them with the amount of accuracy that actual
                    measurements, to be taken from the standard, require. A natural standard is
                    therefore only a matter of sentiment.</p>
                <p>Standards of length are of two types, the defining points being either at a
                    certain part of two parallel lines engraven in one plane (a line-standard), or
                    else points on two parallel surfaces, which can only be observed by contact (an
                    end-standard). The first type is always used for accurate purposes. Units of
                    surface are always directly related to standards of length, without any separate
                    standards. Volume is either determined by the lineal dimensions of a space or a
                    solid, or, for accurate purposes, by the mass of water contained in a volume at
                    a given temperature, which again is measured either by liquid measure, or, more
                    accurately, by weight. The standard of volume in Britain is a hollow cylinder of
                    bronze, with a plate glass cover, when at 62° (gallon), legally defined as
                    277⋅274 cubic inches, or containing 10 pounds of water at 62° F.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Comparisons.—</hi> Lengths nearly equal are compared accurately
                    by fixing two micrometer microscopes with their axes parallel, and at the
                    required distance apart, on a massive support which will not quickly vary with
                    temperature; then the two lengths to be compared, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    the standard yard and another, are alternately placed beneath the microscopes,
                    and their lengths observed several times. The error of a single observation in
                    the Standards Department is stated to be a 100,000th of an inch. For fractional
                    lengths a divided bar is required, the accuracy of which is ascertained by a
                    shorter measure, which can be compared with successive sections of the whole
                    length by micrometers. For ordinary purposes, where not less than⋅001 inch is to
                    be observed, measures may be placed in contact if one is divided on the edge,
                    and the comparison made with a magnifier. In large field-work the ends of a
                    measure are transferred vertically to the ground by a small transit instrument
                    or theodolite. End-measures between surfaces are read by means of a pair of
                    contact pieces bearing line marks, the value of which is ascertained separately,
                    or by a second end-measure; if both measures bear a line for observation,
                    reversals then give the value of each measure.</p>
                <p>Volumes are always most accurately defined by their weight of water, as weighing
                    can be more accurately done than measuring. If the volume is hollow, it may be
                    filled with water and closed with a sheet of plate glass, or if solid the body
                    may be weighed in water and out, the difference giving the weight of its volume
                    of water. Unfortunately the relation between water-weight and absolute volume is
                    not yet accurately known. Volumes of liquid are similarly ascertained by their
                    weight. Volumes of gas are measured in a graduated glass vessel inverted over a
                    liquid, or for commercial purposes by some form of registering flow-meter.</p>
                <p>Masses are compared by the <hi rend="smallcaps">Balance (</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >q.v.),</hi> which may be made to indicate a 100,000,000th of the mass. They may
                    also be estimated, not by their attractive force being balanced by an equal
                    mass, but by the elasticity of a spring; this, which is the only true
                    weighing-machine showing weight and not mass, is useful for rough purposes,
                    owing to its quick indication; the most accurate form probably is that with
                    angular readings.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    and the Atmosphere.—</hi> All the serious difficulties of weighing and measuring
                    result from these causes, the effects of which and their corrections we will
                    briefly notice. In measurement, since all bodies expand by heat, the temperature
                    at which any measure or standard bar represents the abstract unit requires to be
                    accurately stated and observed, the accuracy of optical observation being about
                    equal to <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi> of a
                    degree F. of expansion in a standard. Great accuracy is therefore needed in the
                    manufacture and reading of thermometers, and care that the standard and the
                    thermometer shall be at the same temperature. Another method is to attach a
                    parallel bar of very expansible metal to one end of the standard, and read its
                    length on the standard at the other end; this ensures a more thorough uniformity
                    of mean temperature between the standard and the heat-measurer. The most
                    accurate method is by immersing the measures in a liquid, of which the
                    temperature is read by several thermometers; but this is scarcely needful unless
                    high or low temperatures are required to ascertain the rate of expansion. A room
                    with thick walls, double windows, and the temperature regulated by a gas stove
                    is practically sufficiently equable for comparisons.</p>
                <p>The temperature adopted for the standards is not the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n504/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0504-0479"/> same in different countries. In Britain 62° F.
                    has been adopted since the revision of the standards in 1822, as being a
                    convenient average temperature for work; but, as it is purely a temperature of
                    convenience, the rather higher point of 68° F. would be better. In any case an
                    aliquot part of the thermal unit from freezing to boiling of water should be
                    adopted; 62° is ⅙ and 68° is ⅕ of this interval. Whether a much higher
                    temperature would not be more conducive to accuracy is a question; 92°, or ⅓ of
                    the thermal unit, would be so near the temperature of the observer’s skin and
                    breath that measures and balances could be approached with less production of
                    error; and such a heat does not at all hinder accurate observing. The French
                    temperature of 32° F. for standards has abandoned all other considerations in
                    favour of readily fixing the temperature in practice by melting ice. This is a
                    ready means of regulation, but a point so far from ordinary working temperatures
                    has two great disadvantages: the observer’s warmth produces more error, and the
                    corrections for all observations not iced are so large that the rates of
                    expansion require to be known very accurately for every substance employed. For
                    water their standard temperature is 39°⋅2 F., when it is at its maximum density;
                    this has the advantage that the density varies less with temperature than at any
                    other point, but it is very doubtful if this is much used for actual work.</p>
                <p>No substance expands uniformly with temperature, most materials expanding more
                    rapidly at higher temperatures. The expansion of rods of the following metals,
                    of 100 inches long, is given in decimals of an inch for the 90° from 32° to 122°
                    F. (0 to 50° C.), and from 122° to 212° F. (50° to 100° C.):<note

                <p>But variations of 3 or 4 per cent. may easily be found in the rates of different
                    specimens apparently alike; hence the individual expansion of every important
                    measure needs to be ascertained.</p>
                <p>Weighing is complicated by being done in a dense and variable atmosphere,
                    unless—as in the most refined work —the whole balance is placed in a vacuum.
                    When in the air all bodies placed in the balance must, for accurate purposes,
                    have their volume known; and the weight of an equal volume of such air as they
                    are weighed in must be added to their apparent weight to get their true weight.

                    Hence this reduction need rarely be noticed. The composition of the air also
                    varies, and most seriously in the amount of aqueous vapour; the above is
                    ordinary air, but if quite dry the 1⋅047 grains would become 1⋅052 grains; the

                <p><hi rend="italic">National Standards and Copies.—</hi> Having now noticed the
                    principles and constants involved, we will consider the British and metric
                    standards, the only ones now used in scientific work.</p>
                <p>The imperial standard yard is a bronze bar 38 inches long, 1 inch square; the
                    defining lines, 36 inches apart, are cut on gold studs, sunk in holes, so that
                    their surface passes through the axis of the bar. Thus flexure does not tend to
                    tip the engraved surfaces nearer or farther apart. This bar when in use rests on
                    a lever frame, which supports it at 8 points, 4⋅78 inches apart, on rollers
                    which divide the pressure exactly equally.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Chisholm, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> pp. 188, 189.
                    For less refined purposes measuring bars should be supported on two points, 21
                    per cent. of the whole length from the ends. This equalizes the strains in the
                    curves, and makes a minimum distortion.</p></note> This standard is in actual
                    use for all important comparisons at the Standards Office. Four copies, which
                    are all equal to it, within ⅙° of temperature, are deposited in other places in
                    case of injury or loss of the standard. The standard pound is a thick disk of
                    platinum about 1⅙ inches across, and 1 inch high, with a shallow groove around
                    it near the top. Four copies are deposited with the above copies of the yard.
                    For public use there are a series of end-standards exposed on the outer wall of
                    Greenwich observatory; and a length of 100 feet, and another of 66 feet (1
                    chain), marked on brass <pb break="no"

                    of Trafalgar Square. As this is a practically invariable earth-fast standard,
                    and most convenient for reference, it is important to know the minute errors of
                    it, as determined by the Standards Department.<note anchored="true"

                    the Standards, 1875.</p></note> Starting from 0 the errors are in inches—</p>
                <p>The mean uncertainty in these values is Ό03, and the greatest uncertainty⋅01. The
                    total length of the chain standard is - ⋅019 inch from the truth. There is also
                    a public balance provided at Greenwich observatory, which shows the accuracy of
                    any pound weight placed upon it. For important scientific standards comparisons
                    are made gratuitously, as a matter of courtesy, by the officials of the
                    Standards Office, 7 Old Palace Yard, Westminster. The most delicate weighings
                    are all performed in a vacuum case with glass sides, which is so constructed
                    that the weights can be exchanged from one arm to the other without opening the
                    case, so as to obtain double weighings.</p>
                <p>The toleration of error in copies for scientific purposes, by the Standards
                    Department, is ⋅0005 inch on the yard or lesser lengths, about equal to 15
                    divisions of the micrometer; on the pound ⋅0025 grain, about ½ a division of the
                    official balances; on the ounce ⋅001 grain; on the gallon 1 grain; and on the
                    cubic foot 4 grains. The toleration for commercial copies is ⋅005 on the yard,
                    ⋅001 on the foot and under, and Ί grain on weights of 1 ounce to 1 pound.<note

                <p>For practical work of moderate accuracy the most convenient forms of measures
                    are—for lengths under a foot, feather-edge metal scales divided to <hi

                    are only confusing, and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    1000</hi> of an inch can be safely read by estimation); for lengths of 1 to 10
                    feet, metal tubes or deep bars bearing line-divisions, and with permanent feet
                    attached at 21 per cent. from either end, so that the deformation by flexure is
                    always the same; for long distances a steel tape with fine divisions scratched
                    across it and numbered by etching. The most accurate way of using such a tape is
                    not to prepare a flat bed for it, but to support it at points not more than 50
                    feet apart; then by observing the distances and levels of these points, and
                    knowing the weight of the tape, the correction for the sloping distance between
                    the points and the difference of the catenary length of the tape from the
                    straight distance can be precisely calculated; the corrections for stretching of
                    the tape (best done by a lever arm with fixed weight), and for temperature, are
                    all that are needful besides.</p>
                <p>The first French standard metre (of 1799) is a platinum bar end-standard of about
                    1 inch wide and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi>
                    inch thick; the new standard of the International Metric Commission is a
                    line-standard of platino-iridium, 40 inches long and ⋅8 inches square, grooved
                    out on all four sides so that its section is between × and H form; this provides
                    the greatest rigidity, and also a surface in the axis of the bar to bear the
                    lines of the standard. The new standard kilogramme, like the old one, is a
                    cylinder of platinum of equal diameter and height. These new standards are
                    preserved in the International Metric Bureau at Paris, to which seventeen
                    nations contribute in support and direction, and in which the most refined
                    methods of comparison are adopted. For lineal comparisons the alternate
                    substitution of the measures on a sliding bed beneath fixed micrometer
                    microscopes is provided as in the British office, and a bath for the heating of
                    one measure in a liquid to ascertain its expansion. For weighing four balances
                    are provided, each with mechanism for the transposition of the weights, and the
                    lowering of the balance into play on its bearings, so that weighings can be
                    performed at 13 feet distance from the balance, thus avoiding the disturbance
                    caused by the warmth of the observer. The readings of the balance scale are made
                    by a fixed telescope, the motion being observed by the reflexion of a fixed
                    scale from a mirror attached to the beam of the balance. In this bureau are also
                    an equally fine hydrostatic balance for taking specific gravities by water
                    weighing, a standard barometer, and an air thermometer, with all subsidiary
                    apparatus. The special work of the bureau is the construction and comparison of
                    metric standards for all the countries supporting it, and for scientific work of
                    all kinds.</p>
                <p>The legal theory of the British system of weights and measures is—(A) the
                    standard yard, with all lineal measures and their squares and cubes based upon
                    that; (B) the standard pound of 7000 grains, with all weights based upon that,
                    with the troy pound of 5760 grains for trade purposes; (C) the standard gallon
                    (and multiples and fractions of it), declared to contain 10 lb of water at 62°
                    F., being in volume 277⋅274 cubic inches, which contain each 252⋅724 grains of
                    water in a vacuum at 62°, or 252⋅458 grains of water weighed with brass weights
                    in air of 62° with the barometer at 30 inches.</p>
                <p>The legal theory of the metric system of weights and measures is—(A) the standard
                    metre, with decimal fractions and multiples thereof; (B) the standard
                    kilogramme, with decimal fractions and multiples thereof; (C) the litre (with
                    decimal fractions and multiples), declared to be a cube of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> metre, and to contain
                    a kilogramme of water at 4° C. in a vacuum. No standard litre exists, all liquid
                    measures being legally fixed by weight. The metre was supposed, when established
                    in 1799, to be a ten-millionth of the quadrant of the earth through Paris; it
                    differs from this theoretical amount by about 1 in 4000.</p>
                <p>The legal equivalents between the British and French systems are—metre = 39⋅37079
                    inches; kilogramme = 15432⋅34874 grains. By the more exact comparisons of
                    Captain Clarke (1866) the metre (at 0° C., 32° F.) is equal to 39⋅37043196
                    inches of the yard at 62° F.; but Rogers in 1882 compared the metre as 39⋅37027.
                    It must always be remembered that a French metre of perfect legal exactitude
                    will, by expanding from 32° to 62° F., become equal to a greater number of
                    inches when the two measures are placed together; thus a brass metre is equal to
                    39⋅382 inches when compared with British measures at the same temperature, and
                    this is its true commercial equivalent. The kilogramme determination above is
                    that of Professor Miller (1844), against the kilogramme des Archives, but in
                    1884 the international kilogramme yielded 15432⋅35639.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0506-0481"/> measure is mostly guess-work. Hence, except in a
                    few cases, we shall not here consider any units of the Middle Ages. A constant
                    difficulty in studying works on metrology is the need of distinguishing the
                    absolute facts of the case from the web of theory into which each writer has
                    woven them,—often the names used, and sometimes the very existence of the units
                    in question, being entirely an assumption of the writer. Therefore we shall here
                    take the more pains to show what the actual authority is for each conclusion.
                    Again, each writer has his own leaning: Böckh, to the study of water-volumes and
                    weights, even deriving linear measures therefrom; Queipo, to the connexion with
                    Arabic and Spanish measures; Brandis, to the basis of Assyrian standards;
                    Mommsen, to coin weights; and Bortolotti to Egyptian units; but Hultsch is more
                    general, and appears to give a more equal representation of all sides than do
                    other authors. In this article the tendency will be to trust far more to actual
                    measures and weights than to the statements of ancient writers; and this
                    position seems to be justified by the great increase in materials, and the more
                    accurate means of study of late. The usual arrangement by countries has been
                    mainly abandoned in favour of following out each unit as a whole, without
                    recurring to it separately for every locality.</p>
                <p>The materials for study are of three kinds. (1) <hi rend="italic">Literary,</hi>
                    both in direct statements in works on measures (<hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    Elias of Nisibis), medicine (Galen), and cosmetics (Cleopatra), in
                    ready-reckoners (Didymus), clerk’s (kátíb’s) guides, and like handbooks, and in
                    indirect explanations of the equivalents of measures mentioned by authors (<hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Josephus). But all such sources are liable to the most
                    confounding errors, and some passages relied on have in any case to submit to
                    conjectural emendation. These authors are of great value for connecting the
                    monumental information, but must yield more and more to the increasing evidence
                    of actual weights and measures. Besides this, all their evidence is but
                    approximate, often only stating quantities to a half or quarter of the amount,
                    and seldom nearer than 5 or 10 per cent.; hence they are entirely worthless for
                    all the closer questions of the approximation or original identity of standards
                    in different countries; and it is just in this line that the imagination of
                    writers has led them into the greatest speculations, unchecked by accurate
                    evidence of the original standards. (2) <hi rend="italic">Weights and measures
                    actually remaining.</hi> These are the prime sources, and, as they increase and
                    are more fully studied, so the subject will be cleared and obtain a fixed basis.
                    A difficulty has been in the paucity of examples, more due to the neglect of
                    collectors than the rarity of specimens. The number of published weights did not
                    exceed 600 of all standards a short time ago; but the collections in the last
                    three years from Naucratis (28),<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>These figures reter to the list of publications at the end
                    of the present section, p. 489.</p></note> Defenneh (29), and Memphis (44) have
                    supplied over six times this quantity, and of an earlier age than most other
                    examples, while existing collections have been more thoroughly examined; hence
                    there is need for a general revision of the whole subject. It is above all
                    desirable to make allowances for the changes which weights have undergone; and,
                    as this has only been done for the above Egyptian collections and that of the
                    British Museum, conclusions as to the accurate values of different standards
                    will here be drawn from these rather than Continental sources. (3) <hi
                    rend="italic">Objects which have been made by measure or weight,</hi> and from
                    which the unit of construction can be deduced. Buildings will generally yield up

                    Metrology,</hi> p. 9). Vases may also be found bearing such relations to one
                    another as to show their unit of volume. And coins have long been recognized as
                    one of the great sources of metrology,—valuable for their wide and detailed
                    range of information, though most unsatisfactory on account of the constant
                    temptation to diminish their weight, a weakness which seldom allows us to reckon
                    them as of the full standard. Another defect in the evidence of coins is that,
                    when one variety of the unit of weight was once fixed on for the coinage, there
                    was (barring the depreciation) no departure from it, because of the need of a
                    fixed value, and hence coins do not show the range and character of the real
                    variations of units as do buildings, or vases, or the actual commercial
                    weights.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Principles of Study.</hi> —(1) <hi rend="italic">Limits of
                    Variation in Different Copies, Places, and Times.—</hi> Unfortunately, so very
                    little is known of the ages of weights and measures that this datum—most
                    essential in considering their history—has been scarcely considered. In measure,
                    Egyptians of Dynasty IV. at Gizeh on an average varied 1 in 350 between
                    different buildings (27). Buildings at Persepolis, all of nearly the same age,
                    vary in unit 1 in 450 (25). Including a greater range of time and place, the
                    Roman foot in Italy varied during two or three centuries on an average <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 400</hi> from the mean.
                    Covering a longer time, we find an average variation of <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 200</hi> in the Attic foot (25), <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 150</hi> in the English foot
                    (25), <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 170</hi> in the
                    English itinerary foot (25). So we may say that an average variation of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 400</hi> by toleration,
                    extending to double that by change of place and time, is usual in ancient
                    measures. In weights of the same place and age there is a far wider range; at
                    Defenneh (29), within a century probably, the average variation of different
                    units is <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 36</hi>, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 60</hi>, and <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 67</hi>, the range being just
                    the same as in all times and places taken together. Even in a set of weights all
                    found together, the average variation is only reduced to <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 60</hi> in place of <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 36</hi> (29). Taking a wider range of place and
                    time, the Roman libra has an average variation of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    / <hi rend="subscript"> 50</hi> in the examples of better period (43), and in
                    those of Byzantine age <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    35</hi> (44)∙ Altogether, we see that weights have descended from original
                    varieties with so little intercomparison that no rectification of their values
                    has been made, and hence there is as much variety in any one place and time as
                    in all together. Average variation may be said to range from <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 40</hi> to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 70</hi> in different units,
                    doubtless greatly due to defective balances.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Rate of Variation.—</hi> Though large differences may exist,
                    the rate of general variation is but slow,—excluding, of course, all monetary
                    standards. In Egypt the cubit lengthened <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 170</hi> in some thousands of years (25, 44). The Italian mile
                    has lengthened <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi>
                    since Roman times (2); the English mile lengthened about <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 300</hi> in four centuries (31). The English foot
                    has not appreciably varied in several centuries (25). Of weights there are
                    scarce any dated, excepting coins, which nearly all decrease; the Attic
                    tetradrachm, however, increased <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 50</hi> in three centuries (28), owing probably to its being
                    below the average trade weight to begin with. Roughly dividing the Roman
                    weights, there appears a decrease of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 40</hi> from imperial to Byzantine times (43).</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Tendency of Variation.—</hi> This is, in the above cases of
                    lengths, to an increase in course of time. The Roman foot is also probably <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 300</hi> larger than the
                    earlier form of it, and the later form in Britain and Africa perhaps another <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 300</hi> larger (25).
                    Probably measures tend to increase and weights to decrease in transmission from
                    time to time or place to place; but far more data are needed to study this.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Details of Variation.—</hi> Having noticed variation in the
                    gross, we must next observe its details. The only way of examining these is by
                    drawing curves (28, 29), representing the frequency of occurrence of all the
                    variations of a unit; for instance, in the Egyptian unit—the kat— counting in a
                    large number how many occur between 140 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n507/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0507-0482"/> and 141 grains, 141 and 142, and so on; such
                    numbers represented by curves show at once where any particular varieties of the
                    unit lie (see <hi rend="italic">Naukratis,</hi> i. p. 83). This method is only
                    applicable where there is a large number of examples; but there is no other way
                    of studying the details. The results from such a study—of the Egyptian kat, for
                    example—show that there are several distinct families or types of a unit, which
                    originated in early times, have been perpetuated by copying, and reappear alike
                    in each locality (see <hi rend="italic">Tanis,</hi> ii. pl. 1.). Hence we see
                    that if one unit is derived from another it may be possible, by the similarity
                    or difference of the forms of the curves, to discern whether it was derived by
                    general consent and recognition from a standard in the same condition of
                    distribution as that in which we know it, or whether it was derived from it in
                    earlier times before it became so varied, or by some one action forming it from
                    an individual example of the other standard without any variation being
                    transmitted. As our knowledge of the age and locality of weights increases these
                    criteria in curves will prove of greater value; but even now no consideration of
                    the connexion of different units should be made without a graphic representation
                    to compare their relative extent and nature of variation.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Transfer of Units.—</hi> The transfer of units from one
                    people to another takes place almost always by trade. Hence the value of such
                    evidence in pointing out the ancient course of trade, and commercial connexions
                    (17). The great spread of the Phoenician weight on the Mediterranean, of the
                    Persian in Asia Minor, and of the Assyrian in Egypt are evident cases; and that
                    the decimal weights of the laws of Manu (43) are decidedly not Assyrian or
                    Persian, but on exactly the Phoenician standard, is a curious evidence of trade
                    by water and not overland. If, as seems probable, units of length may be traced
                    in prehistoric remains, they are of great value; at Stonehenge, for instance,
                    the earlier parts are laid out by the Phoenician foot, and the later by the
                    Pelasgo-Roman foot (26). The earlier foot is continually to be traced in other
                    megalithic remains, whereas the later very seldom occurs (25). This bears
                    strongly on the Phoenician origin of our prehistoric civilization. Again, the
                    Belgic foot of the Tungri is the basis of the present English land measures,
                    which we thus see are neither Roman nor British in origin, but Belgic. Generally
                    a unit is transferred from a higher to a less civilized people; but the near
                    resemblance of measures in different countries should always be corroborated by
                    historical considerations of a probable connexion by commerce or origin (Head,
                    <hi rend="italic">Historia Humorum,</hi> xxxvii.). It should be borne in mind
                    that in early times the larger values, such as minae, would be transmitted by
                    commerce, while after the introduction of coinage the lesser values of shekels
                    and drachmae would be the units; and this needs notice, because usually a
                    borrowed unit was multiplied or divided according to the ideas of the borrowers,
                    and strange modifications thus arose.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Connexions of Lengths, Volumes, and Weights.—</hi> This is
                    the most difficult branch of metrology, owing to the variety of connexions which
                    can be suggested, to the vague information we have, especially on volumes, and
                    to the liability of writers to rationalize connexions which were never intended.
                    To illustrate how easy it is to go astray in this line, observe the continual
                    reference in modern handbooks to the cubic foot as 1000 ounces of water; also
                    the cubic inch is very nearly 250 grains, while the gallon has actually been
                    fixed at 10 ft) of water; the first two are certainly mere coincidences, as may
                    very probably be the last also, and yet they offer quite as tempting a base for
                    theorizing as any connexions in ancient metrology. No such theories can be
                    counted as more than coincidences which have been adopted, unless we find a very
                    exact connexion, or some positive statement of origination. The idea of
                    connecting volume and weight has received an immense impetus through the metric
                    system, but it is not very prominent in ancient times. The Egyptians report the
                    weight of a measure of various articles, amongst others water (6), but lay no
                    special stress on it; and the fact that there is no measure of water equal to a
                    direct decimal multiple of the weight-unit, except very high in the scale, does
                    not seem as if the volume was directly based upon weight. Again, there are many
                    theories of the equivalence of different cubic cubits of water with various
                    multiples of talents (2, 3, 18, 24, 33); but connexion by lesser units would be
                    far more probable, as the primary use of weights is not to weigh large cubical
                    vessels of liquid, but rather small portions of precious metals. The Roman
                    amphora being equal to the cubic foot, and containing 80 librae of water, is one
                    of the strongest cases of such relations, being often mentioned by ancient
                    writers. Yet it appears to be only an approximate relation, and therefore
                    probably accidental, as the volume by the examples is too large to agree to the
                    cube of the length or to the weight, differing <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 20</hi> or sometimes even <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi>. All that can be said therefore to the many
                    theories connecting weight and measure is that they are possible, but our
                    knowledge at present does not admit of proving or disproving their exactitude.
                    Certainly vastly more evidence is needed before we would, with Böckh (2), derive
                    fundamental measures through the intermediary of the cube roots of volumes.
                    Soutzo wisely remarks on the intrinsic improbability of refined relations of
                    this kind (<hi rend="italic">Étalons Ponderaux Primitifs,</hi> note, p. 4).</p>
                <p>Another idea which has haunted the older metrologists, but is still less likely,
                    is the connexion of various measures with degrees on the earth’s surface. The
                    lameness of the Greeks in angular measurement would alone show that they could
                    not derive itinerary measures from long and accurately determined distances on
                    the earth.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Connexions with Coinage.—</hi> From the 7th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> onward, the relations of units of weight have been
                    complicated by the need of the interrelations of gold, silver, and copper
                    coinage; and various standards have been derived theoretically from others
                    through the weight of one metal equal in value to a unit of another. That this
                    mode of originating standards was greatly promoted, if not started, by the use
                    of coinage we may see by the rarity of the Persian silver weight (derived from
                    the Assyrian standard), soon after the introduction of coinage, as shown in the
                    weights of Defenneh (29). The relative value of gold and silver (17, 21) in Asia
                    is agreed generally to have been 13 ⅓ to 1 in the early ages of coinage; at
                    Athens in 434 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> it was 14: 1; in Macedon, 350 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> 12½: 1; in Sicily, 400 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> 15: 1, and 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> 12:1; in Italy, in
                    1st century, it was 12:1, in the later empire 13⋅9: 1, under Justinian 14⋅4: 1,
                    and in modern times 15⋅5: 1, but at present 23: 1,—the fluctuations depending
                    mainly on the opening of large mines. Silver stood to copper in Egypt as 80: 1
                    (Brugsch), or 120: 1 (Revillout); in early Italy and Sicily as 250: 1 (Mommsen),
                    or 120: 1 (Soutzo), under the empire 120: 1, under Justinian 100: 1; at present
                    it is 150: 1. The distinction of the use of standards for trade in general, or
                    for silver or gold in particular, should be noted. The early observance of the
                    relative values may be inferred from Num. vii. 13, 14, where silver offerings
                    are 13 and 7 times the weight of the gold, or of equal value and one-half
                    value.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Legal Regulation of Measures.—</hi> Most states have
                    preserved official standards, usually in temples under priestly custody. The

                <p>is familiar; the standard volume of the apet was secured in the dromus of Anubis
                    at Memphis (35); in Athens, besides the standard weight, twelve copies for
                    public comparison were kept in the city; also standard volume measures in
                    several places (2); at Pompeii the block with standard volumes cut in it was
                    found in the portico of the forum (33); other such standards are known in Greek
                    cities (Gythium, Panidum, and Trajanopolis) (11, 33); at Rome the standards were
                    kept in the Capitol, and weights also in the temple of Hercules (2); the
                    standard cubit of the Nilometer was before Constantine in the Serapaeum, but was
                    removed by him to the church (2). In England the Saxon standards were kept at
                    Winchester before 950 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and copies were legally
                    compared and stamped; the Normans removed them to Westminster to the custody of
                    the king’s chamberlains at the exchequer; and they were preserved in the crypt
                    of Edward the Confessor, while remaining royal property (9). The oldest English
                    standards remaining are those of Henry VII. Many weights have been found in the
                    temenos of Demeter at Cnidus, the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, and in a temple
                    of Aphrodite at Byblus (44); and the making or sale of weights may have been a
                    business of the custodians of the temple standards.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Hames of Units.—</hi> It is needful to observe that most
                    names of measures are generic and not specific, and cover a great variety of
                    units. Thus foot, digit, palm, cubit, stadium, mile, talent, mina, stater,
                    drachm, obol, pound, ounce, grain, metretes, medimnus, modius, hin, and many
                    others mean nothing exact unless qualified by the name of their country or city.
                    Also, it should be noted that some ethnic qualifications have been applied to
                    different systems, and such names as Babylonian and Euboic are ambiguous; the
                    normal value of a standard will therefore be used here rather than its name, in
                    order to avoid confusion, unless specific names exist, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >kat</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uten.</hi></p>
                <p>All quantities stated in this article without distinguishing names are in British

                    derived from one of two great systems, that of the cubit of 20⋅63 inches, or the
                    digit of ⋅729 inch; and both these systems are found in the earliest
                    remains.</p>
                <p>20∙63 ins.—First known in Dynasty IV. in Egypt, most accurately 20⋅620 in the
                    Great Pyramid, varying 20⋅51 to 20⋅71 in Dyn. IV. to VI. (27). Divided decimally
                    in 100ths; but usually marked in Egypt into 7 palms or 28 digits, approximately;
                    a mere juxtaposition (for convenience) of two incommensurate systems (25, 27).
                    The average of several cubit rods remaining is 20⋅65, age in general about 1000

                    the Kilometers (44). This unit is also recorded by cubit lengths scratched on a
                    tomb at Beni Hasan (44), and by dimensions of the tomb of Ramessu IV. and of
                    Edfu temple (5) in papyri. From this cubit, <hi rend="italic">mαhi,</hi> was

                    and Laodicea 20⋅94. Ten buildings in all give 20⋅63 mean (18, 25); but in
                    Armenia it rose to 20⋅76 in late Roman times, like the late rise in Egypt (25).
                    It was specially divided into ⅕th, the foot of ⅗ths being as important as the

                    the sexary system applied to the early decimal division of the cubit. In Greece
                    it is the most usual unit, occurring in the Propylaea at Athens 12∙44, temple at

                    inches, which shows the existence of such a measure (33). It became prominent
                    when adopted by Philetaerus about 280 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> as the
                    standard of Pergamum (42), and probably it had been shortly before adopted by
                    the Ptolemies for Egypt. From that time it is one of the principal units in the
                    literature (Didymus, &amp;c.), and is said to occur in the temple of Augustus at
                    Pergamum as 13∙8 (18). Fixed by the Romans at 16 digits (13⅓ = Roman foot), or
                    its cubit at 1⅘ Roman feet, it was legally = 13∙94 at 123 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> (42); and 7½ Philetaerean stadia were = Roman mile (18). The
                    multiples of the 20∙63 cubit are in late times generally reckoned in these feet
                    of ⅔ cubit. The name “Babylonian foot” used by Böckh (2) is only a theory of
                    his, from which to derive volumes and weights; and no evidence for this name, or
                    connexion with Babylon, is to be found. Much has been written (2, 3, 33) on
                    supposed cubits of about 17-18 inches derived from 20∙63,—mainly, in
                    endeavouring to get a basis for the Greek and Roman feet, but these are really
                    connected with the digit system; and the monumental or literary evidence for

                    as 17∙25</p>
                <p>or ⅚ of 20∙70. On the Egyptian cubits a small cubit is marked as about 17 inches,
                    which may well be this unit, as ⅚ of 20∙6 is 17∙2; and, as these marks are
                    placed <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the 23rd digit or 17∙0, they cannot refer
                    to 6 palms, or 17∙7, which is the 24th digit, though they are usually attributed
                    to that (33).</p>
                <p>We now turn to the second great family based on the digit. This has been so
                    usually confounded with the 20∙63 family, owing to the juxtaposition of 28
                    digits with that cubit in Egypt, that it should be observed how the difficulty
                    of their incommensurability has been felt. For instance, Lepsius (3) supposed
                    two primitive cubits of 13∙2 and 20∙63, to account for 28 digits being only 20∙4
                    when free from the cubit of 20 ∙63,—the first 24 digits being in some cases made
                    shorter on the cubits to agree with the true digit standard, while the remaining
                    4 are lengthened to fill up to 20 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6. In the ∙727
                    ins Dynasties IV. and V. in Egypt the digit is found in tomb sculptures as ∙727
                    (27); while from a dozen examples in the later remains we find the mean ∙728
                    (25). A length of 10 digits is marked on all the inscribed Egyptian cubits as
                    the “lesser span” (33). In Assyria the same digit appears as ∙730, particularly
                    at Nimrud (25); and in Persia buildings show the 10-digit length of 7∙34 (25).
                    In Syria it was about ∙728, but variable; in eastern Asia Minor more like the
                    Persian, being ∙732 (25). In these cases the digit itself, or decimal multiples,
                    seem to have been used.</p>
                <p>18∙23 The pre-Greek examples of this cubit in Egypt, men- ∩ <hi rend="subscript">
                    f</hi>- ∙79α tioned by Böckh (2), give 18∙23 as a mean, which is</p>
                <p>“25 digits of ∙729, and has no relation to the 20∙63 cubit. This cubit, or one
                    nearly equal, was used in Judaea in the times of the kings, as the Siloam
                    inscription names a distance of 1758 feet as roundly 1200 cubits, showing a
                    cubit of about 17∙6 inches. This is also evidently the Olympic cubit; and, in
                    pursuance of the decimal multiple of the digit found in Egypt and Persia, the
                    cubit of 25 digits was ¼ of the orguia of 100 digits, the series being old
                    digit, <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> ∑ I orguia, 10=arnrna, 10=stadion.</p>
                <p>•729 inch 18*2 ’ 72'9 √729 7296</p>
                <p>Then, taking ⅔ of the cubit, or ⅙ of the orguia, as a foot, the Greeks arrived at
                    their foot of 12∙14; this, though very well known in literature, is but rarely
                    found, and then generally in the form of the cubit, in monumental measures. The
                    Parthenon step, celebrated as 100 feet wide, and apparently 225 feet long, gives
                    by Stuart 12Ί37, by Penrose 12∙165, by Paccard 12∙148, differences due to scale
                    and not to slips in measuring. Probably 12∙16 is the nearest value. There are
                    but few buildings wrought on this foot in Asia Minor, Greece, or Roman remains.
                    The Greek system, however, adopted this foot as a basis for decimal
                    multiplication, forming foot, 10=acaena, 10=plethron, 12∙16 inches 121∙6
                    1216</p>
                <p>which stand as ⅙th of the other decimal series based on the digit. This is the
                    agrarian system, in contrast to the orguia system, which was the itinerary
                    series (33).</p>
                <p>Then a further modification took place, to avoid the inconvenience of dividing
                    the foot in 16 ⅔ digits, and a new digit was formed —longer than any value of
                    the old digit—of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 16</hi>

                    Egypt, and from the ∙729 digit being the decimal base of the Greek long
                    measures—it is not surprising to find it in use in Italy as a digit, and
                    multiplied by 16 as a foot. The more so, as the half of this foot, or 8 digits,
                    is marked off as a measure on the Egyptian cubit rods (33). Though Queipo has
                    opposed this connexion (not noticing the Greek link of the digit), he agrees
                    that it is supported by the Egyptian square measure of the plethron, being equal
                    to the Roman actus (33). The foot of 11∙6 appears probably first in the
                    prehistoric and early Greek remains, and is certainly found in Etrurian tomb
                    dimensions as 11∙59 (25). Dorpfeld considers this as the Attic foot, and states
                    the foot of the Greek metrological relief at Oxford as 11∙65 (or 11∙61,
                    Hultsch). Hence we see that it probably passed from the East through Greece to
                    Etruria, and thence became the standard foot of Rome; there, though divided by
                    the Italian duodecimal system into 12 unciae, it always maintained its original
                    16 digits, which are found marked on some of the foot-measures. The well-known
                    ratio of 25: 24 between the 12∙16 foot and this we see to have arisen through
                    one being ⅙ of 100 and the other 16 digits,—16⅔: 16 being as 25: 24, the legal
                    ratio. The mean of a dozen foot-measures (1) gives 11∙616± ∙008, and of long
                    lengths and buildings 11∙607± ∙01. In Britain and Africa, however, the Romans
                    used a rather longer form (25) of about 11∙68, or a digit of ∙730. Their series
                    of measures was digitus, 4=palmus, 4=pes. 5=passus, 125=stadium, 8=milliare;</p>

                <p>Either from its Pelasgic or Etrurian use or from Romans, this foot appears to
                    have come into prehistoric remains, as the circle of Stonehenge (26) is 100 feet
                    of 11∙68 across, and the same is found in one or two other cases. 11∙60 also
                    appears as the foot of some mediaeval English buildings (25).</p>
                <p>We now pass to units between which we cannot state any connexion.</p>
                <p>25 Ί. —The earliest sign of this cubit is in a chamber at Abydos (44) about 1400
                    B.c.; there, below the sculptures, the plain wall is marked out by red designing
                    lines in spaces of 25∙13± ∙03 inches, which have no relation to the size of the
                    chamber or to the sculpture. They must therefore have been marked by a workman
                    using a cubit of 25∙13. Apart from mediaeval and other very uncertain data, such
                    as the Sabbath day’s journey being 2000 middling paces for 2000 cubits, it
                    appears that Josephus, using the Greek or Roman cubit, gives half as many more
                    to each dimension of the temple than does the Talmud; this shows the cubit used
                    in the Talmud for temple measures to be certainly not under 25 inches. Evidence
                    of the early period is given, moreover, by the statement in 1 Kings (vii. 26)
                    that the brazen sea held 2000 baths; the bath being about 2300 cubic inches,
                    this would show a cubit of 25 inches. The corrupt text in Chronicles of 3000
                    baths would need a still longer cubit; and, if a lesser cubit of 21∙6 or 18
                    inches be taken, the result for the size of the bath would be impossibly small.
                    For other Jewish cubits see 18∙2 and 21∙6. Oppert (24) concludes from
                    inscriptions that there was in Assyria a royal cubit of <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> the U cubit, or 25∙20; and four monuments
                    show (25) a cubit averaging 25∙28. For Persia Queipo (33) relies on, and
                    develops, an Arab statement that the Arab <hi rend="italic">hashama</hi> cubit
                    was the royal Persian, thus fixing it at about 25 inches; and the Persian guerze
                    at present is 25, the royal guerze being 1½ times this, or 37½ inches. As a unit
                    of 1∙013, decimally multiplied, is most commonly to be deduced from the ancient
                    Persian buildings, we may take 25∙34 as the nearest approach to the ancient
                    Persian unit.</p>
                <p>21∙6.—The circuit of the city wall of Khorsabad (24) is minutely stated on a
                    tablet as 24,740 feet (U), and from the actual size the U is therefore 10∙806
                    inches. Hence the recorded series of measures on the Senkereh tablet are valued
                    (Oppert) as—</p>

                <p>Other units are the suklum or ½U = 5∙4, and cubit of 2U = 21∙6, which are not
                    named in this tablet. In Persia (24) the series on the same base was—</p>
                <p>vitasti, 2=arasni 360=asparasa, 30=parathañha, 2 = gāv;</p>

                <p>probably yava, 6=angusta, 10=vitasti; and gama = ⅗ arasni; also bāzu=2 arasni.
                    •18 inch 1Ό7 10∙7 12∙8 21∙4 42∙8 21∙4</p>
                <p>The values here given are from some Persian buildings (25), which indicate 21∙4,
                    or slightly less; Oppert’s value, on less certain data, is 21 ∙52. The Egyptian
                    cubits have an arm at 15 digits or about 10∙9 marked on them, which seems like
                    this same unit (33).</p>
                <p>This cubit was also much used by the Jews (33), and is so often referred to that
                    it has eclipsed the 25∙1 cubit in most writers. The Gemara names 3 Jewish cubits
                    (2) of 5, 6, and 7 palms; and, as Oppert (24) shows that 25∙2 was reckoned 7
                    palms, 21 ’ 6 being 6 palms, we may reasonably apply this scale to the Gemara
                    list, and read it as 18, 21∙6, and 25 ’ 2 inches. There is also a great amount
                    of mediaeval and other data showing this cubit of 21∙6 to have been familiar to
                    the Jews after their captivity; but there is no evidence for its earlier date,
                    as there is for the 25-inch cubit (from the brazen sea) and for the 18-inch
                    cubit from the Siloam inscription.</p>
                <p>From Assyria also it passed into Asia Minor, being found on the city standard of
                    Ushak in Phrygia (33), engraved as 21∙8, divided into the Assyrian foot of 10∙8,
                    and half and quarter, 5∙4 and 27. Apparently the same unit is found (18) at
                    Heraclea in Lucania, 21∙86; and, as the general foot of the South Italians, or
                    Oscan foot (18), best defined by the 100 feet square being <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> of the jugerum, and
                    therefore = 10∙80 or half of 21∙60. A cubit of 21∙5 seems certainly to be
                    indicated in prehistoric remains in Britain, and also in early Christian
                    buildings in Ireland (25).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">22∙2.—</hi> Another unit not far different, but yet distinct,
                    is found apparently in Punic remains at Carthage (25), about 11∙16 (22∙32), and
                    probably also in Sardinia as 11∙07 (22∙14), where it would naturally be of Punic
                    origin. In the Hauran 22∙16 is shown by a basalt door (British Museum), and
                    perhaps elsewhere in Syria (25). It is of some value to trace this measure,
                    since it is indicated by some prehistoric English remains as 22∙4.</p>
                <p>20 ’ 0.—This unit may be that of the pre-Semitic Mesopotamians, as it is found at
                    the early temple of Mukayyir (Ur); and, with a few other cases (25), it averages
                    19∙97. It is described by Oppert (24), from literary sources, as the great U of
                    222 susi or 39∙96, double of 19∙98; from which was formed a reed of 4 great U or
                    159∙8. The same measure decimally divided is also indicated by buildings in Asia
                    Minor and Syria (25).</p>
                <p>19.2. —In Persia some buildings at Persepolis and other places (25) are
                    constructed on a foot of 9∙6, or cubit of 19∙2; while the modern Persian arish
                    is 38∙27 or 2×19∙13. The same is found very clearly in Asia Minor (25),
                    averaging 19 ∙3; and it is known in literature as the Pythic foot (18, 33) of
                    9∙75, or ½ of 19∙5, if Censorinus is rightly understood. It may be shown by a
                    mark (33) on the 26th digit of Sharpe’s Egyptian cubit=19∙2 inches.</p>
                <p>13.3. —This measure does not seem to belong to very early times, and it may
                    probably have originated in Asia Minor. It is found there as 13∙35 in buildings.
                    Hultsch gives it rather less, at 13∙1, as the “small Asiatic foot.” Thence it
                    passed to Greece, where it is found (25) as 13∙36. In Romano-African remains it
                    is often found, rather higher, or 13∙45 average (25). It lasted in Asia
                    apparently till the building of the palace at Mashita (620 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.),</hi> where it is 13∙22, according to the rough measures we have (25).
                    And it may well be the origin of the dira Stambuli of 26∙6, twice 13∙3. Found in
                    Asia Minor and northern Greece, it does not appear unreasonable to connect it,
                    as Hultsch does, with the Belgic foot of the Tungri, which was legalized (or
                    perhaps introduced) by Drusus when governor, as ⅛ longer than the Roman foot, or
                    13 Ό7; this statement was evidently an approximation by an increase of 2 digits,
                    so that the small difference from 13∙3 is not worth notice. Further the pertica
                    was 12 feet of 18 digits, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Drusian feet.</p>
                <p>Turning now to England, we find (25) the commonest building foot up to the 15th
                    century averaged 13∙22. Here we see the Belgic foot passed over to England, and
                    we can fill the gap to a considerable extent from the itinerary measures. It has
                    been shown (31) that the old English mile, at least as far back as the 13th
                    century, was of 10 and not 8 furlongs. It was therefore equal to 79,200 inches,
                    and divided decimally into 10 furlongs, 100 chains, or 1000 fathoms. For the
                    existence of this fathom (half the Belgic pertica) we have the proof of its
                    half, or yard, needing to be suppressed by statute (9) in 1439, as “the yard and
                    full hand,” or about 40 inches,—evidently the yard of the most usual old English
                    foot of 13∙22, which would be 39∙66. We can restore then the old English system
                    of long measure from the buildings, the statute-prohibition, the surviving chain
                    and furlong, and the old English mile shown by maps and itineraries, thus :—</p>
                <p>foot, 3 = yard, 2 = fathom, 10 = chain, 10 = furlong, 10 = mile.</p>
                <p>13∙22 39∙66 79∙32 793 7932 79,320</p>
                <p>Such a regular and extensive system could not have been put into use throughout
                    the whole country suddenly in 1250, especially as it must have had to resist the
                    legal foot now in use, which was enforced (9) as early as 950. We cannot suppose
                    that such a system would be invented and become general in face of the laws
                    enforcing the 12-inch foot. Therefore it must be dated some time before the 10th
                    century, and this brings it as near as we can now hope to the Belgic foot, which
                    lasted certainly to the 3d or 4th century, and is exactly in the line of
                    migration of the Belgic tribes into Britain. It is remarkable how near this
                    early decimal system of Germany and Britain is the double of the modern decimal
                    metric system. Had it not been unhappily driven out by the 12-inch foot, and
                    repressed by statutes both against its yard and mile, we should need but a small
                    change to place our measures in accord with the metre.</p>

                    Celtic measure, as opposed to the old English, or Germanic, mile. In the
                    north-west of England and in Wales this mile lasted as 1∙56 British miles till
                    1500; and the perch of those parts was correspondingly longer till this century
                    (31). The “old London mile” was 5000 feet, and probably this was the mile which
                    was modified to 5280 feet, or 8 furlongs, and so became the British statute

                    which have contents stated in hons (8, 12, 20, 22, 33, 40) the mean is 29∙2
                    cubic inches ± ∙6; by 9 unmarked pottery measures (30) 29∙1±1∙6, and divided by
                    20; by 18 vases, supposed multiples of lion (1), 32∙1±∙2. These last are
                    probably only rough, and we may take 29∙2 cubic inches ± ∙5. This was reckoned
                    (6) to hold 5 utens of water (uten. ·. 1470 grains), which agrees well to the
                    weight; but this was probably an approximation, and not derivative, as there is
                    (14) a weight called shet of 4∙70 or 4∙95 uten, and this was perhaps the actual
                    weight of a hon. The variations of hon and uten, however, cover one another

                    medimnus = tama or 2 artabas, and fractions down to <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 400</hi> artaba (35). In Roman times the artaba
                    remained (Didymus), but ⅙ was the usual unit (name unknown), and this was
                    divided down to <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 24</hi>

                    Roman artaba (Didymus) of 1540∙ was brought in. Beside the equivalence of the
                    hon to 5 utens weight of water, the mathematical papyrus (35) gives 5 besha = ⅔
                    cubic cubit (Revillout’s interpretation of this as 1 cubit <hi

                    unlikely for 3 to be introduced in an Egyptian derivation, and probably
                    therefore only a working equivalent. The other ratio of Revillout and Hultsch,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Syria, Palestine, and Babylonia.—</hi> Here there are no
                    monumental data known; and the literary information does not distinguish the
                    closely connected, perhaps identical, units of these lands. Moreover, none of
                    the writers are before the Roman period, and many relied on are mediaeval
                    rabbis. A large number of their statements are rough (2, 18, 33), being based on
                    the working equivalence of the bath or epha with the Attic metretes, from which
                    are sometimes drawn fractional statements which seem more accurate than they
                    are. This, however, shows the bath to be about 2500 cubic inches. There are two
                    better data (2) of Epiphanius and Theodoret,—Attic medimnus = 1½ baths, and
                    saton (⅓ bath) = 1 ⅜ modii; these give about 2240 and 2260 cubic inches. The
                    best datum is in Josephus <hi rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> iii. 15, 3), where 10
                    baths = 41 Attic or 31 Sicilian medimni, for which it is agreed we must read
                    modii (33); hence the bath = 2300 cubic inches. Thus these three different
                    reckonings agree closely, but all equally depend on the Greek and Roman
                    standards, which are not well fixed. The Sicilian modius here is <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 10</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 31</hi> or slightly under ⅓,
                    of the bath, and so probably a Punic variant of the ⅓ bath or saton of
                    Phcenicia. One close datum, if trustworthy, would be log of water = Assyrian
                    mina .∙. bath about 2200 cubic inches. The rabbinical statement of cubic cubit
                    of 21∙5 holding 320 logs puts the bath at about 2250 cubic inches; their
                    log-measure, holding six hen’s eggs, shows it to be over rather than under this
                    amount; but their reckoning of bath = ½ cubit cubed is but approximate; by 21∙5
                    it is 1240, by 25∙1 it is 1990 cubic inches. The earliest Hebrew system was—</p>

                    apet and epha, and of log to the Coptic and late measure lok. But there are

                    the Attic system (18). The values are 1½ × the Attic (Athenaeus, Theophrastus,
                    &amp;c. ) (2,18), or more closely 11 to 12 times ⅛ of Attic. Hence, the Attic
                    cotyle being 17∙5 cubic inches, the Aeginetan is about 25∙7. The Boeotian system
                    (18) included the achane; if this = Persian, then cotyle=24∙7. Or, separately
                    through the Roman system, the mnasis of Cyprus (18) = 170 sextarii; then the
                    cotyle = 24∙8. By the theory of the metretes being 1½ talents Aeginetan, the
                    cotyle would be 23∙3 to 24∙7 cubic inches by the actual weights, which have
                    tended to decrease. Probably then 25∙0 is the best approximation. By the theory
                    (18) of 2 metretes = cube of the 18∙67 cubit from the 12∙45 foot, the cotyle
                    would be about 25∙4, within ∙4; but then such a cubit is unknown among measures,
                    and not likely to be formed, as 12∙4 is ⅗ of 20∙6. The Aeginetan system then

                    the cotyle from the Naxian slab is 15∙4 (best, others 14∙6-19∙6); from a vase

                    the amphora is 1695; by the congius of Ste Genevieve (2) 1700 cubic inches; and
                    by the ponderarium measures at Pompeii (33) 1540 to 1840, or about 1620 for a
                    mean. So the Farnesian congius, or about 1650, may best be adopted. The system

                    cubic inches). The Roman theory of the amphora being the cubic foot makes it
                    1569 cubic inches, or decidedly less than the actual measures; the other theory
                    of its containing 80 librae of water would make it 1575 by the commercial or
                    1605 by the monetary libra,—again too low for the measures. Both of these
                    theories therefore are rather working equivalents than original derivations; or

                <p>146 grains.—The Egyptian unit was the kat, which varied between 138 and 155
                    grains (28, 29). There were several families or varieties within this range, at
                    least in the Delta, probably five or six in all (29). The original places and
                    dates of these cannot yet be fixed, except for the lowest type of 138-140
                    grains; this belonged to Heliopolis (7), as two weights (35) inscribed of “the
                    treasury of An” show 139∙9 and 140∙4, while a plain one from there gives 138∙8;
                    the variety 147-149 may belong to Hermopolis (35), according to an inscribed
                    weight. The names of the kat and tema are fixed by being found on weights, the
                    uten by inscriptions; the series was—</p>
                <p>(<hi rend="italic">n</hi>), 10=kaf, 10=uten, 10=tema.</p>
                <p>14∙6 grs. 146 1460 14,600</p>
                <p>The tema is the same name as the large wheat measure (35), which was worth 30,000
                    to 19,000 grains of copper, according to Ptolemaic receipts and accounts (<hi
                    rend="italic">Rev. Bg.,</hi> 1881, 150), and therefore very likely worth 10
                    utens of copper in earlier times when metals were scarcer. The kat was regularly
                    divided into 10; but another division, for the sake of interrelation with
                    another system, was in ⅓ and ⅙, scarcely found except in the eastern Delta,
                    where it is common (29); and it is known from a papyrus (38) to be a Syrian
                    weight. The uten is found÷6 = 245, in Upper Egypt (rare) (44). Another division
                    (in a papyrus) (38) is a silver weight of <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi> kat = about 88,— perhaps the Babylonian siglus of 86.
                    The uten was also binarily divided into 128 peks of gold in Ethiopia; this may
                    refer to another standard (see 129) (33). The Ptolemaic copper coinage is on two
                    bases,—the uten, binarily divided, and the Ptolemaic five shekels (1050), also
                    binarily divided. (This result is from a larger number than other students have
                    used, and study by diagrams.) The theory (3) of the derivation of the uten from
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 1500</hi> cubic cubit of
                    water would fix it at 1472, which is accordant; but there seems no authority
                    either in volumes or weights for taking 1500 utens. Another theory (3) derives
                    the uten from <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 1000</hi>
                    of the cubic cubit of 24 digits, or better <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> / <hi

                    variety of the uten, while there is no evidence of the existence of such a
                    cubit. The kat is not unusual in Syria (44), and among the haematite weights of
                    Troy (44) are nine examples, average 144, but not of extreme varieties.</p>

                <p>and the other system double of this in each stage except the talent. These two
                    systems are distinctly named on the weights, and arc known now as the light an
                    heavy Assyrian systems ( 19, 24). (It is better to avoid the name Babylonian, as
                    it has other meanings also.) There are no weights dated before the Assyrian
                    bronze lion weights (9, 17, 19, 38) of the 11th to 8th centuries <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Thirteen of this class average 127∙2 for the shekel;
                    9 haematite barrel-shaped weights (38) give 128∙2; 16 stone duck-weights (38),
                    126∙5. A heavier value is shown by the precious metals,—the gold plates from
                    Khorsabad (18) giving 129, and the gold daric coinage (21, 35) of Persia 129∙2.
                    Nine weights from Syria (44) average 128∙8. This is the system of the
                    “Babylonian” talent, by Herodotus = 70 minae Euboic, by Pollux = 70 minae Attic,
                    by Aelian = 72 minae Attic, and therefore about 470,000 grains. In Egypt this is
                    found largely at Naucratis (28, 29), and less commonly at Defenneh (29). In both
                    places the distribution, a high type of 129 and a lower of 127, is like the
                    monetary and trade varieties above noticed; while a smaller number of examples
                    are found, fewer and fewer, down to 118 grains. At Memphis (44) the shekel is
                    scarcely known, and a ½ mina weight was there converted into another standard
                    (of 200). A few barrel weights are found at Karnak, and several egg-shaped
                    shekel weights at Gebelen (44); also two cuboid weights from there (44) of 1 and
                    10 utens are marked as 6 and 60, which can hardly refer to any unit but the
                    heavy shekel, giving 245. Hultsch refers to Egyptian gold rings of Dynasty
                    XVIII. of 125 grains. That this unit penetrated far to the south in early times
                    is shown by the tribute of Kush (34) in Dynasty XVIII.; this is of 801, 1443,
                    and 23,741 kats, or 15 and 27 manebs and 7⅜ talents when reduced to this system.
                    And the later Ethiopic gold unit of the pek (7), or <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 128</hi> of the uten, was 10∙8 or more, and may
                    therefore be the ½ sikhir or obolos of 21∙5. But the fraction <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 128</hi>, or a continued
                    binary division repeated seven times, is such a likely mode of rude subdivision
                    that little stress can be laid on this. In later times in Egypt a class of large
                    glass scarabs for funerary purposes seem to be adjusted to the shekel (30).
                    Whether this system or the Phoenician on 224 grains was that of the Hebrews is
                    uncertain. There is no doubt but that in the Maccabean times and onward 218 was
                    the shekel; but the use of the word darkemôn by Ezra and Nehemiah, and the
                    probabilities of their case, point to the darag-maneh, <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 60</hi> maneh, or shekel of Assyria; and the
                    mention of ⅓ shekel by Nehemiah as poll tax nearly proves that the 129 and not
                    218 grains is intended, as 218 was never÷3. But the Maccabean use of 218 may
                    have been a reversion to the older shekel; and this is strongly shown by the
                    fraction ¼ shekel (1 Sam. ix. 8), the continual mention of large decimal numbers
                    of shekels in the earlier books, and the certain fact of 100 shekels being =
                    mina. This would all be against the 129 or 258 shekel, and for the 218 or 224.
                    There is, however, one good datum if it can be trusted: 300 talents of silver (2
                    Kings xviii. 14) are 800 talents on Sennacherib’s cylinder (34), while the 30
                    talents of gold is the same in both accounts. Eight hundred talents on the
                    Assyrian silver standard would be 267 —or roundly 300—talents on the heavy trade
                    or gold system, which is therefore probably the Hebrew. Probably the 129 and 224
                    systems coexisted in the country; but on the whole it seems more likely that 129
                    or rather 258 grains was the Hebrew shekel before the Ptolemaic
                    times,—especially as the 100 shekels to the mina is parallelled by the following
                    Persian system (Hultsch)—<pb break="no"

                <p>and, considering that the two Hebrew cubits are the Babylonian and Persian units,
                    and the volumes are also Babylonian, it is the more likely that the weights
                    should have come with these. From the east this unit passed to Asia Minor; and
                    six multiples of 2 to 20 shekels (av. 127) are found among the haematite weights
                    of Troy (44), including the oldest of them. On the Aegean coast it often occurs
                    in early coinage (17),—at Lampsacus 131-129, Phocaea 256-4, Cyzicus 252-247,
                    Methymna 124∙6, &amp;c. In later times it was a main unit of North Syria, and
                    also on the Euxine, leaden weights of Antioch (3), Callatia, and Tomis being
                    known (38). The mean of these eastern weights is 7700 for the mina, or 128. But
                    the leaden weights of the west (44) from Corfu, &amp;c., average 7580, or 126∙3;
                    this standard was kept up at Cyzicus in trade long after it was lost in coinage.
                    At Corinth the unit was evidently the Assyrian and not the Attic, being 129∙6 at
                    the earliest (17) (though modified to double Attic, or 133, later) and being÷3,
                    and not into 2 drachms. And this agrees with the mina being repeatedly found at
                    Corcyra, and with the same standard passing to the Italian coinage (17) similar
                    in weight, and in division into ⅓,—the heaviest coinages (17) down to 400 <hi

                    Tarentum, &amp;c. ) being none over 126, while later on many were adjusted to
                    the Attic, and rose to 134. Six disk weights from Carthage (44) show 126. It is
                    usually the case that a unit lasts later in trade than in coinage; and the
                    prominence of this standard in Italy may show how it is that this mina (18
                    unciae = 7400) was known as the “Italic” in the days of Galen and Dioscorides
                    (2).</p>
                <p>12β r A variation on the main system was made by forming a 6300 mina of 50
                    shekels. This is one of the Persian series(gold), and the ¼ of the Hebrew series
                    noted above. But it is most striking when it is found in the mina form which
                    distinguishes it. Eleven weights from Syria and Cnidus (44) (of the curious type
                    with two breasts on a rectangular block) show a mina of 6250 (125∙0); and it is
                    singular that this class is exactly like weights of the 224 system found with
                    it, but yet quite distinct in standard. The same passed into Italy and Corfu
                    (44), averaging 6000,—divided in Italy into unciae (<hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi>), and scripulae (<hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 288</hi>), and called litra (in Corfu ?). It is
                    known in the coinage of Hatria (18) as 6320. And a strange division of the
                    shekel in 10 (probably therefore connected with this decimal mina) is shown by a
                    series of bronze weights (44) with four curved sides and marked with circles
                    (British Museum, place unknown), which may be Romano-Gallic, averaging 125÷10.
                    This whole class seems to cling to sites of Phoenician trade, and to keep clear
                    of Greece and the north,—perhaps a Phoenician form of the 129 system, avoiding
                    the sexagesimal multiples.</p>
                <p>If this unit have any connexion with the kat, it is that a kat of gold is worth
                    15 shekels or ¼ mina of silver; this agrees well with the range of both units,
                    only it must be remembered that 129 was used as gold unit, and another silver
                    unit deduced from it. More likely then the 147 aud 129 units originated
                    independently in Egypt and Babylonia.</p>
                <p>86 grs. From 129 grains of gold was adopted an equal value 8600 <hi

                    this 516,000 was divided in 10 = 172,—which was used either in this form, or its
                    half, 86, best known as the siglus (17).</p>
                <p>Such a proportion is indicated in Num. vii., where the gold spoon of 10 shekels
                    is equal in value to the bowl of 130 shekels, or double that of 70, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the silver vessels were 200 and 100 sigli. The silver
                    plates at Khorsabad (18) we find to be 80 sigli of 84∙6. The Persian silver
                    coinage shows about 86 Ό; the danak was ⅓ of this, or 28∙7. Xenophon and others
                    state it at about 84. As a monetary weight it seems to have spread, perhaps
                    entirely, in consequence of the Persian dominion; it varies from 174∙ downwards,
                    usually 167, in Λradus, Cilicia, and on to tho Aegean coast, in Lydia and in
                    Macedonia (17). The silver bars found at Troy averaging 2744, or ⅓mina of 8232,
                    have been attributed to this unit (17); but no division of the mina in ⅓ is to
                    be expected, and the average is rather low. Two haematite weights from Troy (44)
                    show 86 and 87∙2. The mean from leaden weights of Chios, Tenedos (44), &amp;c.,
                    is 8430. A duck-weight of Camirus, probably early, gives 8480; the same passed
                    on to Greece and Italy (17), averaging 8610; but in Italy it was divided, like
                    all other units, into unciae and scripulae (44). It is perhaps found in Etrurian
                    coinage as 175-172 (17). By the Romans it was used on the Danube (18), two
                    weights of the first legion there showing 8610; and this is the mina of 20
                    unciae (8400) named by Roman writers. The system was—</p>
                <p>obol, 6 = siglus, 100 = rnina, 60 = talent.</p>
                <p>14 ∙3 grs. 86 8600 516,000</p>
                <p>A derivation from this was the ⅓ of 172, or 57∙3, the so-called Phocaean drachma,
                    equal in silver value to the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 60</hi> of the gold 258 grains. It was used at Phocaea as
                    58∙5, and passed to the colonies of Posidonia and Velia as 59 or 118. The colony
                    of Massilia brought it into Gaul as 58∙2-54∙9.</p>
                <p>224 grs. That this unit (commonly called Phoenician) is derived 11,200; from the
                    system can hardly be doubted, both being 679,000. so intimately associated in
                    Syria and Asia Minor.</p>
                <p>· The relation is 258: 229:: 9: 8; but the exact form in which the descent took
                    place is not settled: <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    60</hi> of 129 of gold is worth 57 of silver or a drachm, ¼ of 230 (or by trade
                    weights 127 and 226); otherwise, deriving it from the silver weight of 86
                    already formed, the drachm is ⅓ of the stater, 172, or double of the Persian
                    danak of 28∙7, and the sacred unit of Didyma in Ionia was this half drachm, 27;
                    or thirdly, what is indicated by the Lydian coinage (17), 86 of gold was equal
                    to 1150 of silver, 5 shekels, or <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 10</hi> mina. Other proposed derivations from the kat or pek
                    are not satisfactory. In actual use this unit varied greatly: at Naucratis (29)
                    there are groups of it at 231, 223, and others down to 208; this is the earliest
                    form in which we can study it, and the corresponding values to these are 130 and
                    126, or the gold and trade varieties of the Babylonian, while the lower tail
                    down to 208 corresponds to the shekel down to 118, which is just what is found.
                    Hence the 224 unit seems to have been formed from the 129, after the main
                    families or types of that had arisen. It is scarcer at Defenneh (29) and rare at
                    Memphis (44). Under the Ptolemies, however, it became the great unit of Egypt,
                    and is very prominent in the later literature in consequence (18, 35). The
                    average of coins (21) of Ptolemy I. gives 219∙6, and thence they gradually
                    diminish to 210, the average (33) of the whole series of Ptolemies being 218.
                    The “argenteus” (as Revillout transcribes a sign in the papyri) (35) was of 5
                    shekels, or 1090; it arose about 440 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and became
                    after 160 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> a weight unit for copper. In Syria, as
                    early as the 15th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the tribute of the
                    Rutennu, of Naharaina, Megiddo, Anaukasa, &amp;c. (34), is on a basis of 454-484
                    kats, or 300 shekels (<hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    10</hi> talent) of 226 grains. The commonest weight at Troy (44) is the shekel,
                    averaging 224. In coinage it is one of the commonest units in early times; from
                    Phoenicia, round the coast to Macedonia, it is predominant (17); at a maximum of
                    230 (Ialysus), it is in Macedonia 224, but seldom exceeds 220 elsewhere, the
                    earliest Lydian of the 7th century being 219, and the general average of coins
                    218. The system was—</p>
                <p>(I), 8=drachm, 4=shekel, 25=mina, 120=talent.</p>
                <p>7 grs. 56 224 5600 672,000</p>
                <p>From the Phoenician coinage it was adopted for the Maccabean. It is needless to
                    give the continual evidences of this being the later Jewish shekel, both from
                    coins (max. 223) and writers (2, 18, 33); the question of the early shekel we
                    have noticed already under 129. In Phoenicia and Asia Minor the mina was
                    specially made in the form with two breasts (44), 19 such weights averaging 5600
                    ( = 224); and thence it passed into Greece, more in a double value of 11,200 ( =
                    224). From Phoenicia this naturally became the main Punic unit; a bronze weight
                    from Iol (18), marked 100, gives a drachma of 56 or 57 (224-228); and a Punic
                    inscription (18) names 28 drachmae = 25 Attic, and . ·. 57 to 59 grains
                    (228-236); while a probably later series of 8 marble disks from Carthage (44)
                    show 208, but vary from 197 to 234. In Spain it was 236 to 216 in different
                    series (17), and it is a question whether the Massiliote drachmae of 58-55 are
                    not Phoenician rather than Phocaic. In Italy this mina became naturalized, and
                    formed the “Italic mina” of Hero, Priscian, &amp;c.; also its double, the mina
                    of 26 unciae or 10,800, =50 shekels of 216; the average of 42 weights gives 5390
                    ( = 215∙6), and it was divided both into 100 drachmae, and also in the Italic
                    mode of 12 unciae and 288 scripulae (44). The talent was of 120 minae of 5400,
                    or 3000 shekels, shown by the talent from Herculaneum, TA, 660,000 and by the
                    weight inscribed <hi rend="smallcaps">pondo</hi> cxxv. (<hi rend="italic"

                    = 9) nomismata, for 9000). This gives the same approximate ratio 96 :100 to the
                    libra as the usual drachma reckoning. The Alexandrian talent of Festus, 12,000
                    denarii, is the same talent again. It is believed that this mina÷12 unciae by
                    the Romans is the origin of the Arabic ratl of 12 úkíyas, or 5500 grains (33),
                    which is said to have been sent by Harun al-Rashid to Charlemagne, and so to
                    have originated the French monetary pound of 5666 grains. But, as this is
                    probably the same as the English monetary pound, or tower pound of 5400, which
                    was in use earlier (see Saxon coins), it seems more likely that this pound
                    (which is common in Roman weights) was directly inherited from the Roman
                    civilization.</p>
                <p>80 grs. Another unit, which has scarcely been recognized in 80 grs; metrology
                    hitherto, is prominent in the weights from 400,000 Egypt,—some 50 weights from
                    Naucratis and 15 from Defenneh plainly agreeing on this and on no other
                    basis.</p>
                <p>Its value varies between 76∙5 and 81∙5,—mean 79 at Naucratis (29) or 81 at
                    Defenneh (29). It has been connected theoretically with a binary division of the
                    10 shekels or “stone” of the Assyrian systems (28), 1290 ÷ 16 being 80 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 6; this is suggested by the most usual multiples
                    being 40 and 80=25 and 50 shekels of 129; it is thus akin to the mina of 50
                    shekels previously noticed. The tribute of the Asi, <pb break="no"

                    (34), though in uneven numbers of kats, comes out in round thousands of units
                    when reduced to this standard. That this unit is quite distinct from the Persian
                    86 grains is clear in the Egyptian weights, which maintain a wide gap between
                    the two systems. Next, in Syria three inscribed weights of Antioch and Berytus
                    (18) show a mina of about 16,400, or 200 × 82. Then at Abydus, or more probably
                    from Babylonia, there is the large bronze lion-weight, stated to have been
                    originally 400,500 grains; this has been continually ÷ 60 by different writers,
                    regardless of the fact (<hi rend="italic">Rev. Arch.,</hi> 1862, 30) that it
                    bears the numeral 100; this therefore is certainly a talent of 100 minae of
                    4005; and as the mina is generally 50 shekels in Greek systems it points to a
                    weight of 80∙1. Farther west the same unit occurs in several Greek weights (44)
                    which show a mina of 7800 to 8310, mean 8050÷100 = 80∙5. Turning to coinage, we
                    find this often, but usually overlooked as a degraded form of the Persian 86
                    grains siglos. But the earliest coinage in Cilicia, before the general Persian
                    coinage (17) about 380 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> is Tarsus, 164 grains;
                    Soli, 169, 163,158; Nagidus, 158,161-153 later; Issus, 166; Mallus, 163-154,—
                    all of which can only by straining be classed as Persian; but they agree to this
                    standard, which, as we have seen, was used in Syria in earlier times by the
                    Khita, &amp;c. The Milesian or “native” system of Asia Minor (18) is fixed by
                    Hultsch at 163 and 81∙6 grains,—the coins of Miletus (17) showing 160, 80, and
                    39. Coming down to literary evidence, this is abundant. Böckh decides that the
                    “Alexandrian drachma” was <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    5</hi> of the Solonic 67, or=80∙5, and shows that it was not Ptolemaic, or
                    Rhodian, or Aeginetan, being distinguished from these in inscriptions (2). Then
                    the “Alexandrian mina” of Dioscorides and Galen (2) is 20 unciae = 8250; in the
                    “Analecta” (2) it is 150 or 158 drachmae = 8100. Then Attic: Euboic or
                    Aeginetan:: 18: 25 in the metrologists (2), and the Euboic talent = 7000
                    “Alexandrian” drachmae; the drachma therefore is 80∙0. The “Alexandrian” wood
                    talent: Attic talent:: 6: 5 (Hero, Didymus), and .∙. 480,000, which is 60 minae
                    of 8000. Pliny states the Egyptian talent at 80 librae = 396,000; evidently =
                    the Abydus lion talent, which is÷100, and the mina is . ’. 3960, or 50 × 79∙2.
                    The largest weight is the “wood” talent of Syria (18) = 6 Roman talents, or
                    1,860,000, evidently 120 Antioch minae of 15,500 or 2 × 7750. This evidence is
                    too distinct to be set aside; and, exactly confirming as it does the Egyptian
                    weights and coin weights, and agreeing with the early Asiatic tribute, it cannot
                    be overlooked in future. The system was drachm, 2=stater, 50=mina, ∣50=talent.

                <p>Greek usage to 194. But we are now able to prove that it was an independent
                    system—(1) by its not ranging usually over 200 grains in Egypt before it passed
                    to Greece; (2) by its earliest example, perhaps before the 224 unit existed, not
                    being over 208; and (3) by there being no intermediate linking on of this to the
                    Phoenician unit in the large number of Egyptian weights, nor in the Ptolemaic
                    coinage, in which both standards are used. The first example (30) is one with
                    the name of Amenhotep I. (17th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> marked as
                    “gold 5,” which is 5 × 207∙6. Two other marked weights are from Memphis (44),
                    showing 201∙8 and 196∙4, and another Egyptian 191∙4. The range of the (34)
                    Naucratis weights is 186 to 199, divided in two groups averaging 190 and 196,
                    equal to the Greek monetary and trade varieties. Ptolemy I. and II. also struck
                    a series of coins (32) averaging 199. In Syria haematite weights are found (30)
                    averaging 198∙5, divided into 99∙2, 49∙6, and 24∙8; and the same division is
                    shown by gold rings from Egypt (38) of 24∙9. In the medical papyrus (38) a
                    weight of ⅔ kat is used, which is thought to be Syrian; now ⅔ kat = 92 to 101
                    grains, or just this weight which we have found in Syria; and the weights of ⅔
                    and 1/3 kat are very rare in Egypt except at Defenneh (29), on the Syrian road,
                    where they abound. So we have thus a weight of 207-191 in Egypt on marked
                    weights, joining therefore completely with the Aeginetan unit in Egypt of 199 to
                    186, and coinage of 199, and strongly connected with Syria, where a double mina
                    of Sidon (18) is 10,460 or 50 × 209∙2. Probably before any Greek coinage we find
                    this among the haematite weights of Troy (44), ranging from 208 to 193∙2 (or
                    104- 96∙6), <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> just covering the range from the
                    earliest Egyptian down to the early Aeginetan coinage. Turning now to the early
                    coinage, we see the fuller weight kept up (17) at Samos (202), Miletus (201),
                    Calymna (100, 50), Methymna and Scepsis (99, 49),<note anchored="true"

                    coinage of Aegina (17, 12), which by its wide diffusion made this unit best
                    known, though a few of its earliest staters go up even to 207, yet is
                    characteristically on the lower of the two groups which we recognize in Egypt,
                    and thus started what has been considered the standard value of 194, or usually
                    190, decreasing afterwards to 184. In later times, in Asia, however, the fuller
                    weight, or higher Egyptian group, which we have just noticed in the coinage, was
                    kept up (17) into the series of cistophori (196-191), as in the Ptolemaic series
                    of 199. At Athens the old mina was fixed by Solon at 150 of his drachmae (18) or
                    9800 grains, according to the earliest drachmae, showing a stater of 196; and
                    this continued to be the trade mina in Athens, at least until 160 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> but in a reduced form, in which it equalled only 138
                    Attic drachmae, or 9200. The Greek mina weights show (44), on an average of 37,
                    9650 ( = stater of 193), varying from 186 to 199. In the Hellenic coinage it
                    varies (18) from a maximum of 200 at Pharae to 192, usual full weight; this unit
                    occupied (17) all central Greece, Peloponnesus, and most of the islands. The

                <p>It also passed into Italy, but in a smaller multiple of 25 drachmae, or ¼ of the
                    Greek mina; 12 Italian weights (44) bearing value marks (which cannot therefore
                    be differently attributed) show a libra of 2400 or ¼ of 9600, which was divided
                    in unciae and sextulae, and the full-sized mina is known as the 24 uncia mina,
                    or talent of 120 librae of Vitruvius and Isidore (18) = 9900. Hultsch states
                    this to be the old Etruscan pound.</p>
                <p>412 With the trade mina of 9650 in Greece, and recognized</p>
                <p>4950 grs. in Italy, we can hardly doubt that tho Roman libra is the half of this
                    mina. At Athens it was 2 × 4900, and on the average of all the Greek weights it
                    is 2 × 4825, so that 4950 —the libra—is as close as we need expect. The division
                    by 12 does not affect the question, as every standard that came into Italy was
                    similarly divided. In the libra, as in most other standards, tho value whieh
                    happened to be first at hand for the coinage was not the mean of the whole of
                    the weights in the country; the Phoenician coin weight is below the trade
                    average, the Assyrian is above, the Aeginetan is below, but the Roman coinage is
                    above the average of trade weights, or the mean standard. Rejecting all weights
                    of the lower empire, the average (44) of about 100 is 4956; while 42 later Greek
                    weights (nomisma, &amp;c.) average 4857, and 16 later Latin ones (solidus,
                    &amp;c. )show 4819. The coinage standard, however, was always higher (18); the
                    oldest gold shows 5056, the Campanian Roman 5054, the consular gold 5037, the
                    aurei 5037, the Constantine solidi 5053, and the Justinian gold 4996. Thus,
                    though it fell in the later empire, like the trade weight, yet it was always
                    above that. Though it has no exact relation to the congius or amphora, yet it is
                    closely = 4977 grains, the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 80</hi> of the cubic foot of water. If, however, the weight in a degraded
                    form, and the foot in an undegraded form, come from the East, it is needless to
                    look for an exact relation between them, but rather for a mere working
                    equivalent, like the 1000 ounces to the cubic foot in England. Bökh has remarked
                    the great diversity between weights of the same age,—those marked “Ad Augusti
                    Temp” ranging 4971 to 5535, those tested by the fussy praefect Q. Junius
                    Rusticus vary 4362 to 5625, and a set in the British Museum (44) belonging
                    together vary 4700 to 5168. The series was—</p>
                <p>siliqua, 6 = scripulurn, 4 = sextula, 6 = uncia, 12 = libra, 2∙87 grs. 17 2 68∙7
                    412 4950</p>
                <p>the greater weight being the centumpondium of 495,000. Other weights were added
                    to these from the Greek system—</p>
                <p>obolus, 6 = drachma, 2 = sicilicus, 4 = uncia; 8∙6 grs. 51∙5 103 412</p>
                <p>and the sextula after Constantine had the name of solidus as a coin weight, or
                    nomisma in Greek, marked N on the weights. A beautiful set of multiples of the
                    scripulum was found near Lyons (38), from 1 to 10x17∙28 grains, showing a libra
                    of 4976. In Byzantine times in Egypt glass was used for coin-weights (30),
                    averaging 68∙0 for the solidus = 4896 for the libra. The Saxon and Norman ounce
                    is said to average 416∙5 (<hi rend="italic">Num. Chron.,</hi> 1871, 42),
                    apparently the Roman uncia inherited.</p>
                <p>grs. The system which is perhaps the best known, through its adoption by Solon in
                    Athens, and is thence called 402,000. Attic or Solonic, is nevertheless far
                    older than its introduction into Greece, being found in full vigour in Egypt in
                    the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It has been usually reckoned as a
                    rather heavier form of the 129 shekel, increased to 134 on its adoption by
                    Solon. But the Egyptian weights render this view impossible. Among them (29) the
                    two contiguous groups can be discriminated by the 129 being multiplied by 30 and
                    60, while the 67 or 134 is differently × 25, 40, 50, and 100. Hence, although
                    the two groups overlap owing to their nearness, it is impossible to regard them
                    as all one unit. The 129 range is up to 131 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8,
                    while the Attic range is 130 to 138 (65-69). Hultsch reckons on a ratio of 24:
                    25 between them, and this is very near the true values; the full Attic being
                    67∙3, the Assyrian should be 129∙2, and this is just the full gold coinage
                    weight. We may perhaps see the sense of this ratio through another system. The
                    80 grain system, as we have seen, was probably formed by binarily dividing the
                    10 shekels, or “stone”; and it had a talent (Abydus lion) of 5000 drachmae; this
                    is practically identical with the talent of 6000 Attic drachmae. So the talent
                    of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n514/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0514-0489"/> the 80 grain system was sexagesimally divided for
                    the mina which was afterwards adopted by Solon. Such seems the most likely
                    history of it, and this is in exact accord with the full original weight of each
                    system. In Egypt the mean value at Naucratis (29) was 66 7, while at Defenneh
                    (29) and Memphis (44)—probably rather earlier—it was 67∙0. The type of the
                    grouping is not alike in different places, showing that no distinct families had
                    arisen before the diffusion of this unit in Egypt; but the usual range is 65∙5
                    to 69∙0. Next it is found at Troy (44) in three cases, all high examples of 68∙2
                    to 68∙7; and these are very important, since they cannot be dissociated from the
                    Greek Attic unit, and yet they are of a variety as far removed as may be from
                    the half of the Assyrian, which ranges there from 123∙5 to 131; thus the
                    difference of unit between Assyrian and Attic in these earliest of all Greek
                    weights is very strongly marked. At Athens a low variety of the unit was adopted
                    for the coinage, true to the object of Solon in depreciating debts; and the
                    first coinage is of only 65∙2, or scarcely within the range of the trade weights
                    (28); this seems to have been felt, as, contrary to all other states, Athens
                    slowly increased its coin weight up to 66∙6, or but little under the trade
                    average. It gradually supplanted the Aeginetan standard in Greece and Italy as
                    the power of Athens rose; and it was adopted by Philip and Alexander (17) for
                    their great gold coinage of 133 and 66∙5. This system is often known as the
                    “Euboic,” owing to its early use in Euboea, and its diffusion by trade from
                    thence. The series was—</p>
                <p>chalcous, 8 = obolus, 6=drachma, 100 = mina, 60 = talanton.</p>
                <p>1∙4 grs. 1117 67 6700 402,000</p>
                <p>Turning now to its usual trade values in Greece (44), the mean of 113 gives
                    67∙15; but they vary more than the Egyptian examples, having a sub-variety both
                    above and below the main body, which itself exactly coincides with the Egyptian
                    weights. The greater part of those weights which bear names indicate a mina of
                    double the usual reckoning, so that there was a light and a heavy system, a mina
                    of the drachma and a mina of the stater, as in the Phoenician and Assyrian
                    weights. In trade both the minae were divided in ½, ¼, ⅛, ⅓, and ⅙, regardless
                    of the drachmae. This unit passed also into Italy, the libra of Picenum and the
                    double of the Etrurian and Sicilian libra (17); it was there divided in unciae
                    and scripulae (44), the mean of 6 from Italy and Sicily being 6600; one weight
                    (bought in Smyrna) has the name “Leitra” on it. In literature it is constantly
                    referred to; but we may notice the “general mina” (Cleopatra), in Egypt, 16
                    unciae = 6600; the Ptolemaic talent, equal to the Attic in weight and divisions
                    (Hero, Didymus); the Antiochian talent, equal to the Attic (Hero); the treaty of
                    the Romans with Antiochus, naming talents of 80 librae, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> mina of 16 unciae; the Roman mina in Egypt, of 15 unciae, probably
                    the same diminished; and the Italic mina of 16 unciae. It seems even to have
                    lasted in Egypt till the Middle Ages, as Jabarti and the “kátíb’s guide” both
                    name the ratl misri(of Cairo) as 144 dirhems = 6760.</p>
                <p>We have now ended our outline of ancient metrology, omitting all details that
                    were not really necessary to a fair judgment on the subject, but trying to make
                    as plain as possible the actual bases of information, to trust to no opinions
                    apart from facts, and to leave what is stated as free as possible from the
                    influence of theories. Theoretical values have nowhere been adopted here as the
                    standards, contrary to the general practice of metrologists; but in each case
                    the standard value is stated solely from the evidence in hand, quite regardless
                    of how it will agree with the theoretical deduction from other weights or
                    measures. Great refinement in statements of values is needless, looking to the
                    uncertainties which beset us. There are innumerable theories unnoticed here;
                    only those are explained which seem to have a reasonable likelihood, and others
                    are only mentioned where it is needful to show that they have not been
                    overlooked. In many cases fuller detail is given of less important points, when
                    they have not been published before, and no other information can be referred to
                    elsewhere; when any point is abundantly proved and known, it has been passed
                    with a mere mention. Finally, to indicate where further information on different
                    matters may be found reference is frequently made by a number to the list of

                    The use of it is permissive in Great Britain, India, Canada, Chili, &amp;c. The
                    theory of the system is that the metre is a 10,000,000th of a quadrant of the
