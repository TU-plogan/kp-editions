                <p><label type="entry">WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT</label></p>
                <p>§ 1. A GENERAL statement of the principles of the undulatory theory, with
                    elementary explanations, has already been given under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Light,</hi> and in the article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Ether</hi> the
                    arguments which point to the existence of an all-pervading medium, susceptible
                    in its various parts of an alternating change of state, have been traced by a
                    master hand; but the subject is of such great importance, and is so intimately
                    involved in recent optical investigation and discovery, that a more detailed
                    exposition of the theory, with application to the leading phenomena, was
                    reserved for a special article. That the subject is one of difficulty may be at
                    once admitted. Even in the theory of sound, as conveyed by aerial vibrations,
                    where we are well acquainted with the nature and properties of the vehicle, the
                    fundamental conceptions are not very easy to grasp, and their development makes
                    heavy demands upon our mathematical resources. That the situation is not
                    improved when the medium is hypothetical will be easily understood. For,
                    although the evidence is overwhelming in favour of the conclusion that light is
                    propagated as a vibration, we are almost entirely in the dark as to what it is
                    that vibrates and the manner of vibration. This ignorance<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n447/mode/1up"

                    those parts of the subject the treatment of which would not really be modified
                    by the acquisition of a more precise knowledge, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    theory of the colours of thin plates, and of the resolving power of optical
                    instruments. But in other parts of the subject, such as the explanation of the
                    laws of double refraction and of the intensity of light reflected at the surface
                    of a transparent medium, the vagueness is not merely one of language; and if we
                    wish to reach definite results by the <hi rend="italic">a prion</hi> road we
                    must admit a hypothetical element, for which little justification can be given.
                    The distinction here indicated should be borne clearly in mind. Many optical
                    phenomena must necessarily agree with any kind of wave theory that can be
                    proposed; others may agree or disagree with a particular form of it. In the
                    latter case we may regard the special form as disproved, but the undulatory
                    theory in the proper wider sense remains untouched.</p>
                <p>Of such special forms of the wave theory the most famous is that which
                    assimilates light to the transverse vibrations of an elastic solid. <hi
                        rend="italic">Transverse</hi> they must be in order to give room for the
                    phenomena of polarization. This theory is a great help to the imagination, and
                    allows of the deduction of definite results which are at any rate mechanically
                    possible. An isotropic solid has in general two elastic properties—one relating
                    to the recovery from an alteration of volume, and the other to the recovery from
                    a state of shear, in which the strata are caused to slide over one another. It
                    has been shown by Green that it would be necessary to suppose the luminiferous
                    medium to be incompressible, and thus the only admissible differences between
                    one isotropic medium and another are those of <hi rend="italic">rigidity</hi>
                    and of <hi rend="italic">density.</hi> Between these we are in the first
                    instance free to choose. The slower propagation of light in glass than in air
                    may be equally well explained by supposing the rigidity the same in both cases
                    while the density is greater in glass, or by supposing that the density is the
                    same in both cases while the rigidity is greater in air. Indeed there is
                    nothing, so far, to exclude a more complicated condition of things, in which
                    both the density and rigidity vary in passing from one medium to another,
                    subject to the one condition only of making the ratio of velocities of
                    propagation equal to the known refractive index between the media.</p>
                <p>When we come to apply this theory to investigate the intensity of light reflected
                    from (say) a glass surface, and to the diffraction of light by very small
                    particles (as in the sky), we find that a reasonable agreement with the facts
                    can be brought about only upon the supposition that the rigidity is the same
                    (approximately, at any rate) in various media, and that the density alone
                    varies. At the same time we have to suppose that the vibration is perpendicular
                    to the plane of polarization.</p>
                <p>Up to this point the accordance may be regarded as fairly satisfactory; but, when
                    we extend the investigation to crystalline media in the hope of explaining the
                    observed laws of double refraction, we find that the suppositions which would
                    suit best here are inconsistent with the conclusions we have already arrived at.
                    In the first place, and so long as we hold strictly to the analogy of an elastic
                    solid, we can only explain double refraction as depending upon anisotropic
                    rigidity, and this can hardly be reconciled with the view that the rigidity is
                    the same in different isotropic media. And if we pass over this difficulty, and
                    inquire what kind of double refraction a crystalline solid would admit of, we
                    find no such correspondence with observation as would lead us to think that we
                    are upon the right track. The theory of anisotropic solids, with its twenty-one
                    elastic constants, seems to be too wide for optical double refraction, which is
                    of a much simpler character.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>See Stokes, “Report on Double Refraction,” <hi
                                rend="italic">Brit. Assoc. Report,</hi> 1862, p. 253.</p></note></p>
                <p>For these and other reasons, especially the awkwardness with which it lends
                    itself to the explanation of dispersion, the elastic solid theory, valuable as a
                    piece of purely dynamical reasoning, and probably not without mathematical
                    analogy to the truth, can in optics be regarded only as an illustration.</p>
                <p>In recent years a theory has been received with much favour in which light is
                    regarded as an electromagnetic phenomenon. The dielectric medium is conceived to
                    be subject to a rapidly periodic “electric displacement,” the variations of
                    which have the magnetic properties of an electric current. On the basis of
                    purely electrical observations Maxwell calculated the velocity of propagation of
                    such disturbances, and obtained a value not certainly distinguishable from the
                    velocity of light. Such an agreement is very striking; and a further deduction
                    from the theory, that the specific inductive capacity of a transparent medium is
                    equal to the square of the refractive index, is supported to some extent by
                    observation. The foundations of the electrical theory are not as yet quite
                    cleared of more or less arbitrary hypothesis; but, when it becomes certain that
                    a dielectric medium is susceptible of vibrations propagated with the velocity of
                    light, there will be no hesitation in accepting the identity of such vibrations
                    with those to which optical phenomena are due. In the meantime, and apart
                    altogether from the question of its probable truth, the electromagnetic theory
                    is very instructive, in showing us how careful we must be to avoid limiting our
                    ideas too much as to the nature of the luminous vibrations.</p>
                <p>§ 2. <hi rend="italic">Plane Waves of Simple Type.</hi></p>
                <p>Whatever may be the character of the medium and of its vibration, the analytical
                    expression for an infinite train of plane waves is Acos j y(Vi-α) + α J (1), in
                    which λ represents the wave-length, and V the corresponding velocity of
                    propagation. The coefficient A is called the amplitude, and its nature depends
                    upon the medium and must therefore here be left an open question. The phase of
                    the wave at a given time and place is represented by <hi rend="italic">a.</hi>
                    The expression retains the same value whatever integral number of wave-lengths
                    be added to or subtracted from <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> It is also periodic
                    with respect to <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and the period is <hi rend="subscript"
                        > τ</hi> = <hi rend="subscript"> λ</hi> ∕y <hi rend="subscript">
                        (2)&lt;</hi></p>
                <p>In experimenting upon sound we are able to determine independently <hi
                        rend="italic">τ, λ,</hi> and V; but on account of its smallness the periodic
                    time of luminous vibrations eludes altogether our means of observation, and is
                    only known indirectly from λ and V by means of (2).</p>
                <p>There is nothing arbitrary in the use of a circular function to represent the
                    waves. As a general rule this is the only kind of wave which can be propagated
                    without a change of form; and, even in the exceptional cases where the velocity
                    is independent of wavelength, no generality is really lost by this procedure,
                    because in accordance with Fourier’s theorem any kind of periodic wave may be
                    regarded as compounded of a series of such as (1), with wavelengths in
                    harmonical progression.</p>
                <p>A well-known characteristic of waves of type (1) is that any number of trains of
                    various amplitudes and phases, but of the <hi rend="italic">same
                        wave-length,</hi> are equivalent to a single train of the same type. Thus
                    SAcos ^(Vi-αr) + α</p>
                <p> = SA cos <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">-f ( Vt - x)</hi>- SA

                <p>The composition of vibrations of the same period is precisely analogous, as was
                    pointed out by Fresnel, to the composition of forces, or indeed of any other
                    two-dimensional vector quantities. The magnitude of the force corresponds to the
                    amplitude of the vibration, and the inclination of the force corresponds to the
                    phase. Λ group of forces, of equal intensity, represented by lines drawn from
                    the centre to the angular points of a regular polygon, constitute a system in
                    equilibrium. Consequently, a system of vibrations of equal amplitude and of
                    phases symmetrically distributed round the period has a zero resultant.</p>
                <p>According to the phase-relation, determined by (α-α'), the amplitude of the
                    resultant may vary from (A - A') to (A +A'). If A' and A are equal, the minimum
                    resultant is zero, showing that two equal trains of waves may neutralize one
                    another. This happens when the phases are opposite, or differ by half a
                    (complete) period, and the effect is usually spoken of as the <hi rend="italic"
                        >interference</hi> of light. From a purely dynamical point of view the word
                    is not very appropriate, the vibrations being simply <hi rend="italic"
                        >superposed</hi> with as little interference as can be imagined.</p>
                <p>§ 3. <hi rend="italic">Intensity.</hi></p>
                <p>The intensity of light of given wave-length must depend upon the amplitude, but
                    the precise nature of the relation is not at once apparent. We are not able to
                    appreciate by simple inspection the relative intensities of two unequal lights;
                    and, when we say, for example, that one candle is twice as bright as another, we
                    mean that two of the latter burning independently would give us the same light
                    as one of the former. This may be regarded as the definition; and then
                    experiment may be appealed to to prove that the intensity of light from a given
                    source varies inversely as the square of the distance. But our conviction of the
                    truth of the law is perhaps founded quite as much upon the idea that something
                    not liable to loss is radiated outwards, and is distributed in succession over
                    the surfaces of spheres concentric with the source, whose areas are as the
                    squares of the radii. The something can only be energy; and thus we are led to
                    regard the rate at which energy is propagated across a given area parallel to
                    the waves as the measure of intensity; and this is proportional, not to the
                    first power, but to the <hi rend="italic">square</hi> of the amplitude.</p>
                <p>Practical photometry is usually founded upon the law of inverse squares <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">(Light,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 583); and it should be remembered
                    that the method involves essentially the use of a diffusing screen, the
                    illumination of which, seen in a certain direction, is assumed to be independent
                    of the precise direction in which the light falls upon it; for the distance of a
                    candle, for example, cannot be altered without introducing at the same time a
                    change in the apparent magnitude, and therefore in the incidence of some part at
                    any rate of the light.</p>
                <p>With this objection is connected another which is often of greater importance,
                    the necessary enfeeblement of the light by the process of diffusion. Aud, if to
                    maintain the brilliancy we substitute regular reflectors for diffusing screens,
                    the method breaks down altogether by the apparent illumination becoming
                    independent of the distance of the source of light.</p>
                <p>The use of a revolving disk with transparent and opaque sectors in order to
                    control the brightness, as proposed by Fox Talbot,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Phil</hi>. <hi
                                rend="italic">Mag.,</hi> v. p. 331, 1834.</p></note> may often be
                    recommended in scientific photometry, when a great loss of light is
                    inadmissible. The law that, when the frequency of intermittence is sufficient to
                    give a steady appearance, the brightness is proportional to the angular
                    magnitude of the open sectors appears to be well established.</p>
                <p>§ 4. <hi rend="italic">Resultant of a Large Humber of Vibrations of Arbitrary
                        Phase.</hi></p>
                <p>We have seen that the resultant of two vibrations of equal amplitude is wholly
                    dependent upon their phase-relation, and it is of interest to inquire what we
                    are to expect from the composition of a large number (n) of equal vibrations of
                    amplitude unity, and of arbitrary phases. The intensity of the resultant will of
                    course depend upon the precise manner in which the phases are distributed, and
                    may vary from <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> to zero.
                    But is there a definite intensity which becomes more and more probable as <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi> is increased without limit?</p>
                <p>The nature of the question here raised is well illustrated by the special case in
                    which the possible phases are restricted to two <hi rend="italic">opposite</hi>
                    phases. We may then conveniently discard the idea of phase, and regard the
                    amplitudes as at random <hi rend="italic">positive or negative.</hi> If all the
                    signs are the same, the intensity is <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     superscript"> 2</hi>; if, on the other
                    hand, there are as many positive as negative, the result is zero. But, although
                    the intensity may range from 0 to <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="superscript"
                        > 2</hi>, the smaller values are much more probable than the greater.</p>
                <p>The simplest part of the problem relates to what is called in the theory of
                    probabilities the “expectation” of intensity, that is, the mean intensity to be
                    expected after a great number of trials, in each of which the phases are taken
                    at random. The chance that all the vibrations are positive is 2 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> -n</hi>, and thus the expectation of intensity
                    corresponding to this contingency is 2 <hi rend="superscript"> -n</hi>. <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. In like manner the
                    expectation corresponding to the number of positive vibrations being (n-1) is
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-".n.(π-2) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, and
                    so on. The whole expectation of intensity is thus j l.B≈+n.(a-2r+⅛L≤∖ <hi

                    phase. When the phases are arbitrary, this sum is as likely to be positive as

                <p>The reader must be on his guard here against a fallacy which has misled some high
                    authorities. We have not proved that when <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is large
                    there is any tendency for a single combination to give the intensity equal to
                        <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> but the quite different proposition that in a
                    large number of trials, in each of which the phases are rearranged arbitrarily,
                    the <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> intensity will tend more and more to the value
                        <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> It is true that even in a single combination there
                    is no reason why any of the cosines in (2) should be positive rather than
                    negative, and from this we may infer that when <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is
                    increased the sum of the terms tends to vanish in comparison with the number of
                    terms. But, the number of terms being of the order <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi

                <p>Indeed it is not true that the intensity in a single combination approximates to

                <p>It is with this mean intensity only that we are concerned in ordinary photometry.
                    A source of light, such as a candle or even a soda flame, may be regarded as
                    composed of a very large number of luminous centres disposed throughout a very
                    sensible space; and, even though it be true that the intensity at a particular
                    point of a screen illuminated by it and at a particular moment of time is a
                    matter of chance, further processes of averaging must be gone through before
                    anything is arrived at of which our senses could ordinarily take cognizance. In
                    the smallest interval of time during which the eye could be impressed, there
                    would be opportunity for any number of rearrangements of phase, due either to
                    motions of the particles or to irregularities in their modes of vibration. And
                    even if we supposed that each luminous centre was fixed, and emitted perfectly
                    regular vibrations, the manner of composition and consequent intensity would
                    vary rapidly from point to point of the screen, and in ordinary cases the mean
                    illumination over the smallest appreciable area would correspond to a thorough
                    averaging of the phase-relationships. In this way the idea of the intensity of a
                    luminous source, independently of any questions of phase, is seen to be
                    justified, and we may properly say that two candles are twice as bright as
                    one.</p>

                <p>§ 5. <hi rend="italic">Propagation of Waves in General.</hi></p>
                <p>It has been shown under <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics</hi> that a system of rays,
                    however many reflexions or refractions they may have undergone, are always
                    normal to a certain surface, or rather system of surfaces. From our present
                    point of view these surfaces are to be regarded as wave-surfaces, that is,
                    surfaces of constant phase. It is evident that, so long as the radius of
                    curvature is very large in comparison with λ, each small part of a wave-surface
                    propagates itself just as an infinite plane wave coincident with the tangent
                    plane would do. If we start at time <hi rend="italic">t</hi> with a given
                    surface, the corresponding wavesurface at time <hi rend="italic">t+dt</hi> is to
                    be found by prolonging every normal by the length V <hi rend="italic">dt,</hi>
                    where V denotes the velocity of propagation at the place in question. If the
                    medium be uniform, so that V is constant, the new surface is <hi rend="italic"
                        >parallel</hi> to the old one, and this property is retained however many
                    short intervals of time be considered in succession. A wave-surface thus
                    propagates itself <hi rend="italic">normally,</hi> and the corresponding parts
                    of successive surfaces are those whieh lie upon the same normal. In this sense
                    the normal may be regarded as a <hi rend="italic">ray,</hi> but the idea must
                    not be pushed to streams of light limited to pass through small apertures. The
                    manner in which the phase is determined by the length of the ray, and the
                    conditions under which energy may be regarded as travelling along a ray, will be
                    better treated under the head of Huygens’s principle, and the theory of shadows
                    (§ 10).</p>
                <p>From the law of propagation, according to which the wavesurfaces are always as
                    far advanced as possible, it follows that the course of a ray is that for which
                    the time, represented by ∫ <hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     superscript"> -1</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >ds,</hi> is a minimum. This is Fermat’s principle of least time. Since the
                    refractive index (<hi rend="italic">μ)</hi> varies as V <hi rend="superscript">
                        -1</hi>, we may take ∫μ <hi rend="italic">ds</hi> as the measure of the
                    retardation between one wave surface and another; and it is the same along
                    whichever ray it may be measured.</p>
                <p>The principle that <hi rend="italic">∫μds</hi> is a minimum along a ray lends
                    itself readily to the investigation of optical laws. As an example, we will
                    consider the very important theory of magnifying power. Let A <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 0</hi>,B <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> be two points upon a
                    wave-surface before the light enters the object-glass of a telescope, A, B the
                    corresponding points upon a wave-surface after emergence from the eye-piece,
                    both surfaces being plane. The value of <hi rend="italic">∫μds</hi> is the same
                    along the ray A <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> A as along B <hi rend="subscript">
                        0</hi> B; and, if from any cause B <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> be slightly
                    retarded relatively to A <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, then B will be retarded
                    to the same amount relatively to A. Suppose now that the retardation in question
                    is due to a small rotation (<hi rend="italic">θ</hi>) of the wave-surface A <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 0</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> about an axis in its
                    own plane perpendicular to AB. The retardation of B <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>
                    relatively to A <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> is then A <hi rend="subscript">
                        0</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>. <hi rend="italic">θ</hi>; and in like
                    manner, if <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> be the corresponding rotation of AB, the
                    retardation is AB. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>. Since these retardations are the
                    same, we have <hi rend="italic">Φ _</hi><hi rend="underline smallcaps">
                        A(∣Bq</hi><hi rend="italic">θ</hi> AB ’ or <hi rend="italic">the magnifying
                        power is equal to the ratio of the widths of the stream of light before and
                        after passing the telescope.</hi></p>
                <p>The magnifying power is not necessarily the same in all directions. Consider the
                    case of a prism arranged as for spectrum work. Passage through the prism does
                    not alter the vertical width of the stream of light; hence there is no
                    magnifying power in this direction. What happens in a horizontal direction
                    depends upon circumstances. A single prism in the position of minimum deviation
                    does not alter the horizontal width of the beam. The same is true of a sequence
                    of any number of prisms each in the position of minimum deviation, or of the
                    combination called by Thollon a couple, when the deviation is the least that can
                    be obtained by rotating the couple as a <hi rend="italic">rigid system,</hi>
                    although a further diminution might be arrived at by violating this tie. In all
                    these cases there is neither horizontal nor vertical magnification, and the
                    instrument behaves as a telescope of power unity. If, however, a prism be so
                    placed that the angle of emergence differs from the angle of incidence, the
                    horizontal width of the beam undergoes a change. If the emergence be nearly
                    grazing, there will be a high magnifying power in the horizontal direction; and,
                    whatever may be the character of the system of prisms, the horizontal magnifying
                    power is represented by the ratio of widths. Brewster suggested that, by
                    combining two prisms with refracting edges at right angles, it would be possible
                    to secure equal magnifying power in the two directions, and thus to imitate the
                    action of an ordinary telescope.</p>
                <p>The theory of magnifying power is intimately connected with that of apparent
                    brightness. By the use of a telescope in regarding a bright body, such, for
                    example, as the moon, there is a concentration of light upon the pupil in
                    proportion to the ratio of the area of the object-glass to that of the
                        pupil.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is here
                            assumed that the object-glass is large enough to fill the whole of the
                            pupil with light; also that the glasses are perfectly transparent, and
                            that there is no loss of light by reflexion. For theoretical purposes
                            the latter requirement may be satisfied by supposing the transition
                            between one optical medium and another to be gradual in all
                        cases.</p></note> But the apparent brightness remains unaltered, the
                    apparent superficial magnitude of the object being changed in precisely the same
                    proportion, in accordance with the law just established.</p>
                <p>These fundamental propositions were proved a long while since by Cotes and Smith;
                    and a complete exposition of them, from the point of view of geometrical optics,
                    is to be found in Smith’s treatise.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    but any irregularities in the surface impress themselves upon the wave. In the
                    simplest case, that of perpendicular incidence, the irregularities are <hi
                        rend="italic">doubled,</hi> any depressed portion of the surface giving rise
                    to a retardation in the wave front of twice its own amount. It is assumed that
                    the lateral dimensions of the depressed or elevated parts are large multiples of
                    the wave-length; otherwise the assimilation of the various parts to plane waves
                    is not legitimate.</p>
                <p>In like manner, if a plane wave passes perpendicularly through a parallel plate
                    of refracting material, a small elevation <hi rend="italic">t</hi> at any part
                    of one of the surfaces introduces a retardation (μ <hi rend="italic">-</hi> 1)
                        <hi rend="italic">t</hi> in the corresponding part of the wave-surface. An
                    error in a glass surface is thus of only one-quarter of the importance of an
                    equal error in a reflecting surface. Further, if a plate, otherwise true, be
                    distorted by bending, the errors introduced at the two surfaces are
                    approximately opposite, and neutralize one another.<note anchored="true"

                        ones.</p></note></p>
                <p>In practical applications it is of importance to recognize the effects of a small
                    departure of the wave-surface from its ideal plane or spherical form. Let the

                    and the origin being the point of contact of the tangent plane. If, as happens
                    in many cases, the surface be one of symmetry round OZ, the equation of the

                <p>According to geometrical optics, the thickness of the image of a luminous line at
                    the primary focus is determined by the extreme value of ξ; and for good
                    definition in the spectroscope it is necessary to reduce this thickness as much
                    as possible. One way of attaining the desired result would be to narrow the
                    aperture; but, as we shall see later, to narrow the horizontal aperture is
                    really to throw away the peculiar advantage of large instruments. The same
                    objection, however, does not apply to narrowing the <hi rend="italic"
                        >vertical</hi> aperture; and in many spectroscopes a great improvement in
                    definition may be thus secured. In general, it is necessary that both γ and α be
                    small. Since the value of ξ does not depend on p', it would seem that in respect
                    of definition there is no advantage in avoiding astigmatism.</p>
                <p>The width of the image when η = 0 (corresponding to <hi rend="italic">y</hi> = 0)
                    is 3α <hi rend="italic">ρx</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, and vanishes when
                    α = 0, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> when there is no aberration for rays in the
                    primary plane. In this case the image reduces to a linear arc. If further γ = 0,
                    this arc becomes straight, and then the image at the primary focus is perfect to
                    this order of approximation. As an example where α = 0, the image of a luminous
                    point, formed at an equal distance on the further side of a sloped equi-convex
                    lens, may be mentioned.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">η=-2ρ'γxy</hi> (8).</p>
                <p>If γ=0, the secondary focal line is formed without aberration, but not otherwise.
                    Both focal lines are well formed when parallel rays fall upon a plano-convex
                    lens, sloped at about 30°, the curved side of the lens being turned towards the
                    parallel rays.</p>
                <p>§ 7. <hi rend="italic">Interference Fringes.</hi></p>
                <p>We have seen (§ 2) that, when two trains of parallel waves of equal wave-length
                    are superposed, the intensity of the resultant depends upon the phase-relation
                    of the components; but it is necessarily the same at all points of the
                    wave-front. It not unfrequently happens that the parallelism of the component
                    trains is approximate only, and there then arises the phenomenon known as
                    interference fringes. If the two directions of propagation be inclined on
                    opposite sides to the axis of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> at small angles <hi

                    integer.</p>
                <p>If the light were really homogeneous, the successive fringes would be similar to
                    one another and unlimited in number; moreover there would be no place that could
                    be picked out by inspection as the centre of the system. In practice λ varies,
                    and the only place of complete accordance for all kinds of light is at A, where
                        <hi rend="italic">u=0.</hi> Theoretically, there is no place of complete
                    discordance for all kinds of light, and consequently no complete blackness. In
                    consequence, however, of the fact that the range of sensitiveness of the eye is
                    limited to less than an “octave,” the centre of the first dark band (on either
                    side) is sensibly black, even when white light is employed; but it should be
                    carefully remarked that tho existence of even one band is due to selection, and
                    that the formation of several visible bands is favoured by the capability of the
                    retina to make chromatic distinctions within the visible range.</p>
                <p>The number of perceptible bands increases <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with
                    the approach of the light to homogeneity. For this purpose there are two methods
                    that may be used.</p>
                <p>We may employ light, such as that from the soda flame, which possesses <hi
                        rend="italic">ab initio</hi> a high degree of homogeneity. If the range of
                    wave-length included be a corresponding number of inter ference fringes may be
                    made visible. The above is the number obtained by Fizeau, and Michelson has
                    recently gone as far as 200,000. The narrowness of the bright line of light seen
                    in the spectroscope, and the possibility of a large number of Fresnel’s bands,
                    depend upon precisely the same conditions; the one is in truth as much an
                    interference phenomenon as the other.</p>
                <p>In the second method the original light may be highly composite, and homogeneity
                    is brought about with the aid of a spectroscope. The analogy with the first
                    method is closest if we use the spectroscope to give us a line of homogeneous
                    light in simple substitution for the artificial flame. Or, following Foucault
                    and Fizeau, we may allow the white light to pass, and subsequently analyse the
                    mixture transmitted by a narrow slit in the screen upon which the interference
                    bands are thrown. In the latter case we observe a channelled spectrum, with
                    maxima of brightness corresponding to the wave-lengths <hi rend="italic">bu</hi>
                        ∕(<hi rend="italic">n</hi> D). In either case the number of bands observable
                    is limited solely by the resolving power of the spectroscope (§ 13), and proves
                    nothing with respect to the regularity, or otherwise, of the vibrations of the
                    original light.</p>
                <p>The truth of this remark is strikingly illustrated by the possible formation,
                    with white light, of a large number of achromatic bands. The unequal widths of
                    the bands for the various colours, and consequent overlapping and obliteration,
                    met with in the usual form of the experiment, depend upon the constancy of <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> (the mutual distance of the two sources) while λ
                    varies. It is obvious that, if <hi rend="italic">b</hi> were proportional to λ,
                    the widths of the bands would be independent of λ, and that the various systems
                    would fit together perfectly. To carry out the idea in its entirety, it would be
                    necessary to use a diffraction spectrum as a source, and to duplicate this by
                    Lloyd’s method with a single reflector placed so that <hi rend="italic">b =
                        0</hi> when λ = 0. In practice a sufficiently good result could doubtless be
                    obtained with a prismatic spectrum (especially if the red and violet were
                    removed by absorbing agents) under the condition that <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                        (<hi rend="italic">b</hi> ∕λ) = 0 in the yellow-green. It is remarkable
                    that, in spite of the achromatic character of the bauds, their possible number
                    is limited still by the resolving power of the instrument used to form the
                    spectrum.</p>
                <p>If a system of Fresnel’s bands be examined through a prism, the central white
                    band undergoes an abnormal displacement, which has been supposed to be
                    inconsistent with theory. The explanation has been shown by Airy<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>‘‘Remarks on Mr Potter’s
                            Experiment on Interference,” <hi rend="italic">Phil. May.,</hi> ii. p.
                            161, 1833.</p></note> to depend upon the peculiar manner in which the
                    white band is in general formed.</p>
                <p>“Any one of the kinds of homogeneous light composing the incident heterogeneous
                    light will produce a series of bright and dark bars, unlimited in number as far
                    as the mixture of light from the two pencils extends, and undistinguishable in
                    quality. The consideration, therefore, of homogeneous light will never enable us
                    to determine which is the point that the eye immediately turns to as the centre
                    of the fringes. What then is the physical circumstance that determines the
                    centre of the fringes?</p>
                <p>“The answer is very easy. For different colours the bars have different breadths.
                    If then the bars of all colours coincide at one part of the mixture of light,
                    they will not coincide at any other part; but at equal distances on both sides
                    from that place of coincidence they will be equally far from a state of
                    coincidence. If then we can find where the bars of all colours coincide, that
                    point is the centre of the fringes.</p>
                <p>“It appears then that the centre of the fringes is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                    necessarily the point where the two pencils of light have described equal paths,
                    but is determined by considerations of a perfectly different kind The
                    distinction is important in this and in other experiments.”</p>
                <p>The effect in question depends upon the dispersive power of the prism. If <hi
                        rend="italic">v</hi> be the linear shifting due to the prism of the
                    originally central band, <hi rend="italic">v</hi> must be regarded as a function
                    of λ. Measured from the original centre, the position of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi><hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> bar is now <hi rend="italic"
                        >ν+nλD∣b.</hi></p>
                <p>The coincidence of the various bright bands occurs when this quantity is as
                    independent as possible of λ, that is, when <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is the
                    nearest integer to <hi rend="superscript"> ,t</hi> ~~D(7λ <hi rend="superscript"
                        > (3);</hi> or, as Airy expresses it in terms of the width of a band (<hi

                        >dv∣dh.</hi></p>
                <p>The apparent displacement of the white band is thus not <hi rend="italic">v</hi>

                <p>The theoretical error, dependent upon the dispersive power, involved in the
                    method of determining the refractive index of a plate by means of the
                    displacement of a system of interference fringes <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >(Light,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 607) has been discussed by Stokes.<note

                    absence of dispersion the retardation R due to the plate would be independent of

                    dispersion it is accompanied by a fictitious displacement of the fringes on the

                <p>More recently the matter has engaged the attention of Cornu,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Jour. de Physique,</hi>
                            i. p. 293, 1882.</p></note> who thus formulates the general principle
                    :—" <hi rend="italic">Dans un système de franges d'interférences produites à
                        l'aide d’une lumière hétérogène ayant un spectre continu, il existe toujours
                        une frange achromatique qui joue le rôle de frange centrale et qui se trouve
                        au point de champ où les radiations les plus intenses présentent une
                        différence de phase maximum ou minimum.”</hi></p>
                <p>In Fresnel’s experiment, if the retardation of phase due to an interposed plate,
                    or to any other cause, be F(λ), the whole relative retardation of the two
                    pencils at the point <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is</p>
                <p>≠=F(λ) + ⅛ (5); and the situation of the central, or achromatic, band is
                    determined, not by <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = 0, but by <hi rend="italic"
                        >dφ∣dκ</hi> == 0, or u = λ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> DF(λ)∕δ (6).</p>
                <p>In the theoretical statement we have supposed the source of light to be limited
                    to a mathematical point, or to be extended only in the vertical direction
                    (parallel to the bauds). Such a vertical extension, while it increases
                    illumination, has no prejudicial effect upon distinctness, the various systems
                    due to different points of the luminous line being sensibly superposed. On the
                    other hand, the horizontal dimension of the source must be confined within
                    narrow limits, the condition obviously being that the displacement of the centre
                    of the system incurred by using in succession the two edges only of the slit
                    should be small in comparison with the width of an interference band.</p>
                <p>Before quitting this subject it is proper to remark that Fresnel’s bands are more
                    influenced by diffraction than their discoverer supposed. On this account the
                    fringes are often unequally broad and undergo fluctuations of brightness. A more
                    precise calculation has been given by H. F. Weber<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Wied. Ann.,</hi> viii.

                    but the matter is too complicated to be further considered here. The
                    observations of Struve appear to agree well with the corrected theory.</p>
                <p>§ 8. <hi rend="italic">Colours of Thin Plates.</hi></p>
                <p>When plane waves of homogeneous light (λ) fall upon a parallel plate of index <hi
                        rend="italic">μ,</hi> the resultant reflected wave is made up of an infinite
                    number of components, of which the most important are the first, reflected at
                    the upper surface of the plate, and the second, transmitted at the upper
                    surface, reflected at the under surface, and then transmitted at the upper
                    surface. It is readily proved <hi rend="smallcaps">(Light,</hi> vol. xiv. p.
                    608) that so far as it depends upon the distances to be travelled in the plate
                    and in air the retardation (δ) of the second wave relatively to the first is
                    given by</p>
                <p>δ = 2,u&lt;cosα' (1), where <hi rend="italic">t</hi> denotes the thickness of the
                    plate, and α' the angle of refraction corresponding to the first entrance. If we
                    represent all the vibrations by complex quantities, from which finally the
                    imaginary parts are to be rejected, the retardation δ may be expressed by the
                    introduction of the factor e ~ <hi rend="superscript"> iκ8</hi>, where <hi

                <p>At each reflexion or refraction the amplitude of the incident wave must be
                    supposed to be altered by a certain factor. When the light proceeds from the
                    surrounding medium to the plate, the factor for reflexion will be supposed to be
                        <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and for refraction c; the corresponding quantities
                    when the progress is from the plate to the surrounding medium will be denoted by

                    have then for the first component of the reflected wave <hi rend="italic"

                    motions constituting the reflected and refracted rays to which an incident ray
                    gives rise be supposed to be reversed, they will reconstitute a reversed
                    incident ray. This gives one relation; and another is obtained from the
                    consideration that there is no ray in the second medium, such as would be
                    generated by the operation alone of either the reversed reflected or refracted
                    rays. Space does not allow of the reproduction of the argument at length, but a
                    few words may perhaps give the reader an idea of how the conclusions are arrived
                    at. The incident ray (IA) being 1, the reflected (AR) and refracted (AF) rays
                    are denoted by <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and c. When <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is
                    reversed, it gives rise to a reflected ray <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi

                <p>When <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is reversed, it gives rise to <hi rend="italic"
                        >ef</hi> along AI, and <hi rend="italic">ce</hi> along AG. Hence <hi

                <p>It is here assumed that there is no change of phase in the act of reflexion or
                    refraction, except such as can be represented by a change of sign. Professor
                    Stokes has, however, pushed the application of his method to the case where
                    changes of phase are admitted, and arrives at the conclusion that “the sum of
                    the accelerations of phase at the two reflexions is equal to the sum of the
                    accelerations at the two refractions, and the accelerations of the two
                    refractions are equal to each other.” The accelerations are supposed to be so
                    measured as to give like signs to <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It would appear, however,
                            that these laws cannot he properly applied to the calculation of
                            reflexion from a thin plate. This is sufficiently proved by the fact
                            that the resultant expression for the intensity founded upon them does
                            not vanish with the thickness. The truth is that the method of deducing
                            the aggregate reflexion from the consideration of the successive partial
                            reflexions and refractions is applicable only when the disturbance in
                            the interior of the plate is fully represented by the transverse waves
                            considered in the argument, whereas the occurrence of a change of phase
                            is probably connected with the existence of additional superficial waves
                            (§ 27). The existence of these superficial waves may be ignored when the
                            reflected and refracted waves are to be considered only at distances
                            from the surface exceeding a few wave-lengths, but in the application to
                            thin plates this limitation is violated. If indeed the method of
                            calculating the aggregate reflexion from a thin plate were sound when a
                            change of phase occurs, we could still use the expressions (2) and (3),
                            merely understanding by <hi rend="italic">b, c, e, f,</hi> factors which
                            may be complex; and the same formal relations (4) would still hold good.
                            These do not agree w’ith those found by Stokes by the method of
                            reversion; and the discrepancy indicates that, when there are changes of
                            phase, the action cf a thin plate cannot be calculated in the usual
                            way.</p></note></p>
                <p>When the third medium differs from the first, the theory of thin plates is more
                    complicated, and need not here be discussed. One particular case, however, may
                    be mentioned. When a thin transparent<pb break="no"

                    colours should be visible, all the light being ultimately reflected, whatever
                    the wave length may be. The experiment may be tried with a thin layer of gelatin
                    on a polished silver plate. In other cases where a different result is observed,
                    the inference is that either the metal does not reflect perfectly, or else that
                    the material of which the film is composed is not sufficiently transparent.</p>
                <p>Theory and observation alike show that the transmitted colours of a thin plate,
                        <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a soap film or a layer of air, arc very
                    inferior to those reflected. Specimens of ancient glass, which have undergone
                    superficial decomposition, on the other hand, sometimes show transmitted colours
                    of remarkable brilliancy. The probable explanation, suggested by Brewster, is
                    that we have here to deal not merely with one, but with a series of thin plates
                    of not very different thicknesses. It is evident that with such a series the
                    transmitted colours would be much purer, and the reflected much brighter, than
                    usual. If the thicknesses are strictly equal, certain wave-lengths must still be
                    absolutely missing in the reflected light; while on the other hand a constancy
                    of the interval between the plates will in general lead to a special
                    preponderance of light of some other wave-length for which all the component
                    parts as they ultimately emerge are in agreement as to phase.<note

                <p>All that can be expected from a physical theory is the determination of the
                    composition of the light reflected from or transmitted by a thin plate in terms
                    of the composition of the incident light. The further question of the chromatic
                    character of the mixtures thus obtained belongs rather to physiological optics,
                    and cannot be answered without a complete knowledge of the chromatic relations
                    of the spectral colours themselves. Experiments upon this subject have been made
                    by various observers, and especially by Maxwell,<note anchored="true"

                    and to this the reader who desires further information must be referred, with
                    the remark that the true colours are not seen in the usual manner of operating
                    with a plate of air enclosed between glass surfaces, on account of the
                    contamination with white light reflected at the other surfaces of the glasses.
                    This objection is avoided when a soap film is employed, to the manifest
                    advantage of the darker colours, such as the red of the first order. The colours
                    of Newton’s scale are met with also in the light transmitted by a somewhat thin
                    plate of doubly-refracting material, such as mica, the plane of analysis being
                    perpendicular to that of primitive polarization.</p>
                <p>The same series of colours occur also in other optical experiments, <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> at the centre of the illuminated area when light
                    issuing from a point passes through a small round aperture in an otherwise
                    opaque screen (§ 10).</p>
                <p>The colours of which we have been speaking are those formed at nearly
                    perpendicular incidence, so that the retardation (reckoned as a distance), viz.,
                    2μ <hi rend="italic">t</hi> cos α', is sensibly independent of λ. This state of
                    things may be greatly departed from when the thin plate is rarer than its
                    surroundings, and the incidence is such that <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> is nearly
                    equal to 90°, for then, in consequence of the powerful dispersion, cos <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> ' may vary greatly as we pass from one colour to
                    another. Under these circumstances the series of colours entirely alters its
                    character, and the bands (corresponding to a graduated thickness) may even lose
                    their coloration, becoming sensibly black and white through many
                        alternations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    general explanation of this remarkable phenomenon was suggested by Newton, but
                    it does not appear to have been followed out in accordance with the wave
                    theory.</p>
                <p>Let us suppose that plane waves of white light travelling in glass are incident
                    at angle <hi rend="italic">a</hi> upon a plate of air, which is bounded again on
                    the other side by glass. If <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> be the index of the <hi
                        rend="italic">glass, a</hi> the angle of refraction, then sinα' = μsinα; and
                    the retardation, expressed by the equivalent distance in air, is <hi
                        rend="italic">2t</hi> sec <hi rend="italic">a' - μ . 2t</hi> tan <hi
                        rend="italic">a'</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">a = 2t cos a';</hi> and the
                    retardation in <hi rend="italic">phase</hi> is <hi rend="italic">2tcosα'∕λ</hi>,
                    λ being as usual the wavelength in air.</p>
                <p>The first thing to be noticed is that, when α approaches the critical angle, cos
                    α' becomes as small as we please, and that consequently the retardation
                    corresponding to a given thickness is very much less than at perpendicular
                    incidence. Hence the glass surfaces need not be so close as usual.</p>
                <p>A second feature is the increased brilliancy of the light. According to (7) the
                    intensity of the reflected light when at a maximum (sin½κδ = 1) is 4 <hi
                        rend="italic">e</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕(1 + <hi rend="italic"
                        >e</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. At
                    perpendicular incidence <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is about ⅕, and the intensity
                    is somewhat small; but, as cos <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> approaches zero, <hi
                        rend="italic">e</hi> approaches unity (§ 2G), and the brilliancy is much
                    increased.</p>
                <p>But the peculiarity which most demands attention is the lessened influence of a
                    variation in λ upon the phase-retardation. A diminution of λ of itself increases
                    the retardation of phase, but, since waves of shorter wave-length are more
                    refrangible, this effect may be more or less perfectly compensated by the
                    greater obliquity, and consequent diminution in the value of cos <hi
                        rend="italic">a'.</hi> We will investigate the conditions under which the
                    retardation of phase is stationary in spite of a variation of λ.</p>
                <p>In order that λ <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">α</hi> '
                    may be stationary, we must have λsin <hi rend="italic">α'dα</hi> ' + cos a' <hi

                <p>α' = 79° 30'.</p>
                <p>At this angle of refraction, and with this kind of glass, the retardation of
                    phase is accordingly nearly independent of wave-length, and therefore the bands
                    formed, as the thickness varies, are approximately achromatic. Perfect
                    achromatism would be possible only under a law of dispersion</p>

                <p>If the source of light be distant aud very small, the black bands are wonderfully
                    fine and numerous. The experiment is best made (after Newton) with a
                    right-angled prism, whose hypothenusal surface may be brought into approximate
                    contact with a plate of black glass. The bands should be observed with a convex
                    lens, of about 8 inches focus. If the eye be at twice this distance from the
                    prism, and the lens be held midway between, the advantages are combined of a
                    large field and of maximum distinctness.</p>

                    of the coloured rings; and yet by viewing them through a prism great multitudes
                    of those rings have discovered themselves.”</p>
                <p>Newton was evidently much struck with these “so odd circumstances ;” and he
                    explains the occurrence of the rings at unusual thicknesses as due to the
                    dispersing power of the prism. The blue system being more refracted than the
                    red, it is possible under certain conditions that the <hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi><hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> blue ring may be so much displaced
                    relatively to the corresponding red ring as <hi rend="italic">at one part of the
                        circumference</hi> to compensate for the different diameters. A white stripe
                    may thus be formed in a situation where without the prism the mixture of colours
                    would be complete, so far as could be judged by the eye.</p>
                <p>The simplest case that can be considered is when the “thin plate” is bounded by
                    plane surfaces inclined to one another at a small angle. By drawing back the
                    prism (whose edge is parallel to the intersection of the above-mentioned planes)
                    it will always be possible so to adjust the effective dispersing power as to
                    bring the <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> bars to
                    coincidence for any two assigned colours, and therefore approximately for the
                    entire spectrum. The formation of the achromatic band, or rather central black
                    band, depends indeed upon the same principles as the fictitious shifting of the
                    centre of a system of Fresnel’s bands when viewed through a prism.</p>
                <p>But neither Newton nor, as would appear, any of his successors has explained why
                    the bands should be more numerous than usual, and under certain conditions
                    sensibly achromatic for a large number of alternations. It is evident that, in
                    the particular case of the wedge-shaped plate above specified, such a result
                    would not occur. The width of the bands for any colour would be proportional to
                    λ, as well after the displacement by the prism as before; and the succession of
                    colours formed in white light and the number of perceptible bands would be much
                    as usual.</p>

                <p>The peculiarity to be explained appears to depend upon the <hi rend="italic"
                        >curvature</hi> of the surfaces bounding the plate. For simplicity suppose
                    that the lower surface is plane (<hi rend="italic">y</hi> =0), and that the

                    as the square root of the wave-length, instead of as the first power. Even in
                    this case the overlapping and subsequent obliteration of the bands is greatly
                    retarded by the use of the prism, but the full development of the phenomenon
                    requires that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> should be finite. Let us inquire what is
                    the condition in order that the width of the band of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi><hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> order may be stationary, as λ varies.
                    By (14) it is necessary that the variation of λ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    ∕(½ <hi rend="italic">n</hi> λ- <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) should vanish. Hence
                        <hi rend="italic">a=¼nλ,</hi> so that the interval between the surfaces at
                    the place where the n <hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> band is formed should be
                    half due to curvature and half to imperfect contact at the place of closest
                    approach. If this condition be satisfied, the achromatism of the <hi

                    prism, carries with it the achromatism of a large number of neighbouring bands,
                    and thus gives rise to the remarkable effects described by Newton.</p>
                <p>§ 9. <hi rend="italic">Newton’s Diffusion Rings.</hi></p>
                <p>In the fourth part of the second book of his <hi rend="italic">Optics</hi> Newton
                    investigates another series of rings, usually (though not very appropriately)
                    known as the colours of thick plates. The fundamental experiment is as follows.
                    At the centre of curvature of a concave looking-glass, quicksilvered behind, is
                    placed an opaque card, perforated by a small hole through which sunlight is
                    admitted. The main body of the light returns through the aperture; but a series
                    of concentric rings are seen upon the card, the formation of which was proved by
                    Newton to require the co-operation of the two surfaces of the mirror. Thus the
                    diameters of the rings depend upon the thickness of the glass, and none are
                    formed when the glass is replaced by a metallic speculum. The brilliancy of the
                    rings depends upon imperfect polish of the anterior surface of the glass, and
                    may be augmented by a coat of diluted milk, a device used by the Duc de
                    Chaulnes. The rings may also be well observed without a screen in the manner
                    recommended by Stokes. For this purpose all that is required is to place a <hi
                        rend="italic">small</hi> flame at the centre of curvature of the prepared
                    glass, so as to concide with its image. The rings are then seen surrounding the
                    flame and occupying a definite position in space.</p>
                <p>The explanation of the rings, suggested by Young, and developed by Herschel,
                    refers them to interference between one portion of light scattered or diffracted
                    by a particle of dust, and then regularly refracted and reflected, and another
                    portion first regularly refracted and reflected and then diffracted at emergence
                    by the same particle. It has been shown by Stokes<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Camb. Trans.,</hi> ix.
                            p. 147, 1851.</p></note> that no regular interference is to be expected
                    between portions of light diffracted by different particles of dust.</p>
                <p>In the memoir of Stokes will be found a very complete discussion of the whole
                    subject, and to this the reader must be referred who desires a fuller knowledge.
                    Our limits will not allow us to do more than touch upon one or two points. The
                    condition of fixity of the rings when observed in air, and of distinctness when
                    a screen is used, is that the systems due to all parts of the diffusing surface
                    should concide; and it is fulfilled only when, as in Newton’s experiments, the
                    source and screen are in the plane passing through the centre of curvature of
                    the glass.</p>
                <p>As the simplest for actual calculation, we will consider a little further the
                    case where the glass is plane and parallel, of thickness <hi rend="italic"
                        >t</hi> and index <hi rend="italic">μ,</hi> and is supplemented by a lens at
                    whose focus the source of light is placed. This lens acts both as collimator aud
                    as object-glass, so that the combination of lens and plane mirror replaces the
                    concave mirror of Newton’s experiment. The retardation is calculated in the same
                    way as for thin plates. In fig. 2 the diffracting particle is situated at B, and
                    we have to find the relative retardation of the two rays which emerge finally at
                    inclination <hi rend="italic">θ,</hi> the one diffracted at emergence following
                    the path ABDBIE, and the other diffracted at entrance and following the path
                    ABFGH. The retardation of the former from B to I is 2μ + BI, and of the latter
                    from B to the equivalent place G is 2μBF. Now FB=√sec0', 0' being the angle of
                    refraction; BI = 2Ztan0'sin0; so that the relative retardation R is given by</p>
                <p>R = 2μ(!{l + μ^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> tan <hi rend="italic">θ'</hi> sin
                    0 -sec 0'} = 2μi(l - cos 0 ’).</p>
                <p>If 0,0' be small, we may take</p>
                <p>R = 2Z0 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕ <hi rend="subscript"> μ</hi> (1), as
                    sufficiently approximate.</p>
                <p>The condition of distinctness is here satisfied, since R is the same for every
                    ray emergent parallel to a given one. The rays of one parallel system are
                    collected by the lens to a focus at a definite point in the neighbourhood of the
                    original source.</p>
                <p>The formula (1) was discussed by Herschel, and shown to agree with Newton’s
                    measures. The law of formation of the rings follows immediately from the
                    expression for the retardation, the radius of the ring of n <hi
                        rend="superscript"> th</hi> order being proportional to <hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi> and to the square root of the wave-length.</p>
                <p>§10. <hi rend="italic">Huygens's Principle. Theory of Shadows.</hi></p>
                <p>The objection most frequently brought against the undulatory theory in its
                    infancy was the difficulty of explaining in accordance with it the existence of
                    shadows. Thanks to Fresnel and his followers, this department of optics is now
                    precisely the one in which the theory has secured its greatest triumphs.</p>
                <p>The principle employed in these investigations is due to Huygens, and may be thus
                    formulated. If round the origin of waves an ideal closed surface be drawn, the
                    whole action of the waves in the region beyond may be regarded as due to the
                    motion continually propagated across the various elements of this surface. The
                    wave motion due to any element of the surface is called a <hi rend="italic"
                        >secondary</hi> wave, and in estimating the total effect regard must be paid
                    to the phases as well as the amplitudes of the components. It is usually
                    convenient to choose as the surface of resolution a <hi rend="italic"
                        >waυe-front, i.e.,</hi> a surface at which the primary vibrations are in one
                    phase.</p>
                <p>Any obscurity that may hang over Huygens’s principle is due mainly to the
                    indefiniteness of thought and expression which we must be content to put up with
                    if we wish to avoid pledging ourselves as to the character of the vibrations. In
                    the application to sound, where we know what we are dealing with, the matter is
                    simple enough in principle, although mathematical difficulties would often stand
                    in the way of the calculations we might wish to make. The ideal surface of
                    resolution may be there regarded as a flexible lamina; and we know that, if by
                    forces locally applied every element of the lamina be made to move normally to
                    itself exactly as the air at that place does, the external aerial motion is
                    fully determined. By the principle of superposition the whole effect may be
                    found by integration of the partial effects due to each element of the surface,
                    the other elements remaining at rest.</p>
                <p>We will now consider in detail the important case in which uniform plane waves
                    are resolved at a surface coincident with a wave-front (OQ). We imagine the
                    wave-front divided into elementary rings or zones, called Huygens’s zones, by
                    spheres described round P (the point at which the aggregate effect is to be
                    estimated), the first sphere, touching the plane at O, with a radius equal to
                    PO, and the succeeding spheres with radii increasing at each step by ½λ. There
                    are thus marked out a series of circles, whose radii <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    are given by <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + <hi
                        rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> = (<hi
                        rend="italic">r</hi> + ½ <hi rend="italic">n</hi> λ) <hi rend="superscript">
                        2</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">=nλr</hi> nearly; so that the rings are at first of nearly
                    equal area. Now the effect upon P of each element of the plane is proportional
                    to its area; but it depends also upon the distance from P, and possibly upon the
                    inclination of the secondary ray to the direction of vibration and to the
                    wave-front. These questions will be further considered in connexion with the
                    dynamical theory; but under all ordinary circumstances the result is independent
                    of the precise answer that may be given. All that it is necessary to assume is
                    that the effects of the successive zones gradually diminish, whether from the
                    increasing obliquity of the secondary ray or because (on account of the
                    limitation of the region of integration) the zones become at last more and more
                    incomplete. The component vibrations at P due to the successive zones are thus
                    nearly equal in amplitude and opposite in phase (the phase of each corresponding
                    to that of the infinitesimal circle midway between the boundaries), and the
                    series which we have to sum is one in which the terms are alternately opposite
                    in sign and, while at first nearly constant in numerical magnitude, gradually
                    diminish to zero. In such a series each term may be regarded as very nearly
                    indeed destroyed by the halves of its immediate neighbours, and thus the sum of
                    the whole series is represented by half the first term, which stands over
                    uncompensated. The question is thus reduced to that of finding the effect of the
                    first zone, or central circle, of which the area is πλ <hi rend="italic"
                    >r.</hi></p>
                <p>We have seen that the problem before us is independent of the law of the
                    secondary wave as regards obliquity; but the result of the integration
                    necessarily involves the law of the intensity and phase of a secondary wave as a
                    function of <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> the distance from the origin. And we may
                    in fact, as was done by A. Smith,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the result of the integration with that obtained by supposing the primary wave
                    to pass on to P without resolution.</p>
                <p>Now as to the phase of the secondary wave, it might appear natural to suppose
                    that it starts from any point Q with the phase of the primary wave, so that on
                    arrival at P it is retarded by the amount corresponding to QP. But a little
                    consideration will prove that in that case the series of secondary waves could
                    not reconstitute the primary wave. For the aggregate effect of the secondary
                    waves is the half of that of the first Huygens zone, and it is the central
                    element only of that zone for which the distance to be travelled is equal to <hi
                        rend="italic">r.</hi> Let us conceive the zone in question to be divided
                    into infinitesimal rings of equal area. The effects due to each of these rings
                    are equal in amplitude and of phase ranging uniformly over half a complete
                    period. The phase of the resultant is midway between those of the extreme
                    elements, that is to say, a quarter of a period behind that due to the element
                    at the centre of the circle. It is accordingly necessary to suppose that the
                    secondary waves start with a phase one-quarter of a period in advance of that of
                    the primary wave at the surface of resolution.</p>
                <p>Further, it is evident that account must be taken of the variation of phase in
                    estimating the magnitude of the effect at P of the first zone. The middle

                    it is necessary to suppose that the integrated term vanishes at the upper limit.
                    And it is important to notice that without some further understanding the
                    integral is really ambiguous. According to the assumed law of the secondary
                    wave, the result must actually depend upon the precise radius of the outer
                    boundary of the region of integration, supposed to be exactly circular. This
                    case is, however, at most very special and exceptional. We may usually suppose
                    that a large number of the outer rings are incomplete, so that the integrated
                    term at the upper limit may properly be taken to vanish. If a formal proof be
                    desired, it may be obtained by introducing into the integral a factor such as
                        <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> c~</hi><hi rend="italic superscript smallcaps">
                        i,</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> p,</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi> whieh
                        <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is ultimately made to diminish without limit.</p>
                <p>When the primary wave is plane, the area of the first Huygens zoneisπλr, and,
                    since the secondary waves vary as r^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>,
                    theintensity is independent of <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> as of course it should
                    be. If, however, the primary wave be spherical, and of radius <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi> at the wave-front of resolution, then we know that at a distance <hi
                        rend="italic">r</hi> further on the amplitude of the primary wave will be
                    diminished in the ratio α∙.(r + α). This may be regarded as a consequence of the
                    altered area of the first Huygens zone. For, if <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be its
                    radius, we have</p>
                <p>{(r+⅛λ) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">a + r</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> j</hi></p>
                <p>Since the distance to be travelled by the secondary waves is still <hi
                        rend="italic">r,</hi> we see how the effect of the first zone, and therefore
                    of the whole series is proportional toα∕(α + r). In like manner may be treated
                    other cases, such as that of a primary wave-front of unequal principal
                    curvatures.</p>
                <p>The general explanation of the formation of shadows may also be conveniently
                    based upon Huygens’s zones. If the point under consideration be so far away from
                    the geometrical shadow that a large number of the earlier zones are complete,
                    then the illumination, determined sensibly by the first zone, is the same as if
                    there were no obstruction at all. If, on the other hand, the point be well
                    immersed in the geometrical shadow, the earlier zones are altogether missing,
                    and, instead of a series of terms beginning with finite numerical magnitude and
                    gradually diminishing to zero, we have now to deal with one of which the terms
                    diminish to zero <hi rend="italic">at both ends.</hi> The sum of such a series
                    is very approximately zero, each term being neutralized by the halves of its
                    immediate neighbours, which are of the opposite sign. The question of light or
                    darkness then depends upon whether the series begins or ends abruptly. With few
                    exceptions, abruptness can occur only in the presence of the first term, viz.,
                    when the secondary wave of least retardation is unobstructed, or when a <hi
                        rend="italic">ray</hi> passes through the point under consideration.
                    According to the undulatory theory the light cannot be regarded strictly as
                    travelling along a ray; but the existence of an unobstructed ray implies that
                    the system of Huygens’s zones can be commenced, and, if a large number of these
                    zones are fully developed and do not terminate abruptly, the illumination is
                    unaffected by the neighbourhood of obstacles. Intermediate cases in which a few
                    zones only are formed belong especially to the province of diffraction.</p>
                <p>An interesting exception to the general rule that full brightness requires the
                    existence of the first zone occurs when the obstacle assumes the form of a small
                    circular disk parallel to the plane of the incident waves. In the earlier half
                    of the 18th century<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the circular shadow was occupied by a bright point of light, but the observation
                    passed into oblivion until Poisson brought forward as an objection to Fresnel’s
                    theory that it required at the centre of a circular shadow a point as bright as
                    if no obstacle were intervening. If we conceive the primary wave to be broken up
                    at the plane of the disk, a system of Huygens’s zones can be constructed which
                    begin from the circumference; and the first zone external to the disk plays the
                    part ordinarily taken by the centre of the entire system. The whole effect is
                    the half of that of the first existing zone, and this is sensibly the same as if
                    there were no obstruction.</p>
                <p>When light passes through a small circular or annular aperture, the illumination
                    at any point along the axis depends upon the precise relation between the
                    aperture and the distance from it at which the point is taken. If, as in the
                    last paragraph, we imagine a system of zones to be drawn commencing from the
                    inner circular boundary of the aperture, the question turns upon the manner in
                    which the series terminates at the outer boundary. If the aperture be such as to
                    fit exactly an integral number of zones, the aggregate effect may be regarded as
                    the half of those due to the first and last zones. If the number of zones be
                    even, the action of the first and last zones are antagonistic, and there is
                    complete darkness at the point. If on the other hand the number of zones be odd,
                    the effects conspire; and the illumination (proportional to the square of the
                    amplitude) is four times as great as if there were no obstruction at all.</p>
                <p>The process of augmenting the resultant illumination at a particular point by
                    stopping some of the secondary rays may be carried much further.<note

                    photography it is easy to prepare a plate, transparent where the zones of odd
                    order fall, and opaque where those of even order fall. Such a plate has the
                    power of a condensing lens, and gives an illumination out of all proportion to
                    what could be obtained without it. An even greater effect (fourfold) would be
                    attained if it were possible to provide that the stoppage of the light from the
                    alternate zones were replaced by a phase-reversal without loss of amplitude.</p>
                <p>In such experiments the narrowness of the zones renders necessary a pretty close
                    approximation to the geometrical conditions. Thus in the case of the circular
                    disk, equidistant (r) from the source of light and from the screen upon whieh
                    the shadow is observed, the width of the first exterior zone is given by <hi

                    that this zone may be perfectly formed, there should be no error in the
                    circumference of the order of '001 cm.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    from an external mirror. In the absence of a heliostat it is more convenient to

                    the first instance to homogeneous light, and that, in accordance with Fourier’s
                    theorem, each homogeneous component of a mixture may be treated separately. When
                    the original light is white, the presence of some components and the absence of
                    others will usually give rise to coloured effects, variable with the precise
                    circumstances of the case.</p>
                <p>Although what we have to say upon the subject is better postponed until we
                    consider the dynamical theory, it is proper to point out at once that there is
                    an element of assumption in the application of Huygens’s principle to the
                    calculation of the effects produced by opaque screens of limited extent.
                    Properly applied, the principle could not fail; but, as may readily be proved in
                    the case of sonorous waves, it is not in strictness sufficient to assume the
                    expression for a secondary wave suitable when the primary wave is undisturbed,
                    with mere limitation of the integration to the transparent parts of the screen.
                    But, except perhaps in the case of very fine gratings, it is probable that the
                    error thus caused is insignificant; for the incorrect estimation of the
                    secondary waves will be limited to distances of a few wave-lengths only from the
                    boundary of opaque and transparent parts.</p>

                <p>A very general problem in diffraction is the investigation of the distribution of
                    light over a screen upon which impinge divergent or convergent spherical waves
                    after passage through various diffracting apertures. When the waves are
                    convergent and the recipient screen is placed so as to contain the centre of
                    convergency—the image of the original radiant point, the calculation assumes a
                    less complicated form. This class of phenomena was investigated by Fraunhofer
                    (upon principles laid down by Fresnel), and are sometimes called after his name.
                    We may conveniently commence with them on account of their simplicity and great

                    and η are taken universely proportional to λ. A diminution of λ thus leads to a

                <p>If the wave-length remains unchanged, similar effects are produced by an increase
                    in the scale of the aperture. The linear dimension of the diffraction pattem is

                <p>By the principle of energy the illumination over the entire focal plane must be

                <p>It will be observed that, while the total intensity is proportional to <hi

                    the focal plane increased with it, but there is also a concentration of the
                    diffraction pattern. The form of (3) shows immediately that, if <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> be altered, the
                    coordinates of any characteristic point in the pattern vary as <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The contraction of the diffraction pattern with increase of aperture is of
                    fundamental importance with reference to the resolving power of optical
                    instruments. According to common optics, where images are absolute, the
                    diffraction pattern is supposed<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n456/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0456-0431"/> to be infinitely small, and two radiant
                    points, however near together, form separated images. This is tantamount to an
                    assumption that λ is infinitely small. The actual finiteness of λ imposes a
                    limit upon the separating or resolving power of an optical instrument.</p>
                <p>This indefiniteness of images is sometimes said to be due to diffraction by the
                    edge of the aperture, and proposals have even been made for curing it by causing
                    the transition between the interrupted and transmitted parts of the primary wave
                    to be less abrupt. Such a view of the matter is altogether misleading. What
                    requires explanation is not the imperfection of actual images so much as the
                    possibility of their being as good as we find them.</p>
                <p>At the focal point (ξ = 0,η = 0) all the secondary waves agree in phase, and the
                    intensity is easily expressed, whatever be the form of the aperture. From the
                    general formula (2), if A be the <hi rend="italic">area</hi> of aperture,</p>
                <p>I <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = A <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕λ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕ <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi> (7).</p>
                <p>The formation of a sharp image of the radiant point requires that the
                    illumination become insignificant when ξ, η attain small values, and this
                    insignificance can only arise as a consequence of discrepancies of phase among
                    the secondary waves from various parts of the aperture. So long as there is no
                    sensible discrepancy of phase there can be no sensible diminution of brightness
                    as compared with that to be found at the focal point itself. We may go further,
                    and lay it down that there can be no considerable loss of brightness until the
                    difference of phase of the waves proceeding from the nearest and furthest parts
                    of the aperture amounts to ⅛λ.</p>
                <p>When the difference of phase amounts to λ, we may expect the resultant
                    illumination to be very much reduced. In the particular case of a rectangular
                    aperture the course of things can be readily followed, especially if we conceive
                        <hi rend="italic">f</hi> to be infinite. In the direction (suppose
                    horizontal) for which <hi rend="italic">η</hi> = 0, <hi rend="italic"
                        >ξ∕f=sin0</hi>, the phases of the secondary waves range over a complete
                    period when sinθ = λ∕α, and, since all parts of the horizontal aperture are
                    equally effective, there is in this direction a complete compensation and
                    consequent absence of illumination. When sin0 = ⅛λ∕α, the phases range one and a
                    half periods, and there is revival of illumination. We may compare the
                    brightness with that in the direction 0 = 0. The phase of the resultant
                    amplitude is the same as that due to the central secondary wave, and the
                    discrepancies of phase among the components reduce the amplitude in the
                    proportion a- <hi rend="superscript"> 3,r</hi></p>

                    like manner we may find the illumination in any other direction, and it is
                    obvious that it vanishes when sin 0 is any multiple of λ∕α.</p>
                <p>The reason of the augmentation of resolving power with aperture will now be
                    evident. The larger the aperture the smaller are the angles through which it is
                    necessary to deviate from the principal direction in order to bring in specified
                    discrepancies of phase—the more concentrated is the image.</p>
                <p>In many cases the subject of examination is a luminous line of uniform intensity,
                    the various points of which are to be treated as independent sources of light.
                    If the image of the line be <hi rend="italic">ξ</hi> = 0, the intensity at any

                <p>The distribution of illumination in the image of a luminous line is shown by the
                    curve ABC (fig. 5), representing the value of the function sin <hi

                    values of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is similar, OA being a line of symmetry.</p>
                <p>Let us now consider the distribution of brightness in the image of a double line
                    whose components are of equal strength, and at such an angular interval that the
                    central line in the image of one coincides with the first zero of brightness in
                    the image of the other. In fig. 5 the curve of brightness for ono component is
                    ABC, and for tho other OΛ ’ C ’; and the curve representing half the combined
                    brightnesses is ΕΈΕ. The brightness (corresponding to B) midway between the two
                    central points AA' is ’ 8106 of the brightness at the central points themselves.
                    We may consider this to be about the limit of closeness at which there could be

                    accustomed to his instrument would recognize the duplicity with certainty. The
                    obliquity, corresponding to <hi rend="italic">u</hi> = π, is such that the
                    phases of the secondary waves range over a complete period, <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> such that the projection of the horizontal aperture upon this
                    direction is one wave-length. We conclude that <hi rend="italic">a double line
                        cannot be fairly resolved unless its components subtend an angle exceeding
                        that subtended by the wave-length of light at a distance equal to the
                        horizontal aperture.</hi> This rule is convenient on account of its
                    simplicity; and it is sufficiently accurate in view of the necessary uncertainty
                    as to what exactly is meant by resolution.</p>
                <p>On the experimental confirmation of the theory of the resolving power of
                    rectangular apertures, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> vol. xvii. p.
                    807.</p>
                <p>If the angular interval between the components of a double line be half as great
                    again as that supposed in the figure, the brightness midway between is ‘1802 as
                    against 1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 0450 at the central lines of each
                    image. Such a falling off in the middle must be more than sufficient for
                    resolution. If the angle subtended by the components of a double line be twice
                    that subtended by the wave-length at a distance equal to the horizontal
                    aperture, the central bands are just clear of one another, and there is a line
                    of absolute blackness in the middle of the combined images.</p>
                <p>Since the limitation of the width of the central band in the image of a luminous
                    line depends upon discrepancies of phase among the secondary waves, and since
                    the discrepancy is greatest for the waves which come from the edges of the
                    aperture, the question arises how far the operation of the central parts of the
                    aperture is advantageous. If we imagine the aperture reduced to two equal narrow
                    slits bordering its edges, compensation will evidently be complete when the
                    projection on an oblique direction is equal to ⅛λ, instead of λ as for the
                    complete aperture. By this procedure the width of the central band in the
                    diffraction pattern is halved, and so far an advantage is attained. But, as will
                    be evident, the bright bands bordering the central band are now not inferior to
                    it in brightness; in fact, a band similar to the central band is reproduced an
                    indefinite number of times, so long as there is no sensible discrepancy of phase
                    in the secondary waves proceeding from the various parts of the <hi
                        rend="italic">same</hi> slit. Under these circumstances the narrowing of the
                    band is paid for at a ruinous price, and the arrangement must be condemned
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>A more moderate suppression of the central parts is, however, sometimes
                    advantageous. Theory and experiment alike prove that a double line, of which the
                    components are equally strong, is better resolved when, for example, one-sixth
                    of the horizontal aperture is blocked off <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> by a
                    central screen; or the rays quite at the centre may be allowed to pass, while
                    others a little further removed are blocked off. Stops, each occupying
                    one-eighth of the width, and with centres situated at the points of trisection,
                    answer well the required purpose.</p>
                <p>It has already been suggested that the principle of energy requires that the

                <p>In both cases the image of a mathematical point is thus a symmetrical ring
                    system. The greatest brightness is at the centre, where <hi rend="italic">dC =
                        2πρ dp ,</hi> C = πR <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>For a certain distance outwards this remains sensibly unimpaired, and then
                    gradually diminishes to zero, as the secondary waves become discrepant in phase.
                    The subsequent revivals of brightness forming the bright rings are necessarily
                    of inferior brilliancy as compared with the central disk.</p>
                <p>The first dark ring in the diffraction pattern of the complete circular aperture
                    occurs when r∕∕= l∙2197×λ∕2R (15).</p>
                <p>We may compare this· with the corresponding result for a rectangular aperture of
                    width <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">&lt;// = a/«;</hi> and it
                    appears that in consequence of the preponderance of the central parts, the
                    compensation in the case of the circle does not set in at so small an obliquity
                    as when the circle is replaced by a rectangular aperture, whose side is equal to
                    the diameter of the circle.</p>
                <p>Again, if we compare the complete circle with a narrow annular aperture of the
                    same radius, we see that in the latter case the first dark ring occurs at a much
                    smaller obliquity, viz., <hi rend="italic">r∣f =</hi><hi rend="superscript">

                <p>The efficiency of a telescope is of course intimately connected with the size of
                    the disk by which it represents a mathematical point. The resolving power upon
                    double stars of telescopes of various apertures has been investigated by Dawes
                    and others <hi rend="smallcaps">(Optics,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 807), with results
                    that agree fairly well with theory.</p>
                <p>If we integrate the expression (8) for I <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> with
                    respect to <hi rend="italic">r∖,</hi> we shall obtain a result applicable to a

                <p>It will be seen that the distribution ot brightness does not differ greatly from

                <p>In the compound image the illumination at the geometrical focus of one of the

                <p>We find by actual calculation from the series, L(π)=∙0164, L(⅜π) = *1671, L(0) =

                    circular aperture is distinctly less than that of the rectangular aperture of
                    equal width. Hence a telescope will not resolve a double line unless the angular
                    interval between them decidedly exceeds that subtended by the wave-length of
                    light at a distance equal to the diameter of the object-glass. Experiment shows
                    that resolution begins when the angular interval is about a tenth part greater
                    than that mentioned.</p>
                <p>If we integrate (30) with respect to ξ between the limits - ∞ and + oo we obtain
                    πR <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, as has already been remarked. This represents
                    the whole illumination over the focal plane due to a radiant point whose image
                    is at 0, or, reciprocally, the illumination at 0 (the same as at any other
                    point) due to an infinitely extended luminous area. If we take the integration
                    from ξ (supposed positive) to ∞ we get the illumination at 0 due to a uniform
                    luminous area extending over this region, that is to say, the illumination at a
                    point situated at distance ξ outside the border of the geometrical image of a
                    large uniform area. If the point is supposed to be inside the geometrical image
                    and at a distance £ from its edge, we are to take the in tegration from - ∞ to
                    ξ. Thus, if we choose the scale of intensities so that the full intensity is
                    unity, then the intensity at a distance corresponding to + <hi rend="italic"

                <p>It may perhaps have struck the reader that there is some want of rigour in our
                    treatment of (30) when we integrate it over the whole focal plane of <hi
                        rend="italic">ξ, -η,</hi> inasmuch as in the proof of the formulae ξ and <hi
                        rend="italic">η are</hi> supposed to be small. The inconsistency becomes
                    very-apparent when we observe that according to the formulae there is no limit
                    to the relative retardation of secondary waves coming from various parts of the
                    aperture, whereas in reality this retardation could never exceed the longest
                    line capable of being drawn within the aperture. It will be worth while to
                    consider this point a little further, although our limits forbid an extended
                    treatment. _</p>
                <p>The formula becomes rigorous if we regard it as giving the illumination on the

                <p>It appears therefore that according to the assumed law of the secondary wave the
                    total illumination is proportional to the area of aperture, only under the
                    restriction that the linear dimensions of the aperture are very large in
                    comparison with the wave-length.</p>
                <p>A word as to the significance of (39) may not be out of place. We know that</p>

                    direction; and it follows that <hi rend="italic">ffψsinθdθdψ</hi> satisfies the
                    same equation. Now this, if the integration be taken over the hemisphere 0 = 0
                    to 0 = ⅛π, must become a function of <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> or ∖∕(≈ <hi

                <p>The results of the preceding theory of circular apertures admit of an interesting
                    application to <hi rend="italic">coronas,</hi> such as are often seen encircling
                    the sun and moon. They are due to the interposition of small spherules of water,
                    which act the part of diffracting obstacles. In order to the formation of a
                    well-defined corona it is essential that the particles be exclusively, or
                    preponderatingly, of one size.</p>
                <p>If the origin of light be treated as infinitely small, and be seen in focus,
                    whether with the naked eye or with the aid of a telescope, the whole of the
                    light in the absence of obstacles would be concentrated in the immediate
                    neighbourhood of the focus. At other parts of the field the effect is the same,
                    by Babinet’s principle, whether the imaginary screen in front of the
                    object-glass is generally transparent but studded with a number of opaque
                    circular disks, or is generally opaque but perforated with corresponding
                    apertures. Consider now the light diffracted in a direction many times more
                    oblique than any with which we should be concerned, were the whole aperture
                    uninterrupted, and take first the effect of a single small aperture. The light
                    in the proposed direction is that determined by the size of the small aperture
                    in accordance with the laws already investigated, and its phase depends upon the
                    position of the aperture. If we take a direction such that the light (of given
                    wave-length) from a single aperture vanishes, the evanescence continues even
                    when the whole series of apertures is brought into contemplation. Hence,
                    whatever else may happen, there must be a system of dark rings formed, the same
                    as from a single small aperture. In directions other than these it is a more
                    delicate question how the partial effects should be compounded. If we make the
                    extreme suppositions of an infinitely small source and absolutely homogeneous
                    light, there is no escape from the conclusion that the light in a definite
                    direction is arbitrary, that is, dependent upon the chance distribution of
                    apertures. If, however, as in practice, the light be heterogeneous, the source
                    of finite area, the obstacles in motion, and the discrimination of different
                    directions imperfect, we are concerned merely with the mean brightness found by
                    varying the arbitrary phase-relations, and this is obtained by simply
                    multiplying the brightness due to a single aperture by the number of apertures
                        (n).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See §
                        4.</p></note> The diffraction pattern is therefore that due to a single
                    aperture, merely brightened <hi rend="italic">n</hi> times.</p>
                <p>In his experiments upon this subject Fraunhofer employed plates of glass dusted
                    over with lycopodium, or studded with small metallic disks of uniform size; and
                    he found that the diameters of the rings were proportional to the length of the
                    waves and inversely as the diameter of the disks.</p>
                <p>In another respect the observations of Fraunhofer appear at first sight to be in
                    disaccord with theory; for his measures of the diameters of the red rings,
                    visible when white light was employed, correspond with the law applicable to
                    dark rings, and not to the different law applicable to the luminous maxima.
                    Verdet has, however, pointed out that the observation in this form is
                    essentially different from that in which homogeneous red light is employed, and
                    that tho position of the red rings would correspond to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >absence</hi> of blue-green light rather than to the greatest abundance of
                    red light. Verdet’s own observations, conducted with great care, fully confirm
                    this view, and exhibit a complete agreement with theorv.</p>
                <p>By measurements of coronas it is possible to infer the size of the particles to
                    which they are due, an application of considerable interest in the case of
                    natural corona—the general rule being the larger the corona the smaller the
                    water spherules. Young employed this method not only to determine the diameters
                    of cloud particles <hi rend="italic">(e.g., χ-∏oτy</hi> inch), but also those of
                    fibrous material, for which the theory is analogous. His instrument was called

                        Instruments.</hi></p>
                <p>Our investigations and estimates of resolving power have thus far proceeded upon
                    the supposition that there are no optical imperfections, whether of the nature
                    of a regular aberration or dependent upon irregularities of material and
                    workmanship. In practice there will always be a certain aberration or error of
                    phase, which we may also regard as the deviation of the actual wavesurface from
                    its intended position. In general, we may say that aberration is unimportant,
                    when it nowhere (or at any rate over a relatively small area only) exceeds a
                    small fraction of the wavelength (λ). Thus in estimating the intensity at a
                    focal point, where, in the absence of aberration, all the secondary waves would
                    have exactly the same phase, we see that an aberration nowhere exceeding ⅛λ can
                    have but little effect.</p>
                <p>The only case in which the influence of small aberration upon the entire image
                    has been calculated<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                        >.</hi> The aberration is here unsymmetrical, the wave being in advance of
                    its proper place in one half of the aperture, but behind in the other half. No
                    terms in <hi rend="italic">x</hi> or <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> need be considered. The first would
                    correspond to a general turning of the beam; and the second would imply
                    imperfect focusing of the central parts. The effect of aberration may be
                    considered in two ways. We may suppose the aperture (a) constant, and inquire
                    into the operation of an increasing aberration; or we may take a given value of
                    c <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> a given wave-surface) and examine the effect of
                    a varying aperture. The results in the second case show that an increase of
                    aperture up to that corresponding to an extreme aberration of half a period has
                    no ill effect upon the central band (§ 11), but it increases unduly the
                    intensity of one of the neighbouring lateral bands; and the practical conclusion
                    is that the best results will be obtained from an aperture giving an extreme
                    aberration of from a quarter to half a period, and that with an increased
                    aperture aberration is not so much a direct cause of deterioration as an
                    obstacle to the attainment of that improved definition which should accompany
                    the increase of aperture.</p>
                <p>If, on the other hand, we suppose the aperture given, we find that aberration

                <p>These numbers represent the influence of aberration upon the intensity at the
                    central point, upon the understanding that the focusing is that adapted to a
                    small aperture, for which <hi rend="italic">h</hi> might be neglected. If a
                    readjustment of focus be permitted, the numbers will be sensibly raised. The
                    general conclusion is that an aberration between the centre and circumference of
                    a quarter period has but little effect upon the intensity at the central point
                    of the image.</p>
                <p>As an application of this result, let us investigate what amount of temperature
                    disturbance in the tube of a telescope may be expected to impair definition.
                    According to Biot and Arago, the index <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> for air at <hi
                        rend="italic">t°</hi> C. and at atmospheric pressure is given by •00029</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> μ 1-</hi> l + ∙0037U</p>
                <p>If we take 0° C. as standard temperature, δ <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> a =
                    -Γli×10- <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi>.</p>
                <p>Thus, on the supposition that the irregularity of temperature <hi rend="italic"
                        >t</hi> extends through a length <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> and produces an
                    acceleration of a quarter of a wave-length, jλ=l ’ l Zi × 10^ <hi
                        rend="superscript"> β</hi>; or, if we take λ = 5 ’ 3×10^ <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 5</hi>,</p>
                <p>Zi—12, the unit of length being the centimetre.</p>
                <p>We may infer that, in the case of a telescope tube 12 cm. long, a stratum of air
                    heated 1° C. lying along the top of the tube, and occupying a moderate fraction
                    of the whole volume, would produce a not insensible effect. If the change of
                    temperature progressed uniformly from one side to the other, the result would be
                    a lateral displacement of the image without loss of definition; but in general
                    both effects would be observable. In longer tubes a similar disturbance would be
                    caused by a proportionally less difference of temperature.</p>
                <p>We will now consider the application of the principle to the formation of images,
                    unassisted by reflexion or refraction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Phil. Mag.,</hi> March
                        18S1.</p></note> The f unction of a lens in forming an image is to
                    compensate by its variable thickness the differences of phase which would
                    otherwise exist between secondary waves arriving at the focal point from various
                    parts of the aperture <hi rend="smallcaps">(Optics,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 802). If
                    we suppose the diameter of the lens to be given (2R), and its focal length <hi
                        rend="italic">f</hi> gradually to increase, the original differences of
                    phase at the image of an infinitely distant luminous point diminish without
                    limit. When <hi rend="italic">f</hi> attains a certain value, say <hi
                        rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript">
                        1</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> the extreme error of phase to be compensated
                    falls to ¼λ. But, as we have seen, such an error of phase causes no sensible
                    deterioration in the definition; so that from this point onwards the lens is
                    useless, as only improving an image already sensibly as perfect as the aperture
                    admits of. Throughout the operation of increasing the focal length, the
                    resolving power of the instrument, which depends only upon the aperture, remains
                    unchanged; and we thus arrive at the rather startling conclusion that a
                    telescope of any degree of resolving power might be constructed without an
                    object-glass, if only there were no limit to the admissible focal length. This
                    last proviso, however, as we shall see, takes away almost all practical
                    importance from the proposition.</p>
                <p>To get an idea of the magnitudes of the quantities involved, let us take the case
                    of an aperture of ⅕ inch, about that of the pupil of the eye. The distance <hi
                        rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, which the actual focal
                    length must exceed, is given by</p>
                <p>√(∕ι <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + R <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>)-∕ι = ⅛λ;
                    so that</p>
                <p>∕ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = 2R-∕λ (4).</p>
                <p>Thus, if λ = <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 40000</hi> R=
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> we find <hi
                        rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = 800 inches.</p>
                <p>The image of the sun thrown upon a screen at a distance exceeding 66 feet,
                    through a hole <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>
                    inch in diameter, is therefore at least as well defined as that seen direct.</p>
                <p>As the minimum focal length increases with the square of the aperture, a quite
                    impracticable distance would be required to rival the resolving power of a
                    modern telescope. Even for an aperture of 4 inches, <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> would have to be 5 miles.</p>
                <p>A similar argument may be applied to find at what point an achromatic lens
                    becomes sensibly superior to a single one. The question is whether, when the
                    adjustment of focus is correct for the central rays of the spectrum, the error
                    of phase for the most extreme rays (which it is necessary to consider) amounts
                    to a quarter of a wave-length. If not, the substitution of an achromatic lens
                    will be of no advantage. Calculation shows that, if the aperture be ⅛ inch, an
                    achromatic lens has no sensible advantage if the focal length be greater than
                    about 11 inches. If we suppose the focal length to be 66 feet, a single lens is
                    practically perfect up to an aperture of 1∙7 inch.</p>
                <p>Some estimates of the admissible <hi rend="italic">aberration</hi> in a spherical
                    lens have already been given under <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> vol. xvii.
                    p. 807. In a similar manner we may estimate the least visible displacement of
                    the eye-piece of a telescope focused upon a distant object, a question of
                    interest in connexion with range-finders. It appears<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Phil. Mag.,</hi> xx. p.
                            354, 1885.</p></note> that a displacement δ <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    from the true focus will not sensibly impair definition, provided</p>
                <p>δ∕&lt;∕ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> λ∕R <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>,
                    (5),</p>
                <p>2R being the diameter of aperture. The linear accuracy required is thus a
                    function of the <hi rend="italic">ratio</hi> of aperture to focal length. The
                    formula agrees well with experiment.</p>
                <p>The principle gives an instantaneous solution of the question of the ultimate
                    optical efficiency in the method of “mirror-reading,” as commonly practised in
                    various physical observations. A rotation by which one edge of the mirror
                    advances ∣λ (while the other edge retreats to a like amount) introduces a
                    phase-discrepancy of a whole period where before the rotation there was complete
                    agreement. A rotation of this amount should therefore be easily visible, but the
                    limits of resolving power are being approached; and the conclusion is
                    independent of the focal length of the mirror, aud of the employment of a
                    télescope, provided of course that the reflected image is seen in focus, and
                    that the full width of the mirror is utilized.</p>
                <p>A comparison with the method of a material pointer, attached to the parts whose
                    rotation is under observation, and viewed through a microscope, is of interest.
                    The limiting efficiency of the microscope is attained when the angular aperture
                    amounts to 180° <hi rend="smallcaps">(Microscope,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 267; <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 807); and it is evident that a
                    lateral displacement of the point under observation through ½λ entails (at the
                    old image) a phase-discrepancy of a whole period, one extreme ray being
                    accelerated and the other retarded by half that amount. We may infer that the
                    limits of efficiency in the two methods are the same when the length of the
                    pointer is equal to the width of the mirror.</p>
                <p>An important practical question is the amount of error admissible in optical
                    surfaces. In the case of a mirror, reflecting at nearly perpendicular incidence,
                    there should be no deviation from truth (over any appreciable area) of more than
                    ⅜λ. For glass, <hi rend="italic">μ -</hi> 1=½ nearly; and hence the admissible
                    error in a refracting surface of that material is four times as great.</p>
                <p>In the case of oblique reflexion at an angle φ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> the error
                    of retardation due to an elevation BD (fig. 7) is</p>
                <p>QQ ’- QS = BDsecφ(l - cosSQQ ’) = BDsec≠(l + cos2≠) = 2BDcos≠; from which it
                    follows that an error of given magnitude in the figure of a surface is less
                    important in oblique than in perpendicular reflexion. It must, however, be borne
                    in mind that errors can sometimes be compensated by altering adjustments. If a
                    surface intended to be flat is affected with a slight general curvature, a
                    remedy may be found in an alteration of focus, aud the remedy is the less
                    complete as the reflexion is more oblique.</p>
                <p>The formula expressing the optical power of prismatic spectroscopes is given with
                    examples under <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 807, and may
                    readily be investigated upon the principles of the wave theory. Let A <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 0</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> (fig. 8) be a plane
                    wave-surface of the light before it falls upon the prisms, AB the corresponding
                    wave-surface for a particular part of the spectrum after the light has passed
                    the prisms, or after it has passed the eye-piece of the observing telescope. The
                    path of a ray from the wave-surface A <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> B <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 0</hi> to A or B is determined by the condition that the
                    optical distance, <hi rend="italic">fμ ds,</hi> is a minimum <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">(Optics,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 798); and, as AB is by
                    supposition a wave-surface, this optical distance is the same for both points.
                    Thus <hi rend="italic">Jμds(jοτ</hi> A) <hi rend="italic">=j^μds</hi> (for B)
                    (6).</p>
                <p>We have now to consider the behaviour of light belonging to a neighbouring part
                    of the spectrum. The path of a ray from the wave-surface A <hi rend="subscript">
                        0</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> to the point A is changed; but in
                    virtue of the minimum property the change may be neglected in calculating the
                    optical distance, as it influences the result by quantities of the second order
                    only in the changes of refrangibility. Accordingly, the optical distance from A
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> to A is
                    represented by <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (μ + δμ)rfs, the integration being along
                    the original path A <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>... A; and similarly the optical
                    distance between A <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>
                    and B is represented by y (ju +δ <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> α)ιfs, the
                    integration being along B <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>. . . B. In virtue of (6)
                    the difference of the optical distances to A and B is y <hi rend="italic"
                        >δμds</hi> (along B <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>. . . B) - y <hi

                    (7).</p>
                <p>The new wave-surface is formed in such a position that the optical distance is
                    constant; and therefore the <hi rend="italic">dispersion,</hi> or the angle

                    found simply by dividing (7) by the distance AB. If, as in common flint-glass

                <p>§ 14. <hi rend="italic">Theory of Gratings.</hi></p>
                <p>The general explanation of the mode of action of gratings has been given under
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Light</hi> (vol. xiv. p. 607). If the grating be
                    composed of alternate transparent and opaque parts, the question may be treated
                    by means of the general integrals (§11) by merely limiting the integration to
                    the transparent parts of the aperture. For an investigation upon these lines the
                    reader is referred to Airy’s <hi rend="italic">Tracts</hi> and to Verdet’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Leçons.</hi> If, however, we assume the theory of a simple
                    rectangular aperture (§ ll), the results of the ruling can be inferred by
                    elementary methods, which are perhaps more instructive.</p>
                <p>Apart from the ruling, we know that the image of a mathematical line will be a
                    series of narrow bands, of which the central one is by far the brightest. At the
                    middle of this band there is complete agreement of phase among the secondary
                    waves. The dark lines which separate the bands are the places at which the
                    phases of the secondary wave range over an integral number of periods. If now we
                    suppose the aperture AB to be covered by a great number of opaque strips or bars
                    of width <hi rend="italic">cl,</hi> separated by transparent intervals of width
                        <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the condition of things in the directions just
                    spoken of is not materially changed. At the central point there is still
                    complete agreement of phase; but the amplitude is diminished in the ratio of <hi
                        rend="italic">a: a + d.</hi> In another direction, making a srnall angle
                    with the last, such that the projection of AB upon it amounts to a few
                    wave-lengths, it is easy to see that the mode of interference is the same as if
                    there were no ruling. For example, when the direction is such that the
                    projection of AB upon it amounts to one wave-length, the elementary components
                    neutralize one another, because their phases are distributed symmetrically,
                    though discontinuously, round the entire period. The only effect of the ruling
                    is to diminish the amplitude in the ratio <hi rend="italic">a: a + d;</hi> and,
                    except for tho difference in illumination, the appearance of a line of light is
                    the same as if the aperture were perfectly free.</p>
                <p>The lateral (spectral) images occur in such directions that the projection of the
                    element <hi rend="italic">(a + d)</hi> of the grating upon them is an exact
                    multiple of λ. The effect of each of the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> elements of
                    the grating is then the same; and, unless this vanishes on account of a
                    particular adjustment of the ratio <hi rend="italic">a: d,</hi> the resultant
                    amplitude becomes comparatively very great. These directions, in which the
                    retardation between A and B is exactly <hi rend="italic">mnκ,</hi> may be called
                    the principal directions. On either side of any one of them the illumination is
                    distributed according to the same law as for the central image (7n = O),
                    vanishing, for example, when the retardation amounts to (≡±l)λ. In considering
                    the relative brightnesses of the different spectra, it is therefore sufficient
                    to attend merely to the principal directions, provided that the whole deviation
                    be not so great that its cosine differs considerably from unity.</p>
                <p>We have now to consider the amplitude due to a single element, which we may
                    conveniently regard as composed of a transparent part <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    bounded by two opaque parts of width <hi rend="italic">⅛d.</hi> The phase of the
                    resultant effect is by symmetry that of the component which comes from the
                    middle of <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> The fact that the other components have
                    phases differing from this by amounts ranging between ±ατnπ∕(α + cQ causes the
                    resultant amplitude to be less than for the central image (where there is
                    complete phase agreement). If B <hi rend="subscript"> m</hi> denote tho
                    brightness of the wι <hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> lateral image, and B <hi

                    original light can be obtained in the τn <hi rend="superscript"> th</hi>
                    spectrum. We conclude that, with a grating composed of transparent and opaque
                    parts, the utmost light obtainable in any one spectrum is in the first, and
                    there amounts to l∕ιr <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, or about <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛, and that for this purpose α and <hi

                <p>The third spectrum has thus only ⅜ of the brilliancy of the first.</p>
                <p>Another particular case of interest is obtained by supposing α small relatively
                    to (α + d). Unless the spectrum be of very high order, we have simply</p>

                <p>The light stopped by the opaque parts of the grating, together with that
                    distributed in the central image and lateral spectra, ought to make up the
                    brightness that would be found in the central image, were all the apertures
                    transparent. Thus, if α=d, we should have</p>

                <p>According to a general principle formulated by Babinet, the brightness of a
                    lateral spectrum is not affected by an interchange of the transparent and opaque
                    parts of the grating. The vibrations corresponding to the rivo parts are
                    precisely antagonistic, since if both were operative the resultant would be
                    zero. So far as the application to gratings is concerned, the same conclusion
                    may be derived from (2).</p>
                <p>From the value of B <hi rend="italic subscript"> m</hi>: B <hi rend="subscript">
                        0</hi> we see that no lateral spectrum can surpass the central image in
                    brightness; but this result depends upon the hypothesis that the ruling acts by
                    opacity, which is generally very far from being the case in practice. In an
                    engraved glass grating there is no opaque material present by which light could
                    be absorbed, and the effect depends upon a difference of retardation in passing
                    the alternate parts. It is possible to prepare gratings which give a lateral
                    spectrum brighter than the central image, and the explanation is easy. For if
                    the alternate parts were equal and alike transparent, but so constituted as to
                    give a relative retardation of ½λ, it is evident that the central image would be
                    entirely extinguished, while the first spectrum would be four times as bright as
                    if the alternate parts were opaque. If it were possible to introduce at every
                    part of the aperture of the grating an arbitrary retardation, all the light
                    might be concentrated in any desired spectrum. By supposing the retardation to
                    vary uniformly and continuously we fall upon the case of an ordinary prism; but
                    there is then no diffraction spectrum in the usual sense. To obtain such it
                    would be necessary that the retardation should gradually alter by a wave-length
                    in passing over any element of the grating, and then fall back to its previous
                    value, thus springing suddenly over a wave-length. It is not likely that such a
                    result will ever be fully attained in practice; but the case is worth stating,
                    in order to show that there is no theoretical limit to the concentration of
                    light of assigned wave-length in one spectrum, and as illustrating the
                    frequently observed unsymmetrical character of the spectra on the two sides of
                    the central image.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                                rend="italic">Phil. Mag.,</hi> xlvii. 193, 1874.</p></note></p>
                <p>We have hitherto supposed that the light is incident perpendicularly upon the
                    grating; but the theory is easily extended. If the incident rays make an angle
                        <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> with the normal (fig. 9), and the diffracted rays
                    make an angle <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> (upon the same side), the relative
                    retardation from each element of width (<hi rend="italic">a</hi> + <hi
                        rend="italic">d)</hi> to the next is <hi rend="italic">(a + d)</hi> (sin θ
                    +sin φ); and this is the quantity which is to be equated to <hi rend="italic"
                        >m</hi> λ. Thus sin0 + sin&lt;∕&gt; = 2sin⅜(0 + ≠).cos∣(0 - <hi
                        rend="italic">φ)≈mλ∕(a + d) .</hi> (5).</p>
                <p>The “deviation” is <hi rend="italic">(θ+φ),</hi> and is therefore a minimum when
                    0 = ≠, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> when the grating is so situated that the
                    angles of incidence and diffraction are equal.</p>
                <p>In the case of a reflexion grating the same method applies. If θ and <hi
                        rend="italic">φ</hi> denote the angles with the normal made by the incident
                    and diffracted rays, the formula (5) still holds, and, if the deviation be
                    reckoned from the direction of the regularly reflected rays, it is expressed as
                    before by (θ + φ), and is a minimum when θ = φ, that is, when the diffracted
                    rays return upon the course of the incident rays.</p>
                <p>In either case (as also with a prism) the position of minimum deviation leaves
                    the width of the beam unaltered, <hi rend="italic">i</hi>. <hi rend="italic"

                    under view.</p>
                <p>From (5) we see that, when the light falls perpendicularly upon a grating (θ =
                    0), there is no spectrum formed (the image corresponding<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n463/mode/1up"

                        rend="italic">a</hi> + <hi rend="italic">d</hi>) is less than λ. Under these
                    circumstances, if the material of the grating be completely transparent, the
                    whole of the light must appear in the direct image, and the ruling is not
                    perceptible. From the absence of spectra Fraunhofer argued that there must be a
                    microscopic limit represented by λ; and the inference is plausible, to say the
                        least.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Notes on

                    fixed the microscopic limit at ½λ, as appears from (5), when we suppose θ = ⅛τr,

                <p>We will now consider the important subject of the resolving power of gratings, as
                    dependent upon the number of lines <hi rend="italic">(n)</hi> and the order of

                    the relative retardation of the extreme rays (corresponding to the edges A, B of
                    the grating) is <hi rend="italic">mnλ.</hi> If BQ be the direction for the first
                    minimum (the darkness between the central and first lateral band), the relative
                    retardation of the extreme rays is (<hi rend="italic">mn</hi> + 1)λ. Suppose now
                    that λ + δλ is the wave-length for which BQ gives the principal maximum,
                    then</p>
                <p>(<hi rend="italic">mn</hi> + <hi rend="italic">1)λ=mn(λ</hi> + δλ); whence</p>
                <p>δλ∕λ = 1 <hi rend="italic">∣mn . .</hi> (6).</p>
                <p>According to our former standard, this gives the smallest difference of
                    wave-lengths in a double line which can be just resolved; and we conclude that
                    the resolving power of a grating depends only upon the total number of lines,
                    and upon the order of the spectrum, without regard to any other considerations.
                    It is here of course assumed that the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> lines are really
                    utilized.</p>
                <p>In the case of the D-lines the value of δλ∕λ is about 1/1000; so that to resolve
                    this double line in the first spectrum requires 1000 lines, in the second
                    spectrum 500, aud so on.</p>
                <p>It is especially to be noticed that the resolving power does not depend directly
                    upon the closeness of the ruling. Let us take the case of a grating 1 inch
                    broad, and containing 1000 lines, and consider the effect of interpolating an
                    additional 1000 lines, so as to bisect the former intervals. There will be
                    destruction by interference of the first, third, and odd spectra generally;
                    while the advantage gained in the spectra of even order is not in dispersion,
                    nor in resolving power, but simply in brilliancy, which is increased four times.
                    If we now suppose half the grating cut away, so as to leave 1000 lines in half
                    an inch, the dispersion will not be altered, while the brightness and resolving
                    power are halved.</p>
                <p>There is clearly no theoretical limit to the resolving power of gratings, even in
                    spectra of given order. But it is possible that, as suggested by Rowland,<note

                    with the aid of a grating of given resolving power, to construct artificially
                    from white light mixtures of slightly different wave-length whose resolution or
                    otherwise would discriminate between powers inferior and superior to the given

                            grating to construct light of nearly definite wave-length is well
                            illustrated by Young's comparison with the production of a musical note
                            by reflexion of a sudden sound from a row of palings. The objection
                            raised by Herschel (<hi rend="italic">Light,</hi> § 703) to this
                            comparison depends on a misconception.</p></note></p>
                <p>If we define as the “dispersion” in a particular part of the spectrum the ratio
                    of the angular interval <hi rend="italic">dθ</hi> to the corresponding increment
                    of wave-length <hi rend="italic">dλ,</hi> we may express it by a very simple
                    formula. For the alteration of wave-length entails, at the two limits of a
                    diffracted wave-front, a relative retardation equal to <hi rend="italic"
                        >mndλ.</hi> Hence, if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the width of the
                    diffracted beam, and <hi rend="italic">dθ</hi> the angle through which the

                <p>The resolving power and the width of the emergent beam fix the optical character
                    of the instrument. The latter element must eventually be decreased until less
                    than the diameter of the pupil of the eye. Hence a wide beam demands treatment
                    with further apparatus (usually a telescope) of high magnifying power.</p>
                <p>In the above discussion it has been supposed that the ruling is accurate, and we
                    have seen that by increase of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> a high resolving power is
                    attainable with a moderate number of lines. But this procedure (apart from the
                    question of illumination) is open to the objection that it makes excessive
                    demands upon accuracy. According to the principle already laid down, it can make
                    but little difference in the principal direction corresponding to the first
                    spectrum, provided each line lie within a quarter of an interval (<hi

                    position. But, to obtain an equally good result in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >m</hi><hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> spectrum, the error must be less than

                <p>There are certain errors of a systematic character which demand special
                    consideration. The spacing is usually effected by means of a screw, to each
                    revolution of which corresponds a large number <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> one
                    hundred) of lines. In this way it may happen that, although there is almost
                    perfect periodicity with each revolution of the screw after (say) 100 lines, yet
                    the 100 lines themselves are not equally spaced. The “ghosts” thus arising were
                    first described by Quincke,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                                ><p><hi rend="italic">Pοgg. Ann.,</hi> cxlvi. p. 1, 1872.</p></note>
                    and have been elaborately investigated by Peirce,<note anchored="true"

                            vol. ii. p. 330, 1879.</p></note> both theoretically and experimentally.
                    The general nature of the effects to be expected in such a case may be made
                    clear by means of an illustration already employed for another purpose. Suppose
                    two similar and accurately ruled transparent gratings to be superposed in such a
                    manner that the lines are parallel. If the one set of lines exactly bisect the
                    intervals between the others, the grating interval is practically halved, and
                    the previously existing spectra of odd order vanish. But a very slight relative
                    displacement will cause the apparition of the odd spectra. In this case there is
                    approximate periodicity in the half interval, but complete periodicity only
                    after the whole interval. The advantage of approximate bisection lies in the
                    superior brilliancy of the surviving spectra; but in any case the compound
                    grating may be considered to be perfect in the longer interval, and the
                    definition is as good as if the bisection were accurate.</p>
                <p>The effect of a gradual increase in the interval (fig. 12) as we pass across the
                    grating has been investigated by Cornu,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">C</hi>. <hi rend="italic">R.,</hi>

                    Mascart. The latter found that certain gratings exercised a converging power
                    upon the spectra formed upon one side, and a corresponding diverging power upon
                    the spectra on the other side. Let us suppose that the light is incident
                    perpendicularly, and that the grating interval increases from the centre towards
                    that edge which lies nearest to the spectrum under observation, and decreases
                    towards the hinder edge.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the waves from <hi rend="italic">both</hi> halves of the
                    grating are accelerated in an increasing degree, as we pass from the centre
                    outwards, as compared with the phase they would possess were the central value
                    of the grating interval maintained throughout. The irregularity of spacing has
                    thus the effect of a convex lens, which accelerates the marginal relatively to
                    the central rays. On the other side the effect is reversed. This kind of
                    irregularity may clearly be present in a degree surpassing the usual limits,
                    without loss of definition, when the telescope is focused so as to secure the
                    best effect.</p>
                <p>It may be worth while to examine further the other variations from correct ruling
                    which correspond to the various terms expressing the deviation of the
                    wave-surface from a perfect plane. If <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi

                    the origin corresponding to the centre of the beam, we have as an approximate

                    increasing interval. He has also shown how to rule a plane surface with lines so
                    disposed that the grating shall of itself give well-focused spectra.<note

                <p>A similar idea appears to have guided Rowland to his brilliant invention of
                    concave gratings, by which spectra can be photographed without any further
                    optical appliance. In these instruments the lines are ruled upon a spherical
                    surface of speculum metal, and mark the intersections of the surface by a system
                    of parallel and equidistant planes, of which the middle member passes through
                    the centre of the sphere. If we consider for the present only the primary plane

                        μ=-1</p></note> If Q be on the circle described upon OA as diameter, so that
                    w = αcos&lt;∕&gt;, then Q' lies also upon the same circle; and in this case it
                    follows from the symmetry that the unsymmetrical aberration (depending upon α)
                    vanishes.</p>
                <p>This disposition is adopted in Rowland’s instrument; only, in addition to the
                    central image formed at the angle <hi rend="italic">Φ'=Φ,</hi> there are a

                <p>If <hi rend="italic">Φ' ≈φ,</hi> the term of the first order vanishes, and the

                    Q and Q' are conjugate foci, but also that the foci are exempt from the most
                    important term in the aberration. In the present application <hi rend="italic"
                        >φ'</hi> is not necessarily equal to <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>; but if P
                    correspond to a line upon the grating, the difference of retardations for
                    consecutive positions of P, so far as expressed by the term of the first order,
                    will be equal to ψwtλ (in integral), and therefore without influence,
                    provided</p>
                <p>σ(sin≠-sin≠')=ψwιλ (ll), w’here <hi rend="italic">σ</hi> denotes the constant
                    interval between the planes containing the lines. This is the ordinary formula
                    for a reflecting plane grating, and it shows that the spectra are formed in the
                    usual directions. They are here focused (so far as the rays in the primary plane
                    are concerned) upon the circle OQ'A, and the outstanding aberration is of the
                    fourth order.</p>
                <p>In order that a large part of the field of view may be in focus at once, it is
                    desirable that the locus of the focused spectrum should be nearly perpendicular
                    to the line of vision. For this purpose Rowland places the eye-piece at 0, so
                    that ≠ = 0, and then by (11) the value of <hi rend="italic">Φ'</hi> in the <hi

                    are altogether <hi rend="italic">n</hi> lines, nσ=2αsinw, and the value of the

                    as great as four millions before the error of phase would reach ⅜λ. If it were,
                    desired to use an angular aperture so large that the aberration according to
                    (13) would be injurious, Rowland points out that on his machine there would be
                    no difficulty in applying a remedy by making <hi rend="italic">σ</hi> slightly
                    variable towards the edges. Or, retaining <hi rend="italic">σ</hi> constant, we
                    might attain compensation by so polishing the surface as to bring the
                    circumference slightly forward in comparison with the position it would occupy
                    upon a true sphere.</p>
                <p>It may be remarked that these calculations apply to the rays in the primary plane
                    only. The image is greatly affected with astigmatism; but this is of little
                    consequence, if γ in (8) be small enough. Curvature of the primary focal line
                    having a very injurious effect upon definition, it may be inferred from the
                    excellent performance of these gratings that 7 is in fact small. Its value does
                    not appear to have been calculated. The other coefficients in (8) vanish in
                    virtue of the symmetry.</p>
                <p>The mechanical arrangements for maintaining the focus are of great simplicity.
                    The grating at A and the eye-piece at O are rigidly attached to a bar AO, whose
                    ends rest on carriages, moving on rails OQ, AQ at right angles to each other. A
                    tie between C and Q can be used if thought desirable.</p>
                <p>The absence of chromatic aberration gives a great advantage in the comparison of
                    overlapping spectra, w’hich Rowland has turned to excellent account in his
                    determinations of the relative wavelengths of lines in the solar spectrum.<note

                    angular measurements present less difficulty than the comparison of the grating
                    interval with the standard metre. There is also some uncertainty as to the
                    actual temperature of the grating when in use. In order to minimize the heating
                    action of the light, it might be submitted to a preliminary prismatic analysis
                    before it reaches the slit of the spectrometer, after the manner of Von
                    Helmholtz <hi rend="smallcaps">(Optics,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 802).</p>
                <p>Bell found further that it is necessary to submit the gratings to calibration,
                    and not to rest satisfied with a knowledge of the number of lines and of the
                    total width. It not unfrequently happens that near the beginning of the ruling
                    the interval is anomalous. If the width of this region be small, it has scarcely
                    any effect upon the angular measurements, and should be left out of account in
                    estimating the effective interval.</p>
                <p>§15. <hi rend="italic">Theory of Corrugated Waves.</hi></p>
                <p>The theory of gratings is usually given in a form applicable only to the case
                    where the alternate parts are transparent and opaque. Even then it is very
                    improbable that the process of simply including the transparent parts and
                    excluding the opaque parts in the integrations of § 11 gives an accurate result.
                    The condition of things in actual gratings is much more complicated, and all
                    that can with confidence be asserted is the approximate periodicity in the
                    interval σ. The problem thus presents itself—to determine the course of events
                    on the further side of the plane <hi rend="italic">z</hi> = 0 when the amplitude
                    and phase over that plane are periodic functions of <hi rend="italic">x;</hi>
                    and the first step in the solution would naturally be to determine the effect
                    corresponding to the infinitesimal strip <hi rend="italic">ydx</hi> over which
                    the amplitude and phase are constant. In fig. 20 QQ' represents the strip in

                    which the effect is to be estimated is distant by a very great number of

                <p>The wave represented by (6) is one in which the amplitude at various points of a
                    wave-front is proportional to cosρξ, or cosjxc; and, beyond the reversals of
                    phase herein implied, the phase is constant, so that the wave-surfaces are given
                    by <hi rend="italic">z=</hi> constant. The wave thus described moves forward at
                    the velocity given by (7), and with type unchanged.</p>
                <p>The above investigation may be regarded as applicable to gratings which give
                    spectra of the first order only. Although κ vary, there is no separation of
                    colours. Such a separation requires either a limitation in the width of the
                    grating (here supposed to be infinite), or the use of a focusing lens.</p>
                <p>It is important to remark that <hi rend="italic">p</hi> has been assumed to be
                    less than κ, or <hi rend="italic">σ</hi> greater than λ; otherwise no part of
                    the range of integration in (3) is exempt from rapid fluctuation of sign, and
                    the result must be considered to be zero. The principle that irregularities in a
                    wave-front of periods less than λ cannot be propagated is of great consequence.
                    Further light will be thrown upon it by a different investigation to be given
                    presently.</p>
                <p>The possibility of the wave represented by (6) is perhaps sufficiently
                    established by the preceding method, but the occurrence of the factor κ∕∖∕(κ <hi

                    from a consideration of uniform plane waves) was not rightly assumed.</p>
                <p>The correct law applicable in any case may be investigated as follows. Let us
                    assume that the expression for the wave of given periodic time is</p>

                <p>We conclude that under these circumstances the motion rapidly diminishes as <hi

                    propagated at all.</p>
                <p>It follows that corrugations of a reflecting surface (no matter how deep) will
                    not disturb the regularity of a perpendicularly reflected wave, provided the
                    wave-length of the corrugation do not exceed that of the vibration. And,
                    whatever the former wave-length may be in relation to the latter, regular
                    reflexion will occur when the incidence is sufficiently oblique.</p>
                <p>The first form of solution may be applied to give an explanation of the
                    appearances observed when a plane wave traverses a parallel coarse grating and
                    then impinges upon a screen held at varying distances behind.<note

                                Mag.,</hi> x. p. 364, 1837.</p></note> was that any ray which
                    suffered in traversing the plate a retardation of an odd number of half
                    wave-lengths would be extinguished, and that thus the spectrum would be seen
                    interrupted by a number of dark bars. But this explanation cannot be accepted as
                    it stands, being open to the same objection as Arago’s theory of stellar
                        scintillation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Οn
                            account of inequalities in the atmosphere giving a variable refraction,
                            the light from a star would be irregularly distributed over a screen.
                            The experiment is easily made on a laboratory scale, with a small source
                            of light, the rays from which, in their course towards a rather distant
                            screen, are disturbed by the neighbourhood of a heated body. At a moment
                            when the eye, or object-glass of a telescope, occupies a dark position,
                            the star vanishes. A fraction of a second later the aperture occupies a
                            bright place, and the star reappears. According to this view the
                            chromatic effects depend entirely upon atmospheric
                        dispersion.</p></note> It is as far as possible from being true that a body
                    emitting homogeneous light would disappear on merely covering half the aperture
                    of vision with a half-wave plate. Such a conclusion would be in the face of the
                    principle of energy, which teaches plainly that the retardation in question
                    leaves the aggregate brightness unaltered. The actual formation of the bands
                    comes about in a very curious way, as is shown by a circumstance first observed
                    by Brewster. When the retarding plate is held on the side towards the red of the

                    case, the thickness of the plate must not exceed a certain limit, however pure
                    the spectrum may be. A satisfactory explanation of these bands was first given

                <p>The expression (5) gives the illumination at ξ due to that part of the complete

                    point O' for which the retardation is R; and the required result is obtained by
                    simply integrating (5) with respect to ξ from - ∞ to + ∞. To each value of ξ
                    corresponds a different value of λ, and (in consequence of the dispersing power
                    of the plate) of R. The variation of λ may, however, be neglected in the
                    integration, except in 2πR∕λ, where a small variation of λ entails a
                    comparatively large alteration of phase. If we write</p>
                <p>P = 2πR∕λ (6), we must regard <hi rend="italic">p</hi> as a function of ξ, and we
                    may take with sufficient approximation under any ordinary circumstances p-p' +
                    wξ (7), where ρ <hi rend="italic">'</hi> denotes the value of ρ at O, and ῶ is a
                    constant, which is positive when the retarding plate is held at the side on
                    which the blue of the spectrum <hi rend="italic">is seen.</hi> The possibility
                    of dark bands depends upon ῶ being positive. Only in this case can cos(<hi
                        rend="italic">p</hi> ’ ÷ (w — <hi rend="italic">2πlιjλf)ξ }</hi> retain the
                    constant value - 1 throughout the integration, and then only when w=2πhι∕λf (8),
                    and cos p' = -1 (9).</p>
                <p>The first of these equations is the condition for the formation of dark bands,
                    and the second marks their situation, which is the same as that determined by
                    the imperfect theory.</p>
                <p>The integration can be effected without much difficulty. For the first term in
                    (5) the evaluation is effected at once by a known formula. In the second term if

                <p>It appears therefore that there are no bands at all unless <hi rend="italic"

                    middle of the range when ῶ <hi rend="italic">=2h</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"
                        > 1</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> The formation of bands thus requires that
                    the retarding plate be held upon the side already specified, so that ῶ be
                    positive; and that the thickness of the plate (to which ῶ is proportional) do
                    not exceed a certain limit, which we may call 2T <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>.
                    At the best thickness T <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> the bands are black, and
                    not otherwise.</p>
                <p>The linear width of the band (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>)is the increment of <hi
                        rend="italic">ξ</hi> which alters p by 2π, so that <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    = 2π <hi rend="italic">∣ῶ</hi> (13). </p>
                <p>With the best thickness <hi rend="italic">ῶ=2πh∣λf</hi> (14), so that in this
                    case e=λ∕∕7⅛, (15).</p>
                <p>The bands are thus of the same width as those due to two infinitely narrow
                    apertures coincident with the central lines of the retarded and unretarded
                    streams, the subject of examination being itself a fine luminous line.</p>
                <p>If it be desired to see a given number of bands in the whole or in any part of
                    the spectrum, the thickness of the retarding plate is thereby determined,
                    independently of all other considerations. But in order that the bands may be
                    really visible, and still more in order that they may bc black, another
                    condition must be satisfied. It is necessary that the aperture of the pupil be
                    accommodated to the angular extent of the spectrum, or reciprocally. Black bands
                    will be too fine to be well seen unless the aperture (2 <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi>) of the pupil be somewhat contracted. One-twentieth to one-fiftieth of
                    an inch is suitable. The aperture and the number of bands being both fixed, the
                    condition of blackness determines the angular magnitude of a band and of the
                    spectrum. The use of a grating is very convenient, for not only are there
                    several spectra in view at the same time, but the dispersion can be varied
                    continuously by sloping the grating. The slits may be cut out of tin-plate, and
                    half covered by mica or “microscopic glass,” held in position by a little
                    cement.</p>
                <p>If a telescope be employed there is a distinction to be observed, according as
                    the half-covered aperture is between the eye and the ocular, or in front of the
                    object-glass. In the former case the function of the telescope is simply to
                    increase the dispersion, and the formation of the bands is of course independent
                    of the particular manner in which the dispersion arises. If, however, the
                    half-covered aperture be in front of the object-glass, the phenomenon is
                    magnified as a whole, and the desirable relation between the (unmagnified)
                    dispersion and the aperture is the same as without the telescope. There appears
                    to be no further advantage in the use of a telescope than the increased facility
                    of accommodation, and for this of course a very low power suffices.</p>
                <p>The original investigation of Stokes, here briefly sketched, extends also to the
                    case where the streams are of unequal width <hi rend="italic">h, k,</hi> and are
                    separated by an interval <hi rend="italic">2g.</hi> In the case of unequal width
                    the bands cannot be black; but if <hi rend="italic">h=k,</hi> the finiteness of
                        <hi rend="italic">2g</hi> does not preclude the formation of black
                    bands.</p>

                        Focus.</hi></p>
                <p>The phenomena to be considered under this head are of less importance than those
                    investigated by Fraunhofer, and will be treated in less detail; but, in view of
                    their historical interest and of the ease with which many of the experiments may
                    be tried, some account of their theory could not be excluded from such a work as
                    the present. One or two examples have already attracted our attention when
                    considering Huygens’s zones, viz., the shadow of a circular disk, and of a
                    screen circularly perforated; but the most famous problem of this class—first
                    solved by Fresnel—relates to the shadow of a screen bounded by a straight
                    edge.</p>
                <p>In theoretical investigations these problems are usually treated as of two
                    dimensions only, everything being referred to the plane passing through the
                    luminous point and perpendicular to the diffracting edges, supposed to be
                    straight and parallel. In strictness this idea is appropriate only when the
                    source is a luminous line, emitting cylindrical waves, such as might be obtained
                    from a luminous point with the aid of a cylindrical lens. When, in order to
                    apply Huygens’s principle, the wave is supposed to be broken up, the phase is
                    the same at every element of the surface of resolution which lies upon a line
                    perpendicular to the plane of reference, and thus the effect of the whole line,
                    or rather infinitesimal strip, is related in a constant manner (§ 15) to that of
                    the element which lies in the plane of reference, and may be considered to be
                    represented thereby. The same method of representation is applicable to
                    spherical waves, issuing from a <hi rend="italic">point,</hi> if the radius of
                    curvature be large; for, although there is variation of phase along the length
                    of the infinitesimal strip, the whole effect depends practically upon that of
                    the central parts where the phase is sensibly constant.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The constant parts in (14), viz. ½, may be determined by direct integration of

                <p>We now proceed to consider more particularly the distribution of light upon a
                    screen PBQ near the shadow of a straight edge A. At a point P within the
                    geometrical shadow of the obstacle, the half of the wave to the right of C (fig.
                    22), the nearest point on the wave-front, is wholly intercepted, and on the left
                    the integration is to be taken from <hi rend="italic">s</hi> = CA to <hi

                <p>Now in the integrals represented by G and H every element diminishes as V
                    increases from zero. Hence, as CA increases, viz., as the point P is more and
                    more deeply immersed in the shadow, the illumination <hi rend="italic"
                        >continuously</hi> decreases, and that without limit. It has long been known
                    from observation that there are no bands on the interior side of the shadow of
                    the edge.</p>
                <p>The law of diminution when V is moderately large is easily expressed with the aid
                    of the series (16), (17) for G, H. We have ultimately G = 0, H=(πV) <hi
                        rend="superscript"> -1</hi>, so that</p>
                <p>I <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = l∕π <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> V <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, or the illumination is inversely as the square
                    of the distance from the shadow of the edge.</p>
                <p>For a point Q outside the shadow the integration extends over <hi rend="italic"
                        >more</hi> than half the primary wave. The intensity may be expressed by I

                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + (⅛ + Sv) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> (22);

                <p>When V=0, viz., at the edge of the shadow, I <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> = ⅜;
                    when V = ∞, I <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = 2, on the scale adopted. The
                    latter is the intensity due to the uninterrupted wave. The quadrupling of the
                    intensity in passing outwards from the edge of the shadow is, however,
                    accompanied by fluctuations giving rise to bright and dark bands. The position
                    of these bands determined by (23) may be very simply expressed when V is large,
                    for then sensibly G = 0, and</p>

                <p>The first maximum in fact occurs when δ = ⅜λ — ⋅0046λ, and the first minimum when

                <p>The position of Q corresponding to a given value of V, that is, to a band of

                <p>By means of this expression we may trace the locus of a band of given order as
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi> varies. With sufficient approximation we may regard
                    BQ and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> as rectangular coordinates of Q. Denoting them
                    by <hi rend="italic">X, y,</hi> so that AB is axis of <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    and a perpendicular through A the axis of <hi rend="italic">X,</hi> and
                    rationalizing (26), we have</p>

                    represents a hyperbola with vertices at 0 and A.</p>
                <p>From (24), (26) we see that the width of the bands is of the order √{ δλ(α +
                    5)∕α}. From this we may infer the limitation upon the width of the source of
                    light, in order that the bands may be properly formed. If <hi rend="italic"
                        >ω</hi> be the apparent magnitude of the source seen from A, <hi

                <p>The values of V for the maxima and minima of intensity, and the magnitudes of the

                <p>&lt;r=y √(dx <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + dy) = v (30),</p>

                <p>S = - ... (33).</p>
                <p>Cornu remarks that this equation suffices to determine the general character of
                    the curve. For the osculating circle at any point includes the whole of the
                    curve which lies beyond; and the successive convolutions envelop one another
                    without intersection.</p>
                <p>The utility of the curve depends upon the fact that the elements of arc
                    represent, in amplitude and phase, the component vibrations due to the
                    corresponding portions of the primary wave-front. For by (30) <hi rend="italic"
                        >dσ</hi> = <hi rend="italic">dv</hi>, and by (2) <hi rend="italic">dv</hi>
                    is proportional to <hi rend="italic">ds.</hi> Moreover by (2) and (31) the
                    retardation of phase of the elementary vibration from PQ (fig. 21) is 2πδ∕λ, or
                        <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> Hence, in accordance with the rule for compounding
                    vector quantities, the resultant vibration at B, due to any finite part of the
                    primary wave, is represented in amplitude and phase by the chord joining the
                    extremities of the corresponding arc (σ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>- σ <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi>).</p>
                <p>In applying the curve in special cases of diffraction to exhibit the effect at
                    any point P (fig. 22) the centre of the curve O is to be considered to
                    correspond to that point C of the primary wave-front which lies nearest to P.
                    The operative part, or parts, of the curve are of course those which represent
                    the unobstructed portions of the primary wave.</p>
                <p>Let us reconsider, following Cornu, the diffraction of a screen unlimited on one
                    side, and on the other terminated by a straight edge. On the illuminated side,
                    at a distance from the shadow, the vibration is represented by JJ'. The
                    coordinates of J, J' being (½, ½), ( - ½, - ½), I <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    is 2; and the phase is ⅛ period in arrear of that of the element at O. As the
                    point under contemplation is supposed to approach the shadow, the vibration is
                    represented by the chord drawn from J to a point on the other half of the curve,
                    which travels inwards from J' towards O. The amplitude is thus subject to
                    fluctuations, which increase as the shadow is approached. At the point O the
                    intensity is one-quarter of that of the entire wave, and after this point is
                    passed, that is, when we have entered the geometrical shadow, the intensity
                    falls off gradually to zero, <hi rend="italic">without fluctuations.</hi> The
                    whole progress of the phenomenon is thus exhibited to the eye in a very
                    instructive manner.</p>
                <p>We will next suppose that the light is transmitted by a slit, and inquire what is
                    the effect of varying the width of the slit upon the illumination at the
                    projection of its centre. Under these circumstances the arc to be considered is
                    bisected at O, and its length is proportional to the width of the slit. It is
                    easy to see that the length of the chord (which passes in all cases through O)
                    increases to a maximum near the place where the phase-retardation is ⅜ of a
                    period, then diminishes to a minimum when the retardation is about ⅞ of a
                    period, and so on.</p>
                <p>If the slit is of constant width and we require the illumination at various
                    points on the screen behind it, we must regard the arc of the curve as of <hi
                        rend="italic">constant length.</hi> The intensity is then, as always,
                    represented by the square of the length of the chord. If the slit be narrow, so
                    that the arc is short, the intensity is constant over a wide range, and does not
                    fall off to an important extent until the discrepancy of the extreme phases
                    reaches about a quarter of a period.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto supposed that the shadow of a diffracting obstacle is received
                    upon a diffusing screen, or, which comes to nearly the same thing, is observed
                    with an eye-piece. If the eye, provided if necessary with a perforated plate in
                    order to reduce the aperture, be situated inside the shadow at a place where the
                    illumination is still sensible, and be focused upon the diffracting edge, the
                    light which it receives will appear to come from the neighbourhood of the edge,
                    and will present the effect of a silver lining. This is doubtless the
                    explanation of a “pretty optical phenomenon, seen in Switzerland, when the sun
                    rises from behind distant trees standing on the summit of a mountain.”<note

                <p>Spherical waves, centred upon the axis, of radius <hi rend="italic">a</hi> fall
                    upon the diffracting screen; and the illumination is required on a second

                        rend="italic">a</hi> + <hi rend="italic">b</hi>) from the source. We have
                    first to express the distance (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) between an element <hi
                        rend="italic">dS</hi> of the wave-front and a point M in the plane of the

                    through M, the coordinates of M are (Ϛ, 0, 0). On the same system the

                <p>§ 19. <hi rend="italic">Polarization.</hi></p>
                <p>A ray of ordinary light is symmetrical with respect to the direction of
                    propagation. If, for example, this direction be vertical, there is nothing that
                    can be said concerning the north and south sides of the ray that is not equally
                    true concerning the east and west sides. In polarized light this symmetry is
                    lost. Huygens showed that when a ray of such light falls upon a crystal of
                    Iceland spar, which is made to revolve about the ray as an axis, the phenomena
                    vary in a manner not to be represented as a mere revolution with the spar. In
                    Newton’s language, the ray itself has <hi rend="italic">sides,</hi> or is
                    polarized.</p>
                <p>Malus discovered that ordinary light may be polarized by reflexion as well as by
                    double refraction; and Brewster proved that the effect is nearly complete when
                    the tangent of the angle of incidence is equal to the refractive index, or
                    (which comes to tho same) when the reflected and refracted rays are
                    perpendicular to one another. The light thus obtained is said to be polarized in
                    the plane of reflexion.</p>
                <p>Reciprocally, the character of a polarized ray may be revealed by submitting it
                    to the test of reflexion at the appropriate angle. As the normal to the
                    reflecting surface revolves (in a cone) about the ray, there are two azimuths of
                    the plane of incidence, distant 180°, at which the reflexion is a maximum, and
                    two others, distant 90° from the former, at which the reflexion (nearly)
                    vanishes. In the latter case the plane of incidence is perpendicular to that in
                    which the light must be supposed to have been reflected in order to acquire its
                    polarization.</p>
                <p>The full statement of the law of double refraction is somewhat complicated, and
                    scarcely to be made intelligible except in terms of the wave theory; but, in
                    order merely to show the relation of double refraction in a uniaxal crystal,
                    such as Iceland spar, to polarized light, we may take the case of a prism so cut
                    that the refracting edge is parallel to the optic axis. By traversing such a
                    prism, in a plane perpendicular to the edge, a ray of ordinary light is divided
                    into two, of equal intensity, each of which is refracted according to the
                    ordinary law of Snell. Whatever may be the angle and setting of the prism, the
                    phenomenon may be represented by supposing half the light to be refracted with
                    one index (1⋅65), and the other half with the different index (1⋅48). The rays
                    thus arising are polarized,—the one more refracted in the plane of refraction,
                    and the other in the perpendicular plane. If these rays are now allowed to fall
                    upon a second similar prism, held so that its edge is parallel to that of the
                    first prism, there is no further duplication. The ray first refracted with index
                    1 ’ 65 is refracted again in like manner, and similarly the ray first refracted
                    with index 1⋅48 is again so refracted. But the case is altered if the second
                    prism be caused to rotate about the incident ray. If the rotation be through an
                    angle of 90°, each ray is indeed refracted singly; but the indices are
                    exchanged. The ray that suffered most refraction at the first prism now suffers
                    least at the second, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> At intermediate
                    rotations the double refraction reasserts itself, each ray being divided into
                    two, refracted with the above-mentioned indices, and of intensity dependent upon
                    the amount of rotation, but always such that no light is lost (or gained) on the
                    whole by the separation.</p>
                <p>The law governing the intensity was formulated by Malus, and has been verified by
                    the measures of Arago and other workers. If <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> be the
                    angle of rotation from the position in which one of the rays is at a maximum,
                    while the other vanishes, the intensities are proportional to cos <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">ϴ</hi> and sin <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">ϴ</hi>. On the same scale, if we
                    neglect the loss by reflexion and absorption, the intensity of the incident
                    light is represented by unity.</p>
                <p>A similar law applies to the intensity with which a polarized ray is reflected
                    from a glass surface at the Brewsterian angle. If <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> be
                    reckoned from the azimuth of maximum reflexion, the intensity at other angles
                    may be represented by cos <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ϴ</hi>, vanishing when <hi rend="italic">ϴ</hi> = 90°.</p>
                <p>The phenomena here briefly sketched force upon us the view that the vibrations of
                    light are transverse to the direction of propagation. In ordinary light the
                    vibrations are as much in one transverse direction as in another; and when such
                    light falls upon a doubly refracting, or reflecting, medium, the vibrations are
                        <hi rend="italic">resolved</hi> into two definite directions, constituting
                    two rays polarized in perpendicular planes, and differently influenced by the
                    medium. In this case the two rays are necessarily of equal intensity.</p>
                <p>Consider, for example, the application of this idea to the reflexion of a ray of
                    ordinary light at the Brewsterian, or polarizing, angle. The incident light may
                    be resolved into two, of equal intensity, and polarized respectively in and
                    perpendicular to the plane of incidence. Now we know that a ray polarized in the
                    plane perpendicular to that of incidence will not be reflected, will in fact be
                    entirely transmitted; aud the necessary consequence is that all the light
                    reflected at this angle will be polarized in the plane of incidence. The
                    operation of the plate is thus purely selective, the polarized component, which
                    is missing in the reflected light, being represented in undue proportion in the
                    transmitted light.</p>
                <p>If the incident light be polarized, suppose at an angle ϴ with the plane of
                    incidence, the incident vibration may be resolved into cos <hi rend="italic"
                        >ϴ</hi> in the one plane and sin <hi rend="italic">ϴ</hi> in the other. The
                    latter polarized component is not reflected. The reflected light is thus in all
                    cases polarized in the plane of reflexion; and its <hi rend="italic"
                        >intensity,</hi> proportional to the square of the vibration, is represented
                    by <hi rend="italic">h</hi> cos <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >θ</hi>, if <hi rend="italic">h</hi> be the intensity in which light is
                    reflected when polarized in the plane of reflexion. The law of Malus is thus a
                    necessary consequence of the principle of resolution.</p>
                <p>The idea of transverse vibrations was admitted with reluctance, even by Young and

                    be no reason <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> for preferring one kind of
                    vibration to another; and the phenomena of polarization prove conclusively that,
                    if luminous vibrations are analogous to those of a material medium, it is to
                    solids, and not to fluids, that we must look. An isotropic solid is capable of
                    propagating two distinct kinds of waves,—the first dependent upon <hi
                        rend="italic">rigidity,</hi> or the force by which shear is resisted, and
                    the second analogous to waves of sound aud dependent upon <hi rend="italic"
                        >compressibility.</hi> In the former the vibrations are transverse to the
                    direction of propagation, that is, they may take place in any direction parallel
                    to the wave front, and they are thus suitable representatives of the vibrations
                    of light. In this theory the luminiferous ether is distinctly assimilated to an
                    elastic solid, and the velocity of light depends upon the <hi rend="italic"
                        >rigidity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">density</hi> assigned to the
                    medium.</p>
                <p>The possibility of longitudinal waves, in which the displacement is perpendicular
                    to the wave-front, is an objection to the elastic solid theory of light, for
                    there is nothing known in optics corresponding thereto. If, however, we suppose
                    with Green that the medium is incompressible, the velocity of longitudinal waves
                    becomes infinite, and the objection is in great degree obviated. Such a
                    supposition is hardly a departure from the original idea, inasmuch as, so far as
                    we know, there is nothing to prevent a solid material possessing these
                    properties, and an approximation is actually presented by such bodies as jelly,
                    for which the velocity of longitudinal vibrations is a large multiple of that of
                    transverse vibrations.</p>

                <p>The conditions of interference of polarized light are most easily deduced from
                    the phenomena of the colours of crystalline plates, if we once admit Young’s
                    view that the origin of the colours is to be sought in the interference of the
                    differently refracted rays. Independently of any hypothesis of this kind, the
                    subject was directly investigated by Fresnel and Arago,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Fresnels <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi>
                            vol. i. p. 521.</p></note> who summarized their conclusions thus :—</p>
                <p>(1) Under the same conditions in which two rays of ordinary light appear to
                    destroy one another, two rays polarized in contrary (viz., perpendicular)
                    directions are without mutual influence.</p>
                <p>(2) Two rays of light polarized in the same direction act upon one another like
                    ordinary rays; so that, with these two kinds of light, the phenomena of
                    interference are identical.</p>
                <p>(3) Two rays <hi rend="italic">originally polarized in opposite directions</hi>
                    may afterwards be brought to the same plane of polarization, <hi rend="italic"
                        >without thereby acquiring the power to influence one another.</hi></p>
                <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Two rays polarized in opposite directions, and afterwards
                        brought to similar polarizations,</hi> react in the same manner as natural
                    rays, <hi rend="italic">if they are derived from a beam originally polarized in
                        one direction,.</hi></p>
                <p>The fact that oppositely polarized rays cannot be made to interfere may of itself
                    be regarded as a proof that the vibrations are transverse; and the principle,
                    once admitted, gives an intelligible account of all the varied phenomena in this
                    field of optics. The only points on which any difficulty arises are as to the
                    nature of ordinary unpolarized light, and the rules according to which <hi
                        rend="italic">intensity</hi> is to be calculated. It will be proper to
                    consider these questions somewhat fully.</p>
                <p>In ordinary (plane) polarized light the vibrations are supposed to be in one
                    direction only. If <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> be
                    rectangular coordinates in the plane of the wave, we may take, as representing a
                    regular vibration of plane-polarized light, <hi rend="italic">x=acos(ϕ-α</hi>)
                    (1), where <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = <hi rend="italic">2πt∕τ</hi>, and <hi
                        rend="italic">a, a</hi> denote constants. It must be remembered, however,
                    that in optics a regular vibration of this kind never presents itself. In the
                    simplest case of approximately monochromatic light, the amplitude and phase must
                    be regarded (§ 4) as liable to incessant variation, and all that we are able to
                    appreciate is the <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> intensity, represented by <hi
                        rend="italic">M(a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi>). If a number of
                    these irregular streams of light are combined, the intensity of the mixture
                    cannot be calculated from a mere knowledge of the separate intensities, unless
                    we have assurance that the streams are <hi rend="italic">independent,</hi> that
                    is, without mutual phase-relations of a durable character. For instance, two
                    thoroughly similar streams combine into one of <hi rend="italic">fourfold</hi>
                    intensity, if the phases are the same; while, if the phases are opposed, the
                    intensity falls to zero. It is only when the streams are independent, so that
                    the phase-relation is arbitrary and variable from moment to moment, that the
                    apparent resultant intensity is necessarily the double of the separate
                    intensities.</p>
                <p>If any number of independent vibrations of type (1) be superposed, the resultant
                    is</p>
                <p>[∑ α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> cos α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> 3 cos <hi

                <p>The phase-relations being unknown, this quantity is quite indeterminate. But,
                    since each cosine varies from moment to moment, and on the whole is as much
                    positive as negative, the <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> intensity is M(α <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) + M(α <hi

                    say, is to be found by simple addition of the separate intensities.</p>
                <p>Let us now dispense with the restriction to one direction of vibration, and
                    consider in the first place the character of a <hi rend="italic">regular</hi>
                    vibration, of given frequency. The general expression will be <hi rend="italic"
                        >x</hi> =αcos(φ - a), <hi rend="italic">y=bcοs(ϕ-β) . . .</hi> (2), where
                        <hi rend="italic">a, a, b, β</hi> are constants. If <hi rend="italic">β =
                        a,</hi> the vibrations are executed entirely in the plane <hi rend="italic"
                        >x∣y=a∣b,</hi> or the light is plane-polarized. Or if <hi rend="italic">β =
                        π - a,</hi> the light is again plane-polarized, the plane of vibration being
                        <hi rend="italic">x∣y= -a∣b.</hi> In other cases the vibrations are not
                    confined to one plane, so that the light is not plane-polarized, but, in
                    conformity with the path denoted by (2), it is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                        >elliptically-</hi> polarized. If one of the constituents of
                    elliptically-polarized light be suitably accelerated or retarded relatively to
                    the other, it may be converted into plane-polarized light, and so identified by
                    the usual tests. Or, conversely, plane-polarized light may be converted into
                    elliptically-polarized by a similar operation. The relative acceleration in
                    question is readily effected by a plate of doubly refracting crystal cut
                    parallel to the axis.</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">β</hi> = α±½π, whether in the first instance or after the
                    action of a crystalline plate, <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = αcos(ϕ-α), <hi
                        rend="italic">y</hi> = ± <hi rend="italic">b</hi> sin (ϕ-α <hi rend="italic"
                        >) .. .</hi> (3).</p>
                <p>The maxima and minima values of the one coordinate here occur synchronously with
                    the evanescence of the other, and the coordinate axes are the <hi rend="italic"
                        >principal</hi> axes of the elliptic path.</p>
                <p>An important particular case arises when further δ = α, The path is then a
                    circle, and the light is said to be <hi rend="italic">circularly</hi>-polarized.
                    According to the sign adopted in the second equation (3), the circle is
                    described in the one direction or in the other.</p>
                <p>Circularly-polarized light can be resolved into plane-polarized components in <hi
                        rend="italic">any</hi> two rectangular directions, which are such that the
                    intensities are equal and the phases different by a quarter period. If a
                    crystalline plate be of such thickness that it retards one component by a
                    quarter of a wave-length (or indeed by any odd multiple thereof) relatively to
                    the other, it will convert plane-polarized light into circularly-polarized, and
                    conversely,—in the latter case without regard to the azimuth in which it is
                    held.</p>
                <p>The property of circularly-polarized light whereby it is capable of resolution
                    into oppositely plane-polarized components of equal intensities is possessed
                    also by natural unpolarized light; but the discrimination may be effected
                    experimentally with the aid of the quarter-wave plate. By this agency the
                    circularly-polarized ray is converted into plane-polarized, while the natural
                    light remains apparently unaltered. The difficulty which remains is rather to
                    explain the physical character of natural light. To this we shall presently
                    return; but in the meantime it is obvious that the constitution of natural light
                    is essentially irregular, for we have seen that absolutely regular, <hi
                        rend="italic">i</hi>. <hi rend="italic">e.,</hi> absolutely homogeneous,
                    light <hi rend="italic">is necessarily (elliptically) polarized.</hi></p>
                <p>In discussing the vibration represented by (2), we have considered the amplitudes
                    and phases to be constant; but in nature this is no more attainable than in the
                    case of plane-polarized light. In order that the elliptic polarization may be of
                    a definite character, it is only necessary that the <hi rend="italic">ratio</hi>
                    of amplitudes and the <hi rend="italic">difference</hi> of phases should be
                    absolute constants, and this of course is consistent with the same degree of
                    irregularity as was admitted for plane vibrations.</p>
                <p>The intensity of elliptically-polarized light is the sum of the intensities of
                    its rectangular components. This we may consider to be an experimental fact, as
                    well as a consequence of the theory of transverse vibrations. In whatever form
                    such a theory may be adopted, the energy propagated will certainly conform to
                    this law. When the constants in (2) are regarded as subject to variation, the
                    apparent intensity is represented by</p>
                <p>M(α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) + <hi rend="italic">M(b</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     superscript"> 2</hi>) (4).</p>
                <p>We are now in a position to examine the constitution which must be ascribed to
                    natural light. The conditions to be satisfied are that when resolved in any
                    plane the mean intensity of tho vibrations shall be independent of the
                    orientation of the plane, and, further, that this property shall be unaffected
                    by any previous relative retardation of the rectangular components into which it
                    may have been resolved. The original vibration being represented by <hi

                    interpretation. The value of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> may bo written</p>
                <p>τ∕=δcosδcos&lt;∕&gt; + δsinδsin&lt;∕&gt; .... (ll); from which we see that δcosδ
                    is the coefficient of that part of the <hi rend="italic">y</hi> vibration which
                    has the same phase as the <hi rend="italic">x</hi> vibration. Thus αδcosδ may be
                    interpreted as the product of the coefficients of the parts of the <hi
                        rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> vibrations which have the
                    same phase. Next suppose the phase of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> accelerated by
                    writing ⅜π + &lt;∕&gt; in place of <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> We should thus have
                    y = -δcosδsin≠ + δsinδcos≠, andαδsinδ represents the product of the coefficients
                    of the parts which are now in the same phase, or (which is the same) the product
                    of the coefficients of the <hi rend="italic">x</hi> vibration and of that part
                    of the <hi rend="italic">y</hi> vibration which was 90° behind in phase. In

                <p>The second product, representing the circulating part of the motion, is thus

                <p>Let us pass on to the consideration of the mean quantities which occur in (9),

                <p>From (16), (17), (18), (19), if A', B', C', D' denote the corresponding

                <p>D' = D (23).</p>
                <p>These formulae prove that, if the conditions (9), (10), shown to be necessary in
                    order that the light may behave as natural light, be satisfied for one set of
                    axes, they are equally satisfied with any other. It is thus a matter of
                    indifference with respect to what axes the retardation e is supposed to be
                    introduced, and the conditions (9), (10) are sufficient, as well as necessary,
                    to characterize natural light.</p>
                <p>Reverting to (8), we see that, whether the light be natural or not, its
                    character, so far as experimental tests can show, is determined by the values of
                    A, B, C, D. The effect of a change of axes is given by (20), &amp;c., and it is
                    evident that the new axes may always be so chosen that C'=0. For this purpose it
                    is only necessary to take <hi rend="italic">ω</hi> such that tan 2ω =
                    2C∕(A-B).</p>
                <p>If we choose these new axes as fundamental axes, the values of the constants for
                    any others inclined to them at angle <hi rend="italic">ω</hi> will be of the
                    form</p>
                <p>A = A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> cos <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi

                <p>C = (B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>) cos <hi

                <p>If A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are here
                    equal, then C∙=0, A = B for all values of ω. In this case, the light cannot be
                    distinguished from natural light by mere resolution; but if D be finite, the
                    difference may be made apparent with the aid of a retarding plate.</p>
                <p>If A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are unequal,
                    they represent the maximum and minimum values of A and B. The intensity is then
                    a function of the plane of resolution, and the light may be recognized as
                    partially polarized by the usual tests. If either A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    or B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> vanishes, the light is plane-polarized.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In this case Dnecessarily
                            vanishes.</p></note></p>
                <p>When several independent streams of light are combined, the values, not only of A
                    and B, but also of C and D, for the mixture, are <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> to
                    be found by simple addition. It must here be distinctly understood that there
                    are no permanent phase-relations between one component and another. Suppose, for
                    example, that there are two streams of light, each of which satisfies the
                    relations A = B, C≈=0, but makes the value of D finite. If the two values of D
                    are equal and opposite, and the streams are independent, the mixture constitutes
                    natural light. A particular case arises when each component is
                    circularly-polarized (D=±A=±B), one in the right-handed and the other in the
                    left-handed direction. The intensities being equal, the mixture is equivalent to
                    natural light, but only under the restriction that the streams are without
                    phase-relation. If, on the contrary, the second stream be similar to the first,
                    affected merely with a constant retardation, the resultant is not natural, but
                    completely (plane) polarized light.</p>
                <p>We will now prove that the most general mixture of light may be regarded as
                    compounded of one stream of light elliptically-polarized in a definite manner,
                    and of an independent stream of natural light. The theorem is due to
                        Stokes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Οn the

                <p>Under these conditions the light is reduced to be of a definite elliptic
                    character, although the amplitude and phase of the system <hi rend="italic">as a
                        whole</hi> may be subject to rapid variation. The elliptic constants are

                <p>In general AB exceeds (C <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + D <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi>); but it will always be possible to find a
                    positive quantity H, which when subtracted from A and B (themselves necessarily
                    positive) shall reduce the product to equality with C <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>The original light may thus be resolved into two groups. For the first group the

                    is of a simple character; for the first represents natural light, and the second
                    light elliptically polarized. It is thus proved that in general a stream of
                    light may be regarded as composed of one stream of natural light and of another
                    elliptically-polarized. The intensity of the natural light is 2H, where from

                <p>If D = 0, and therefore by (28) δ = 0, the second component is plane-polarized.
                    This is regarded as a particular case of elliptic polarization. Again, if A = B,
                    C = 0, the polarization is circular.</p>
                <p>The laws of interference of polarized light, discovered by Fresnel and Arago, are
                    exactly what the theory of transverse vibrations would lead us to expect, when
                    once we have cleared up the idea of unpolarized light. Ordinary sources, such as
                    the sun, emit unpolarized light. If this be resolved in two opposite directions,
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n473/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0473-0448"/> polarized components are not only each
                    irregular, but there is no permanent phase-relation between them. No light
                    derived from one can therefore ever interfere regularly with light derived from
                    the other. If, however, we commence with plane-polarized light, we have only one
                    series of irregularities to deal with. When resolved in two rectangular
                    directions, the components cannot then interfere, but only on account of the
                    perpendicularity. If brought back by resolution to the same plane of
                    polarization, interference becomes possible, because the same series of
                    irregularities are to be found in both components.</p>
                <p>§ 21. <hi rend="italic">Double Refraction.</hi></p>
                <p>The construction by which Huygens explained the ordinary and extraordinary
                    refraction of Iceland spar has already been given <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >(Light,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 610). The wave-surface is in two sheets, composed
                    of a sphere and of an ellipsoid of revolution, in contact with one another at
                    the extremities of the polar axis. In biaxal crystals the wave-surface is of a
                    more complicated character, including that of Huygens as a particular case.</p>
                <p>It is not unimportant to remark that the essential problem of double refraction
                    is to determine the two velocities with which plane waves are propagated, when
                    the direction of the normal to the wave-front is assigned. When this problem has
                    been solved, the determination of the wave-surface is a mere matter of geometry,
                    not absolutely necessary for the explanation of the leading phenomena, but
                    convenient as affording a concise summary of the principal laws. In all cases
                    the wave-surface is to be regarded as the envelope at any subsequent time of all
                    the plane wave-fronts which at a given instant may be supposed to be passing
                    through a particular point.</p>
                <p>In singly refracting media, where the velocity of a wave is the same in all
                    directions, the wave-normal coincides with the <hi rend="italic">ray.</hi> In
                    doubly refracting crystals this law no longer holds good. The principles by
                    which the conception of a ray is justified (§ 10), when applied to this case,
                    show that the centre of the zone system is not in general to be found at the
                    foot of the perpendicular upon the primary wave-front. The surface whose contact
                    with the primary wave-front determines the element from which the secondary
                    disturbance arrives with least retardation is now not a sphere, but whatever
                    wave-surface is appropriate to the medium. The direction of the ray,
                    corresponding to any tangent plane of the wavesurface, is thus not the normal,
                    but the radius vector drawn from the centre to the point of contact.</p>
                <p>The velocity of propagation (reckoned always perpendicularly to the wave-front)
                    may be conceived to depend upon the direction of the wave-front, or wave-normal,
                    and upon what we may call (at any rate figuratively) the direction of vibration.
                    If the velocity depended exclusively upon the wave-normal, there could be no <hi
                        rend="italic">double,</hi> though there might be <hi rend="italic"
                        >extraordinary,</hi> refraction, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> refraction
                    deviating from the law of Snell; but of this nothing is known in nature. The
                    fact that there are in general two velocities for one wave-front proves that the
                    velocity depends upon the direction of vibration.</p>
                <p>According to the Huygenian law, confirmed to a high degree of accuracy by the
                    observations of Brewster and Swan,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            375.</p></note> a ray polarized in a principal plane (<hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e</hi>., a plane passing through the axis) of a uniaxal crystal suffers
                    ordinary refraction only, that is, propagates itself with the same velocity in
                    all directions. The interpretation which Fresnel put upon this is that the
                    vibrations (understood now in a literal sense) are perpendicular to the plane of
                    polarization, and that the velocity is constant because the direction of
                    vibration is in all cases similarly related (perpendicular) to the axis. The
                    development of this idea in the fertile brain of Fresnel led him to the
                    remarkable discovery of the law of refraction in biaxal crystals.</p>
                <p>The hypotheses upon which Fresnel based his attempt at a mechanical theory are
                    thus summarized by Verdet:—</p>
                <p>(1) The vibrations of polarized light are perpendicular to the plane of
                    polarization;</p>
                <p>(2)The elastic forces called into play during the propagation of a system of
                    plane waves (of rectilinear transverse vibrations) differ from the elastic
                    forces developed by the parallel displacement of a single molecule only by a
                    constant factor, independent of the particular direction of the plane of the
                    wave;</p>
                <p>(3) When a plane wave propagates itself in any homogeneous medium, the components
                    parallel to the wave-front of the elastic forces called into play by the
                    vibrations of the wave are alone operative;</p>
                <p>(4) The velocity of a plane wave which propagates itself with type unchanged in
                    any homogeneous medium is proportional to the square root of the effective
                    component of the elastic force developed by the vibrations.</p>
                <p>Fresnel himself was perfectly aware that his theory was deficient in rigour, and
                    indeed there is little to be said in defence of his second hypothesis.
                    Nevertheless, the great historical interest of this theory, and the support that
                    experiment gives to Fresnel’s conclusion as to the actual form of the
                    wave-surface in biaxal crystals, render some account of his work in this field
                    imperative.</p>
                <p>The potential energy of displacement of a single molecule from its position of
                    equilibrium is ultimately a quadratic function of the three components reckoned
                    parallel to any set of rectangular axes. These axes may be so chosen as to
                    reduce the quadratic function to a sum of squares, so that the energy may be
                    expressed,</p>

                    (1), where ξ, η, Ϛ are the three component displacements. The corresponding
                    forces of restitution, obtained at once by differentiation, are X-α <hi

                    &lt; . . . (2).</p>
                <p>The force of restitution is thus in general inclined to the direction of
                    displacement. The relation between the two directions X, Y, Z and ξ, <hi

                    axes are the only ones in which a displacement calls iuto operation a parallel
                    force of restitution. If two of the quantities <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi

                    the ellipsoid (3) is of revolution, and every direction in the plane of the
                    equal axes possesses the property in question. This is the case of a uniaxal
                    crystal. If the three quantities <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="superscript">
                        2</hi>, <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, <hi

                    is isotropic.</p>
                <p>If we resolve the force of restitution in the direction of displacement, we
                    obtain a quantity dependent upon this direction in a manner readily expressible
                    by means of the ellipsoid of elasticity (3). For, when the total displacement is

                <p>We have now to inquire in what directions, limited to a particular plane, a
                    displacement may be so made that the <hi rend="italic">projection</hi> of the
                    force of restitution upon the plane may be parallel to the displacement. The
                    answer follows at once from the property of the ellipsoid of elasticity. For, if
                    in any section of the ellipsoid we have a radius vector such that the plane
                    containing it and the normal to the corresponding tangent plane is perpendicular
                    to the plane of the section, the tangent line to the section must be
                    perpendicular to the radius vector, that is, the radius vector must be a
                    principal axis of the section. There are therefore two, and in general only two,
                    directions in any plane satisfying the proposed condition, and these are
                    perpendicular to one another. If, however, the plane be one of those of circular
                    section, every line of displacement is such that the component of the force,
                    resolved parallel to the plane, coincides with it.</p>
                <p>According to the principles laid down by Fresnel, we have now complete data for
                    the solution of the problem of double refraction. If the direction of the
                    wave-front be given, there are (in general) only two directions of vibration
                    such that a single wave is propagated. If the actual displacements do not
                    conform to this condition, they will be resolved into two of the required
                    character, and the components will in general be propagated with different
                    velocities. The two directions are the principal axes of the section of (3) made
                    by the wave-front, and the velocities of propagation are inversely proportional
                    to the lengths of these axes.</p>
                <p>The law connecting the lengths of the axes with the direction (<hi rend="italic"

                    symmetry, and there is no distinction between 0 ' and 0.</p>
                <p>Since waves in a biaxal crystal propagated along either optic axis have but one
                    velocity, it follows that tangent planes to the wavesurface, perpendicular to
                    these directions, touch both sheets of the surface. It may be proved further
                    that each plane touches the surface not merely at two, but at an infinite number
                    of points, which lie upon a circle.</p>
                <p>The directions of the optic axes, and the angle included between them, are found
                    frequently to vary with the colour of the light. Such a variation is to be
                    expected, in view of dispersion, which renders α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>,
                    δ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, c <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> functions of
                    the wave-length.</p>
                <p>A knowledge of the form of the wave-surface determines in all cases the law of
                    refraction according to the construction of Huygens. We will suppose for
                    simplicity that the first medium is air, and that the surface of separation
                    between the media is plane. The incident wave-front at any moment of time cuts
                    the surface of separation in a straight line. On this line take any point, and
                    with it as centre construct the wave-surface in the second medium corresponding
                    to a certain interval of time. At the end of this interval the trace of the
                    incident wave-front upon the surface will have advanced to a new position,
                    parallel to the former. Planes drawn through this line so as to touch the
                    wavesurface give the positions of the refracted wave-fronts. None other could
                    satisfy the two conditions—(l)that the refracted wavefront should move within
                    the crystal with the normal velocity suitable to its direction, and (2) that the
                    traces of the incident and refracted waves upon the surface of separation should
                    move together. The normal to a refracted wave lies necessarily in the plane of
                    incidence, but the refracted <hi rend="italic">ray,</hi> coinciding with the
                    radius vector of the wave-surface, in general deviates from it. In most cases it
                    is sufficient to attend to the wave normal.</p>
                <p>As in total reflexion by simply refracting <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> media,
                    it may happen that no tangent planes can be drawn to satisfy the prescribed
                    conditions, or that but one such can be drawn.</p>
                <p>When the crystal is uniaxal, one wave is refracted according to the ordinary law
                    of Snell. The accuracy of both the sphere and the ellipsoid of the Huygenian
                    construction has been fully verified by modern observations.<note

                <p>The simplest case of uniaxal refraction is when the axis of the crystal is
                    perpendicular to the plane of incidence, with respect to which every thing then
                    becomes symmetrical. The section of the wave-surface with which we have to deal
                    reduces to two concentric circles; so that <hi rend="italic">both</hi> waves are
                    refracted according to the ordinary law, though of course with different
                    indices.</p>
                <p>In biaxal crystals one wave follows the ordinary law of refraction, if the plane
                    of incidence coincide with a principal plane of the crystal. This consequence of
                    his theory was verified by Fresnel himself, and subsequently by Rudberg and
                    others. But the most remarkable phenomena of biaxal refraction are undoubtedly
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n475/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0475-0450"/> those discovered by Hamilton and Lloyd,
                    generally known as conical refraction.</p>
                <p>In general there are two refracted rays, corresponding to two distinct waves. But
                    the refracted waves coalesce when they are perpendicular to either optic axis,
                    and (as we have seen) this wave touches the wave-surface along a circle. Thus
                    corresponding to one wave direction there are an infinite number of rays, lying
                    upon a cone. The division of a single incident ray into a cone of refracted rays
                    is called internal conical refraction. If the second face of the crystal is
                    parallel to the first, each refracted ray resumes on emergence its original
                    direction, so that the emergent bundle forms a hollow cylinder.</p>
                <p>External conical refraction depends upon the singular points in the principal
                    plane of <hi rend="italic">zx,</hi> where the two sheets of the surface cross
                    one another (fig. 24). At such a point (P) an infinite number of tangent planes
                    may be drawn to the surface, and each of the perpendiculars from O represents a
                    wave direction, corresponding to the single <hi rend="italic">ray</hi> OP. On
                    emergence these waves will be differently refracted; and thus corresponding to a
                    single internal ray there are an infinite number of external rays, lying upon a
                    cone.</p>
                <p>It has already been admitted that the dynamical foundations of Fresnel’s theory
                    are unsound; and it must be added that the rigorous theory of crystalline solids
                    investigated by Cauchy and Green does not readily lend itself to the explanation
                    of Fresnel’s laws of double refraction. On this subject the reader should
                    consult Prof. Stokes’s Report. Sir W. Thomson has recently shown<note

                <p>It may perhaps be worth while to remark that the equations, analogous to (2) §

                    at once to the desired results. But the equations (25) are not applicable to the
                    vibrations of a crystalline solid.</p>
                <p>In the electromagnetic theory double refraction is attributed to aeolotropic
                    inductive capacity, and appears to offer no particular difficulty.</p>
                <p>If the present position of the theory of double refraction is still somewhat
                    unsatisfactory, it must be remembered that the uncertainty does not affect the
                    general principle. Almost any form of wave theory involving transverse
                    vibrations will explain the leading phenomenon, viz., the bifurcation of the
                    ray. It is safe to predict that when ordinary refraction is well understood
                    there will be little further trouble over double refraction.</p>
                <p>The wave-velocity is not the only property of light rendered unsymmetrical by
                    crystalline structure. In many cases the two polarized rays are subject to a
                    different rate of <hi rend="italic">absorption.</hi> Tourmalines and other
                    crystals may be prepared in plates of such thickness that one ray is sensibly
                    stopped and the other sensibly transmitted, and will then serve as polarizing
                    (or analysing) apparatus. Although for practical purposes Nicol’s prisms <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">(Light,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 612) are usually to be preferred,
                    the phenomenon of double absorption is of great theoretical interest. The
                    explanation is doubtless closely connected with that of double refraction.</p>
                <p>§ 22. <hi rend="italic">Colours of Crystalline Plates.</hi></p>
                <p>When polarized light is transmitted through a moderately thin plate of doubly
                    refracting crystal, and is then analysed, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> with a
                    Nicol, brilliant colours are often exhibited, analogous in their character to
                    the tints of Newton’s scale. With his usual acuteness, Young at once attributed
                    these colours to interference between the ordinary and extraordinary waves, and
                    showed that the thickness of crystal required to develop a given tint, inversely
                    proportional to the doubly refracting power, was in agreement with this view.
                    But the complete explanation, demanding a fuller knowledge of the laws of
                    interference of polarized light, was reserved for Fresnel and Arago. The subject
                    is one which admits of great development;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>See Verdet’s Leçons, vol. ii.</p></note> but the
                    interest turns principally upon the beauty of the effects, and upon the facility
                    with which many of them may be obtained in experiment. We must limit ourselves
                    to a brief treatment of one or two of the simpler cases.</p>
                <p>The incident vibration being plane-polarized, we will suppose that its plane
                    makes an angle α with the principal plane of the crystal. On entering the
                    crystal it is accordingly resolved into the two components represented by cos α
                    cos <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> sin a cos <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> where <hi
                        rend="italic">φ = 2∙πt∣τ.</hi></p>
                <p>In traversing the crystal both waves are retarded, but we are concerned only with
                    the difference of the retardations. Denoting the difference by <hi rend="italic"
                        >p,</hi> we may take as the expressions of the waves on emergence cos <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> sin <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">(φ</hi>- p).</p>
                <p>It may be remarked that, in the absence of <hi rend="italic">dispersion, p</hi>
                    would be inversely proportional to λ; but in fact there are many cases where it
                    deviates greatly from this law.</p>
                <p>Now let the plane of analysation be inclined at the angle <hi rend="italic"
                        >β</hi> to that of primitive polarization (fig. 25). Then for the sum of the

                <p>If in (1) we write <hi rend="italic">β + ⅛π</hi> in place of <hi rend="italic"

                    (1) and (2) is unity under all circumstances. The effect of rotating the
                    analyser through 90° is thus always to transform the tint into its
                    complementary. The two complementary tints may be seen at the same time if we
                    employ a double image prism. In the absence of an analyser we may regard the two
                    images as superposed, and there is no colour.</p>
                <p>These expressions may be applied at once to the explanation of the colours of
                    thin plates of mica or selenite. In this case the retardation p is proportional
                    to the thickness, and approximately independent of the precise direction of the
                    light, supposed to be nearly perpendicular to the plate, viz., nearly parallel
                    to a principal axis of the crystal.</p>
                <p>The most important cases are when <hi rend="italic">β=0,</hi> 0=½π. In the latter
                    the field would be dark were the plate removed; and the actual intensity is sin
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 2αsin <hi rend="superscript"> 2½ρ</hi>
                    (3).</p>
                <p>The composition of the light is thus independent of the azimuth of the plate (<hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi>); but the <hi rend="italic">intensity</hi> varies
                    greatly, vanishing four times during the complete revolution. The greatest
                    brightness occurs when the principal plane bisects the angle between the planes
                    of polarization and analysis. If <hi rend="italic">β</hi> = 0, the light is
                    complementary to that represented by (3).</p>
                <p>If two plates be superposed, the retardations are added if the azimuths
                    correspond; but they are subtracted if one plate be rotated relatively to the
                    other through 90°. It is thus possible to obtain colour by the superposition of
                    two nearly similar plates, although they may be too thick to answer the purpose
                    separately.</p>
                <p>If dispersion be neglected, the law of the colours in (3) is the same as that of
                    the reflected tints of Newton’s scale. The thicknesses of the plates of mica
                    (acting by double refraction) and of air required to give the same colour are as
                    400: 1. When a plate is too thick to show colour, its action may be analysed
                    with the aid of a spectroscope.</p>
                <p>Still thicker plates may be caused to exhibit colour, if the direction of the
                    light within them makes but a small angle with an optic axis. Let us suppose
                    that a plate of Iceland spar, or other uniaxal crystal (except quartz), cut
                    perpendicularly to the axis, is interposed between the polarizing and analysing
                    apparatus, and that the latter is so turned that the field is originally dark.
                    The ray which passes perpendicularly is not doubly refracted, so that the centre
                    of the field remains dark. At small angles to the optic axis the relative
                    retardation is evidently proportional to the square oi the inclination, so that
                    the colours are disposed in concentric rings. But the intensity is not the same
                    at the various parts of the circumference. In the plane of polarization and in
                    the perpendicular plane there is no double refraction, or rather one of the
                    refracted rays vanishes. Along the corresponding lines in the field of view
                    there is no revival of light, and the ring system is seen to be traversed by a
                    black cross.</p>
                <p>In many crystals the influence of dispersion is sufficient to sensibly modify the
                    proportionality of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to λ. In one variety of uniaxal
                    apophyllite Herschel found the rings nearly achromatic, indicating that <hi
                        rend="italic">p</hi> was almost independent of λ. Under these circumstances
                    a much larger number of rings than usual became visible.</p>
                <p>In biaxal crystals, cut so that the surfaces are equally inclined to the optic
                    axes, the rings take the form of lemniscates.</p>
                <p>A medium originally isotropic may acquire the doubly refracting property under
                    the influence of strain; and, if the strain be <hi rend="italic"
                        >homogeneous,</hi> the conditions are optically identical with those found
                    in a natural crystal. The principal axes of the wave-surface coincide with those
                    of strain. If the strain be symmetrical, the medium is optically uniaxal. In
                    general, if P, Q, R be the principal stresses, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n476/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0476-0451"/> the difference of velocities for waves
                    propagated parallel to R is evidently proportional to (P - Q), and so on.</p>
                <p>More often it happens that the strain is not homogeneous. Even then the small
                    parts may be compared to crystals, but the optical constants vary from point to
                    point. The comparatively feeble doubly refracting power thus developed in glass
                    may best be made evident by the production of the colours of polarized light.
                    Thus, in an experiment due to Brewster, a somewhat stout slab of glass, polished
                    on the edges, is interposed between crossed Nicols. When the slab is bent in a
                    plane perpendicular to that of vision, a revival of light takes place along the
                    edges, where the elongation and contraction is greatest. If the width (in the
                    direction of vision) be sufficient, the effect may be increased until the
                    various colours of Newton’s scale are seen. These colours vary from point to
                    point of the thickness in the plane of bending, the “neutral axis” remaining
                    dark. The optic axis, being everywhere coincident with the direction of
                    elongation (or contraction), is parallel to the length of the slab. To this
                    direction the plane of polarization should be inclined at about 45°.</p>
                <p>The condition of internal strain is not necessarily due to forces applied from
                    without. Thus, if glass originally free from strain be unequally heated, the
                    accompanying expansions give rise to internal strains which manifest themselves
                    in polarized light. If the heating be moderate, so as not to approach the
                    softening point, the state of ease is recovered upon cooling, and the double
                    refraction disappears. But if the local temperature be raised further, the hot
                    parts may relieve themselves of the temporary strain, and then upon cooling they
                    and other parts may be left in a condition of permanent strain. Sudden cooling
                    of glass heated to the softening point leads to a similar result. The outer
                    parts harden while the interior is still at a higher temperature, so that, when
                    the whole is cooled down, the outside, being as it were too large for the
                    inside, is in a condition of radial tension and circumferential compression. An
                    examination in polarized light shows that the strains thus occasioned are often
                    very severe. If any small part be relieved by fracture from the constraint
                    exercised upon it by the remainder, the doubly refracting property almost or
                    wholly disappears. In this respect unannealed glass differs essentially from a
                    crystal, all parts of which are similar and independent. It may be remarked that
                    it is difficult to find large pieces of glass so free from internal strain as to
                    show no revival of light when examined between crossed Nicols.</p>
                <p>§ 23. <hi rend="italic">Rotatory Polarization.</hi></p>
                <p>In general a polarized ray travelling along the axis of a uniaxal crystal
                    undergoes no change; but it was observed by Arago that, if quartz be used in
                    this experiment, the plane of polarization is found to be rotated through an
                    angle proportional to the thickness of crystal traversed. The subject was
                    further studied by Biot, who ascertained that the rotation due to a given
                    thickness is inversely as the square of the wave-length of the light, thus
                    varying very rapidly with the colour. In some, specimens of quartz (called in
                    consequence right-handed) the rotation is to the right, while in others it is to
                    the left. Equal thicknesses of right-and lefthanded quartz may thus compensate
                    one another.</p>
                <p>Fresnel has shown that the rotation of the plane may be interpreted as indicating
                    a different velocity of propagation of the two circularly-polarized components
                    into which plane-polarized light may always be resolved. In ordinary media the
                    right-and lefthanded circularly-polarized rays travel at the same speed, and at
                    any stage of their progress recompound a ray rectilinearly-polarized in a fixed
                    direction. But it is otherwise if the velocities of propagation of the circular
                    components be even slightly different.</p>
                <p>The first circularly-polarized wave may be expressed by</p>

                        k</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi> are inversely as the wave-lengths
                    of the two circular components for the same periodic time. When the relative
                    retardation amounts to an entire period, (<hi rend="italic">k</hi><hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>- <hi rend="italic">k</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                        1</hi>) <hi rend="italic">z=</hi> 2π, and then, by (4), θ = π. The
                    revolution of the plane through two right angles restores the original state of
                    polarization. In quartz the rotation is very rapid, amounting in the case of
                    yellow light to about 24° for each millimetre traversed.</p>
                <p>It is interesting to observe with what a high degree of accuracy the comparison
                    of the velocities of the two waves can be effected. If the plane of polarization
                    be determined to one minute of angle, a relative retardation of λ∕10800 is made
                    manifest. If <hi rend="italic">l</hi> be the thickness traversed, <hi
                        rend="italic">v</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v + δv</hi> the two velocities,
                    the relative retardation is <hi rend="italic">lδν/υ.</hi> To take an example,
                    suppose that <hi rend="italic">l=</hi> 20 inches, λ = <hi rend="superscript">
                        1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 40000</hi> inch; so that if δ <hi
                        rend="italic">v∣v</hi> exceed 10 <hi rend="superscript"> -8</hi>, the fact
                    might be detected.</p>
                <p>In quartz the rotation of the plane depends upon the crystalline structure, but
                    there are many liquids, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> oil of turpentine and
                    common syrup, which exhibit a like effect. In such cases the rotation is of
                    course independent of the direction of the light; it must be due to some
                    peculiarity in the constitution of the molecules.</p>
                <p>A remarkable connexion has been observed between the rotatory property and the
                    crystalline form. Thus Herschel found that in many specimens the right-handed
                    and left-handed varieties of quartz could be distinguished by the disposition of
                    certain subordinate faces. The crystals of opposite kinds are symmetrical in a
                    certain sense, but are yet not <hi rend="italic">superposable.</hi> The
                    difference is like that between otherwise similar right-and left-handed screws.
                    The researches of Pasteur upon the rotatory properties of tartaric acid have
                    opened up a new and most interesting field of chemistry. At that time two
                    isomeric varieties were known,—ordinary tartaric acid, which rotates to the
                    right, and racemic acid, which is optically inactive, properties of the acids
                    shared also by the salts. Pasteur found that the crystals of tartaric acid and
                    of the tartrates possessed a right-handed structure, and endeavoured to discover
                    corresponding bodies with a left-handed structure. After many trials
                    crystallizations of the double racemate of soda and ammonia were obtained,
                    including crystals of opposite kinds. A selection of the right-handed specimens
                    yielded ordinary dextro-tartaric acid, while a similar selection of the
                    left-handed crystals gave a new variety— laevo-tartaric acid, rotating the plane
                    of polarization to the left in the same degree as ordinary tartarie acid rotates
                    it to the right. A mixture in equal proportions of the two kinds of tartaric
                    acid, which differ scarcely at all in their chemical properties,<note

                    reconstitutes racemic acid.</p>
                <p>The possibility of inducing the rotatory property in bodies otherwise free from
                    it was one of the finest of Faraday’s discoveries. He found that, if heavy
                    glass, bisulphide of carbon, &amp;c., are placed in a magnetic field, a ray of
                    polarized light, propagated along the lines of magnetic force, suffers rotation.
                    The laws of the phenomenon were carefully studied by Verdet, whose conclusions
                    may be summed up by saying that in a given medium the rotation of the plane for
                    a ray proceeding in any direction is proportional to the difference of magnetic
                    potential at the initial and final points. In bisulphide of carbon, at 18° and
                    for a difference of potential equal to unity C. G. S., the rotation of the plane
                    of polarization of a ray of soda light is ⋅0402 minute of angle.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Phil.
                                Trans.,</hi> 1885, p. 343.</p></note></p>
                <p>A very important distinction should be noted between the magnetic rotation and
                    that natural to quartz, syrup, &amp;c. In the latter the rotation is always
                    right-handed or always left-handed with respect to the direction of the ray.
                    Hence when the ray is reversed the absolute direction of rotation is reversed
                    also. A ray which traverses a plate of quartz in one direction, and then after
                    reflexion traverses the same thickness again in the opposite direction, recovers
                    its original plane of polarization. It is quite otherwise with the rotation
                    under magnetic force. In this case the rotation is in the same absolute
                    direction even though the ray be reversed. Hence, if a ray be reflected
                    backwards and forwards any number of times along a line of magnetic force, the
                    rotations due to the several passages are all accumulated. The non-reversibility
                    of light in a magnetized medium proves the case to be of a very exceptional
                    character, and (as was argued by Thomson) indicates that the magnetized medium
                    is itself in rotatory motion independently of the propagation of light through
                        it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Maxwell’s <hi

                <p>The importance of polarimetric determinations has led to the contrivance of
                    various forms of apparatus adapted to the special requirements of the case. If
                    the light be bright enough, fairly accurate measurements may be made by merely
                    rotating a Nicol until the field appears dark. Probably the best form of

                    coloured components, is the Jellet,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    however, is only applicable to homogeneous light. In this apparatus, advantage
                    is taken of the action of a half-wave plate. In passing such a plate the plane

                    section, that is, rotated until it makes the same angle with the principal
                    section as at first, but upon the further side. The plate covers only half of
                    the field of view, and the eye is focused upon the <pb break="no"

                    the two halves of the field are different, unless the original plane be parallel
                    (or perpendicular) to the principal section. In the Laurent analyser the
                    halfwave plate is rigidly combined with a Nicol in such a position that the
                    principal section of the latter makes a small but finite angle with that of the
                    plate. The consequence is that the two halves of the field of view cannot be
                    blackened simultaneously, but are rendered equally dark when the instrument is
                    so turned that the principal section of the plate is parallel to the plane of
                    original polarization, which is also that of the uncovered half of the field. A
                    slight rotation in either direction darkens one half of the field and brightens
                    the other half.</p>
                <p>In another form of “half-shade” polarimeter, invented by Poynting, the half-wave
                    plate of the Laurent is dispensed with, a small rotation of one half of the
                    field with respect to the other half being obtained by quartz (cut
                    perpendicularly to the axis) or by syrup. In the simplest construction the syrup
                    is contained in a small cell with parallel glass sides, and the division into
                    two parts is effected by the insertion of a small piece of plate glass about <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 16</hi> inch thick, a
                    straight edge of which forms the dividing line. If the syrup be strong, the
                    difference of thickness of <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 16</hi> inch gives a relative rotation of about 2°. In this arrangement
                    the sugar cell is a fixture, and only the Nicol rotates. The reading of the
                    divided circle corresponds to the mean of the planes for the two halves of the
                    field, and this of course differs from the original position of the plane before
                    entering the sugar. This circumstance is usually of no importance, the object
                    being to determine the <hi rend="italic">rotation</hi> of the plane of
                    polarization when some of the conditions are altered.</p>
                <p>A discussion of the accuracy obtainable in polarimetry will be found in a recent

                    quartz, may be fitted together, so that a movement of the combination in either
                    direction increases the thickness of one variety traversed and diminishes that
                    of the other. The linear movement required to compensate the introduction of a

                <p>The explanation of diffraction phenomena given by Fresnel and his followers is
                    independent of special views as to the nature of the ether, at least in its main
                    features; for in the absence of a more complete foundation it is impossible to
                    treat rigorously the mode of action of a solid obstacle such as a screen. The
                    full solution of problems of this kind is scarcely to be expected. Even in the
                    much simpler case of sound, where we know what we have to deal with, the
                    mathematical difficulties are formidable; and we are not able to solve even such
                    an apparently elementary question as the transmission of sound past a rigid
                    infinitely thin plane screen, bounded by a straight edge, or perforated with a
                    circular aperture. But, without entering upon matters of this kind, we may
                    inquire in what manner a primary wave may be resolved into elementary secondary
                    waves, and in particular as to the law of intensity and polarization in a
                    secondary wave as dependent upon its direction of propagation, and upon the
                    character as regards polarization of the primary wave. This question is treated
                    by Stokes in his “Dynamical Theory of Diffraction”<note anchored="true"

                <p>It is to be observed that δ denotes the dilatation of volume of the element

                    medium is regarded as absolutely incompressible δ vanishes; but, in order that
                    equations (2) may preserve their generality, we must suppose <hi rend="italic"

                <p>These equations simplify very much in their application to plane waves. If the

                        rend="italic">t</hi> only. Equation (1) and the first pair of equations (2)
                    are thus satisfied identically. The third equation gives f- <hi

                    “Let ξ = 0, η = 0, <hi rend="italic">ζ=f(bt-x)</hi> be the displacements

                <p>The occurrence of sin <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> as a factor in (6) shows that the

                    regards polarization. If the direction of primary vibration be perpendicular to
                    the plane of diffraction (containing both primary and secondary rays), sin <hi
                        rend="italic">φ =</hi> 1; but, if the primary vibration be in the plane of
                    diffraction, sin <hi rend="italic">φ =</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">θ.</hi> This
                    result was employed by Stokes as a criterion of the direction of vibration; and
                    his experiments, conducted with gratings, led him to the conclusion that the
                    vibrations of polarized light are executed in a direction <hi rend="italic"
                        >perpendicular</hi> to the plane of polarization.</p>
                <p>The factor (1 + cos θ) shows in what manner the secondary disturbance depends
                    upon the direction in which it is propagated with respect to the front of the
                    primary wave.</p>
                <p>If, as suffices for all practical purposes, we limit the application of the
                    formulae to points in advance of the plane at which the wave is supposed to be
                    broken up, we may use simpler methods of resolution than that above considered.
                    It appears indeed that the purely mathematical question has no definite answer.
                    In illustration of this the analogous problem for sound may be referred to.
                    Imagine a flexible lamina to be introduced so as to coincide with the plane at
                    which resolution is to be effected. The introduction of the lamina (supposed to
                    be devoid of inertia) will make no difference to the propagation of plane
                    parallel sonorous waves through the position which it occupies. At every point
                    the motion of the lamina will be the same as would have occurred in its absence,
                    the pressure of the waves impinging from behind being just what is required to
                    generate the waves in front. Now it is evident that the aerial motion in front
                    of the lamina is determined by what happens at the lamina without regard to the
                    cause of the motion there existing. Whether the necessary forces are due to
                    aerial pressures acting on the rear, or to forces directly impressed from
                    without, is a matter of indifference. The conception of the lamina leads
                    immediately to two schemes, according to which a primary wave may be supposed to
                    be broken up. In the first of these the element <hi rend="italic">d</hi> S the
                    effect of which is to be estimated, is supposed to execute its actual motion,
                    while every other element of the plane lamina is maintained at rest. The
                    resulting aerial motion in front is readily calculated;<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Theory of Sound,</hi> §

                    secondary disturbance thus obtaiued is integrated with respect to <hi
                        rend="italic">d</hi> S over the entire plane of the lamina, the result is
                    necessarily the same as would have been obtained had the primary wave been
                    supposed to pass on without resolution, for this is precisely the motion
                    generated when every element of the lamina vibrates with a common motion, equal
                    to that attributed to <hi rend="italic">d</hi> S. The only assumption here
                    involved is tho evidently legitimate one that, when two systems of variously
                        distributed<pb break="no"

                    corresponding motions in front are superposed also.</p>
                <p>The method of resolution just described is the simplest, but it is only one of an
                    indefinite number that might be proposed, and which are all equally legitimate,
                    so long as the question is regarded as a merely mathematical one, without
                    reference to the physical properties of actual screens. If, instead of supposing
                    the <hi rend="italic">motion</hi> at <hi rend="italic">d</hi> S to be that of
                    the primary wave, and to be zero elsewhere, we suppose the <hi rend="italic"

                    lamina to be that corresponding to the primary wave, and to vanish elsewhere, we
                    obtain a secondary wave following quite a different law.<note anchored="true"

                    directions varies as cos θ, vanishing at right angles to the direction of
                    propagation of the primary wave. Here again, on integration over the entire
                    lamina, the aggregate effect of the secondary waves is necessarily the same as
                    that of the primary.</p>
                <p>In order to apply these ideas to the investigation of the secondary wave of

                    motion in an infinitely extended elastic solid due to a locally applied periodic

                <p>The occurrence of sinϕ shows that there is no disturbance radi ated in the
                    direction of the force, a feature which might have been anticipated from
                    considerations of symmetry.</p>
                <p>We will now apply (18) to the investigation of a law of secondary disturbance,
                    when a primary wave f= sin <hi rend="italic">(nt - kx)</hi> (19)</p>
                <p>is supposed to be broken up in passing the plane <hi rend="italic">x</hi> =0. The
                    first step is to calculate the force which represents the reaction between the
                    parts of the medium separated by <hi rend="italic">x</hi> =0. The force
                    operative upon the positive half is parallel to OZ, and of amount per unit of
                    area equal to <hi rend="italic">- b-~Ddζ∣dx≈</hi> δ <hi rend="superscript">
                        2</hi> ΛD cos <hi rend="italic">nt;</hi> and to this force acting over the
                    whole of the plane the actual motion on the positive side may be conceived to be
                    due. The secondary disturbance corresponding to the element <hi rend="italic"
                        >d</hi> S of the plane may be supposed to be that caused by a force of the
                    above magnitude acting over <hi rend="italic">d</hi> S and vanishing elsewhere;
                    and it only remains to examine what the result of such a force would be.</p>
                <p>Now it is evident that the force in question, supposed to act upon the positive
                    half only of the medium, produces just double of the effect that would be caused
                    by the same force if the medium were undivided, and on the latter supposition
                    (being also localized at a point) it comes under the head already considered.
                    According to (18), the effect of the force acting at <hi rend="italic">dS</hi>
                    parallel to OZ, and of amount equal to</p>
                <p>2δ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> UDdS cos «ί, will be a disturbance</p>

                    therefore expresses the secondary disturbance at a distance <hi rend="italic"
                        >r</hi> and in a direction making an angle <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> with OZ
                    (the direction of primary vibration) due to the element <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    S of the wave-front.</p>
                <p>The proportionality of the secondary disturbance to sinϕ is common to the present
                    law and to that given by Stokes, but here there is no dependence upon the angle
                        <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> between the primary and secondary rays. The
                    occurrence of the factor (λr) <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi>, and the necessity
                    of supposing the phase of the secondary wave accelerated by a quarter of an
                    undulation, were first established by Archibald Smith, as the result of a
                    comparison between the primary wave, supposed to pass on without resolution, and
                    the integrated effect of all the secondary waves (§ 10). The occurrence of
                    factors such as sinϕ, or ½(1+cos <hi rend="italic">θ</hi>), in the expression of
                    the secondary wave has no influence upon the result of the integration, the
                    effects of all the elements for which the factors differ appreciably from unity
                    being destroyed by mutual interference.</p>
                <p>The choice between various methods of resolution, all mathematically admissible,
                    would be guided by physical considerations respecting the mode of action of
                    obstacles. Thus, to refer again to the acoustical analogue in which plane waves
                    are incident upon a perforated rigid screen, the circumstances of the case are
                    best represented by the first method of resolution, leading to symmetrical
                    secondary waves, in which the normal motion is supposed to <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n479/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0479-0454"/> be zero over the unperforated parts. Indeed,
                    if the aperture is very small, this method gives the correct result, save as to
                    a constant factor. In like manner our present law (20) would apply to the kind
                    of obstruction that would be caused by an actual physical division of the
                    elastic medium, extending over the whole of the area supposed to be occupied by
                    the intercepting screen, but of course not extending to the parts supposed to be
                    perforated. In the present state of our ignorance this law seems to be at least
                    as plausible as any other.</p>

                <p>The theory of the diffraction, dispersion, or scattering of light by small
                    particles, as it has variously been called, is of importance, not only from its
                    bearings upon fundamental optical hypotheses, but on account of its application
                    to explain the origin and nature of the light from the sky. The view, suggested
                    by Newton and advocated in more recent times by such authorities as

                    then prevalent notion that the suspended moisture of clouds and mists was in the
                    form of vesicles or bubbles. Experiments such as those of Brücke<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Pοgg.
                                Ann.,</hi> vol. lxxxiii.</p></note> pointed to a different
                    conclusion. When a weak alcoholic solution of mastic is agitated with water, the
                    precipitated gum scatters a blue light, obviously similar in character to that
                    from the sky. Not only would it be unreasonable to attribute a vesicular
                    structure to the mastic, but (as Brücke remarked) the dispersed light is much
                    richer in quality than the blue of the first order. Another point of great
                    importance is well brought out in the experiments of Tyndall<note

                    precipitated by the chemical action of light. Whenever the particles are

                    direction perpendicular to the incident beam, is <hi rend="italic">completely
                        polarized</hi></p>
                <p>About the colour there can be no <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> difficulty;
                    for, as soon as the question is raised, it is seen that the standard of linear
                    dimension, with reference to which the particles are called small, is the
                    wave-length of light, and that a given set of particles would (on any
                    conceivable view as to their mode of action) produce a continually increasing
                    disturbance as we pass along the spectrum towards the more refrangible end.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, that the direction of complete polarization should be
                    independent of the refracting power of the matter composing the cloud has been
                    considered mysterious. Of course, on the theory of thin plates, this direction
                    would be determined by Brewster’s law; but, if the particles of foreign matter
                    are small in all their dimensions, the circumstances are materially different
                    from those under which Brewster’s law is applicable.</p>
                <p>The investigation of this question upon the elastic solid theory will depend upon
                    how we suppose the solid to vary from one optical medium to another. The slower
                    propagation of light in glass or water than in air or vacuum may be attributed
                    to a greater density, or to a less rigidity, in the former case; or we may adopt
                    the more complicated supposition that both these quantities vary, subject only
                    to the condition which restricts the ratio of velocities to equality with the
                    known refractive index. It will presently appear that the original hypothesis of
                    Fresnel, that the rigidity remains the same in both media, is the only one that
                    can be reconciled with the facts; and we will therefore investigate upon this
                    basis the nature of the secondary waves dispersed by small particles.</p>
                <p>Conceive a beam of plane polarized light to move among a number of particles, all
                    small compared with any of the wavelengths. According to our hypothesis, the
                    foreign matter may be supposed to <hi rend="italic">load</hi> the aether, so as
                    to increase its <hi rend="italic">inertia</hi> without altering its resistance
                    to distortion. If the particles were away, the wave would pass on unbroken and
                    no light would be emitted laterally. Even with the particles retarding the
                    motion of the aether, the same will be true if, to counterbalance the increased
                    inertia, suitable forces are caused to act on the aether at all points where the
                    inertia is altered. These forces have the same period and direction as the
                    undisturbed luminous vibrations themselves. The light actually emitted laterally
                    is thus the same as would be caused by forces exactly the opposite of these
                    acting on the medium otherwise free from disturbance, and it only remains to see
                    what the effect of such force would be.</p>
                <p>On account of the smallness of the particles, the forces acting throughout the
                    volume of any individual particle are all of the same intensity and direction,
                    and may be considered as a whole. The determination of the motion in the aether,
                    due to the action of a periodic force at a given point, is a problem with which
                    we have recently been occupied (§ 24). But, before applying the solution to a
                    mathematical investigation of the present question, it may be well to consider
                    the matter for a few moments from a more general point of view.</p>
                <p>In the first place, there is necessarily a complete symmetry round the direction
                    of the force. The disturbance, consisting of trans verse vibrations, is
                    propagated outwards in all directions from the centre; and, in consequence of
                    the symmetry, the direction of vibration in any ray lies in the plane containing
                    the ray and the axis of symmetry; that is to say, the direction of vibration in
                    the scattered or diffracted ray makes with the direction of vibration in the
                    incident or primary ray the least possible angle. The symmetry also requires
                    that the intensity of the scattered light should vanish for the ray which would
                    be propagated along the axis; for there is nothing to distinguish one direction
                    transverse to the ray from another. The application of this is obvious. Suppose,
                    for distinctness of statement, that the primary ray is vertical, and that the
                    plane of vibration is that of the meridian. The intensity of the light scattered
                    by a small particle is constant, and a maximum, for rays which lie in the
                    vertical plane running east and west, while there is <hi rend="italic">no
                        scattered ray along the north and smith line.</hi> If the primary ray is
                    unpolarized, the light scattered north and south is entirely due to that
                    component which vibrates east and west, and is therefore <hi rend="italic"
                        >perfectly polarized,</hi> the direction of its vibration being also east
                    and west. Similarly any other ray scattered horizontally is perfectly polarized,
                    and the vibration is performed in the horizontal plane. In other directions the
                    polarization becomes less and less complete as we approach the vertical.</p>
                <p>The observed facts as to polarization are thus readily explained, and the general
                    law connecting the intensity of the scattered light with the wave-length follows
                    almost as easily from considerations of <hi rend="italic">dimensions.</hi></p>
                <p>The object is to compare the intensities of the incident and scattered light, for
                    these will clearly be proportional. The number (<hi rend="italic">i</hi>)
                    expressing the ratio of the two amplitudes is a function of the following
                    quantities :—(T) the volume of the disturbing particle; (r) the distance of the
                    point under consideration from it; (λ) the wave-length; (<hi rend="italic"
                        >b</hi>) the velocity of propagation of light; (D) and (D') the original and
                    altered densities: of which the first three depend only upon space, the fourth
                    on space and time, while the fifth and sixth introduce the consideration of
                    mass. Other elements of the problem there are none, except mere numbers and
                    angles, which do not depend upon the fundamental measurements of space, time,
                    and mass. Since the ratio (<hi rend="italic">i</hi>), whose expression we seek,
                    is of no dimensions in mass, it follows at once that D and D' occur only under
                    the form D: D', which is a simple number and may therefore be disregarded. It
                    remains to find how <hi rend="italic">i</hi> varies with T, <hi rend="italic">r,
                        λ, b.</hi></p>
                <p>Now, of these quantities, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is the only one depending on
                    time; and therefore, as <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is of no dimensions in time,
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi> cannot occur in its expression.</p>
                <p>Moreover, since the same amount of energy is propagated across all spheres
                    concentric with the particle, we recognize that <hi rend="italic">i</hi> varies
                    as <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> It is equally evident that <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    varies as T, and therefore that it must be proportional to T∕λ <hi rend="italic"
                        >r</hi>, T being of three dimensions in space. In passing from one part of
                    the spectrum to another, λ is the only quantity which varies, and we have the
                    important law :—</p>
                <p>When light is scattered by particles which are very small compared with any of
                    the wave-lengths, the ratio of the amplitudes of the vibrations of the scattered
                    and incident lights varies inversely as the square of the wave-length, and the
                    ratio of <hi rend="italic">intensities</hi> as the inverse fourth power.</p>
                <p>The light scattered from small particles is of a much richer blue than the blue
                    of the first order as reflected from a very thin plate. From the general theory
                    (§ 8), or by the method of dimensions, it is easy to prove that in the latter
                    case the intensity varies as λ <hi rend="superscript"> -2</hi>, instead of λ <hi
                        rend="superscript"> -4</hi>.</p>
                <p>The principle of energy makes it clear that the light emitted laterally is not a
                    new creation, but only diverted from the main stream. If I represent the
                    intensity of the primary light after traversing a thickness <hi rend="italic"
                        >x</hi> of the turbid medium, we have <hi rend="italic">d</hi> I <hi

                    altogether similar to that of absorption, and showing how the light tends to
                    become yellow and finally red as the thickness of the medium increases.<note

                <p>We may now investigate the mathematical expression for the disturbance propagated
                    in any direction from a small particle upon which a beam of light strikes. Let
                    the particle be at the origin of coordinates, and let the expression for the
                    primary vibration be ς=sin(<hi rend="italic">nt-kx</hi>) (2).</p>
                <p>The acceleration of the element at the origin is - <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">nt;</hi> so that the
                    force which would have to be applied to the parts where the density is D'
                    (instead of D), in order that the waves might pass on undisturbed, is per unit
                    of volume,</p>

                <p>To obtain the total force which must be supposed to act, the factor T
                    (representing the volume of the particle) must be introduced. The opposite of
                    this, conceived to act at O, would give the same disturbance as is actually
                    caused by the presence of the particle. Thus by (18) (§ 24) the secondary

                <p>The preceding investigation is based upon the assumption that in passing from one
                    medium to another the rigidity of the aether does not change. If we forego this
                    assumption, the question is necessarily more complicated; but, on the
                    supposition that the changes of rigidity (∆N) and of density (∆I)) are
                    relatively small, the results are fairly simple. If the primary wave be

                <p>The expression for the resultant rotation in the general case would be rather
                    complicated, and is not needed for our purpose. It is easily seen to be about an
                    axis perpendicular to the scattered ray <hi rend="italic">(x, y, z),</hi>

                <p>Let us consider the more special case of a ray scattered normally to the incident
                    ray, so that <hi rend="italic">x=0.</hi> We have</p>

                <p>If ∆N, ∆D be both finite, we learn from (7) that there is no direction
                    perpendicular to the primary (polarized) ray in which the secondary light
                    vanishes. Now experiment tells us plainly that there is such a direction, and
                    therefore we are driven to the conclusion that either ∆N or ∆D must vanish.</p>
                <p>The consequences of supposing ∆N to be zero have already been traced. They agree
                    very well with experiment, and require us to suppose that the vibrations are
                    perpendicular to the plane of polarization. So far as (7) is concerned the
                    alternative supposition that ∆D vanishes would answer equally well, if we
                    suppose the vibrations to be executed in the plane of polarization; but let us
                    now revert to (5), which gives</p>

                <p>According to these equations there would be, in all, six directions from O along
                    which there is no scattered light,—two along the axis of <hi rend="italic"
                        >y</hi> normal to the original ray, and four (<hi rend="italic">y</hi> = 0,

                    that ray. So long as the particles are small no such vanishing of light in
                    oblique directions is observed, and we are thus led to the conclusion that the
                    hypothesis of a finite ∆N and of vibrations in the plane of polarization cannot
                    be reconciled with the facts. No form of the elastic solid theory is admissible

                    this subject it may be instructive to show the application of a method, similar
                    to that used for small particles, to the case of an obstructing <hi
                        rend="italic">cylinder,</hi> whose axis is parallel to the fronts of the
                    primary waves. We will suppose (1) that the variation of optical properties
                    depends upon a difference of density (D' —D), and is small in amount; (2) that
                    the diameter of the cylinder is very small in comparison with the wave-length of
                    light.</p>
                <p>Let the axis of the cylinder be the axis of <hi rend="italic">z</hi> (fig. 26),
                    and (as before) let the incident light be parallel to <hi rend="italic">x.</hi>
                    The original vibration is thus, in the principal cases, parallel to either <hi
                        rend="italic">z</hi> or <hi rend="italic">y.</hi> We will take first the
                    former case, where the disturbance due to the cylinder must evidently be
                    symmetrical round OZ and parallel to it. The element of the disturbance at A,
                    due to PQ <hi rend="italic">(dz),</hi> will be proportional to <hi rend="italic"

                    perpendicular to OZ, it is only necessary to introduce the factor cos α in order
                    to make the previous expression (9) applicable.</p>
                <p>The investigation shows that the light diffracted by an ideal wiregrating would,
                    according to the principles of Fresnel, follow the law of polarization
                    enunciated by Stokes. On the other hand, this law would be departed from were we
                    to suppose that there is any difference of rigidity between the cylinder and the
                    surrounding medium.</p>
                <p>§ 26. <hi rend="italic">Reflexion and Refraction.</hi></p>
                <p>So far as the directions of the rays are concerned, the laws of reflexion and
                    refraction were satisfactorily explained by Huygens on the principles of the
                    wave theory. The question of the <hi rend="italic">amount</hi> of light
                    reflected, as dependent upon the characters of the media and upon the angle of
                    incidence, is a much more difficult one, and cannot be dealt with <hi
                        rend="italic">a priori</hi> without special hypotheses as to the nature of
                    the luminous vibrations, and as to the cause of the difference between various
                    media. By a train of reasoning, not strictly dynamical, but of great ingenuity,
                    Fresnel was led to certain formulae, since known by his name, expressing the
                    ratio of the reflected to the incident vibration in terms of one constant (μ).
                    If <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> be the angle of incidence and <hi rend="italic"
                        >θ</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the angle of refraction, Fresnel’s
                    expression for light polarized in the plane of incidence is sin(0-0 <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> /n</hi> sin(0 + 0 <hi

                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> (2).</p>
                <p>In like manner, for light polarized perpendicularly to the plane of incidence,
                    Fresnel found <hi rend="underline">tan(0-0</hi><hi rend="subscript underline">
                        1</hi><hi rend="underline">)</hi><hi rend="subscript"> (3)</hi> tan(0 + 0

                <p>In the particular case of perpendicular incidence, both formulae coincide with
                    one previously given by Young, viz.,</p>
                <p>(μ-l)∕(μ + l). . . . . . . (4).</p>
                <p>Since these formulae agree fairly well with observation, and are at any rate the
                    simplest that can at all represent the facts, it may be advisable to consider
                    their significance a little in detail. As θincreases from 0 to ½ <hi
                        rend="italic">π,</hi> the sine-formula increases from Young’s value to
                    unity. We may see this most easily with the aid of a slight transformation

                    continuously from 1 to 0, and therefore (1) increases from (μ-l)∕(μ + l) to
                    unity.</p>
                <p>It is quite otherwise with the tangent-formula. Commencing at Young’s value, it
                    diminishes, as θ increases, until it attains zero, when <hi rend="italic">θ +

                    Brewster. It presents itself here as the <pb break="no"

                    reflexion of the polarized light under consideration. As the angle of incidence
                    passes through the polarizing angle, the reflected vibration changes sign, and
                    increases in numerical value until it attains unity at a grazing incidence (θ =
                    ½π).</p>
                <p>We have hitherto supposed that the second medium (into which the light enters at
                    the refracting surface) is the denser. In the contrary case, total reflexion
                    sets in as soon as sin <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> =μ <hi rend="superscript">
                        -1</hi>, at which point <hi rend="italic">θ</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    becomes imaginary. We shall be able to follow this better in connexion with a
                    mechanical theory.</p>
                <p>If light falls upon the first surface of a parallel plate at the polarizing
                    angle, the refracted ray also meets the second surface of the plate at the
                    appropriate polarizing angle. For if <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> be the index of
                    the second medium relatively to the first, the tangent of the angle of
                    incidence, which is also the cotangent of the angle of refraction, is equal to
                        <hi rend="italic">μ.</hi> At the second surface (the third medium being the
                    same as the first) the angles of incidence and refraction are interchanged, aud
                    therefore the condition for the polarizing angle is satisfied, since the index
                    for the second refraction is <hi rend="italic">μ</hi><hi

                <p>The principal formulae apply to light polarized in, and perpendicular to, the
                    plane of incidence. If the plane of polarization make an angle <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The formulae for the intensities of the refracted light follow immediately from
                    the corresponding formulae relative to the reflected light in virtue of the
                    principle of energy. The simplest way to regard the matter is to suppose the
                    refracted light to emerge from the second medium into a third medium similar to
                    the first without undergoing loss from a second reflexion, a supposition which
                    would be realized if the transition between the two media were very gradual
                    instead of abrupt. The intensities of the different lights may then be measured
                    in the same way; and the supposition that no loss of energy is incurred when the
                    incident light gives rise to the reflected and refracted lights requires that
                    the sum of the squares of the vibrations representing the latter shall be equal
                    to the square of the vibration representing the former, viz., unity. We thus
                    obtain, in the two cases corresponding to (1) and (3),</p>

                <p>A plate of glass, or a pile of parallel plates, is often convenient as a

                    reflected, even when the incident light is unpolarized. The polarization of the

                <p>The investigation has been extended by Stokes so as to cover the case in which
                    the plates exercise an absorbing influence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The verification of Fresnel’s formulae by direct photometric measurement is a
                    matter of some difficulty. The proportion of perpendicularly incident light
                    transmitted by a glass plate has been investigated by Rood;<note anchored="true"

                    absorption. If we attempt to deal directly with the reflected light, the
                    experimental difficulties are much increased; but the evidence is in favour of
                    the approximate correctness of Fresnel’s formulae when light is reflected nearly
                    perpendicularly from a recently polished glass surface. When the surface is old,
                    even though carefully cleaned, there may be a considerable falling off of
                    reflecting power.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Οn
                            the Intensity of Light reflected from Certain Surfaces at nearly

                <p>We have seen that according to Fresnel’s tangent-formula there would be
                    absolutely no reflexion of light polarized perpendicularly to the plane of
                    incidence, when the angle of incidence is tan <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi> μ,
                    or, which comes to the same thing, common light reflected at this angle could be
                    perfectly extinguished with a Nicol’s prism.</p>
                <p>It was first observed by Airy that in the case of the diamond and other highly
                    refracting media this law is only approximately in accordance with the facts. It
                    is readily proved by experiment that, whatever be the angle of incidence,
                    sunlight reflected from a plate of black glass is incapable of being quenched by
                    a Nicol, and is therefore imperfectly plane-polarized.</p>
                <p>This subject has been studied by Jamin. The character of the reflected vibration
                    can be represented, as regards both amplitude and phase, by the situation in a
                    plane of a point P relatively to the origin of coordinates O. The length of the
                    line OP represents the amplitude, while the inclination of OP to the axis of <hi
                        rend="italic">x</hi> represents the phase. According to Fresnel’s formula
                    appropriate to light polarized perpendicularly to the plane of incidence, P is
                    situated throughout on the axis of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> passing through O
                    when the angle of incidence is tan <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">μ.</hi> Jamin found, however, that in general P does not pass
                    through O, but above or below it. When P is on the axis of <hi rend="italic"
                        >y,</hi> the amplitude is a minimum, and the phase is midway between the
                    extreme phases. For one class of bodies the phase is in arrear of that
                    corresponding to perpendicular incidence, and for another class of bodies in
                    advance. In a few intermediate cases P passes sensibly through O; and then the
                    change of phase is sudden, and the minimum amplitude is zero.</p>
                <p>In the case of metals the polarization produced by reflexion is still more
                    incomplete. Light polarized perpendicularly to the plane of incidence is
                    reflected at all angles, the amount, however, decreasing as the angle of
                    incidence increases from 0° to about 75°, and then again increasing up to a
                    grazing incidence. The most marked effect is the relative retardation of one
                    polarized component with respect to the other. At an angle of about 75° this
                    retardation amounts to a quarter period.</p>
                <p>The intensity of reflexion from metals is often very high. From silver, even at
                    perpendicular incidence, as much as 95 per cent. of the incident light is
                    reflected. There is reason for regarding the high reflecting power of metals as
                    connected with the intense absorption which they exercise. Many aniline dyes
                    reflect in abnormal proportion from their surface those rays of the spectrum to
                    which they are most opaque. The peculiar absorption spectrum of permanganate of
                    potash is reproduced in the light reflected from a surface of a crystal.<note

                <p>On the theory which assimilates the aether to an elastic solid, the investigation
                    of reflexion and refraction presents no very serious difficulties, but the
                    results do not harmonize very well with optical observation. It is, however, of
                    some importance to understand that reflexion and refraction can be explained, at
                    least in their principal features, on a perfectly definite and intelligible
                    theory, which, if not strictly applicable to the aether, has at any rate a
                    distinct mechanical significance. The refracting surface and the wave-fronts may
                    for this purpose be supposed to be plane.</p>

                <p>If we assume the complete accuracy of Fresnel’s expressions, either alternative
                    agrees with observation: only, if N = N <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, light must
                    be supposed to vibrate normally to the plane of polarization; while, if D = D
                        <hi rend="subscript"> υ</hi> the vibrations are parallel to that plane.</p>
                <p>An intermediate supposition, according to which the refraction-is regarded as due
                    partly to a difference of density and partly to a difference of rigidity, could
                    scarcely be reconciled with observation, unless one variation were very
                    subordinate to the other. But the most satisfactory argument against the joint
                    variation is that derived from the theory of the diffraction of light by small
                    particles (§ 25).</p>
                <p>We will now, limiting ourselves for simplicity to Fresnel’s supposition (N <hi

                    when total reflexion sets in. The symbolical expressions for the reflected and

                <p>In this case there is a refracted wave of the ordinary kind, conveying away a
                    part of the original energy. When, however, the second medium is the rarer (V

                <p>Since <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is supposed to be negative in the second medium,
                    we see that the disturbance is there confined to a small distance (a few
                    wave-lengths) from the surface, and no energy is propagated into the interior.
                    The whole of the energy of the incident waves is to be found in the reflected
                    waves, or the reflexion is <hi rend="italic">total.</hi> There is, however, a
                    change of phase of 2e, given by (20), or in terms of V, V <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>The principal application of the formulae being to reflexions when the second

                    Fresnel. His argument was perhaps not set forth with full rigour, but of its
                    substantial validity there can be no question. By a similar process Fresnel
                    deduced from his tangent-formula for the change of phase (2√) accompanying total
                    reflexion when the vibrations are executed in the plane of incidence, tan e ’

                <p>The phase-differences represented by 2e and 2∈' cannot be investigated
                    experimentally, but the <hi rend="italic">difference</hi> (2√ - 2e) is rendered
                    evident when the incident light is polarized obliquely so as to contribute
                    components in both the principal planes. If in the act of reflexion one
                    component is retarded more or less than the other, the resultant light is no

                <p>The most interesting case occurs when the difference of phase amounts to a
                    quarter of a period, corresponding to light circularly polarized. If, however,

                <p>The desired object may, however, be attained by two successive reflexions. The

                <p>It appears that, when ∕x = l"51, 0 = 48° 37' or 54° 37'.</p>
                <p>These results were verified by Fresnel by means of the rhomb shown in fig.
                    27.</p>
                <p>The problem of reflexion upon the elastic solid theory, when the vibrations are
                    executed in the plane of incidence, is more complicated, on account of the
                    tendency to form waves of dilatation. In order to get rid of these, to which no
                    optical phenomena correspond, it is necessary to follow Green in supposing that
                    the velocity of such waves is infinite, or that the media are
                        incompressible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                            supposition that the velocity is zero, favoured by some writers, is
                            inadmissible. Even dilatational waves involve a shearing of the medium,
                            and must therefore be propagated at a finite rate, unless the resistance
                            to compression were <hi rend="italic">negative.</hi> But in that case
                            the equilibrium would be unstable.</p></note> Even then we have to
                    introduce in the neighbourhood of the interface waves variously called
                    longitudinal, pressurai, or surface waves; otherwise it is impossible to satisfy
                    the conditions of continuity of strain and stress. These waves, analogous in
                    this respect to those occurring in the second medium when total reflexion is in
                    progress (19), extend to a depth of a few wave-lengths only, and they are so
                    constituted that there is neither dilatation nor rotation. On account of them
                    the final formulae are less simple than those of Fresnel. If we suppose the
                    densities to be the same in the two media, there is no correspondence whatever
                    between theory and observation. In this case, as we have seen, vibrations
                    perpendicular to the plane of incidence are reflected according to Fresnel’s
                    tangent-formula; and thus vibrations in the plane of incidence should follow the
                    sine-formula. The actual result of theory is, however, quite different. In the
                    case where the relative index does not differ greatly from unity, polarizing
                    angles of 22½ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> and 67½° are indicated, a result
                    totally at variance with observation. As in the case of diffraction by small
                    particles, an elastic solid theory, in which the densities in various media are
                    supposed to be equal, is inadmissible. If, on the other hand, following Green,
                    we regard the rigidities as equal, we get results in better agreement with
                    observation. To a first approximation indeed (when the refraction is small)
                    Green’s formula coincides with Fresnel’s tangent-formula; so that light
                    vibrating in the plane of incidence is reflected according to this law, and
                    light vibrating in the perpendicular plane according to the sine-formula. The
                    vibrations are accordingly perpendicular to the plane of polarization.</p>
                <p>The deviations from the tangent-formula, indicated by theory when the refraction
                    is not very small, are of the same general character as those observed by Jamin,
                    but of much larger amount. The minimum reflexion at the surface of glass (μ =
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) would be <hi

                    which takes place at perpendicular incidence, and very much in excess of the
                    truth. This theory cannot therefore be considered satisfactory as it stands, and
                    various suggestions have been made for its improvement. The only variations from
                    Green’s suppositions admissible in strict harmony with an elastic solid theory
                    is to suppose that the transition from one medium to the other is gradual
                    instead of abrupt, that is, that the transitional layer is of thickness
                    comparable with the wave-length. This modification would be of more service to a
                    theory which gave Fresnel’s tangent-formula as the result of a sudden transition
                    than to one in which the deviations from that formula are already too great.</p>
                <p>It seems doubtful whether there is much to be gained by further discussion upon
                    this subject, in view of the failure of the elastic solid theory to deal with
                    double refraction. The deviations from Fresnel’s formulae for reflexion are
                    comparatively small; and the whole problem of reflexion is so much concerned
                    with the condition of things at the interface of two media, about which we know
                    little, that valuable guidance can hardly be expected from this quarter. It is
                    desirable to bear constantly in mind that reflexion depends entirely upon an
                    approach to discontinuity in the properties of the medium. If the thickness of
                    the transitional layer amounted to a few wave-lengths, there would be no
                    sensible reflexion at all.</p>
                <p>Another point may here be mentioned. Our theories of reflexion take no account of
                    the fact that one at least of the media is dispersive. The example of a
                    stretched string, executing transverse vibrations, and composed of two parts,
                    one of which in virtue of stiffness possesses in some degree the dispersive
                    property, shows that the boundary conditions upon which reflexion depends are
                    thereby modified. We may thus expect a finite reflexion at the interface of two
                    media, if the dispersive powers are different, even though the indices be
                    absolutely the same for the waves under consideration, in which case there is no
                    refraction. But a knowledge of the dispersive properties of the media is not
                    sufficient to determine the reflexion without recourse to hypothesis.<note

                <p>§ 28. <hi rend="italic">The Velocity of Light.</hi></p>
                <p>According to the principles of the wave theory, the dispersion of refraction can
                    only be explained as due to a variation of velocity with wave-length or period.
                    In aerial vibrations, and in those propagated through an elastic solid, there is
                    no such variation; and so the existence of dispersion was at one time considered
                    to be a serious objection to the wave theory. Dispersion <hi rend="italic">in
                        vacuo</hi> would indeed present some difficulty, or at least force upon us
                    views which at present seem unlikely as to the constitution of free aether. The
                    weight of the evidence is, however, against the existence of dispersion <hi
                        rend="italic">in vacuo.</hi> “Were there a difference of one hour in the
                    times of the blue and red rays reaching us from Algol, this star would show a
                    well-marked coloration in its phases of increase and decrease. No trace of
                    coloration having been noticed, the difference of times cannot exceed a fraction
                    of an hour. It is not at all probable that the parallax of this star amounts to
                    one-tenth of a second, so that its distance, probably, exceeds two million radii
                    of the earth’s orbit, and the time which is required for its light to reach us
                    probably exceeds thirty years, or a quarter of a million hours. It is therefore
                    difficult to see how there can be a difference as great as four parts in a
                    million between the velocities of light coming from near the two ends of the
                    bright part of the spectrum.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Newcomb concludes, as the most probable result—</p>
                <p>Velocity of light <hi rend="italic">in νacuο=</hi> 299,860±30 kilometres.</p>
                <p>It should be mentioned that Young and Forbes inferred from their observations a
                    difference of velocities of blue and red light amounting to about 2 per cent.,
                    but that neither Michelson nor Newcomb, using Foucault’s method, could detect
                    any trace of such a difference.</p>
                <p>When we come to consider the propagation of light through ponderable media, there
                    seems to be little reason for expecting to find the velocity independent of
                    wave-length. The interaction of matter and aether may well give rise to such a
                    degree of complication that the differential equation expressing the vibrations
                    shall contain more than one constant. The law of constant velocity is a special
                    property of certain very simple media. Even in the case of a stretched string,
                    vibrating transversely, the velocity becomes a function of wave-length as soon
                    as we admit the existence of finite stiffness.</p>
                <p>As regards the law of dispersion, a formula, derived by Cauchy from theoretical
                    considerations, was at one time generally accepted. According to this,</p>
                <p>μ = A+Bλ <hi rend="superscript"> -2</hi> + Cλ <hi rend="superscript"> -4</hi> +
                    (1); and there is no doubt that even the first two terms give a good
                    representation of the truth in media not very dispersive, and over the more
                    luminous portion of the spectrum. A formula of this kind treats dispersion as
                    due to the smallness of wave-lengths, giving a definite limit to refraction (A)
                    when the wave-length is very large. Recent investigations by Langley on the law
                    of dispersion for rock-salt in the ultra red region of the spectrum are not very
                    favourable to this idea. The phenomena of abnormal dispersion<pb break="no"

                    and absorption, and Helmholtz has formulated a general theory of dispersion
                    based upon the hypothesis that it may be connected with an absorbing influence
                    operative upon invisible portions of the spectrum. Upon this subject, which is
                    as yet little understood, the reader may consult Glazebrook’s “Report on Optical
                        Theories.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The limits of this article do not permit the consideration of the more
                    speculative parts of our subject. We will conclude by calling attention to two
                    recent experimental researches by Michelson, the results of which cannot fail to
                    give valuable guidance to optical theorists. The first of these<note

                    a repetition under improved conditions of a remarkable experiment of Fizeau, by
                    which it is proved that when light is propagated through water, itself in rapid
                    movement in the direction of the ray, the velocity is indeed influenced, but not
                    to the full extent of the velocity of the water <hi rend="italic">(v).</hi>
                    Within the limits of experimental error, the velocity agrees with a formula
                    suggested by Fizeau on the basis of certain views of Fresnel, viz.,</p>
                <p>V = V <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> ±⅛u (2), <hi rend="italic">h</hi></p>
                <p>V <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> being the velocity when the medium is stationary.
                    In the case of water, (μ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>-1)∕μ <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =⋅437. Conformably with (2), a similar experiment
                    upon air, moving at a velocity of 25 metres per second, gave no distinct
                    effect.</p>
                <p>From the result of the experiments upon water we should be tempted to infer that
                    at the surface of the earth, moving through space, the gether still retains what
                    must be coarsely called relative motion. Nevertheless, the second research above
