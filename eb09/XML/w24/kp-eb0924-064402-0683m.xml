                <p><label type="entry">WOOD-CARVING</label>. In most countries, during the early
                    development of the plastic art, sculpture in wood took a very important
                    position, and was much used for statues on a large scale, as well as for small
                    works decorated with surface carving. On the whole, wood is much more suitable
                    for carving in slight relief than for sculpture in the round, and its special
                    structure, with bundles of long fibres, strong in one direticon and weak in <pb

                    suit his design to the exigencies of the material. Large curves should be
                    avoided, on account of their tendency to split across with the grain, and deep
                    under-cutting is objectionable for the same reason. A tough fibrous substance
                    like wood obviously calls for a very different treatment from that which is
                    suitable to a homogeneous substance like stone or marble. This adaptation of the
                    design to the material is very conspicuous in the wood-carving of the finest
                    kinds, such as the Scandinavian doorways of the 9th to the 12th centuries, the
                    Perpendicular roofs and screens of England in the 15th century, and the richly
                    carved panelling of Moslem countries throughout the Middle Ages.</p>
                <p>Some woods, such as pear, lime, and more especially box, are comparatively free
                    from any distinct grain, and may be carved almost like marble, but these woods
                    are only to be had in small pieces, and from their want of fibre are
                    structurally weak, and are therefore only available for decorative purposes on a
                    small scale. It is this absence of grain which makes boxwood the material
                    selected for engraving on wood, a form of wood-carving in which the artist needs
                    to be as little as possible hampered by the structure of his material. In
                    ancient times cedar wood was specially used for decorative carving, and in the
                    East various perfumed woods, such as that of the sandaltree, lιave always been
                    favourites with the carver. In Europe the oak, the chestnut,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In many cases it is almost
                    impossible to distinguish between chestnut and oak, especially in the mediaeval
                    roofs of England.</p></note> the fir, and the walnut have been chiefly used, and
                    for sculpture in the round or high relief the sycamore and the plane-tree, as
                    well as the oak.</p>
                <p>One objection to using wood for life-sized or colossal sculpture is that large
                    blocks are very liable to crack and split from end to end, owing to the fact
                    that the parts near the surface dry and shrink more rapidly than the core. For
                    this reason the mediaeval carvers usually hollowed out their wooden statues from
                    the back, so as to equalize the shrinkage and prevent splitting. In all cases
                    wood for carving should be very well seasoned, and it is especially necessary to
                    get rid of the natural sap, which causes rot if it is not dried out. It is
                    useful to soak newly cut timber in running water, so that the sap may be washed
                    away; it is then comparatively easy to dry out the water which has soaked into
                    the pores of the wood and taken the place of the sap.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Egyptian.—</hi> One of the most remarkable examples of ancient
                    Egyptian art, dating probably from nearly 4000 years <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> is a life-sized portrait statue of a stout elderly man, now in the
                    Boulak museum. This is carved out of a solid block of sycamore wood, except that
                    the right arm is worked separately and attached by a mortice and tenon; the eyes
                    are formed by inlaid bits of shell and crystal, and the whole is a most
                    wonderful piece of life-like realism (see fig. 1). Although dating from so
                    remote a period, this statue bears witness to an amount of technical skill and
                    artistic knowledge which shows that long centuries of experience and artistic
                    development must have preceded its production,—a period of which we have no
                    remains, this statue being one of the earliest works of art which even Egypt has
                    preserved for us. In the same museum are also some very remarkable wooden panels
                    from the tomb of Hosi, about four feet high, carved in low relief with standing
                    figures of men and hieroglyphs. These large slabs of wood formed part of the
                    wall lining of the tomb. The reliefs are executed with the utmost spirit and
                    extreme delicacy of treatment, and are highly decorative in style; they show,
                    moreover, a keen sense of the special treatment suitable to the material in
                    which they are carved. These also date from nearly 4000 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> After the early dynasties in Egypt wood does not seem to have been
                    used for sculpture on a large scale, although it was very commonly employed for
                    mummy cases or coffins, one end carved with a human face and the rest almost
                    plain, except for its elaborate painted ornaments in gold and colours, applied
                    on a thin coat of stucco laid evenly over the wood. A large number of smaller
                    examples of Egyptian wood-carving exist in various museums, such as furniture,
                    boxes, implements for the toilet, and the like, frequently decorated with slight
                    surface reliefs of animals or plants, and graceful patterns formed of the lotus
                    or papyrus flower treated with great decorative skill.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Greek.—</hi> Owing to the perishable nature of the material,
                    almost the only ancient examples of wood-carving which have survived to our time
                    are those from the tombs of Egypt.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Acacia and sycamore wood were chiefly used for the larger

                    a tomb at Panticapaeum (Kertch), and is now in the museum at St
                    Petersburg.</p><p/></note> The many important pieces of wooden sculpture which
                    once existed in Greece and other ancient countries are only known to us by the
                    descriptions of Pausanias and various classical writers. It is probable that the
                    earliest examples of the plastic art among the Hellenic race were the rude
                    wooden images of the gods (£όανα), of which many examples were preserved down to
                    late historic times. The art of sculpture, and especially sculpture in wood, is
                    probably older than that of painting, as it requires less artistic knowledge to
                    rudely fashion a log of wood into a rough body with rounded head, two holes for
                    the eyes and slits for the mouth and nose, than to conceive mentally and set
                    down on a plane surface any attempt even at the rudest outline drawing,—a
                    process which requires a distinct act of abstraction and some notion of treating
                    the subject in a conventionally symbolic way. Real things have of course no
                    enclosing line, and the representation of an object in outline conveys little or
                    no idea to the mind of a man who is yet in a very early stage of culture. The
                    Palladium, or sacred figure of Pallas, which was guarded by the vestal virgins
                    in Rome, and which was fabled to have been brought by Aeneas from the burning
                    Troy, was one of these wooden <hi rend="italic">ξ,oaνa</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Vesta).</hi> A wooden figure of the Armed Aphrodite at Cythera

                    wood, was the statue of Apollo in his temple, dedicated 428 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    presented it to the temple (Pliny, <hi rend="italic">H. H.,</hi> xiii. 5 and
                    xxxvi. 4). Pausanias (ii. 24) mentions another early wooden statue at
                    Argos,—that of Zeus Larissaeus, which was remarkable for having three eyes. A
                    very elaborate example of cedar-wood carving enriched with gold and ivory is
                    described by Pausanias (v. 17 to 19). This was a coffer dedicated at Olympia by
                    the children of Cypselus, tyrant of Corinth in the 7th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It was decorated with bands in relief, with scenes
                    from the lives of various gods and heroes. A cedar box, with two carved dogs
                    attached to it, was found at Mycenae by Dr Schliemann, and is now in the museum
                    at Athens. During the most flourishing period of Greek art wood was sometimes
                    used for important plastic purposes, as, for example, the colossal statue of
                    Athene at Plataea, carved by Phidias. The figure was of gilt or plated wood,
                    with the exception of the nude parts,— the face, hands, and feet,—which were of
                    Pentelic marble.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roman.—</hi> Of the wood-carving of the Roman period almost no
                    important examples now exist; but the carved panels of the main doors of S.
                    Sabina on the Aventine Hill are very interesting specimens of wooden
                    reliefsculpture of early Christian times, dating, as the costumes show, from the
                    5th century. The doors are made up of a large number of small square panels,
                    each minutely carved with a scene from the Old or New Testament; the whole
                    feeling of these reliefs is thoroughly classical, though of course in a very
                    debased form.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mediaeval.—</hi> The most remarkable examples of early
                    mediaeval wood-carving are the doorways of wooden churches of Scandinavia and
                    Denmark, dating from the 9th to the 13th centuries. These are framed with great
                    planks or slabs of pine wood, the whole surface of which is covered with rich
                    and intricate patterns of interlacing scroll-work, mixed with figures of dragons
                    and serpents, designed with extraordinary wealth of invention, and of the
                    highest decorative value. The relief is very low, except where occasionally a
                    monster’s head projects from the general level; and yet the utmost vigour of
                    effect is gained by the grand sweeping curves of the leading lines. These are
                    masterpieces of wood-carving, designed and executed with the most perfect sense
                    of the necessities of the material. Fig. 2 shows part of the architrave of a
                    door from Aal church, Norway, dating from the 12th century. Unhappily almost the
                    last of these interesting wooden churches have been destroyed in recent years,
                    and merely the wrecks of their grand wooden sculpture have been occasionally
                    preserved in some museum; some very valuable casts of these are in the South
                    Kensington Museum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">English.—</hi> For various ecclesiastical purposes a large
                    amount of important sculpture in wood was produced in Britain throughout the
                    Middle Ages. At the time of the Reformation every church had its rood-screen,
                    surmounted by a large crucifix between two standing figures of St Mary and St
                    John. These were of wood, except perhaps in some of the richest cathedral or
                    abbey churches, which occasionally had the rood made of silver. A very large
                    number of churches also had retables over the various altars, with reliefs
                    carved in wood and decorated with gold and colours. Many examples of this class
                    still exist in Germany and Spain, but almost all the English examples perished
                    under the iconoclasm of the Reformation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Only three English examples of the figure of Christ on the
                    rood are now known to exist. One of these was recently found built up in the
                    rood-staircase of a small church in Wales. It is a work of the 14th century,
                    carved roughly, but with much spirit.</p></note></p>
                <p>Another important class of wood-carving was that of large recumbent effigies from
                    tombs, of which a good many examples still exist. One of the earliest is that of
                    Robert, duke of Normandy, in Gloucester cathedral, illustrated in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sculpture,</hi> fig. 5 (vol. xxi. p. 558). It is a work of the
                    12 th century, but was broken to pieces, and is now much restored. Like most
                    wooden sculpture in England, it is carved out of oak. The finest example of
                    English wood sculpture is a life-sized effigy in the south choir aisle of
                    Abergavenny church, that of the young knight George de Cantelupe (d. 1273). The
                    face is a portrait of very high plastic merit, and the whole treatment of the
                    figure, with the graceful drapery of its tunic, and its carefully carved armour,
                    is very remarkable as an example of the very high level of excellence that was
                    reached by the English contemporaries of Niccola Pisano. The usual treatment of
                    these wooden figures was to cover the whole surface with a thin coating of <hi
                    rend="italic">gesso</hi> or fine stucco, in which various details or ornaments
                    were modelled or stamped in relief, and then richly decorated with gold and
                    colour. A similar treatment was adopted for all the wooden sculpture of the
                    mediaeval period throughout Europe.</p>
                <p>The church at Abergavenny, already referred to, also contains part of what once
                    must have been a very large and magnificent example of wooden sculpture. This is
                    a colossal recumbent figure of Jesse, and formed the lower part of what was
                    called a “Jesse tree.” Out of the recumbent figure grew a great tree, on the
                    branches of which were figures of the illustrious descendants of Jesse’s line.
                    Merely the stump of this tree now remains, springing from the side of Jesse, but
                    when complete the whole tree must have reached high up towards the roof, with
                    its network of branches forming a sort of screen behind the high altar—very rich
                    and magnificent in effect, when the whole was perfect with its brilliant
                    coloured decoration, and the stained glass of the large east window seen dimly
                    through the open branches of the tree. The existing figure of Jesse, which is 10
                    feet long, is cut out of a solid block of oak; a figure of an angel at the head
                    is worked out of the same piece of wood.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    reached so high a pitch of splendour. The development of architectural
                    wood-carving was much slower than that of sculpture in stone. During the “Early
                    English” period wood-work was rather heavy in style and coarse in detail; in
                    “Decorated” times wood-work of much beauty and richness was produced, but forms
                    more suitable to stone were still used, and it was not till the later
                    “Perpendicular” period in the 15th century that the wood-carvers of England
                    learnt to perfectly adapt their designs to the nature of their material. Very
                    beautiful roofs, for example, were produced in the 14th century, such as that at

                    arched braces, richly moulded and very graceful in effect but constructionally
                    weak, and very wasteful of the material. Enormous balks of oak were required to
                    enable the large curves of the braces to be cut out of the solid. The builders
                    of the 15th century corrected these defects, and designed their sumptuous
                    screens, stall-canopies, and open roofs with straight lines for the leading
                    framework,— only using curves on a smaller scale, and in places where much
                    strain does not fall upon them. Nothing can exceed the beauty, in its own class,
                    of the 15th and early 16th century wood-work in England; the many fine examples
                    that still exist give us some notion of the wealth of the country in this branch
                    of art at a time when every church was obliged by canon law to have its
                    rood-screen, and almost always also possessed carved oak stalls and many other
                    fittings, such as statues and retables, in the same material.<note

                    Old English the word “picture” was often used for a statue or a relief,—partly
                    no doubt from the fact that all sculpture was decorated with
                    painting.</p></note></p>
                <p>The rich oak work of England was no exception to the universal application of
                    coloured decoration, and nearly every screen, roof, or choir-stall was covered
                    with minute painting in gold and colours. The modern notion that oak should be
                    left unpainted was quite unknown to our mediaeval forefathers; and they, as a
                    rule, preferred even a simple coating of white, red, or other colour to the
                    natural tint of the oak, which would have looked very dull and heavy in tone
                    when surrounded by the polychromatic brilliance of the floor, the walls, and the
                    windows. In most cases, however, the wood-work was not left with its uniform
                    ground of paint; delicate and graceful patterns of diapers or sprigs of foliage
                    were added on to all the main lines of the work, and covered the chief members
                    of all the mouldings, in exactly the same way as was done with the sculpture in
                    stone. Many of the Norfolk screens still have much of their painted ornament in
                    good preservation<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    delicately moulded stucco with which the whole surface of the wood was covered
                    before the colouring and gilding were applied. Modern “restorers” have in most
                    cases scraped off all that remained of this brilliant decoration, and frequently
                    no signs are now visible of this universal system of decoration. The very rich

                    now bare of any colouring, though it was once a very brilliant example of
                    polychromatic decoration.</p>
                <p>Great richness of carving is lavished on the church roofs especially of Norfolk
                    and Suffolk. Carved bosses cover the intersections of the moulded timbers, some
                    with bunches of delicate foliage, others carved into figures of angels with
                    outspread wings. Other statuettes of angels often cover the ends of the
                    hammer-beams, and the whole cornice frequently has running foliage inserted in a
                    hollow of the moulding. All this wood-carving is usually of very high artistic
                    merit, and combines delicacy of detail with strength of decorative effect in a
                    way that has never been surpassed by the mediaeval artists of any country of the
                    Continent. These magnificent roofs, which are peculiar to England, and even to
                    certain districts such as East Anglia, are among the most perfect artistic
                    productions of the Middle Ages.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Norfolk, Suffolk, Devonshire, and other counties are still rich in elaborate
                    chancel screens, carved with delicate foliage, especially in the hollows of the
                    cornice, and light open cresting or “brattishing” along the top. The tracery
                    which fills in the upper part of these screens is of wonderful beauty, and
                    executed with the most minute finish and delicate moulding. The ends of the
                    15th-century stalls were often richly decorated with carving, and are crowned
                    with finials or “poppy-heads” of the most elaborate and spirited design. The
                    underside of the “misericords”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Often wrongly called “misereres.”</p></note> of the monastic
                    stalls were specially selected for-minute enrichment, in spite of their very
                    inconspicuous position. The utmost wealth of fancy and minuteness of workmanship
                    is often lavished upon these, and their reliefs are frequently works of art of a
                    very high order. In some cases the carver took his design from contemporary
                    engravings by some distinguished German or Flemish artist, such as Schongauer or
                    Albert Dürer. One of these in the chapel of Henry VII. at Westminster,
                    representing “The Golden Age,” is a work of wonderful beauty and delicacy of
                    touch. Genre and satirical subjects are often selected: the regulars are made
                    fun of in the churches of the secular clergy, and the vices of the secular
                    priests are satirized on the stalls of the monastic churches. This satire is
                    often carried to the verge of indecency, especially in the scenes frequently
                    selected by clerical carvers to set forth the miseries of the married state.</p>
                <p>In England during the 16th and 17 th centuries little wood-carving of much merit
                    was produced; the oak panelling, furniture, and other fittings of the
                    Elizabethan and Jacobean periods were largely enriched with surface reliefs,
                    coarse in execution, but often decorative in effect, and chiefly remarkable for
                    their showy appearance produced with the minimum of labour,<note anchored="true"

                    exquisite finish of the pre-Reformation work. Towards the end of the 17 th
                    century a very realistic style of wood-carving came into use, in which great
                    technical skill was displayed but little real artistic feeling. Grinling Gibbons
                    (1648-1721) and his pupils produced the most elaborate works of this class, such
                    as wreaths, scrolls, and friezes carved in high relief, or in the round, with
                    fruit and flowers, modelled and carved with wonderful imitative skill, but weak
                    in true decorative effect. These clever groups of foliage and fruit were carved
                    in pear or lime wood, and fastened on to the surface of wall-panels,
                    mantelpieces, and other wooden fittings. The stalls and screens in St Paul’s
                    Cathedral are some of Gibbons’s best works, and a great deal of his realistic
                    carving still exists at Oxford in Trinity College, at Trinity College,
                    Cambridge, at Chatsworth, at Petworth, and in many of the great country houses
                    of that time. Since then wood-carving has not taken an important position among
                    the lesser arts of the country.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Italian.—</hi> During the mediaeval period wood was often used
                    by the greatest sculptors of Italy, especially for crucifixes and statues of
                    saints for ecclesiastical purposes. Fig. 3 shows a magnificent example of the
                    school of Nino Pisano, dating from about the middle of the 14th century. It is a
                    colossal figure of the Angel of the Annunciation, said to have once belonged to
                    Pisa cathedral, and now one of the chief treasures of the South Kensington
                    Museum. It is very remarkable for the delicate beauty of the face, and for the
                    sculpturesque simplicity of the folds of the drapery. The original wings were
                    probably much larger than the present ones, which are restorations.</p>
                <p>Many fine roods or crucifixes of life size still exist in the churches of Italy.
                    One attributed to Donatello is preserved at Florence, in the church of S. Croce;
                    another by Brunelleschi still exists. Nothing like the magnificent oak open
                    roofs and choir screens of England were made in Italy. The latter were usually
                    of marble or of metal, and the roofs were of the plain king-post construction,
                    usually concealed by vaulted or panelled ceilings. Towards the end of the 15 th
                    century, and especially in the first half of the 16th, wood-carving of the most
                    elaborate and magnificent sort was largely used to decorate church stalls,
                    wall-panelling, doors, and the like. A very important school of this branch of
                    art was founded by Raphael, whose designs were used or adapted by a large number
                    of very skilful wood-carvers. The shutters of “Raphael’s Stanze” in the Vatican
                    and the choir stalls of the church of S. Pietro de’ Cassinesi at Perugia are
                    among the most beautiful examples of this class of carving.<note anchored="true"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Spanish.—</hi> Spain during the 15th and 16th centuries was
                    specially remarkable for the production of large and elaborate retables, carved
                    with statues and reliefs, very like those of contemporary Germany. Alonso Cano
                    and other sculptors frequently used wood for large statuary, which was painted
                    in a very realistic way with the most startling life-like effect.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Danish.—</hi> Denmark also possessed a school of able
                    woodcarvers, who imitated the great altarpieces of Germany. A very large and
                    well-carved example still exists in the metropolitan cathedral of Röskilde.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">French.—</hi> In France during the mediaeval period wooden
                    sculpture was produced which was very similar in character to that of England,
                    and was decorated with similar colouring. Many of the French cathedral and abbey
                    choir stalls are works of the utmost magnificence. Those at Amiens are specially
                    remarkable. Fig. 5 shows an example of the delicate tracery work of the 15th
                    century. In the 16th century many wood-carvers in France imitated the rich and
                    delicate work of the Raphaelesque school in Italy, and much wood-work of great
                    refinement was produced, very different from the coarsely effective work of
                    Elizabethan and Jacobean England.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    wooden panelling for rooms, the walls being divided into series of spaces with
                    rococo framing, formed by applied scroll-work, made up of many fantastic and
                    incongruous bits of curved mouldings, which were usually gilt. The general
                    effect was very inartistic, and was unredeemed by any beauty of detail. The
                    intermediate spaces were sometimes filled with tapestry or paintings designed by
                    Watteau, Boucher, or other popular artists.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">German.—</hi> In Germany, during the 15th century, wood was
                    used for the most important sculpturesque purposes, such as large triptychs or
                    retables made up of many reliefs, with sacred subjects, and statues of
                    saints,—the whole framed and canopied with rich Gothic “tabernacle work.” See

                    South Kensington Museum. As in England the whole of the wood was covered with
                    fine <hi rend="italic">gesso</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> and then
                    richly gilt and painted with vivid colours. Nothing could exceed the decorative
                    effect of these great retables, rich with minute sculpture and carved foliage,
                    and shining with gold and brilliant colours, some of which were mixed with a
                    transparent varnish medium, and applied over a ground of gold leaf, so that the
                    metallic lustre shone through the transparent pigments over it. Stall ends and
                    panels were enriched with carving of the highest order of merit; life-sized
                    human figures are often introduced at the ends of the book-rests, and large

                    graceful lines and extreme decorative vigour. Fig. 7 shows a fine example of the
                    treatment of a large panel in the front of the stalls at Ulm cathedral, carved
                    in unusually high relief with bold conventional foliage, full of spirit and
                    vigorous beauty. These splendid stalls were executed in 1468 by Jörg Syrlin.
                    During this period the wood-carving of Germany occupied a foremost position in
                    the world, and in many places, such as Nuremberg and parts of Bavaria, great
                    technical skill has survived down to the present time.</p>
                <p>Switzerland and Tyrol have also been for long celebrated for delicate
                    wood-carving on a small scale. The cleverly executed figures of peasants and of
                    animals, especially the chamois, are widely popular, and their production gives
                    occupation to a large class of able artisans, who, however, rarely rise to the
                    level of original artists, though they attain a fairly high average of
                    excellence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mohammedan.—</hi> Nothing can exceed the skill with which the
                    Moslem wood-carvers of Persia, Syria, Egypt, and Spain designed and executed the
                    richest panelling and other decorations for wall-lining, ceilings, pulpits, and
                    all kinds of fittings and furniture. The mosques and private houses of Cairo,
                    Damascus, and other Oriental cities are full of the most elaborate and minutely
                    delicate wood-work. A favourite style of ornament was to cover the surface with
                    very intricate interlacing patterns, formed by delicately moulded ribs; the
                    various geometrical spaces between the ribs were then filled in with small
                    pieces of wood with carved foliage in slight relief. The use of different woods,
                    such as ebony or box, inlaid so as to emphasize the design, combined with the
                    ingenious richness of the patterns, give this class of wood-work an almost
                    unrivalled splendour of effect. Carved ivory is also often used for the filling
                    in of the flat spaces. Fig. 8 shows a fine example of this sort of work, dating
                    from the 14th century,—part of a wall-lining in the Alhambra; special skill is
                    shown by the way in which the Moslem carver has adapted his design to his
                    material—avoiding curved lines, and utilizing woods which he could only get in
                    small pieces. Another very elaborate class of Oriental woodwork is the rich
                    ceilings and domes ' built up of small pieces of wood into the ingeniously
                    intricate “stalactite” patterns, which were then covered with stucco and
                    decorated with rich painting in gold and colours.</p>
                <p>In the early mediaeval period very elaborate wood-work for screens and other
                    fittings was produced for the Coptic churches of Egypt by native Christian
                    workmen some of these had small panels carved in a hard dark wood, with saints
                    and Bible subjects in low relief, very Byzantine in style. The British Museum
                    possesses some fine examples of this carved work from a church in Old Cairo.
                    These early wood fittings are now rapidly disappearing.<note anchored="true"

                    wood-carving of the most magnificent kind has been constantly produced for many
                    centuries. The ancient Hindu temples were decorated with doors, ceilings, and
                    other fittings, carved in sandal and other <pb break="no"

                    minute elaboration. The doors of the temple at Somnauth, on the north-west coast
                    of India, were especially famed for their magnificence, and were very highly
                    valued as sacred relics. In 1024 they were carried off to Ghuznee by the Moslem
                    conqueror Sultan Mahmoud, and are now lying in the fort at Agra. The gates which
                    still exist are very fine specimens of ancient wood-carving, but they are
                    probably only copies of the original very early doors.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In many parts of India wood-carving of the most beautiful kind is largely used
                    for architectural purposes, especially for the enrichment of the wooden
                    framework of houses, and for forming delicate open lattices for windows. In the
                    main, however, the native carvers of India excel rather in richness of effect
                    and minute delicacy of workmanship than in general gracefulness of line and
                    purity of design. In these respects the wood-work of Moslem carvers in India is
                    very far superior to that of the Hindus.</p>
                <p>In China and Japan the wood-carvers are absolutely unrivalled in technical skill;
                    grotesque and imitative work of the most wonderful perfection is produced, and
                    some of the wood-carvings of these countries are really beautiful as works of
                    art, especially when the carver copies the lotus lily or other aquatic plants.
                    In many cases, however, as in the other arts of Japan and China, extreme
                    ugliness of design is combined with the most perfect execution and exquisite
                    finish, and the carvers have very little notion of the really decorative
                    treatment of surface reliefs. The extensive use of wood or bamboo for
                    architectural purposes creates a wide field for the wood-carver, whose very
                    limited sense of true beauty is to some extent made up for by his wealth of
                    grotesque fancy and extreme deftness of hand, which are the main characteristics
                    of the workmen of China and Japan in all branches of art.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wood-Carving of Savage Races.—</hi> Many savage races, such as
                    the Maoris and Polynesians, are very skilful in the decorative treatment of wood
                    in slight relief. Intricate geometrical designs of much beauty and suitability
                    to the material are used to decorate canoes, paddles, and the beams of huts.
                    Great richness of effect is often produced by the smallest possible amount of
                    cutting into the surface of the wood. The wooden architecture of the Maoris is
                    sometimes decorated in the most lavish way. The main uprights of the walls are
                    carved into grotesque semi-human monsters, enriched with painting and inlay of
                    iridescent shell, which show much imaginative power. Other beams are carved with
                    series of spirals, bearing much resemblance to the very early sculptured
                    ornaments of Mycenae, Tiryns, and other Hellenic cities,—one of the many
                    examples which show that very similar stages of artistic development are passed
                    through by men of the most different races and age. In many cases the freshness
                    of invention and freedom of hand shown in the carved ornament of savage races
                    give a more really artistic value to their work than is usually found in the
                    modern laboured and mechanical carving of highly civilized people.</p>
                <p>In modern Europe decorative wood-carving shares the general low level of the
                    lesser arts. The commercial spirit of the age, and the general desire to produce
                    the utmost display with the smallest cost and labour, have reduced the art of
                    wood-carving to a very low state.</p>
