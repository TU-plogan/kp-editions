                    (1750-1817), the father of German geology, was born in Oberlausitz, Saxony, 25th
                    September 1750. The family to which he belonged had been engaged for several
                    hundred years in mining pursuits. His father was inspector of Count Solm’s
                    iron-works at Mehrau and Lorzendorf, and from young Werner’s infancy cultivated
                    in him a taste for minerals and rocks. The boy showed early promise of
                    distinction. In his fourth year he had learnt to read; in his fifth he could
                    write and cipher; and by the time he was six or seven years old he had grown to
                    be a great reader. Already, when only three years of age, he had begun to
                    collect specimens of stones, and, when he could read, one of his favourite
                    employments was to pore over the pages of a dictionary of mining. At the age of
                    nine he was sent to school at Bunzlau in Silesia, where he remained until 1764,
                    when he joined his father, with the idea of ultimately succeeding him in the
                    post which the latter held there. In his eighteenth year ill-health compelled
                    him to seek the mineral waters of Carlsbad. In journeying thither by way of
                    Freiberg he showed such enthusiasm and knowledge in an excursion in that
                    neighbourhood as to attract the notice of the officials there, who invited him
                    to attend their mining school which had been established two years previously.
                    This was the turning point in Werner’s career. He came to Freiberg in 1769 when
                    he was nineteen years of age, and found the school in its merest infancy. He
                    soon distinguished himself by his industry and by the large amount of practical
                    knowledge of mineralogy which he acquired. In 1771 he repaired to the university
                    of Leipsic and went through the usual curriculum of study, but continued to
                    devote himself with the greatest ardour to mineralogical pursuits. While still a
                    student he wrote his first work on the external characters of minerals <hi

                    1764), which at once gave him a name among the mineralogists of the day. His
                    friends in Freiberg, who had watched his progress with much gratification,
                    called him at the close of his college life to be inspector in the mining school
                    and teacher of mineralogy there. To the development of that school and to the
                    cultivation of mineralogy and geognosy he thenceforth devoted the whole of his
                    active and indefatigable industry. From a mere provincial institution the
                    Freiberg academy under his care rose to be one of the great centres of
                    scientific light in Europe, to which students from all parts of the world
                    flocked to listen to his eloquent teaching. He wrote but little, and though he
                    elaborated a complete system of geognosy and mineralogy he never could be
                    induced to publish it. From the notes of his pupils, however, the general
                    purport of his teaching was well known, and it widely influenced the science of
                    his time. He had the art of infusing into those who listened to him some of his
                    own ardent enthusiasm. His disciples accordingly left his rooms with the
                    determination to preach his doctrine everywhere. They became ardent partisans,
                    and carried on an active propaganda in most countries of Europe. He died at
                    Freiberg on June 30, 1817.</p>
                <p>One of the distinguishing features of Werner’s teaching was the care with which
                    he taught the succession of geological formations. He showed that the rocks of
                    the earth are not disposed at random, but follow each other in a certain
                    definite order. Unfortunately he had never enlarged his experience by travel,
                    and the sequence of rock-masses which he had recognized in Saxony was believed
                    by him to be of universal application all over the globe. He taught that the
                    rocks were the precipitates of a primeval oceau, and followed each other in
                    successive deposits of world-wide extent. Volcanoes were regarded by him as
                    abnormal phenomena, probably due to the combustion of subterranean beds of coal.
                    Basalt and similar rocks, which even then were recognized by other observers as
                    of igneous origin, were believed by him to bc water-formed accumulations of the
                    same ancient ocean. Hence arose one of the great historical controversies of
                    geology. Werner’s followers preached the doctrine of the aqueous origin of
                    rocks, and were known as Neptunists; their opponents, who recognized the
                    important part taken in the construction of the earth’s crust by subterranean
                    heat, were styled Vulcanists. Though much of Werner’s theoretical work was
                    erroneous, science is indebted to him for so clearly demonstrating the
                    chronological succession of rocks, for the enthusiastic zeal which he infused
                    into his pupils, and for the impulse which he thereby gave to the study of
                    geology.</p>
