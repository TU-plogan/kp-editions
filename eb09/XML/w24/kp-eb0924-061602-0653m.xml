                <p><label type="entry">WISCONSIN</label>, one of the North-Eastern Central States of
                    the American Union, has the parallel of 42° 30' N. lat. for its southern limit,
                    Lake Michigan for its border on the E., Lake Superior on the N., and the
                    Mississippi on theW. Michigan on the E., Minnesota and Iowa on the W., and
                    Illinois on the S. are its neighbour States. Its area, exclusive of water
                    surface, is estimated at 54,450 square miles. Its length from north to south is
                    300 miles, its breadth 250 miles; its lake shore-line exceeds 500 miles. Its
                    surface contours are gentle and pleasing. The lower parts of the State lie about
                    600 feet above the sea, the highest summits about 1800 feet. Few peaks rise more
                    than 400 feet above their bases, and abrupt elevations of more than 200 or 300
                    feet are not common except along the Mississippi. The State is merely a swell of
                    land between three notable depressions,—the basins of Lake Michigan, Lake
                    Superior, and the Mississippi. The summit of the.swell lies within 30 miles of
                    Lake Superior, whence there is a rapid descent northward, with gentler declines
                    to the south-east and south-west, separated by a low swell extending from the
                    summit southward into Illinois. This is traversed in the south-central portion
                    of the State by a remarkable diagonal valley, occupied by Green Bay and the Fox
                    and Wisconsin rivers, cutting it down to within about 200 feet of the lake
                    levels. The easterly slope is traversed longitudinally by a ridge of Niagara
                    limestone, running nearly parallel to the shore of Lake Michigan, at an average
                    distance of about 30 miles.</p>
                <p>The greatest topographical interest—and it is very considerable—lies in the minor
                    surface features. The ice of the Glacial period invaded in force the eastern and
                    northern parts of the State, while an area of 10,000 square miles in the
                    south-western portion was left untouched. Flowing but very irregular contours,
                    accented by morainic peaks and ridges, by gravel knolls, and by domes of drift,
                    mark the former area; while deep dendritic valleys, erosion cliffs, and
                    castellated outliers give more str <hi rend="underline">iki</hi> ng relief to
                    the latter. About 2000 minor lakes dot the eastern and northern portions, all
                    lying within the glaciated area, and caused by the irregular heaping of the
                    drift, or by the erosion of the glaciers. Numerous waterfalls occur in this
                    portion, likewise due to the disturbance of the rivercourses by the ice
                    incursion. None occur in the unglaciated area.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The geological structure of the State is
                    unusually symmetrical (see general geological map in Plate XV. ). It has for its
                    nucleus a great mass of the most ancient crystalline rocks (Archaean). This
                    nucleus occupies the north-central portion of the State, and about it are
                    wrapped successive layers of later-formed rocks, lying concentrically upon each
                    other, and occupying all the rest of the State. The ancient nucleus consists of
                    granites, gneisses, syenites, and various highly crystalline schists. These are
                    warped, contorted, and twisted among themselves in the most intricate fashion,
                    and, since their original upheaval, have been extensively cut away, exhibiting
                    what was formerly the interior of a much distorted mass. Whether this was
                    originally sedimentary or igneous is undetermined, so great are the vicissitudes
                    it has suffered since its original formation. It is extensively traversed by
                    dykes and veins. As yet it has not proved to be productive in minerals of
                    notable commercial value, but affords a wealth of the finest of building
                    material. This formation is confidently referred to the Laurentian age, and
                    ranks among the earliest known formations. Around the borders of this nucleus,
                    though not skirting it continuously at the surface, are tracts of Huronian
                    rocks. For the greater part these lie in highly inclined beds, and exhibit
                    evidence of much disturbance since their original formation. Where they come in
                    contact with the Laurentian nucleus, they show, by their unconformity to it, and
                    the erosion of the strata at the contact, that a vast but unknown interval of
                    time separated the two formations. The Huronian rocks are chiefly quartzites,
                    with which are associated quartz-porphyries and various slates and schists,
                    together with layers of igneous rock, either formed at the same time with other
                    members of the series, or subsequently intruded. They embrace also, especially
                    in the northeastern and northern portions of the State, and extending into the
                    upper peninsula of Michigan, valuable beds of iron-ore, as well as beds of
                    carbonaceous material. The amount of carbon contained is large, but
                    unfortunately impure and in the graphitic condition. Limestone also occurs,
                    among the most ancient of its kind. The quartzites of Barron county embrace
                    deposits of pipestone, which also occurs in the Baraboo quartzite, but less
                    notably. Several isolated knobs of quartz-porphyry in central Wisconsin are
                    referred to this formation, and are being extensively utilized for building
                    material, paving, and macadamizing. Apart from the igneous beds, the members of
                    this series were originally sediments, and even now show clearly their
                    fragmental origin. The thickness of the Huronian beds reaches at least 13,000
                    feet. Overlying the Huronian rocks in the north-western part of the State is an
                    immense series of igneous beds, sandwiched between which, and also overlying
                    which, are layers of sandstone, shale, and conglomerate, the whole constituting
                    the great copper-bearing (Keweenaw) formation of Lake Superior. This crosses the
                    entire north-western corner of the State. The strata are bowed downwards,
                    forming a great trough, the axis of which stretches from near the mouth of the
                    Montreal river to the St Croix. The igneous beds were formed by great
                    outwellings of molten matter, which spread widely over the surface, following
                    each other at longer or shorter intervals, as shown by the presence or absence
                    of intervening deposits or by erosion. The copper of the formation appears to
                    have been brought up by these igneous ejections, and to have been subsequently
                    concentrated by percolating water in the vesicular portions of the old lavas, or
                    in the intervening sandstones or conglomerates, or in fissures traversing the
                    beds,—all these forms being present. The formation in Wisconsin has not yet
                    proved sufficiently rich to pay the expense of mining. The thickness of this
                    formation is truly stupendous, estimates ranging from 25,000 to 45,000 feet.</p>
                <p>The preceding formations are found tilted at various angles; those which follow
                    lie nearly flat. The Potsdam sandstone, next in order, rests upon all of these
                    at points, coming in contact with different ones in different places. The wear
                    which they had suffered before it was placed upon them indicates a long interval
                    of time. The thickness of the Potsdam is very irregular, owing to the uneven<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0656-0617"/> worn surface of these underlying formations. In
                    places it is upwards of 1000 feet deep. Being an open-textured water-bearing
                    formation, dipping south-eastward and south-westward from the central axis of
                    the State, and embracing and being overlaid by impervious beds, it furnishes
                    many fine-flowing wells to the districts bordering Lake Michigan and the
                    Mississippi. Some of its beds supply excellent building material, though in
                    general it is not sufficiently firm. The Potsdam sandstone forms a broad
                    irregular crescentic belt, sweeping around the southern border of the Archaean
                    nucleus. It also skirts the northern side in the Lake Superior basin. Overlying
                    the Potsdam sandstone is a stratum of impure Magnesian Limestone, ranging from
                    50 to 250 feet in thickness. It forms the surface rock in an irregular ragged
                    belt, stretching from the St Croix southward along the Mississippi, and
                    south-easterly to the south-central part of the State, and thence north-easterly
                    to the upper peninsula of Michigan. Small quantities of the ores of lead, iron,
                    and copper are found in it, and certain portions furnish an excellent building
                    stone. Overlying this, the Lower Magnesian Limestone, is an irregular stratum of
                    nearly pure sandstone (St Peter’s), ranging from a few feet to upwards of 200
                    feet in thickness. It is composed of nearly pure grains of quartz, and from the
                    absence of cementing material generally crumbles with ease, though in
                    exceptional places it is sufficiently hard to be used as a building-stone. Being
                    porous and gently dipping between impervious beds, it supplies some of the
                    finest artesian fountains in the State. Its purer portions afford sand.</p>
                <p>Upon the St Peter’s sandstone rests a series of limestone beds, the lower part of
                    which is known as Trenton, the upper as Galena. Their united thickness varies
                    considerably, averaging about 250 feet. In the south-western part of the State
                    they have yielded large quantities of lead and zinc ores, and some copper. The
                    formation occupies a small area in the north-λvest of the State, a large area in
                    the south-west, and a belt stretching from south to north through the valleys of
                    Rock river and Green Bay.</p>
                <p>Overlying the above limestones is a stratum of about 200 feet in thickness,
                    composed of clay, earthy, and calcareous shales (Hudson River). This is a soft
                    formation and easily eroded, and hence occupies little area at the surface. It
                    forms a narrow north-and-south belt on the eastern margin of the Green Bay and
                    Rock river valley. It has little economic value. At a few points on the surface
                    of these shales there are accumulations of a peculiar Oolitic iron ore
                    (Clinton), popularly known as “seed” or “shot ore,” from its concretionary
                    structure. Its highest development is at Iron Ridge in Dodge county, where its
                    thickness ranges from 15 to 25 feet. It is a soft ore, lying in regular
                    horizontal beds, is quarried with great ease, and yields about 45 per cent, of
                    metallic iron.</p>
                <p>The next formation is a thick limestone stratum (Niagara), ranging from 400 to
                    800 feet. The different portions vary greatly in texture and purity, some being
                    very fine-grained, others of admirable granular texture, and others uneven,
                    cavernous, or full of chert nodules. It furnishes excellent building rock, and
                    quicklime of high quality. The formation occupies a broad tract adjacent to Lake
                    Michigan, reaching from the southern line of the State to the head of the Green
                    Bay peninsula. It also caps the elevated mounds in the south-west of the State.
                    The Lower Helderberg limestone, which attains great thickness farther east, is
                    barely (indeed, somewhat doubtfully) represented in the State by some thin shaly
                    beds of limestone found north of Milwaukee. The remainder of the normal Silurian
                    beds and the Lower Devonian formations are not represented in the State, but
                    just north of Milwaukee is a small area of limestone which represents the
                    Hamilton period (Middle Devonian), a portion of which possesses hydraulic
                    properties of a high degree or excellence, and is the basis of an important
                    industry.</p>
                <p>From the middle of the Devonian age until the ice incursion of the Glacial
                    period, Wisconsin appears to have been a land surface, subjected to erosion,
                    which developed the hills and valleys that diversify its surface, except as they
                    were modified by the invading ice. As previously indicated, the ice of the
                    Glacial period overrode the northern and eastern portions of the State, while it
                    left about one-fifth of the State in the south-west untouched. The paths of the
                    invading ice were determined by the great valleys of Lake Superior, Lake
                    Michigan, and Green Bay, aided by the diverting influence of the intervening
                    heights. There appear to have been two important invasions,—the earlier covering
                    the larger area, while the later exhibited the more forceful action. There were
                    also minor episodes of glacial advance and retreat. Both spread out an irregular
                    sheet of mixed rock debris, partly derived from the old decomposed surface, and
                    partly produced by the grinding action of the glaciers themselves. The
                    underlying rock was smoothed, scratched, and polished, and in some moderate
                    measure filed down by the overriding ice. A remarkable chain of hills formed
                    about the edge of the ice (the Kettle moraine) constitutes an interesting
                    feature topographically and geologically. It forms a part of an extensive series
                    of terminal moraines that stretch from the Atlantic to the Saskatchewan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soils.—</hi> The soils of the State are varied. Those of the
                    drift-</p>
                <p>came from the German empire, 66,284 from the Scandinavian countries, and 78,057
                    from Great Britain and Ireland.</p>
                <p>bearing region are derived from the heterogeneous mixture of preglacial soils and
                    glacial grindings, and constitute for the greater part loamy clays and sandy
                    loams of a high degree of fertility and permanence. In the south-west a
                    considerable portion of the soils are derived from the decomposition of the
                    underlying limestone, and are highly fertile and easily tilled. In the central
                    portion there is a considerable area underlaid by the Potsdam sandstone, from
                    which sandy soils, of relatively low fertility, have been derived.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetation.—</hi> The greater part of the State was originally
                    covered by forest, but in the south and west considerable areas of prairies were
                    found interspersed with woodlands. The prevalent trees of this region are the
                    oaks, poplars, hickories, and their usual associates. Along the eastern border
                    of the State, except at the very south, is an extensive tract of heavy timber,
                    in which maple, elm, ash, and their usual associates predominate. Towards the
                    north the pines, hemlocks, and spruces come in. The north part of the State was
                    originally covered by an almost unbroken forest, composed of groves of pine, of
                    hard wood, and of a promiscuous mixture of species embracing both conifers and
                    deciduous trees. This constitutes the great lumber region of Wisconsin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> Lying between 42⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>
                    and 47° N. lat., and near the centre of the continent, Wisconsin has a typical
                    temperate continental climate. Its summers are warm, and diversified by short
                    rains and clear skies; its winters are somewhat severe but relatively dry and
                    stimulating, and are less chilly than more humid atmospheres at similar or even
                    higher temperatures. The average rainfall is about 30 inches. The mean summer
                    temperature varies from about 70° in the south to about 60° in the north; the
                    mean winter temperature varies from about 25° in the south to about 15° in the
                    extreme north. The great lakes produce a marked effect on the seasonal
                    temperature of the State, elevating it in winter and depressing it in summer, so
                    that the summer isotherms run from the north-west to south-east, forced south by
                    the cooling influence of the lakes; while those of the winter run from
                    south-west to north-east, forced north by their warming influence. As a result,
                    productions requiring a high summer temperature flourish in the south-western
                    and central portions of the State, but are precarious in the vicinity of the
                    lakes, while fruits and crops requiring milder winters and more equable
                    temperatures can be produced near the lakes, but are uncertain away from them.

                    acres were improved land. Of these farms 122,163 were cultivated by the owners
                    and 12,159 were rented. The State census of 1885 estimates the total number of
                    persons engaged in agriculture at 332,500, and the value of farms and
                    agricultural products at §568,187,288. The produce is estimated approximately as
                    follows :—wheat, 21,000,000 bushels; Indian corn, 37,700,000; oats, 43,000,000;

                <p><hi rend="italic">Lumbering.—</hi> The proximity of Wisconsin to the prairie
                    States renders its lumbering interests especially important. In 1886 the total
                    forest area of the State was 17,000,000 acres, or 48 ’ 8 per cent, of the whole
                    area. According to the census of 1880, Wisconsin was exceeded only by Michigan
                    and Pennsylvania in the value of its lumber product. Operations are chiefly
                    carried on along the Menomonee, Peshtigo, Oconto, Wolf, Wisconsin, Yellow,
                    Black, Chippewa, Red Cedar, and St Croix rivers; but the rapid increase in
                    railroads has opened the northern forests very generally. The lumber, shingles,
                    and lath manufactured amounted to about 3,323,390,000 feet in 1885.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mines and Quarries.—</hi> In 1880 Wisconsin ranked sixth among
                    the iron-producing States, but since then its importance has increased. The most
                    extensive iron deposits occur in the Huronian formation in the Menominee region,
                    and along the Montreal river. In 1882 the total product of the Menominee region
                    was 276,017 tons; the Montreal range, divided between Wisconsin and Michigan,
                    about a dozen miles south of Lake Superior, has just been opened up, and there
                    is a rich deposit of Bessemer ore. In 1886 the product of the whole range was
                    about 800,000 tons. The lead and zinc region lies in the south-west of the
                    State; production had been declining, but recently new discoveries have revived
                    it. There is a rich supply of building-stone; limestone quarries are most
                    numerous, but the red-brown sandstone of Bayfield county and the granite of
                    Marquette county are especially valued.</p>

                    Omaha; the Milwaukee, Lake Shore, and Western; and the Wisconsin Central. A
                    canal connects the Fox and Wisconsin rivers at Portage, and the Sturgeon Bay

                    senators and nine representatives. The supreme court is composed of a chief
                    justice and four associate justices; there are fourteen judicial circuits, each
                    with a judge; and besides these are county and municipal judges and justices of
                    the peace. The State legislature, composed of the senate (33 members) and the
                    assembly (100 members), meets bienially.</p>

                    for the year 1886, as determined by the State board of assessment, was as
                    follows:—personal property, $114,922,900; city and village lots, $110,564,625;
                    lands, $271,019,627; total assessed value of all property, $496,507,152. Taxes
                    were as follows:—State tax, $241,137; county taxes, $2,590,375; town, city, and
                    village taxes, $7,835,385. The total indebtedness of the towns, cities,
                    villages, and school districts in 1885 was $6,848,123; total indebtedness of
                    counties, $1,569,444; bonded debt of the State, $2,252,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Charitable, Reformatory, and Penal Institutions.—</hi> The
                    State supports two hospitals for the insane, containing together 1141 inmates in
                    1885, while there are 1240 insane in county asylums, jails, and poorhouses. The
                    school for the deaf has an attendance of 205, school for the blind, 62;
                    industrial school for boys, 292; industrial school for girls, 268; State prison
                    school, 443; a school for dependent children has just been established. The
                    whole number of prisoners in all places of confinement during 1885 was 19,829,
                    and in reformatories 771. The State board of control and the board of charities
                    and reforms have charge of these institutions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fclucatioιι.—</hi> The State makes liberal provision for its
                    public schools; it sets apart as a permanent fund the Federal grant of section
                    16 in each township, with 500,000 acres of land, and 5 per cent, of the proceeds
                    of the sale of public lands in the State, together with less important items. In
                    1886 there were still 103,130 acres unsold, and the amount of the fund at
                    interest was nearly $3,000,000. This school-fund income, which in 1887 was
                    $341,289, is supplemented by a State tax of one mill on the dollar, which
                    amounted to $896,138; the combined amount is annually apportioned among the
                    counties, towns, villages, and cities in proportion to the number of children in
                    each of from four to twenty years of age; in their turn the counties must levy
                    upon each town, city, and village a tax equal to their proportion of the
                    combined school fund and State mill tax. The total receipts from all sources for
                    school purposes in 1886 was $4,192,962, and the disbursements $3,184,958. In the
                    same year there were 556,093 persons of school age. Of these 59 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4 per cent, were enrolled in the public schools. The
                    enrolments in normal schools and university (2481), in colleges, seminaries, and
                    academies (1131), and in private schools (14,164) made the total enrolment over
                    350,000. In 1879 attendance at a public or private school for at least twelve
                    weeks each year was made compulsory on all children between the .ages of seven
                    and fifteen years. Women are eligible to all school offices, except that of
                    State superintendent of public instruction. In 1888 there are 137 free high
                    schools, receiving special aid from the State. Provision is made for the
                    education of teachers by the five normal schools. The leading denominational
                    colleges are Beloit, Ripon, Milton, Racine, and Lawrence university. The public
                    school system is crowned by the State university at Madison, organized in 1848.
                    It derives its support chiefly from an annual State tax of one-eighth of a mill
                    on the dollar. The total regular income of the university in 1886 was $105,000;
                    the attendance in 1887 was 600. Connected with the university are a teachers’
                    institute lectureship and farmers’ institutes held in different portions of the
                    State, as well as over sixty accredited high schools.</p>

                    Wisconsin was the meeting ground of the Algonkin and Dakota Indian tribes. Its
                    water system connecting the Great Lakes and the Mississippi made it the keystone
                    of the French possessions in Canada and Louisiana. The genesis of Wisconsin was
                    from the fur trade. French explorers, ascending the Ottawa, crossed to Lake
                    Huron, whence they easily passed through the Straits of Mackinaw to Green Bay,
                    thence up the Fox to the portage between it and the Wisconsin, aud on to the
                    Mississippi. In 1634 an agent of Champlain, Jean Nicolet, first of recorded
                    white men to reach Wisconsin soil, ascended the Fox a considerable distance. In
                    1658-59 Radisson and Groseilliers, two fur traders who afterwards induced
                    England to enter the Hudson Bay region, passing along the south shore of Lake
                    Superior, struck southward to the tributaries of the Mississippi. Radisson’s
                    journal describes a great river visited by him, which was probably the
                    Mississippi. In 1665 Father Claude Allouez founded a Jesuit mission at La
                    Pointe, and in 1669 the mission of St Francis Xavier on the shores of Green Bay.
                    Louis Joliet, leaving Quebec under orders to discover the South Sea, in 1673,
                    took with him Father Marquette from Mackinaw, and reached the Mississippi by the
                    diagonal waterway of the Fox and Wisconsin rivers. In 1679 La Salle, accompanied
                    by Father Hennepin, passed along the western shore of Lake Michigan to· the
                    Illinois, and in the next year Hennepin, ascending the Mississippi, met Du Luth,
                    who had reached it by way of the western extremity of Lake Superior. Thus were
                    traced out the bounds and principal river-courses of Wisconsin. The epoch of the
                    fur trade followed, during which stockade posts were erected at various
                    key-points on the trading routes; they became dependencies of Mackinaw, long the
                    emporium of the fur trade. In the French and Indian war of 1755-60 Wisconsin
                    savages served under Charles de Langlade against the English at Braddock’s
                    defeat and elsewhere. Near the middle of the 18th century De Langlade and his
                    father had established a trading post at Green Bay, which afterwards became a
                    fixed settlement; at the close of the revolutionary war Prairie du Chien, at the
                    mouth of the Wisconsin, grew into a like settlement; and towards the close of
                    the century Milwaukee, La Pointe, and Portage became permanent trading posts.
                    The British garrison that was sent in 1761 to hold Green Bay left at the
                    outbreak of Pontiac’s war, and did not return. In the revolutionary war
                    Wisconsin Indians under De Langlade supported the British. England having
                    retained Mackinaw despite the treaty of 1783, American domination was not
                    practically felt by the Wisconsin traders until after the war of 1812. In this
                    war they favoured Great Britain, and in 1814 the latter wrested Prairie du Chien
                    from an American detachment. But the formation of Astor’s American Fur Company
                    to deal in this region was followed by a United States law excluding English
                    traders, which resulted in an increase of American influence. At the close of
                    the war the United States placed forts at Green Bay and Prairie du Chien. By the
                    ordinance of 1787 Wisconsin had been a part of the territory north-west of the
                    river Ohio; in 1800 it was included in Indiana Territory, whence in 1809 it
                    passed to Illinois Territory, and in 1818 to Michigan Territory. In 1825 the
                    lead-mines in south-western Wisconsin, which had been known from the earliest
                    days of French exploration, and had been worked by the Sacs and Foxes and by
                    Winnebagoes, attracted a considerable mining population. Hostilities with the
                    Winnebagoes followed, resulting in the cession by the latter of the lead region,
                    and the erection of Fort Winnebago in 1828 at Portage. In 1832 occurred Black
                    Hawk’s War, occasioned <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0658-0619"/> by the refusal of a Sac band to remove beyond the
                    Mississippi from Illinois, in accordance with treaty stipulations. Pursued by
                    regulars and Illinois militia to the head-waters of Rock river, the band fled
                    across south-western Wisconsin to the Mississippi, where they were nearly
                    exterminated. This expedition disclosed the rich farming lands of the region. In
                    1836 Wisconsin Territory was formed. Before this the fur trade and lead-mining
                    had been the chief factors in development, but a wave of land speculation and
                    immigration reached here at this period. In 1840 there was a population of
                    30,945, more than double that of four years before. On August 9, 1846, Congress
                    authorized Wisconsin to form a State government. The constitution framed in 1846
                    being rejected by the people, a second one was ratified in 1848, and Wisconsin
                    became a State on May 29 of that year.</p>
                <p>At an early period the State adopted the policy of attracting immigration by
                    cheap lands, a work in which the railroads have greatly aided, with the result
                    that Wisconsin has the remarkable proportion of persons of foreign parentage
                    indicated above. There are whole communities of the same foreign
                    nationality,—such as the German groups along the shore of Lake Michigan, the
                    Scandinavian in various localities, the Swiss colony of New Glarus, the Belgians
                    in Door county, and many others. The recent development of lumbering has rapidly
                    built up northern Wisconsin, a process now being accelerated' by the mining
                    interests on the Montreal range. Wisconsin furnished to the Union armies in the
                    civil war over 91,000 men, the famous Iron Brigade being chiefly from that
                    State. (F. J. T.)</p>
