                    on the 7th of April 1770. His parentage offers a curious parallel to Scott’s: he
                    was the son of an attorney, law-agent to the earl of Lonsdale, a prosperous man
                    in his profession, descended from an old Yorkshire family of landed gentry. On
                    the mother’s side also Wordsworth was connected with the middle territorial
                    class: his mother, Anne Cookson, was the daughter of a well-to-do mercer in
                    Penrith, but her mother was a Crackanthorpe, whose ancestors had been lords of
                    the manor of New-biggin, near Penrith, from the time of Edward III. He was thus,
                    as Scott put it in his own case, come of “gentle” kin, and like Scott he was
                    proud of it, and dictated the fact in his short fragment of prose autobiography.
                    The country squires and farmers whose blood flowed in Wordsworth’s veins were
                    not far enough above local life to be out of sympathy with it, and the poet’s
                    interest in the common scenes and common folk of the Nortlι country hills and
                    dales had a traceable hereditary bias.</p>
                <p>Though his parents were of sturdy stock, both died prematurely, his mother when
                    he was five years old, his father when he was thirteen, the ultimate cause of
                    death in his mother's case being exposure to cold in “a best bedroom” in London,
                    in his father’s exposure on a Cumberland hill, where he had been befogged and
                    lost his way. At the age of eight Wordsworth was sent to school at Hawkshead, in
                    the Esthwaite valley in Lancashire. His father died while he was there, and at
                    the age of seventeen he was sent by his uncle to St John’s College, Cambridge.
                    He did not distinguish himself in the studies of the university, and for some
                    time after taking his degree of B.A., which he did in January 1791, he showed
                    what seemed to his relatives a most perverse reluctance to adopt any regular
                    profession. His mother had noted his “stiff, moody, and violent temper” in
                    childhood, and it seemed as if this family judgment was to be confirmed in his
                    manhood. After taking his degree, he was pressed to take holy orders, but would
                    not; he had no taste for the law; he idled a few months aimlessly in London, a
                    few months more with a Welsh college friend, with whom he had made a pedestrian
                    tour in France and Switzerland during his last Cambridge vacation; then in the
                    Novémber of 1791 he crossed to France, ostensibly to learn the language, made
                    the acquaintance of revolutionaries, sympathized with them vehemently, and was
                    within an ace of throwing in his lot with the Brissotins to give them the steady
                    direction that they needed. When it came to this, his relatives cut off his
                    supplies, and he was obliged to return to London towards the close of 1792. But
                    still he resisted all pressure to enter any of the regular professions,
                    published <hi rend="italic">An Evening Walk</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Descriptive Sketches</hi> in 1793, and in 1794, still moving about to all
                    appearance in stubborn aimlessness among his friends and relatives, had no more
                    rational purpose of livelihood than drawing up the prospectus of a periodical of
                    strictly republican principles to be called “The Philanthropist.” At this stage,
                    at the age of twenty-four, Wordsworth seemed to his friends a very hopeless and
                    impracticable young man.</p>
                <p>But all the time from his boyhood upwards a great purpose had been growing and
                    maturing in his mind. <hi rend="italic">Tlιe Prelude</hi> expounds in lofty
                    impassioned strain, treating of simple facts in diction that would be “poetic”
                    beyond the worst extravagances of the panegyrical school but for the genuine
                    emotion that inspires its amplitude of phrase, how his sensibility for nature
                    was “augmented and sustained,” and how it never, except for a brief interval,
                    ceased to be “creative” in the special sense of his subsequent theory. But it is
                    with his feelings towards nature that <hi rend="italic">The Prelude</hi> mainly
                    deals; it says little regarding the history of his ambition to express those
                    feelings in verse. It is the autobiography, not of the poet of nature, but of
                    the worshipper and priest. The salient incidents in the history of the poet he
                    communicated in prose notes and in familiar discourses. And it appears that,
                    while he was still a schoolboy of fourteen, the delight that he took in
                    contemplating and moralizing from nature was mingled with the enthusiasm of a
                    poet’s ambition and joy in the discovery of a fresh imperfectly worked field.
                    Commenting on the couplet in the <hi rend="italic">Evening Walk—</hi></p>
                <p>“And, fronting the bright west, yon oak entwines Its darkening boughs and leaves
                    in stronger lines—” he said:</p>
                <p>“This is feebly and imperfectly exprest; but I recollect distinctly the very spot
                    where this first struck me. It was on the way between Hawkshead and Ambleside,
                    and gave me extreme pleasure. The moment was important in my poetical history;
                    fori date from it my consciousness of the infinite variety of natural
                    appearances which had been unnoticed by the poets of any age or country, so far
                    as I was acquainted with them; <hi rend="italic">and, 1 made a resolution to
                    supply in some degree the deficiency.</hi> I could not at that time have been
                    above fourteen years of age.”</p>
                <p>About the same time he wrote, as a school task at Hawkshead, verses that show
                    considerable acquaintance with the poets of his own country at least, as well as
                    some previous practice in the art of verse-making.<note anchored="true"

                    Wordsworth,</hi> by Canon Wordsworth, vol. i. pp. 10, 11. According to his own
                    statement in the memoranda dictated to his biographer, it was the success of
                    this exercise that “put it into his head to compose verses from the impulse of
                    his own mind.” The resolution to supply the deficiencies of poetry in the exact
                    description of natural appearances was probably formed while he was in this
                    state of boyish ecstasy at the accidental revelation of his own powers. The date
                    of his beginnings as a poet is confirmed by the lines in <hi rend="italic">The

                    written while he was still at school. And, undistinguished as he was at
                    Cambridge in the contest for academic honours, the <hi rend="italic">Evening
                    Walk,</hi> his first publication, was written during his vacations.<note

                    little progress.” To the same time belongs an incident recorded later in the
                    same book, when he was returning in early morning from a dance—</p><p>“My heart
                    was full; I made no vows, but vows</p><p>Were then made for me; bond unknown to

                    do something, although he had not distinguished himself in university work. It
                    is significant of his persistency of purpose that in this poem, as well as in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Descriptive Sketches</hi> founded on his tour abroad
                    during his last vacation, he is seen to be steadily fulfilling his resolution to
                    supply defects in the minute description of nature. There are touches here and
                    there of the bent of imagination that became dominant in him soon afterwards,
                    notably in the moral aspiration that accompanies his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Remembrance of Collins</hi> on the Thames :—</p>
                <p>“O glide, fair stream! for ever so Thy quiet soul on all bestowing, Till all our
                    minds for ever flow As thy deep waters now are flowing.”</p>
                <p>But in the main this first publication represents the poet in the stage described
                    in the twelfth book of <hi rend="italic">The Prelude :—</hi></p>
                <p>“Bent overmuch on superficial things, Pampering myself with meagre novelties Of
                    colour and proportion; to the moods Of time and season, to the moral power, The
                    affections, and the spirit of the place Insensible.”</p>
                <p>Nature was little more than a picture-gallery to him; the pleasures of the eye
                    had all but absolute dominion; and he</p>
                <p>“Roamed from hill to hill, from rock to rock, Still craving combinations of new
                    forms, New pleasures, wider empire for the sight, Proud of her own endowments,
                    and rejoiced To lay the inner faculties asleep.”</p>
                <p>But, though he had not yet found his distinctive aim as a poet, he was inwardly
                    bent, all the time that his relatives saw in him only a wayward and unpromising
                    aversion to work in any regular line, upon poetry as “his office upon
                    earth.”</p>
                <p>In this determination he was strengthened by his sister Dorothy, who with rare
                    devotion consecrated her life henceforward to his service. A timely legacy
                    enabled them to carry their purpose into effect. A friend of his, whom he had
                    nursed in a last illness, Raisley Calvert, son of the steward of the duke of
                    Norfolk, who had large estates in Cumberland, died early in 1795, leaving him a
                    legacy of &lt;£900. And here it may be well to notice how opportunely, as De
                    Quincey half-ruefully remarked, money always fell in to Wordsworth, enabling him
                    to pursue his poetic career without distraction. Calvert’s bequest came to him
                    when he was on the point of concluding an engagement as a journalist in London.
                    On it and other small resources he and his sister, thanks to her frugal
                    management, contrived to live for nearly eight years. By the end of that time
                    Lord Lonsdale, who owed Wordsworth’s father a large sum for professional
                    services, and had steadily refused to pay it, died, and his successor paid the
                    debt with interest. His wife, Mary Hutchinson, whom he married in 1802, brought
                    him some fortune; and in 1813, when in spite of his plain living his family
                    began to press upon his income, he was appointed stamp-distributor for
                    Westmorland, with an income of £500, afterwards nearly doubled by the increase
                    of his district. By this succession of timely godsends, Wordsworth, though he
                    did not escape some periods of sharp anxiety, was saved from the necessity of
                    turning aside from his vocation.</p>
                <p>To return, however, to the course of his life from the time when he resolved to
                    labour with all his powers in the office of poet. The first two years, during
                    which he lived with his self-sacrificing sister at Racedown, in Dorset, were
                    spent in half-hearted and very imperfectly successful experiments, satires in
                    imitation of Juvenal, the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">The Borderers</hi><note

                    the Spenserian stanza, the poem now entitled <hi rend="italic">Guilt and
                    Sorrow.</hi> How much longer this time of doubtful self-distrustful endeavour
                    might have continued is a subject for curious speculation; an end was put to it
                    by a fortunate incident, a visit from Coleridge, who had read his first
                    publication, and seen in it, what none of the public critics had discerned, the
                    advent of “an original poetic genius.” It would be impossible to exaggerate the
                    importance for Wordsworth of the arrival of this enthusiastic Columbus. Under
                    his sister’s genial influence<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Principal Shairp, 1874. The poet’s acknowledgments of obligation to her were not
                    mere grateful words thrown out at random—</p><p>“She gave me eyes, she gave me
                    ears, And humble cares, and delicate fears; A heart, the fountain of sweet

                    book contains a complete picture of the state of mind in which Coleridge found
                    the poet, when he “seemed to gain clear sight of a new world—a world, too, that
                    was fit to be transmitted and made visible to other eyes.”</p></note> he was
                    groping his way doubtfully out of the labyrinth of poetic conventions, beginning
                    to see a new pathos and sublimity in human life, but not yet convinced except by
                    fits and starts of the rightness of his own vision. Stubborn and independent as
                    Wordsworth was, he needed some friendly voice from the outer world to give him
                    confidence in himself. Coleridge rendered him this indispensable service. He had
                    begun to seek his themes in</p>
                <p>“Sorrow, that is not sorrow, but delight; And miserable love, that is not pain To
                    hear of, for the glory that redounds Therefrom to human kind, and what we
                    are.”</p>
                <p>He read to his visitor one of these experiments, the story of the ruined cottage,

                    poetic genius in the poems published before, was enthusiastic in his praise of
                    them as having “a character, by books not hitherto reflected,” and his praise
                    gave new heart and hope to the poet hitherto hesitating and uncertain.</p>
                <p>June 1797 was the date of this memorable visit. So pleasant was the companionship
                    on both sides that, when Coleridge returned to Nether Stowey in Somerset,
                    Wordsworth at his instance changed his quarters to Alfoxden, within a mile and a
                    half of Coleridge’s temporary residence, and the two poets lived in almost daily
                    intercourse for the next twelve months. During that period Wordsworth’s powers
                    rapidly expanded and matured; ideas that had been gathering in his mind for
                    years, and lying there in dim confusion, felt the stir of a new life, and ranged
                    themselves in clearer shapes under the fresh quickening breath of Coleridge’s
                    swift and discursive <pb break="no"

                    more variously gifted man stirred the stiffer and more sluggish nature of the
                    recluse to its depths, and Coleridge’s quick and generous appreciation of his
                    power gave him precisely the encouragement that he needed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi> were the poetic fruits of their
                    companionship. Out of their frequent discussions of the relative value of common
                    life and supernatural incidents as themes for imaginative treatment grew the
                    idea of writing a volume together, composed of poems of the two kinds. Coleridge
                    was to take the supernatural; and, as his industry was not equal to his
                    friend’s, this kind was represented by the <hi rend="italic">Ancient

                <p>It is necessary to enumerate the contents of this volume in fairness to the
                    contemporaries of Wordsworth, whom it is the fashion to reproach for their cold
                    or scoffing reception of his first distinctive work. Those Wordsworthians who
                    give up <hi rend="italic">The Idiot Boy, Goody Blake,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Thorn</hi> as mistaken experiments have no right to triumph over the first
                    derisive critics of the <hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads,</hi> or to wonder at
                    the dulness that failed to see at once in this humble issue from an obscure
                    provincial press the advent of a great master in literature. The poems that have
                    not yet won general acceptance even among the most devoted Wordsworthians formed
                    a large part of the whole revelation, and attention was specially drawn to them
                    by the title. While the taste for <hi rend="italic">The Idiot Boy</hi> is still
                    uncreated, still far from general, while critics of authority can still so
                    completely miss the poet’s intention as to suggest that the poem might have been
                    enjoyable if Betty Foy’s imbecile son had been described as beautiful and the
                    word “idiot” had not been left to convey uncorrected its repulsive associations,
                    while intimate disciples acknowledge themselves unable to understand the “glee”
                    with which Wordsworth told the simple story, and wonder whether he intended it
                    as a “comic poem,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    defect of <hi rend="italic">The Idiot Boy</hi> is really rhetorical, rather than
                    poetic. Wordsworth himself said that ’ ‘ he never wrote anything with so much
                    glee,” and, once the source of his glee is felt in the nobly affectionate
                    relations between the two half-witted irrational old women and the glorious
                    imbecile, the work is seen to be executed with a harmony that should satisfy the
                    most exacting criticism. The poet not only felt but gave complete expression to
                    the most exquisitely tender humour in telling the story of the simple incident.
                    Poetically, therefore, the poem is a success; not a note is out of tune, with
                    the exception perhaps of the boisterous ridicule of the romantic ballad in his
                    speculations as to the employment of the lost horseman; otherwise, as a work of
                    art in a rare vein of humorous tenderness elevated by the moral dignity of the
                    subject, <hi rend="italic">The Idiot Boy</hi> is as perfect as anything that
                    Wordsworth wrote. But rhetorically this particular attempt to “breathe grandeur
                    upon the very humblest face of human life” must be pronounced a failure,
                    inasmuch as the writer did not use sufficiently forcible means to disabuse his
                    readers of vulgar prepossessions.</p></note> it may be doubted whether now,
                    after nearly a century of discipleship and exposition, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lyrical Ballads</hi> would receive a much more cordial or much wider welcome
                    than they did in 1798. It is true that <hi rend="italic">Tintern Abbey</hi> was
                    in the volume, and that all the highest qualities of Wordsworth’s imagination
                    and of his verse could be illustrated now from the lyrical ballads proper in
                    this first publication; but before we accuse our predecessors of purblindness,
                    corrupt taste, and critical malignity, as is the sweet and reasonable custom of
                    too many professing Wordsworthians,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Herein curiously, if not ridiculously, inconsistent, as
                    their master was not, with his tranquillizing creed.</p></note> we should
                    remember that clear vision is easier for us than it was for them when the
                    revelation was fragmentary and incomplete.</p>
                <p>Although Wordsworth was not received at first with the respect to which we now
                    see that he was entitled, his power was not entirely without recognition. There
                    is a curious commercial evidence of this, which ought to be noted, because a
                    perversion of the fact is sometimes used to exaggerate the supposed neglect of
                    Wordsworth at the outset of his career. When the Longmans took over Cottle’s
                    publishing business in 1799, the value of the copyright of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lyrical Ballads,</hi> for which Cottle had paid thirty guineas, was assessed at
                    <hi rend="italic">nil.</hi> Cottle therefore begged that it might be excluded
                    altogether from the bargain, and presented it to the authors. But in 1800, when
                    the first edition was exhausted, the Longmans offered Wordsworth £100 for two
                    issues of a new edition with an additional volume and an explanatory preface.
                    The sum was small compared with what Scott and Byron soon afterwards received,
                    but it shows that the public neglect was not quite so complete as is sometimes
                    represented. Another edition was called for in 1802, and a fourth in 1805. The
                    new volume in the 1800 edition was made up of poems composed during his
                    residence at Goslar in the winter of 1798-99, and after his settlement at
                    Grasmere in December 1799. It contained a large portion of poems now universally
                    accepted :— <hi rend="italic">Ruth, Nutting, Three Years She Grew, Α Poet's
                    Epitaph, Hartleap Well, L·ucy Gray, The Brothers, Michael, The Old Cumberland
                    Beggar, Poems on the Naming of Places.</hi> But it contained also the famous
                    Preface, in which he infuriated critics by presuming to defend his
                    eccentricities in an elaborate theory of poetry and poetic diction.</p>
                <p>Comparatively few in the present day have actually read and studied this famous
                    document, although it is constantly referred to as a sort of revolutionary
                    proclamation against the established taste of the eighteenth century. For one
                    that has read Wordsworth’s original, hundreds have read Coleridge’s brilliant
                    criticism, and the fixed conception of the doctrines actually put forth by
                    Wordsworth is taken from this. Now, although the Preface and the extensive and
                    bitter discussion provoked by it had not a tithe of the influence on poetry
                    ascribed to it by a natural liking for sudden changes and simple personal
                    agencies, although the result on literary practice was little more than the
                    banishment of a few overdriven phrases and figures of speech from poetic
                    diction,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir Henry
                    Taylor, one of the most acute and judicious of Wordsworth’s champions, came to
                    this conclusion in 1834.</p><p/></note> it is desirable, considering the
                    celebrity of the affair, that Wordsworth’s exact position should be made clear.
                    To do this is to contradict several· “vulgar errors” on the subject, probably
                    too vulgar and deeply rooted to be affected by any exposure. Coleridge’s
                    criticism of his friend’s theory proceeded avowedly “on the assumption that his
                    words had been rightly interpreted, as purporting that the proper diction for
                    poetry in general consists altogether in a language taken, with due exceptions,
                    from the mouths of men in real life, a language which actually constitutes the
                    natural conversation of men under the influence of natural feelings.” Coleridge
                    assumed further that, when Wordsworth spoke of there being “no essential
                    difference between the language of prose and metrical composition,” he meant by
                    language not the mere words but the style, the structure, and the order of the
                    sentences; on this assumption he argued as if Wordsworth had held that the
                    metrical order should always be the same as the prose order. Given these
                    assumptions, which formed the popular interpretation of the theory <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n712/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0712-0671"/> by its opponents, it was easy to demonstrate its
                    absurdity, and Coleridge is very generally supposed to have given Wordsworth’s
                    theory in its bare and naked extravagance the <hi rend="italic">coup de
                    grdce.</hi> But the truth is that neither of the two assumptions is warranted;
                    not only so, but both were expressly disclaimed by Wordsworth in the Preface
                    itself. There is not a single qualification introduced by Coleridge in
                    correction of the theory that was not made by Wordsworth himself in the original
                    statement.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Although
                    Coleridge makes the qualifications more prominent than they were in the original
                    statement, the two theories are at bottom so closely the same that one is
                    sometimes inclined to suspect that parts, at least, of the original emanated
                    from the fertile mind of Coleridge himself. The two poets certainly discussed
                    the subject together in Somerset when the first ballads were written, and
                    Coleridge was at Grasmere when the Preface was prepared in 1800. The diction of
                    the Preface is curiously Hartleian, and, when they first met, Coleridge was a
                    devoted disciple of Hartley, naming his first son after the philosopher, while
                    Wordsworth detested analytic psychology. If Coleridge did contribute to the
                    original theory in 1798 or 1800, he was likely enough to have forgotten the fact
                    by 1814. At any rate he evidently wrote his criticism without making a close
                    study of the Preface, and what he did in effect was to restate the original
                    theory against popular misconceptions of it.</p></note> In the first place, it
                    was not put forward as a theory of poetry in general, though from the vigour
                    with which he carried the war into the enemy’s country it was naturally enough
                    for polemic purposes taken as such; it was a statement and defence of the
                    principles on which his own poems of humbler life were composed, undertaken at
                    the instance of friends interested in “a class of poetry well adapted to
                    interest mankind permanently, and not unimportant in the quality and in the
                    multiplicity of its moral relations.” He assailed the public taste as
                    “depraved,” first and mainly in so far as it was adverse to simple incidents
                    simply treated, being accustomed to "gross and violent stimulants,” “craving
                    after extraordinary incident,” possessed with a “degrading thirst after
                    outrageous stimulation,” “frantic novels, sickly and stupid German tragedies,
                    and deluges of idle and extravagant stories in verse.” This, and not adherence
                    to the classical rule of Pope, which had really suffered deposition a good half
                    century before, was the first count in Wordsworth’s defensive indictment of the
                    taste of his age. To make it perfectly clear that he was pleading only for his
                    own maligned and misunderstood poems, he repeated at the close of the Preface
                    that, “if his purpose were fulfilled, a species of poetry would be produced
                    which is genuine poetry, in its nature well adapted to interest mankind,
                    &amp;c.” It is true that he said also that, “in order entirely to enjoy the
                    poetry which I am recommending, it would be necessary to give up much of what is
                    ordinarily enjoyed but the context makes it plain that in so saying he referred
                    to startling incident and gaudy ornament, his own purpose being to make “the
                    feeling give importance to the action and situation, not the action and
                    situation to the feeling,” and to use language as near as possible to the
                    language of real life. In the second place, as regards this language of real
                    life, and the “poetic diction,” the liking for which was the second count in his
                    indictment of the public taste, it is most explicitly clear that, when he said
                    that there was no essential difference between the language of poetry and the
                    language of prose, he meant words, plain and figurative, and not structure and
                    order, or, as Coleridge otherwise puts it, the “ordonnance” of composition.
                    Coleridge says that if he meant this he was only uttering a truism, which nobody
                    that knew Wordsworth would suspect him of doing; but, strange to say, it is as a
                    truism, nominally acknowledged by everybody, that Wordsworth does advance his
                    doctrine on this point. Only he adds—“if in what I am about to say it shall
                    appear to some that my labour is unnecessary, and that I am like a man fighting
                    a battle without enemies, such persons may be reminded that, whatever be the
                    language outwardly holden by men, a practical faith in tlιe opinions which I am
                    wishing to establish is almost unknown”; and what he wished to establish, as may
                    be seen by any person of average intelligence who grapples honestly with his
                    stiff and condensed exposition, and interprets it with reference to the
                    controversy in which it was an incident, was the simple truth that what is
                    false, unreal, affected, bombastic, or nonsensical in prose is not less so in
                    verse. There was no greater heresy than this in Wordsworth’s theory of poetic
                    diction. The form in which he expresses the theory was conditioned by the
                    circumstances of the polemic, and readers were put on a false scent by his
                    purely incidental and collateral and very much overstrained defence of the
                    language of rustics, as being less conventional and more permanent, and
                    therefore better fitted to afford materials for the poet’s selection. But this
                    was a side issue, a paradoxical retort on his critics, seized upon by them in
                    turn and made prominent as a matter for easy ridicule; all that he says on this
                    head might be cut out of the Preface without affecting in the least his main
                    thesis. The drift of this is fairly apparent all through, but stands out in
                    unmistakable clearness in his criticism of the passages from Johnson and
                    Cowper.</p>
                <p>“But the sound of the church-going bell These valleys and rocks never heard;
                    Ne’er sighed at the sound of a knell Or smiled when a Sabbath appeared.”</p>
                <p>The epithet “church-going” offends him as a puritan in grammar; whether his
                    objection is well founded or ill founded, it applies equally to prose and verse.
                    Poetic licence does not justify bad grammar. Whether this is strictly defensible
                    or not, all the same it illustrates his contention. To represent the valleys and
                    rocks as sighing and smiling in the circumstances would appear feeble and absurd
                    in prose composition, and is not less so in metrical composition; “the occasion
                    does not justify such violent expressions.” These are examples of all that
                    Wordsworth meant by saying that “there is no essential difference between the
                    language of prose and metrical composition”; and it is mere pedantry to detach
                    this phrase from the context, and hold him bound by the precise scholastic sense
                    of the word essential to a meaning that he expressly repudiates. So far is
                    Wordsworth from contending that the metrical order should always be the same
                    with the prose order, that part of the preface is devoted to a subtle analysis
                    of the peculiar effect of metrical arrangement, assigning the pleasure proper to
                    this as his reason for writing in verse rather than in prose, and repeating
                    again and again such phrases as “fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of
                    the real language of men in a state of vivid sensation,” and “language closely
                    resembling that of real life, and yet in the circumstance of metre differing
                    from it. so widely.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He
                    expressly admitted also that, in the expression of passion, owing to “the
                    tendency of metre to divest language to a certain degree of its reality,” a
                    strength of language might be used in verse that good taste would not tolerate
                    in prose.</p><p/></note> What he objects to is not departure from the structure
                    of prose, but the assumption, which seemed to him to underlie the criticisms of
                    lιis ballads, that a writer of verse is not a poet unless he uses artificially
                    ornamental language, not justified by the strength of the emotion expressed. The
                    farthest that he went in defence of prose structure in poetry was to maintain
                    that, if the words in a verse happened to be in the order of prose, it did not
                    follow that they were prosaic in the sense of being unpoetic,—a side-stroke at
                    critics who complained of his prosaisms for no better reason than that the words
                    stood in the order of prose composition.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0713-0672"/>
                <p>Wordsworth was far from repudiating elevation of style in poetry. “If,” he said,
                    “the poet’s subject be judiciously chosen, it will naturally, and upon fit
                    occasion, lead him to passions the language of which, if selected truly and
                    judiciously, must necessarily be dignified and variegated, and alive with
                    metaphors and figures.” But no “foreign splendours” should be interwoven with
                    what “the passion naturally suggests,” and “where the passions are of a milder
                    character the style also should be subdued and temperate.”</p>
                <p>Such was Wordsworth’s theory of poetic diction. Nothing could be more grossly
                    mistaken than the current notion, which has been repeated by so many critics of
                    authority that it has become an established belief, that the greater part of
                    Words worth’s poetry was composed in defiance of his own theory, and that he
                    succeeded best when he set his own theory most at defiance. All commentators on
                    Wordsworth who feel tempted to repeat this pretty paradox should pause and read
                    his own statement of his theory before giving further currency to a
                    misconception which they will see is absurdly unwarrantable. It is traceable to
                    the authority of Coleridge. His just, sympathetic, and penetrating criticism on
                    Wordsworth’s work as a poet did immense service in securing for him a wider
                    recognition; but his proved friendship and brilliant style have done sad
                    injustice to the poet as a theorist. It was natural to assume that Coleridge, if
                    anybody, must have known what his friend’s theory was; and it was natural also
                    that readers under the charm of his lucid and melodious prose should gladly
                    grant themselves a dispensation from the trouble of verifying his facts in the
                    harsh and cumbrous exposition of the theorist himself.<note anchored="true"

                    even Mr Myers, after quoting the Preface itself, and the famous stanza “Perhaps
                    some dungeon hears thee groan,” &amp;c., from <hi rend="italic">The Affliction
                    of Margaret,</hi> comments as follows:—“These lines, supposed to be spoken by ‘
                    a poor widow at Penrith,’ afford a fair illustration of what Wordsworth calls
                    ‘the language really spoken by men,’ with ‘metre superadded.’ ‘ What other
                    distinction from prose, ’ he asks, ‘ would we have? ’ We may answer that we
                    would have what he has actually given us, viz., an appropriate and attractive
                    music, lying both in the rhythm and the actual sound of the words used.” But in
                    the theory this is covered by the phrases <hi rend="italic">metrical

                    expositor in prose, and he did not make his qualifications sufficiently
                    prominent, but the theory of diction taken with those qualifications left him
                    free without inconsistency to use any language that was not contrary to “true
                    taste and feeling.” He acknowledged that he might occasionally have substituted
                    “particular for general associations,” and that thus language charged with
                    poetic feeling to himself might appear trivial and ridiculous to others, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">The Idiot Boy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Goody Blake</hi>; he
                    even went so far as to withdraw <hi rend="italic">Alice Fell,</hi> first
                    published in 1807, from several subsequent editions; but he argued that it was
                    dangerous for a poet to make alterations on the simple authority of a few
                    individuals or even classes of men, because if he did not follow his own
                    judgment and feelings his mind would infallibly be debilitated.</p><p/></note>
                    After all, the theory is a minor affair. It is the work that counts; only it is
                    hardly fair to Wordsworth that he should go down as a stupid genius who did
                    right against his own reasoned principles, or an arrogant person who knew
                    himself to be wrong but refused to admit it.</p>
                <p>The question of diction made most noise, but it was far from being the most
                    important point of poetic doctrine set forth in the Preface. If in this he
                    merely enunciated a truism, generally admitted in words but too generally
                    ignored in practice, there was real novelty in his plea for humble subjects, and
                    in his theory of poetic composition. We might, indeed, easily exaggerate to
                    ourselves the amount of innovation in mere abstract theory; this might have been
                    insignificant enough but for the turn that was given to it by the poet’s
                    individuality. But in view of all that was most distinctive and influential in
                    Wordsworth’s own work, his remarks on poetry in general, on the supreme function
                    of the imagination in dignifying humble and commonplace incidents, and on the
                    need of active exercise of imagination in the reader as well as in the
                    poet—passiveness in this particular not being recommended as wise—his remarks on
                    these points are immeasurably more important than his theory of poetic diction.
                    It is much to be regretted that Coleridge’s genius for luminous and brilliant
                    exposition was not applied to the development of the few stiff phrases in which
                    Wordsworth sought to generalize his own practice. Such sayings as that poetry
                    “takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity,” or that it is the
                    business of a poet to trace “how men associate ideas in a state of excitement,”
                    are, like the detached parts of a Chinese puzzle, meaningless till they are
                    pieced together with views of the poet’s art expressed and illustrated
                    elsewhere. They are significant of Wordsworth’s endeavour to lay the foundations
                    of his art in an independent study of the feelings and faculties of men in real
                    life, unbiassed as far as possible by poetic custom and convention. If this had
                    meant, as many might suppose from the bare statement of the idea, that the new
                    poet was to turn his back on his predecessors and· never look behind him to what
                    they had done, was to reject absolutely as valueless for him the accumulating
                    tradition of thought and expression, was to write in short as if nobody before
                    him had ever written a line, even going to common speech for his diction, a more
                    foolish and unfruitful, silly and presumptuous, ambition could not be conceived.
                    But Wordsworth was guilty of no such extravagance. He was from boyhood upwards a
                    diligent student of poetry, and was not insensible of his obligations to the
                    past. His purpose was only to use real life as a touchstone of poetic substance.
                    Imagination operates in all men for the increase or the abatement of emotion.
                    Incidents that have lodged in the memory are not allowed to lie there unchanged;
                    joy is sustained by the instinctive activity of the imagination in assembling
                    kindred ideas round the original incident, and under the instinctive operation
                    of the same faculty pain is relieved by the suggestion of ideas that console and
                    tranquillize. Now the poet, in Wordsworth’s conception, is distinctively a man
                    in whom this beneficent energy of imagination, operative as a blind instinct
                    more or less in all men, is stronger than in others, and is voluntarily and
                    rationally exercised for the benefit of all in its proper work of increase and
                    consolation. If the poet is to discharge this mission profitably, he must study
                    how the imagination works in real life, that is to say, “how men associate ideas
                    in a state ’ of excitement.” Not every image that the excited mind conjures up
                    in real life is necessarily poetical. Joy may be chilled and pain exaggerated by
                    morbid imaginative activity. It is the business of the poet to select and modify
                    for his special purpose of producing immediate pleasure. “Nor,” says the ardent
                    theorist, “let this necessity of producing immediate pleasure be considered as a
                    degradation of the poet’s art. It is far otherwise. It is an acknowledgment of
                    the beauty of the universe, an acknowledgment the more sincere because it is not
                    formal but indirect; it is a task light and easy to him who looks at the world
                    in the spirit of love; further, it is a homage paid to the native and naked
                    dignity of man, to the grand elementary principle of pleasure, by which he knows
                    and feels and moves.”</p>
                <p>All this is elementary enough as Hartleian psychology. The formal recognition of
                    it will not make a man a poet. But there were several respects in which the
                    formal <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n714/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0714-0673"/> recognition of these elementary principles of
                    poetic evolution powerfully affected Wordsworth’s practice. One of these may be
                    indicated, though not fully expressed, by saying that he endeavoured always to
                    work out an emotional motive from within. Instead of choosing a striking theme
                    and working at it like a decorative painter, embellishing, enriching, dressing
                    to advantage, standing back from it and studying effects, his plan was to take
                    incidents that had set his own imagination spontaneously to work, and to study
                    and reproduce with artistic judgment the modification of the initial feeling,
                    the emotional motive, within himself. There is room for an endless amount of
                    subtle discussion, which would be out of place here, as to the exact difference
                    between the methods thus broadly stated. It is obvious that they tend to
                    approximate, inasmuch as all poets must work to some extent from within and all
                    to some extent from without. The mere fact of using words, the medium of
                    communication between man and man, implies a reference, unconscious or
                    deliberate, to the effect produced on others. But undoubtedly in Wordsworth’s
                    case the reference to others was of deliberate purpose as much as possible
                    suppressed. Probably from natural stiffness of temper, he could not make it
                    easily, and found the effort, as it must always be when it is an effort and not
                    a happy instinct, embarrassing and chilling. At any rate, if an association, to
                    use his own terminology, gave pleasure to himself, he did not pause long to
                    consider the probable effect on others. If he did reflect upon it when the act
                    of composition was over, he was often able to satisfy himself that, if an
                    association which seemed to him just, reasonable, and humane, was not acceptable
                    to general sentiment, the general sentiment was corrupt. To this, as he himself
                    with his’habits of self-criticism was fully aware, was owing much of his
                    strength and much of his unpopularity. By keeping his eye on the object, as
                    spontaneously modified by his own imaginative energy, he was able to give full
                    and undistracted scope to all his powers in poetic coinage of the wealth that
                    his imagination brought. On the other hand, readers whose nature or education
                    was different from his own, were repelled or left cold and indifferent, or
                    obliged to make the sympathetic effort to see with his eyes, which he refused to
                    make in order that he might see with theirs.</p>
                <p>“He is retired as noontide dew Or fountain in a noon-day grove, And you must love
                    him ere to you He will seem worthy of your love.”</p>
                <p>From this habit of taking the processes of his own mind as the standard of the
                    way in which “men associate ideas in a state of excitement,” and language
                    familiar to himself as the standard of the language of “real men,” arises a
                    superficial anomaly in Wordsworth’s .poetry, an apparent contradiction between
                    his practice and his theory. His own imagination, judged by ordinary standards,
                    was easily excited, excited by emotional motives that have little force with
                    ordinary men. Most of his poems start from humbler, slighter, less generally
                    striking themes than those of any other poet of high rank. But his poetry is not
                    correspondingly simple. On the contrary, much of it, much of the best of it—for
                    example, the <hi rend="italic">Ode to Duty,</hi> and that on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Intimations of Immortality—</hi> is as intricate, elaborate, and
                    abstruse, as remote from the ordinary paths of thought, as is to be found in
                    literature. The emotional motive is simple; the passion has almost always a
                    simple origin, and often is of no great intensity; but the imaginative structure
                    is generally elaborate, and, when the poet is at his best, supremely splendid
                    and gorgeous. No poet has built such magnificent palaces of rare material for
                    the ordinary everyday homely human affections. It is because he has invested our
                    ordinary everyday principles of conduct, which are so apt to become threadbare,
                    with such imperishable robes of finest texture and richest design that
                    Wordsworth holds so high a place among the great moralists, the greatest of
                    moralists in verse. And yet he attained this end in his most effectively moral
                    poems, though not by any means in all his poems, without in the least confusing
                    the boundaries between poetry and preaching, his conception of the end of poetry
                    as immediate pleasure serving him as a load-star.</p>
                <p>His practice was influenced also, and not always for good, by his theory that
                    poetry “takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity.” This was a
                    somewhat doubtful corollary from his general theory of poetic evolution. A poem
                    is complete in itself; there must be no sting in it to disturb the reader’s
                    content with the whole; through whatever agitations it progresses, to whatever
                    elevations it soars, to this end it must come, otherwise it is imperfect as a
                    poem. Now the imagination in ordinary men, though the process is not expressed
                    in verse, and the poet’s special art *has thus no share in producing the effect,
                    reaches the poetic end when it has so transfigured a disturbing experience,
                    whether of joy or grief, that this rests tranquilly in the memory, can be
                    recalled without disquietude, and dwelt upon with some mode and degree of
                    pleasure, more or less keen, more or less pure or mixed with pain. True to his
                    idea of imitating real life, Wordsworth made it a rule for himself not to write
                    on any theme till his imagination had operated upon it for some time
                    involuntarily; it was not in his view ripe for poetic treatment till this
                    transforming agency had subdued the original emotion to a state of
                    tranquillity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">The Prelude</hi> contains a record of his practice, after the
                    opening lines of the first book—</p><p>“Thus far, 0 friend! did I, not used to

                    this tranquillity arises the favourable moment for poetic composition, some day
                    when, as he contemplates the subject, the tranquillity disappears, an emotion
                    kindred to the original emotion is reinstated, and the poet retraces and
                    supplements with all his art the previous involuntary and perhaps unconscious
                    imaginative chemistry.</p>
                <p>When we study the moments that Wordsworth found favourable for successful
                    composition, a very curious law reveals itself, somewhat at variance with the
                    common conception of him as a poet who derived all his strength from solitary
                    communion with nature. We find that the recluse’s best poems were written under
                    the excitement of some break in the monotony of his quiet life—change of scene,
                    change of companionship, change of occupation. The law holds from the beginning
                    to the end of his poetic career. We have already noticed the immense stimulus
                    given to his powers by his first contact with Coleridge after two years of
                    solitary and abortive effort. <hi rend="italic">Above Tintern Abbey</hi> was

                    Tintern, and concluded it as he was entering Bristol. His residence amidst
                    strange scenes and “unknown men” at Goslar was particularly fruitful: <hi

                    circumstances and the near prospect of marriage, roused him to one of his
                    happiest fits of activity. His first great sonnet, <pb break="no"

                    coincident with the exaltation of spirit due to the triumphant and successful

                    ><p>This casual estimate of his own work is not merely amusing but also
                    instructive, as showing—what is sometimes denied—that Wordsworth himself knew
                    well enough the difference between “poetry” and such “valuable thoughts” as he
                    propounded in <hi rend="italic">The Excursion.</hi></p></note> was the product
                    of a calmer period. The excitement of preparing for publication always had a
                    rousing effect upon him; the preparation for the edition of 1807 resulted in the
                    completion of the ode on the <hi rend="italic">Intimations of Immortality,</hi>
                    the sonnets <hi rend="italic">The World is too much with us, Methought I saw the
                    Footsteps of a Throne, Two Voices are there,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lady,
                    the Songs of Spring were in the Grove,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Song at
                    the Feast of Brougham Castle.</hi> After 1807 there is a marked falling off in
                    the quality, though not in the quantity, of Wordsworth’s poetic work. It is
                    significant of the comparatively sober and laborious spirit in which he wrote
                    <hi rend="italic">The Excursion</hi> that its progress was accompanied by none
                    of those casual sallies of exulting and exuberant power that mark the period of
                    the happier <hi rend="italic">Prelude.</hi> The completion of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Excursion</hi> was signalized by the production of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laodamia.</hi> The chorus of adverse criticism with which it was received
                    inspired him in the noble sonnet to Haydon <hi rend="italic">—High is our
                    Calling, Friend.</hi> He rarely or never again touched the same lofty
                    height.</p>
                <p>It is interesting to compare with what he actually accomplished the plan of
                    life-work with which Wordsworth settled at Grasmere in the last month of the
                    eighteenth century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    parsonage at Grasmere, from 1811 to 1813; Rydal Mount, for the rest of his
                    life.</p><p/></note> The plan was definitely conceived as he left the German
                    town of Goslar in the spring of 1799. Tired of the wandering unsettled life that
                    he had led hitherto, dissatisfied also with the fragmentary occasional and
                    disconnected character of his lyrical poems, he longed for a permanent home
                    among his native hills, where he might, as one called and consecrated to the
                    task, devote his powers continuously to the composition of a great philosophical
                    poem on “Man, Nature, and Society.” The poem was to be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Recluse,</hi> “as having for its principal subject the sensations and
                    opinions of a poet living in retirement.” He communicated the design to
                    Coleridge, who gave him enthusiastic encouragement to proceed. In the first
                    transport of the conception he felt as if he needed only solitude and leisure
                    for the continuous execution of it. But, though he had still before him fifty
                    years of peaceful life amidst his beloved scenery, the work in the projected
                    form at least was destined to remain incomplete. Doubts and misgivings soon
                    arose, and favourable moments of felt inspiration delayed their coming. To
                    sustain him in his resolution he thought of writing as an introduction, or, as
                    he put it, an antechapel to the church which he proposed to build, a history of
                    his own mind up to the time when he recognized the great mission of his life.
                    One of the many laughs at his expense by unsympathetic critics has been directed
                    against his saying that he wrote this <hi rend="italic">Prelude</hi> of fourteen
                    books about himself out of diffidence. But in truth the original motive was none
                    other than distrust of his own powers. He began this review of his early life to
                    reassure himself from misgivings whether nature and education had fitted him for
                    his proposed task, partly by elevating his mind to a confidence in nature’s
                    special destination, and partly by making practical trial of his powers in a
                    simpler work. He turned aside from <hi rend="italic">The Prelude</hi> to prepare
                    the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi> and write the
                    explanatory Preface, which as a statement of his aims in poetry had partly the
                    same purpose of strengthening his self-confidence. From his sister’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal</hi> we learn that in the winter of 1801-2 he was “hard at
                    work on <hi rend="italic">The Pedlar"—</hi> the original title of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Excursion.</hi> But this experiment on the larger work was
                    also soon abandoned. It appears from a letter to his friend Sir George Beaumont
                    that his health was far from robust, and in particular that he could not write
                    without intolerable physical uneasiness. We should probably not be wrong in
                    connecting his physical weakness with his rule of waiting for favourable
                    moments. His next start with <hi rend="italic">The Prelude,</hi> in the spring
                    of 1804, was more prosperous; he dropped it for several months, but, resuming
                    again in the spring of 1805, he completed it in the summer of that year. But
                    still the composition of the great work to which it was intended to be a portico
                    proceeded by fits and starts. It was not till 1814 that the second of the three
                    divisions of <hi rend="italic">The Recluse,</hi> ultimately named <hi
                    rend="italic">The Excursion,</hi> was ready for publication; and he went no
                    further in the execution of his great design. It is possible that he had his own
                    unfinished project in mind when he wrote the sonnet on Malham Cove.—</p>
                <p>“ ’Mid the wreck of Is and Was, Things incomplete and purposes betrayed Make
                    sadder transits o’er thought’s optic glass Than noblest objects utterly
                    decayed.”</p>
                <p>We shall speak presently of the reception of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Excursion.</hi> Meantime we must look elsewhere for the virtual accomplishment
                    of the great design of <hi rend="italic">The Recluse.</hi> The purpose was not
                    after all betrayed; it was really fulfilled, though not in the form intended, in
                    his various occasional poems. In relation to the edifice that he aspired to
                    construct, he likened these poems to little cells, oratories, and sepulchral
                    recesses; they are really the completed work, much more firmly united by their
                    common purpose than by any formal and visible nexus of words. Formally
                    disconnected, they really, as we read and feel them, range themselves to
                    spiritual music as the component parts of a great poetic temple, finding a
                    rendezvous amidst the scenery of the district where the poet had his local
                    habitation. The Lake District, as transfigured by Wordsworth’s imagination, is
                    the fulfilment of his ambition after an enduring memorial. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poems</hi> collected and published in 1807 compose in effect “a philosophical
                    poem on man, nature, and society,” the title of which might fitly have been <hi
                    rend="italic">The Recluse,</hi> “as having for its principal subject the
                    sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement.” As a realization of the
                    idea of <hi rend="italic">The Recluse,</hi> these poems are from every poetical
                    point of view infinitely superior to the kind of thing that he projected and
                    failed to complete.</p>
                <p>The derisive fury with which <hi rend="italic">The Excursion</hi> was assailed
                    upon its first appearance has long been a stock example of critical blindness,
                    conceit, and malignity. And yet, if we look at the position claimed for the <hi
                    rend="italic">Excursion</hi> now by competent authorities, the error of the
                    first critics is seen to lie not in their indictment of faults, but in the
                    prominence they gave to the faults and their generally disrespectful<pb

                    Jeffrey’s petulant “This will never do,” uttered, professedly at least, more in
                    sorrow than in anger, because the poet would persist in spite of all friendly
                    counsel in misapplying his powers,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The lively lawyer, to whom reviewing was a recreation,
                    obviously enjoyed the process of “slating” more than is quite consistent with
                    his strong protestations of sorrow over the poet’s waywardness; but it should
                    not be overlooked that he did make ample acknowledgment, when he had sated
                    himself with denunciations of the Wanderer’s verbosity, of the power and beauty
                    of isolated passages. In the second part of his article, indeed, he quoted so
                    much that was admirable that he confessed himself disposed to rescind his severe
                    judgment, but reperusal of the Wanderer’s arguments convinced him that it could
                    not be rescinded. Jeffrey’s criticisms in their entirety are dead and buried,
                    except for the professional student, but even critics have their humble rights,
                    and it is time that his four opening words should receive the privilege of
                    interment also, if they are not to be fairly interpreted. His criticism of <hi
                    rend="italic">The White Doe</hi> is valueless enough, because the sentiment of
                    that poem is more abstruse, less palpable to the running reader; but what he
                    said of <hi rend="italic">The Excursion</hi> has simply been repeated in duller
                    language by the Wordsworthians who have denounced his arrogance in daring to say
                    it.</p></note> has become a byword of ridiculous critical cocksureness. But the
                    curious thing is that <hi rend="italic">The Excursion</hi> has not “done,” and
                    that the Wordsworthians who laugh at Jeffrey are in the habit of repeating the
                    substance of his criticism, though in more temperate and becoming language. Thus
                    Dean Church, in a criticism at once sympathetic and judicious, after the usual
                    fling at Jeffrey’s “insolence,” goes on to say—</p>
                <p>“In <hi rend="italic">The Excursion</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Prelude</hi>
                    there are passages as magnificent as perhaps poet ever wrote; but they are not
                    specimens of the context in which they are embedded, and λvhich in spite of them
                    does not carry a!ong with it the reader’s honest enjoyment. We read on because

                <p>This is the very substance of Jeffrey’s criticism, which was far from being
                    unreservedly damnatory, as the following will show :—</p>
                <p>“Besides those more extended passages of interest or beauty which we have quoted
                    and omitted to quote, there are scattered up and down the book, and in the midst
                    of its most repulsive portions, a very great number of single lines and images
                    that sparkle like gems in the desert and startle us by an intimation of the
                    great poetic powers that lie buried in the rubbish that has been heaped around
                    them.”</p>
                <p>Jeffrey, it will be seen, was not blind to the occasional felicities and
                    unforgetable lines celebrated by Coleridge, and his general judgment on <hi

                    >The Prelude</hi> is infinitely superior; its autobiographical character gives
                    it a certain unity, and it contains a greater number of lofty passages in
                    Wordsworth’s best vein.</p></note> Lt is not upon <hi rend="italic">The
                    Excursion</hi> that Wordsworth’s reputation as a poet can ever rest, whatever
                    defence may be made for it as “a chain of extremely valuable thoughts,” varied
                    by passages of lofty or quietly beautiful description, invigorating exhortation,
                    and gentle pathos. The two “books” entitled <hi rend="italic">The Churchyard
                    among the Mountains</hi> are the only parts of the poem that derive much force
                    from the scenic setting; if they had been published separately, they would
                    probably have obtained at once a reception very different from that given to <hi
                    rend="italic">The Excursion</hi> as a whole. The dramatic setting is merely dead
                    weight, not because the chief speaker is a pedlar— Wordsworth fairly justifies
                    this selection—but because the pedlar, as a personality to be known, and loved,
                    and respected, and listened to with interest, is not completely created. We know
                    Uncle Toby better than Sterne, but we do not know the Wanderer so well as
                    Wordsworth, and consequently we are more easily bored by him than by the poet
                    speaking in his own person as he does in <hi rend="italic">The Prelude.</hi> His
                    cheerfulness after reciting the tale of Margaret at the ruined cottage is almost
                    offensive; the assigned motive for it in the beauty of nature that remains
                    though the poor broken-hearted woman is gone is hardly higher than the dropsical
                    scullion’s philosophy in <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy.</hi> “‘He is dead.
                    He is certainly dead,’ said Obadiah. ‘So am not I,’ said the foolish

                    Lamb’s review of <hi rend="italic">The Excursion</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly</hi> (Oct. 1814), in spite of the editor Gifford’s modifications,
                    remains the most sympathetic of competent criticisms of the poem. In one point
                    there is an oversight, significant of the indefiniteness of Wordsworth’s
                    exposition; Lamb supposes the conversion of the Solitary to be accomplished
                    within <hi rend="italic">The Excursion.</hi> It was really reserved for the
                    third part of <hi rend="italic">The Recluse.</hi> It was the poet’s intention,
                    as expressed in his conversations with Miss Fenwick, to effect this conversion
                    not by argument, but by carrying the sceptic back to his native Scotland, making
                    him witness of a sacrament service, and making early associations thereupon
                    reassert themselves. This would have been in accordance with his theory of the
                    value of early associations. What makes the position of the Solitary a little
                    difficult to gι∙asp at first is that Wordsworth, on principle, does not present
                    this character in marked contrast to the other characters in the poem, but
                    rather lays stress on what he has in common with them, tender-heartedness
                    towards suffering and intense enthusiasm for nature; hence it arises that the
                    reader cannot see without some study what it is that the other interlocutors
                    find lacking in him, and aim at supplying to him.</p></note></p>
                <p>There can be little doubt that adverse criticism had a depressing influence on
                    Wordsworth’s poetical powers, notwithstanding his nobly expressed defiance of it
                    and his determination to hold on in his own path undisturbed. Its effect in
                    retarding the sale of his poems and thus depriving him of the legitimate fruits
                    of his industry was a favourite topic with him in his later years;<note

                    of what he considered his best and most distinctive work, contributed in all
                    probability to a still more unfortunate result—the premature depression and
                    deadening of his powers. He schooled himself to stoical endurance, but he was
                    not superhuman, and in the absence of sympathy not only was any possibility of
                    development checked but he ceased to write with the spontaneity and rapture of
                    his earlier verse. The common theory that the marked stiffening of his powers
                    after 1807 was the effect of age only may be true; but the coincidence of this
                    falling off with the failure of the strenuous effort made in that year to
                    conquer the hostility of critics and the indifference of the public makes the
                    theory extremely doubtful as a whole truth. Wordsworth’s true nature is often
                    misjudged under the fallacy that the preacher of high and serene fortitude in
                    the face of failure and misfortune must himself be imperturbable. On the
                    contrary the most eloquent advocate of this heroic virtue is the man who most
                    feels the need of it in the frailty of his own temper. It is on record that
                    Wordsworth, with all his philosophy of consolation, did not easily recover
                    serenity after domestic bereavements, and we go very far wrong when we confound
                    his proud and self-reliant defiance of criticism with insensibility to it or
                    power to rise at will above its disheartening and benumbing influence.</p>
                <p>For five years after the condemnation of <hi rend="italic">The Excursion</hi>
                    Wordsworth published almost nothing that had not been composed before. The chief
                    exception is the <hi rend="italic">Thanksgiving Ode</hi> of 1816. He was
                    occupied mainly in the task of putting his work and his aims more fully before
                    the world, maintaining his position with dignity and unflinching courage, so far
                    unmoved by criticism that he would not alter his course one jot for the sake of
                    public favour. In 1815 he published a new edition of his poems, in the
                    arrangement according to faculties and feelings in which they have since stood;
                    and he sought to explain his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n717/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0717-0676"/> purposes more completely than before in an essay
                    on “Poetry as a Study.” In the same year he was persuaded to publish the <hi
                    rend="italic">The White Boe of Rylstone,</hi> written mainly eight years before.
                    In purely poetic charm the <hi rend="italic">White Doe</hi> ought to be ranked
                    among the most perfect of Wordsworth’s poems, the most completely successful
                    exhibition of his finest qualities; nowhere is the peculiar music of his verse
                    more happily sustained or more perfectly in harmony with the noble and tender
                    feeling which here springs as if from infinite depths, to flow round and subdue
                    the tragic agony of the incidents. But Jeffrey, who was much too busy a man to
                    enter into a vein of poetry so remote from common romantic sentiment, would have
                    none of the <hi rend="italic">White Doe:</hi> he pronounced it “the very worst
                    poem ever written,” and the public too readily endorsed his judgment. Two other
                    poems, with which Wordsworth made another appeal, were not more successful. <hi
                    rend="italic">Peter Bell,</hi> written in 1798, was published in 1819; and at
                    the instigation of Charles Lamb it was followed by <hi rend="italic">The
                    Waggoner,</hi> written in 1805. Both were mercilessly ridiculed and parodied.
                    These tales from humble life are written in Wordsworth’s most unconventional
                    style, and with them emphatically “not to sympathize is not to understand,” but
                    when they are read sympathetically they are felt to be written with the
                    spontaneity and freedom of the poet’s most inspired moments, although they are
                    not in his high serious vein.</p>
                <p>Meantime, the great design of <hi rend="italic">The Recluse</hi> languished. The
                    neglect of what Wordsworth himself conceived to be his best and most
                    characteristic work was not encouraging; and there was another reason why the
                    philosophical poem on man, nature, and society did not make progress. Again and
                    again in his poetry Wordsworth celebrates the value of constraint, and the
                    disadvantage of “too much liberty,” of “unchartered freedom.”<note

                    rend="italic">Nuns fret not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">, The Pass of

                    thought was impressed upon him by his own experience. There was “too much
                    liberty” in his vague scheme of a philosophical poem. He needed more of the
                    constraint of a definite form to stimulate his working powers to prosperous
                    vigour. The formlessness of the scheme prevented his ’working at it
                    continuously. Hence his “philosophy” was expressed in casual disconnected
                    sonnets, or in sonnets and other short poems connected by the simplest of all
                    links, sequence in time or place. He stumbled upon three or four such serial
                    ideas in the latter part of his life, and thus found beginning and end for
                    chains of considerable length, which may be regarded as fragments of the project
                    which he had not sufficient energy of constructive power to execute. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Sonnets on the River Duddon,</hi> written in 1820, follow the
                    river from its source to the sea, and form a partial embodiment of his
                    philosophy of nature. The <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Sonnets,</hi> written
                    in 1820-21, trace the history of the church from the Druids onwards, following
                    one of the great streams of human affairs, and exhibit part of his philosophy of
                    society. A tour on the Continent in 1820, a tour in Scotland in 1831, a tour on
                    the west coast in 1833, a tour in Italy in 1837, furnished him with other serial
                    forms, serving to connect miscellaneous reflections on man, nature, and society;
                    and his views on the punishment of death were strung together in still another
                    series in 1840. He sought relief from “the weight of too much liberty” in this
                    voluntary subjection to serial form, taking upon himself that</p>
                <p>“Constraint</p>
                <p>Whence oft invigorating transports flow That choice lacked courage to
                    bestow.”</p>
                <p>His resolute industry was productive of many wise, impressive, and charitable
                    reflexions, and many casual felicities of diction, but the poet very seldom
                    reached the highest level of his earlier inspirations.</p>
                <p>Wordsworth was appointed poet-laureate on the death of Southey in 1843. His only
                    official composition was an ode on the installation of the Prince Consort as
                    chancellor of Cambridge university in 1847. This was his last writing in verse.
                    He died at Rydal Mount after a short illness, on the 23d of April 1850, and was
                    buried in Grasmere churchyard.</p>
                <p>It was Wordsworth’s own desire that there should be no elaborate criticism of his
                    poetry. This desire has not been respected. We have already referred to Lamb’s
                    severely edited review of <hi rend="italic">The Excursion</hi> (1814), and to
                    Coleridge’s criticism in the <hi rend="italic">Biographia Literaria</hi> (1817).
                    This last, together with the enthusiastic and unreserved championship of Wilson
                    in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</hi> in a series of articles between
                    1819 and 1822 (see <hi rend="italic">Recreations of Christopher North"),</hi>
                    formed the turning point in Wordsworth’s reputation. From 1820 to 1830 De
                    Quincey says it was militant, from 1830 to 1840 triumphant. By 1850 there were
                    signs of reaction, but, though the language of criticism has become more
                    judicial, there has been no falling off in veneration for Wordsworth’s character
                    or appreciation of his best work. Among critics that are specially interesting
                    for various reasons we may mention De Quincey (<hi rend="italic">Works,</hi>
                    vols. ii. and v.), Sir Henry Taylor (<hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> vol. v.),
                    George Brimley <hi rend="italic">(Essays),</hi> Matthew Arnold (preface to <hi
                    rend="italic">Selection),</hi> Mr Swinburne <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Miscellanies),</hi> Mr F. W. H. Myers (“Men of Letters” series), and Mr Leslie
                    Stephen <hi rend="italic">(Hours in a Library,</hi> 3d series, “Wordsworth’s
                    Ethics ”).</p>
                <p>Wordsworth’s writings in prose have been collected by Mr Grosart (London, 1876).
                    This collection contains the previously unpublished <hi rend="italic">Apology
                    for a French Revolution,</hi> written in 1793, besides the scarce tract on the
                    <hi rend="italic">Convention of</hi><hi rend="italic">Cintra</hi> (1809) and the
                    political addresses <hi rend="italic">To the Freeholders of Westmoreland</hi>
                    (1818). The bulk of three volumes is made up by including letters, notes,
                    prefaces, &amp;c. Wordsworth’s <hi rend="italic">Guide to the Lakes</hi>
                    originally appeared in 1810 as an introduction to Wilkinson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Select Views,</hi> and was first published separately in 1822.</p>
                <p>The standard editions of Wordsworth are Moxon’s six-volume edition originally
                    settled by the poet himself in 1836-7, and Moxon’s single-volume double-column
                    edition sanctioned by the poet in 1845. A carefully annotated edition in nine
                    large volumes, by Prof. Knight, is in course of publication. It contains a
                    useful chronological table of the poems; and the hitherto unpublished part of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Recluse</hi> is promised for the ninth volume. Prof.
                    Knight’s book on <hi rend="italic">The English Lake District</hi> is also useful
                    to minute students of Wordsworth. (W. Μ.)</p>
