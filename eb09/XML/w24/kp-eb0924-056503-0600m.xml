                    634. When nearly fourteen years of age he was sent away from a harsh stepmother
                    to serve in King Oswy’s court, where he attracted the notice of the queen,
                    Eanfled.</p>

                <p>She, fostering his inclination for a religious life, placed him under the care of
                    an old noble, Cudda, who had betaken himself to a monastic life at Lindisfarne.
                    Later on Eanfled enabled him to visit Rome under the protection of Benedict
                    Biscop, the son of a Northumbrian, or rather Anglian, noble. At Lyons Wilfrid’s
                    pleasing features and quick intelligence made Dalfinus, or Aunemund, the
                    archbishop, desire to adopt him and marry him to his niece. Resisting his
                    offers, the youth went on to Rome, received the papal benediction, and then, in
                    accordance with his promise, returned to Lyons, where he stayed for three years,
                    till the murder of his patron <hi rend="italic">(1</hi> 656), whose fate he
                    would have shared had not his beauty stayed the hand of the executioners. On his
                    return home, Oswy’s son Alchfrid gave him a monastery at Ripon, and before long
                    Bishop Agilbert of Paris ordained him priest. He was probably already regarded
                    as the leading exponent of the Roman discipline in England when his speech at
                    the council of Whitby determined the overthrow of the Celtic party (664). About
                    a year later he was consecrated to the see of York (not in England, where
                    perhaps he could not find the fitting number of orthodox prelates, but at
                    Compiègne). On his return journey he narrowly escaped the pagan wreckers of
                    Sussex, and only reached his own country to find he had been supplanted in his
                    see. The rest of his life is a record of wandering and misfortune. For three
                    years (665-668) he ruled his monastery at Ripon in peace, occasionally, however,
                    exercising his episcopal functions in Mercia and Kent. On Archbishop Theodore’s
                    arrival (668) he was restored to his see, but only to be driven out through the
                    anger of King Egfrid’s queen (677). Theodore now divided Wilfrid’s large diocese
                    into three; and the aggrieved prelate went to lay his case before the bishop of
                    Rome. On his way he narrowly escaped murder at the hands of foreign princes,
                    whom his own countrymen had stirred up against him. A synod held at Rome under
                    Agatho (?679) ordained his restitution; but even a papal decision could not
                    prevent his being cast into prison on his return home. When released he wandered
                    first to Mercia, whence Egfrid once more drove him forth to Sussex. Here he
                    rescued the pagan folk from an impending famine, and established a bishop’s see
                    at Selsea. After Egfrid’s death (20th May 685) Wilfrid was restored to York and
                    Ripon (686-687). He was once more driven out in 691- 692, and after appealing to
                    Rome in person obtained another decision in his favour (703-704). Despite the
                    intercession of Berghtwald, archbishop of Canterbury, Egbert’s brother Aldfrid
                    refused to admit the aged prelate into his kingdom till his last illness (705).
                    This year or the next a council was held near the river Nidd, the papal letters
                    were read, and, despite the opposition of the bishops, Wilfrid once more
                    received the abbeys of Ripon and Hexham. Not long after he died at Oundle
                    (Northamptonshire) as he was going on a visit to Ceolred, king of Mercia (709).
                    He was buried at Ripon, whence, according to Eadmer, his bones were afterwards
                    removed to Canterbury.</p>
                <p>Wilfrid’s is a memorable name in English history, not only because of the large
                    part he played in supplanting the Celtic discipline and in establishing a
                    precedent of appeal to papal authority, but also by reason of his services to
                    architecture and learning. At York he renewed Paulinus’s old church, roofing it
                    with lead and furnishing it with glass windows; at Ripon he built an entirely
                    new basilica with columns and porches; at Hexham in honour of St Andrew he
                    reared a still nobler church, over which Eddius grows eloquent. In the early
                    days of his bishopric he used to travel about his diocese attended by a little
                    troop of skilled masons. He seems to have also reformed the method of conducting
                    the divine services by the aid of his skilled chanters, Aedde and Aeonan, and to
                    have established or renewed the rule of St Benedict in the monasteries. On each
                    visit to Rome it was bis delight to collect relics for his native land; and to
                    his favourite basilica at Ripon he gave a bookcase wrought in gold and precious
                    stones, besides a splendid copy of the Gospels. As a missionary his success was
                    extraordinary, and even on his way to Rome in 679 he found time to convert the
                    Frisian king, Ald-gislus, though the latter had been bribed to slay him by the
                    offer of “a measure of gold solidi.” Later in life he ordained Suidbert as the
                    first bishop of Frisia. In earlier years his influence was so great that he
                    supplied the Franks with one of their later Merovingian kings, Dagobert II.</p>
                <p>wilfrid’s life was written shortly after his death by Eddius at the request of
                    Acea, his successor at Hexham, and Tatbert, abbot of Ripon,—both intimate
                    friends of the great bishop. Other lives were written by Frithegode in the 10th,
                    by Folcard in the llth, and by Eadmer early in the 12th century. The dates have
                    to be supplied mainly from Bede’s <hi rend="italic">Hist. Ecd.,</hi> iii. c. 25,
                    &amp;c., 13, &amp;c., V. 19, &amp;c. All the lives are printed in Raine’s <hi
