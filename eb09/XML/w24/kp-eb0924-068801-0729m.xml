                <p><label type="entry">WREN</label> (Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">Wraenna</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">W</hi><hi rend="italic">renne,</hi> Icelandic <hi
                    rend="italic">Pindill),</hi> the well-known little brown bird—with its short
                    tail, cocked on high—inquisitive and familiar, that braves the winter of the
                    British Islands and even that of the European continent, and, except in the
                    hardest of frosts, will daily sing its spirit-stirring strain. It is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Motacilla</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sylvia troglodytes</hi> of the
                    earlier systematists, and the <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">parvulus,</hi><hi rend="italic">europaeus,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">vulgaris</hi> of most later writers, save a few who (ignoring not
                    only common sense but also the accepted rules of scientific nomenclature), by an
                    utterly mistaken view of Vieillot’s intention in establishing the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Troglodytes,</hi> reserve that term for some American
                    species—which can hardly be generically separated from the European form—and
                    have attempted to fix on the latter the generic term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anorthura,</hi> which is its strict equivalent and was proposed by Rennie on
                    grounds that are wholly inadmissible.</p>
                <p>The interest taken in this bird throughout all European countries is scarcely
                    exceeded by that taken in any other, and, though in Britain comparatively few
                    vernacular names have been applied to it, two of them—“Jenny” or <hi
                    rend="superscript"> u</hi> Kitty-Wren”—are terms of endearment. Μ. Rolland
                    records no fewer than 139 local names for it in France; and Italy, Germany, and
                    other lands are only less prolific. Many of these carry on the old belief that
                    the Wren was the King of Birds, a belief connected with the fable that on one
                    occasion the fowls of the air in general assembly resolved to choose for their
                    leader that one of them which should mount highest. This the Eagle seemed to do,
                    and all were ready to accept his rule, when a loud burst of song was heard, and
                    perched upon him was seen the exultant Wren, which unseen and unfelt had been
                    borne aloft by the giant. The curious association of this bird with the Feast of
                    the Three Kings, on which day in South Wales, or, in Ireland and in the south of
                    France, on or about Christmas Day, it was customary for men and boys to “hunt
                    the Wren,” addressing it in a song as “the King of Birds,” is very remarkable,
                    and has never yet been explained.</p>
                <p>The Wren hardly needs description here, and its domed nest, apparently so
                    needlessly large for the size of the bird, is a well-known object, for it is
                    built with uncommon care, and often (though certainly not always) in such a
                    fashion as to assimilate its exterior to its surroundings and so to escape
                    observation. Very curious too is the equally unaccountable fact, that near any
                    occupied nest may generally be found another nest, or more than one, of
                    imperfect construction. The widespread belief concerning these unfinished
                    fabrics is implied by their common name of “cocks’ nests,” but evidence to that
                    effect is not forthcoming. The breeding-habits of the Wren were most closely
                    studied and accurately reported by Mr Weir to Macgillivray <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Brit. Birds,</hi> iii. pp. 23-30) in a way that leads every ornithologist to
                    wish that the same care might be bestowed on other kinds of birds.</p>
                <p>The range of the Wren in Europe<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Much interest has lately attached to the discovery,
                    announced by Mr Seebohm <hi rend="italic">{Zoologist,</hi> 1884, p. 333), that
                    the Wren, for 200 years and upwards, known to inhabit St Kilda differed in hue
                    from that of the other British Islands and of the continent of Europe, and it
                    has by him been described as a distinct species, <hi rend="italic">T.
                    hirtensis.</hi> It had for more than twenty years been known that the Wren of
                    the Faeroes and Iceland deserved separation from the ordinary <hi rend="italic"
                    >Τ.</hi><hi rend="italic">parvulus,</hi> by being larger, and especially by
                    having larger and stouter feet. It is the <hi rend="italic">T. borealis</hi> of
                    Fischer <hi rend="italic">{Jσurη.</hi><hi rend="italic">für Ornithologie,</hi>
                    1861, p. 14, pl. i. ).</p></note> is very extensive, though it seems to stop
                    short of the Arctic Circle; but it occurs in Algeria, Madeira, and, according to
                    Bolle, in the Canaries. It also inhabits Palestine. Further to the eastward its
                    limits are difficult to trace, because they inosculate with those of a
                    considerable number of local races or species. As might be expected, the form
                    inhabiting Japan, <hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi rend="italic">fumigatus,</hi>
                    seems to be justifiably deemed a species. In North America, <hi rend="italic">T.
                    alascensis</hi> occurs in the extreme north-west, and is replaced further to the
                    southward by <hi rend="italic">T. pacificus.</hi> Eastward of the Rocky
                    Mountains, the form is <hi rend="italic">T. hyemalis—</hi> the well-known
                    Winter-Wren of Canada and the United States. The number of species of Wrens
                    inhabiting North America is, however, very considerable: but authorities are by
                    no means agreed as to how many should be reckoned valid, and they have been
                    segregated into six or seven genera. Here the House-Wren, <hi rend="italic">T.
                    domesticus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">aedon,</hi> can alone be mentioned. It is a
                    very common summervisitant to most parts of the Eastern States, and where it
                    occurs is of a very familiar disposition, entering into the closest relations
                    with those that cultivate its acquaintance. It is represented in the West by <hi
                    rend="italic">T. parkmaηni.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Troglodytidae,</hi> if they are to be regarded as forming a
                    distinct Family, predominate in the New World, no fewer than 60 species being
                    enumerated in the <hi rend="italic">Nomenclator</hi> of Messrs Sclater and
                    Salvin as belonging to the Neotropical Region. But the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troglodytidae</hi> by no means contain all the birds to which the name “Wren”
                    is applied. Several of the <hi rend="italic">Sylviidae (cf.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Warbler)</hi> bear it, especially the beautiful little
                    Golden-crested Wren (c∕. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kinglet)</hi> and the group
                    commonly known in Britain as “Willow-Wrens ”— forming the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Phylloscopus.</hi> Three of these are habitual summer-visitants,
                    which differ much more in their manners than in their look. The largest, usually
                    called the Wood-Wren, <hi rend="italic">P. sibilatrix,</hi> is more abundant in
                    the north than in the south of England, and chiefly frequents woods of oak or
                    beech. It has a loud and very peculiar song, like the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >twee,</hi> sounded very long, and repeated several times in succession—at first
                    slowly, but afterwards more quickly, and near the end accompanied by a peculiar
                    quivering of the wings, while at uncertain intervals comes another note, which
                    has been syllabled as <hi rend="italic">chea,</hi> uttered about three times in
                    succession. The Willow-Wren proper, <hi rend="italic">P. trochilus,</hi> is in
                    many parts of Great Britain the commonest summer-bird, and is the most generally
                    dispersed. In spring its joyous burst of song is repeated time after time, until
                    all around thrills with the loud and merry chorus, and yet never tires the ear.
                    The restless but graceful activity of the bird, as it flits from twig to twig,
                    adds to the charm of its appearance, which Hewitson so well appreciated. The
                    third species, <hi rend="italic">P. collybita</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >minor</hi> (frequently but most wrongly called <hi rend="italic">Sylvia
                    rufa</hi> or <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">rufus),</hi> commonly
                    known as the Chiffchaff, from the peculiarity of its constantly repeated
                    two-noted cry, is very numerous in the southern and western part of England, but
                    seems to be scarcer northward. These three species make their nest upon or very
                    close to the <pb break="no"

                    they are commonly called “Oven-birds,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>By ornithologists this name is given to a wholly distinct
                    group— not even belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Oscines—</hi> the <hi

                    Tracheophonine Birds, some of which build marvellous nests of mud spherical in
                    form. For their habits see Darwin <hi rend="italic">(Jour. of Researches,</hi>

                    structure, “Hay-jacks,” a name common to the <hi rend="smallcaps">White-Throat
                    (ç.v.)</hi> and its allies.</p>
                <p>To return, however, to the <hi rend="italic">Troglodytidae</hi> or true Wrens. If
                    it cannot be said that they form a peculiar Family, it would be rather to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sylviidae</hi> that they and the <hi rend="italic">Certhvidae
                    (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Tree-Creeper)</hi> should be assigned, and they
                    seem to be very unfitly placed among the <hi rend="italic">Timeliidae,</hi> as
                    has lately been done <hi rend="italic">{Cat. B. Brik Museum,</hi> vi. p. 1).
                    These last, so far as any definition can be given of them, belong to the
                    Ethiopian and Indian Regions, while the predominance of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troglodytidae</hi> in the Neotropical Region, as already remarked, is very
                    obvious. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
