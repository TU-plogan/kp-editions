                    province of Chĕ-keang, and one of the ports opened by treaty to foreign trade,
                    is situated (28° 1' N. lat. and 120° 31' E. long.) on the south bank of the
                    river Gow, about 20 miles from the sea. The site is said to have been chosen by
                    Kwo P’oh (276-324 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> a celebrated antiquary who
                    recognized in the adjacent mountain peaks a correspondence with the stars in the
                    constellation of the Great Bear, from which circumstance the town was first
                    known as the Tow, or Great Bear, city. Subsequently, however, the appearance in
                    its vicinity of a white deer carrying a flower in its mouth was deemed to be so
                    favourable an omen as to more than justify the change of its name to Lull, or
                    Deer, city. Its present name, which signifies the “mild district,” and which is
                    correctly descriptive of the climate, though not of the inhabitants, was given
                    to it during the last dynasty (1368-1644). The walls, which were built in the
                    10th century, are about 6 miles in circumference, 35 feet in height, and 12 feet
                    broad at the top. The gates, seven in number, were put up in 1598. Wăn-chow is
                    about 1563 miles by road from Peking and 600 from Hankow. The country in the
                    neighbourhood of the town is hilly and pretty, while opposite the north-west <pb

                    object. The island is, however, more beautiful than healthy. The port, which was
                    opened to foreign trade in 1876, has not justified the great expectations which
                    were formed of its probable success as a commercial centre.</p>
                <p>In 1886 the imports (excluding treasure) were valued at £118,710, and the exports
                    at £25,751; 44 vessels entered, of which one only was British, and 45 cleared. A
                    noticeable feature in the year’s return is the falling off in the quantity of
                    opium imported,—only 25 piculs, 62 per cent. less than the average of the
                    previous three years. The principal item of import is cotton goods, which showed
                    an increase of 12 per cent. over the same average. Kerosene oil, matches,
                    window-glass, sugar, dates, and old iron are among the chief goods imported;
                    while among the exports kittysols or umbrellas, timber, oranges, and tea figure
                    prominently.</p>
