                    Christi.</hi> At Deventer, where the best traditions of the 14th-century
                    mysticism were still cultivated, Wessel imbibed that earnest devotional
                    mysticism which was the basis of his theology and which drew him irresistibly,
                    after a busy life, to spend his last days among the Friends of God in the Low
                    Countries. From Deventer he went to Cologne to be taught the Thomist theology,
                    which was fondly cherished in that famous Dominican school; and there he learnt
                    realism, which, although he afterwards became a nominalist in metaphysics,
                    always coloured his theology. At Cologne too he came in contact with humanism.
                    He learnt Greek and Hebrew from monks who, it is said, had been driven out of
                    Greece. The Thomist theology sent him to study Augustine, and his Greek reading
                    led him to Plato, and from both of these great thinkers he learnt much that went
                    to enrich his own theological system. The echoes of the din raised in Paris by
                    the disputes between the realists and the nominalists reached Wessel in Cologne,
                    and a desire to mingle in the fray, or perhaps to learn on which side truth was,
                    induced him to go to Paris, where he remained sixteen years, scholar and
                    teacher. There he eventually took the nominalist side, prompted as much by his
                    mystical anti-ecclesiastical tendencies as from any metaphysical insight; for
                    the nominalists were then the anti-papal party. A desire to know more about
                    humanism sent him to Rome, where we find him in 1470 the intimate friend of
                    Italian scholars and under the protection of Cardinals Bessarion and Della
                    Rovere (afterwards Pope Sixtus IV.). It is said that Sixtus would have gladly
                    made Wessel a bishop, but that he had no desire for any ecclesiastical
                    preferment. From Rome he returned to Paris, and speedily became a famous
                    teacher, gathering round him a band of enthusiastic young students, among whom
                    was Reuchlin. As old age approached he came to have a growing dislike to the
                    wordy theological strife which surrounded him, and turned away from that
                    university discipline, “non studia sacrarum literarum sed studiorum commixtae
                    corruptiones.” After thirty years of academic life he went back to his native
                    Groningen, and spent the rest of his life partly as director in a nuns’ cloister
                    there and partly in the convent of St Agnes at Zwolle. He was welcomed as the
                    most renowned scholar of his time, and it was fabled that he had travelled
                    through all lands, Egypt as well as Greece, gathering everywhere the fruits of
                    all sciences—“a man of rare erudition,” says the title page of the first edition
                    of his collected works, “who in the shadow of papal darkness was called the
                    light of the world.” His remaining years were spent amid a circle of warm
                    admirers, friends, and disciples, to whom he imparted the mystical theology, the
                    devotion to higher learning, and the deep devotional spirit which characterized
                    his own life. He died on October 4, 1489, with the confession on his lips, “I
                    know only Jesus the crucified.” He is buried in the middle of the choir of the
                    church of the “Geestlichen Maegden,” whose director he had been.</p>
                <p>Wessel has been called one of the “reformers before the Reformation,” and the
                    title is a true one if by it is meant a man of deeply spiritual life, who
                    protested against the growing paganizing of the papacy, the superstitious and
                    magical uses of the sacraments, the authority of ecclesiastical tradition, and
                    that tendency in later scholastic theology to lay greater stress in a doctrine
                    of justification upon the instrumentality of the human will than on the
                    objective work of Christ for man’s salvation. His own theology was, however,
                    essentially mediaeval in type, and he never grasped that experimental thought of
                    justification on which Reformation theology rests.</p>
