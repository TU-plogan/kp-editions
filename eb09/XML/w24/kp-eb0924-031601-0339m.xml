                    rend="italic">Uuagtale,</hi> Turner, 1544, p. 53), the little bird that delights
                    us equally by its neat coloration, its slender form, its nimble actions, and its
                    sprightly notes. Since it is so generally dispersed, especially in summer,
                    throughout the British Islands, it seems to need no further description.</p>
                <p>The Pied Wagtail of authors, it is the <hi rend="italic">Motacilla lugubris</hi>
                    of modern ornithology, or <hi rend="italic">Μ. yarrelli</hi> of some writers,
                    and has for its very near ally—if indeed it be not considered merely a local
                    race or subspecies of—the <hi rend="italic">Μ. alba</hi> of Linnaeus, which has
                    a wide range in Europe, Asia, and Africa, visiting England almost yearly, and
                    chiefly differing from the ordinary British form in its lightercoloured
                    tints,—the cock especially having a clear grey instead of a black back. Eleven
                    other more or less nearly-allied species are recognized by Mr Sharpe (<hi
                    rend="italic">Cat. B. Brit. Museum, x.</hi> pp. 456-496), who has laboriously
                    treated the complicated synonymy of this group of birds. Eight of these are
                    natives of Asia, several of them wintering in India, and one, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Μ. ocularis,</hi> even occasionally reaching the west coast of North America,
                    while the rest are confined to Africa. No colours but black, grey, or white
                    enter into the plumage of any of the foregoing; but in the species peculiar to
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n340/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0340-0317"/> Madagascar, <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    flaviventris,</hi> as well as in that which it much resembles, the so-called
                    Grey Wagtail of Britain, <hi rend="italic">Μ. melanope (Μ. boarula</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">sulphurea</hi> of some authors), a great part of the lower surface
                    is yellow. The species last mentioned is one of the most graceful of birds, and
                    though having a very wide range in the world at large is curiously local in its
                    distribution in Britain, being almost wholly confined in the breeding-season to
                    the neighbourhood of rocky streams in the west and north, and a line drawn from
                    the Start Point, slightly curving to round the Derbyshire hills, and ending at
                    the mouth of the Tees, will, it is believed, mark off its breeding-range in
                    England. Then there is a section which by some systematists has been raised to
                    the rank of a genus, <hi rend="italic">Budytes,</hi> containing the Wagtails in
                    which yellow takes a still more prominent part in their coloration. Of these, 8
                    species, besides several subspecies, are recognized by Mr Sharpe <hi
                    rend="italic">(ut supra,</hi> pp. 503-532). One of these is the common Yellow
                    Wagtail of England, <hi rend="italic">Μ. raii</hi> (by some mistakenly called
                    <hi rend="italic">Μ. campestris),</hi> which, though very generally distributed
                    throughout the country, is much less numerous than the Pied Wagtail, and more
                    addicted to wet meadows; but, just as <hi rend="italic">Μ. lugubris</hi> is
                    regarded by some as a local form of the more widely-ranging <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    alba,</hi> so does <hi rend="italic">Μ. raii</hi> hold the same relation to <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. flaνa,</hi> the Blue-headed Wagtail, which has a very extensive
                    distribution in the Old World, and even crosses the Pacific to Alaska,
                    presenting also a great number of varieties or races (most of which are treated
                    by Mr Sharpe as real species) differing from each other chiefly, if not solely,
                    in the colour of the head, a character which in this section can hardly be
                    deemed specific, while their geographical range intersects and inosculates in a
                    most puzzling manner. Much credit is due to the author just named for the
                    enormous trouble he has taken, after study of a vast series of specimens, to
                    clear up the questions herein involved; but it will probably be long before
                    ornithologists can agree on many of the disputed points, and it is certain that
                    the last word has by no means been spoken concerning them.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Motacilla</hi> (an exact rendering of the English
                    “Wagtail,” the Dutch <hi rend="italic">Kwikstaart,</hi> the Italian <hi
                    rend="italic">Codatremola</hi> and other similar words), which, as originally
                    founded by Linnaeus, contained nearly all the “soft-billed” birds of early
                    English ornithologists, was restricted by various authors in succession,
                    following the example set by Scopoli in 1769, until none but the Wagtails
                    remained in it. Most of the rest are now commonly classed as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sylviidae</hi> (<hi rend="italic">cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Warbler),</hi>
                    while the Wagtails with the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pipits</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                    >q.v.)</hi> constitute the Family <hi rend="italic">Motacillidae.</hi><hi
