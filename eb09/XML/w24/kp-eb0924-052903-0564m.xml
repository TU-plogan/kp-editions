                    most distinguished in the university. Copleston, afterwards bishop of Llandaff,
                    was a college tutor when Whately entered, and had a marked influence upon the
                    younger man. In their long walks together round Oxford they discussed and worked
                    out much that was afterwards embodied in Whately’s <hi rend="italic">Logic.</hi>
                    Whately took a double second-class in honours in 1808, afterwards gaining the
                    prize for the English essay, and in 1811 he was elected fellow of Oriel. He
                    continued to reside at Oxford as a private tutor, and in 1814 took holy orders.
                    The Oriel common-room at that time was full of intellectual life, destined to
                    discharge itself in very varied channels. Besides Copleston and Whately,
                    Davison, Arnold, Keble, and Hawkins were among the fellows, and Newman and Pusey
                    were added about the time of Whately’s leaving Oxford. Newman has put on record
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Apologia</hi> his indebtedness to Whately, who, he
                    says, opened his mind and taught him to think and to use his reason. They soon
                    became separated; but between Arnold and Whately there was a warm friendship
                    till the death of the former. It was at this time that Whately wrote his
                    celebrated tract, <hi rend="italic">Historic Doubts relative to Napoleon
                    Bonaparte,</hi> a very clever <hi rend="italic">jeu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d'esprit</hi> directed against excessive scepticism as applied to the Gospel
                    history. In 1820 Whately made the acquaintance of Elizabeth Pope, to whom he was
                    married in July of the following year. After his marriage he first settled in
                    Oxford, where he continued to take pupils, and in 1822 he was appointed Bampton
                    lecturer. The lectures, <hi rend="italic">On the Use and Abuse of Party Spirit
                    in Matters of Religion,</hi> were published in the same year, and were followed
                    by a volume of <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> in 1823.. In August 1823 he
                    removed to Halesworth in Suffolk, a country living to which he had been
                    presented. Here two years were spent in vigorous parish work; but the damp
                    climate nearly proved fatal to Mrs Whately, and, when he was appointed in 1825
                    to the principalship of St Alban Hall, he returned with his family to Oxford. In
                    the same year he took the degree of doctor of divinity. At St Alban Hall Whately
                    found much to reform, and he left it a different place. In 1825 he published a
                    series of <hi rend="italic">Essays on Some of the Peculiarities of the Christian
                    Religion,</hi> followed in 1828 by a second series <hi rend="italic">On Some of
                    the Difficulties in the Writings of St Paul,</hi> and in 1830 by a third <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Errors of Romanism traced to their Origin in Human
                    Nature.</hi> He also published in 1829 a volume of his Halesworth sermons, under
                    the title <hi rend="italic">A View of the Scripture Revelations concerning a
                    Future</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n565/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0565-0530"/><hi rend="italic">State.</hi> It was while he was
                    at St Alban Hall (1826) that the work appeared which is perhaps most closely
                    associated with his name,—his treatise on <hi rend="italic">Logic,</hi>
                    originally contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Metropolitana.</hi> By this work, which gave a great impetus to
                    the study of logic not only in Oxford but throughout Great Britain, Whately has
                    been known to generation after generation of students; and, though it is no
                    longer so much in use, the qualities of the book make much of it as admirable
                    now as when it was written. Whately swept the webs of scholasticism from the
                    subject, and raised the study to a new level. A similar treatise on <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhetoric,</hi> also contributed to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopaedia,</hi> appeared in 1828. In 1829 Whately was elected to the
                    professorship of political economy at Oxford in succession to Senior. In writing
                    to a friend he gives the following characteristic reason for accepting the
                    appointment: “It seems to me that before long political economists of some sort
                    will govern the world. Now the antiChristians are striving hard to have this
                    science to themselves, and to interweave it with their notions; and, if these
                    efforts are not met, the rising generation will be at the mercy of these men.”
                    It was a subject admirably suited to his lucid, practical intellect; but his
                    tenure of office was cut short by his appointment to the archbishopric of Dublin
                    in 1831. He published only one course of <hi rend="italic">Introductory
                    Lectures</hi> (1831), in which he sought to establish the true scope of the
                    science; but one of his first acts on going to Dublin was to endow a chair of
                    political economy in Trinity College out of his private purse. Whately’s
                    appointment by Lord Grey to the see of Dublin came as a great surprise to
                    everybody, for though a decided Liberal Whately had from the beginning stood
                    aloof from all political parties, and ecclesiastically his position was that of
                    an Ishmaelite fighting for his own hand. The Evangelicals regarded him as a
                    dangerous latitudinarian on the ground of his views on Catholic emancipation,
                    the Sabbath question, the doctrine of election, and certain quasi-Sabellian
                    opinions he was supposed to hold about the character and attributes of Christ,
                    while his view of the church was diametrically opposed to that of the High
                    Church party, and from the beginning he was the determined opponent of what was
                    afterwards called the Tractarian movement. The appointment was challenged in the
                    House of Lords, but without success. In Ireland it was immensely unpopular among
                    the Protestants, both for the reasons just mentioned and as being the
                    appointment of an Englishman and a Whig. Whately’s blunt outspokenness and his
                    “want of conciliating manners,” which even his friends admit, prevented him from
                    ever completely eradicating these prejudices; and the amount of opposition he
                    met with from his own clergy would have daunted a man less resolute than the new
                    archbishop in the performance of what he conceived to be his duty. He ran
                    counter to their most cherished prejudices 4rom the first by connecting himself
                    prominently with the attempt to establish a national and unsectarian system of
                    education. He enforced strict discipline in his diocese, where it had been long
                    unknown; and he published an unanswerable, and all the more unpalatable,
                    statement of his views on the Sabbath <hi rend="italic">(Thoughts on the
                    Sabbath,</hi> 1832). The archbishopric of Dublin at that time—just after the
                    passing of the Catholic Emancipation Act, and in the midst of a general refusal
                    to pay tithes—was anything but a bed of roses. Whately spoke of his appointment
                    as “a call to the helm of a crazy ship in a storm,” and one which nothing but an
                    overpowering sense of duty could have induced him to accept. He took a small
                    country place at Redesdale, four miles out of Dublin, where he could enjoy his
                    favourite relaxation of gardening. Here his life was one of indefatigable
                    industry. Questions of tithes, reform of the Irish Church, reform of the Irish
                    Poor Laws, and, in particular, the organization of national education occupied
                    much of his time. But he found leisure for the discussion of other public
                    questions, for example, the subject of transportation and the general question
                    of secondary punishments, in which he was strongly interested and on which he
                    repeatedly published. In 1837 he wrote his well-known handbook of <hi
                    rend="italic">Christian Evidences,</hi> which was translated during his lifetime
                    into more than a dozen languages. At a later period he also wrote, in a similar
                    form, <hi rend="italic">Easy Lessons on Reasoning,</hi> on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Morals,</hi> on <hi rend="italic">Mind,</hi> and on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >British Constitution.</hi> He attached much importance himself to these
                    unpretending but useful books. Among other works may be mentioned <hi
                    rend="italic">Charges and Tracts</hi> (1836), <hi rend="italic">Essays on some
                    of the Dangers to Christian Faith</hi> (1839), <hi rend="italic">The Kingdom of
                    Christ</hi> (1841). He also edited Bacon’s <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi>
                    Paley’s <hi rend="italic">Evidences,</hi> and Paley’s <hi rend="italic">Moral
                    Philosophy.</hi> His cherished scheme of unsectarian religious instruction for
                    Protestants and Catholics alike was carried out for a number of years with a
                    measure of success, a selection of Scripture lessons and of Christian evidences
                    by the archbishop himself being actually used in the model schools. But in 1852
                    the scheme broke down through the opposition of the new Catholic archbishop of
                    Dublin, and Whately felt himself constrained to withdraw from the Education
                    Board. This was felt by him as a grievous disappointment. From the beginning
                    Whately was a keen-sighted observer of the condition of Ireland question, and
                    gave much offence by openly supporting the state endowment of the Catholic
                    clergy as a measure of justice. During the terrible years of 1846 and 1847 the
                    archbishop and his family were unwearied in their efforts to alleviate the
                    miseries of the people. Whately’s private beneficence was not confined, however,
                    to this period. Though so rigid a political economist that he could boast of
                    never having given a penny to a beggar, his charities were princely, and
                    oftenest bestowed without the knowledge of his nearest friends. From 1856
                    onwards symptoms of decline began to manifest themselves in a paralytic
                    affection of the left side, which kept his arm in a constant tremor. In 1860 he
                    lost his wife and a much-loved daughter. Still he continued the active discharge
                    of his public duties till the summer of 1863, when he was prostrated by an ulcer
                    in the leg, and after several months of acute suffering he died on 8th October
                    1863. In the following year his daughter published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Miscellaneous Remains</hi> from his commonplace book and in 1866 his <hi
                    rend="italic">Life and Correspondence</hi> in two volumes. The loosely compiled
                    <hi rend="italic">Anecdotal Memoirs of Archbishop Whately,</hi> by W. J.
                    Fitzpatrick (1864), may be used (with discretion) as enlivening Miss Whately’s
                    picture of her father.</p>
                <p>Few eminent men have had more anecdotes and witty sayings attributed to them than
                    Whately. He was a great talker, much addicted in early life to argument, in
                    which he used others as instruments on which to hammer out his own views, and as
                    he advanced in life much given to didactic monologue. But this didactic tendency
                    was accompanied almost to the last by an intensely youthful delight in
                    logic-chopping. At his monthly dinners to his clergy the archbishop would
                    indulge even to an undignified extent in a species of logical horse-play. To
                    this were added a keen wit, whose sharp edge often inflicted wounds never
                    deliberately intended by the speaker, and a wholly uncontrollable love of
                    punning. Whately often offended people by the extreme unconvention-alitý of his
                    manners. When at Oxford his white hat, rough white coat, and huge white dog
                    earned for him the sobriquet of the White Bear, and he outraged the conventions
                    of the place by exhibiting the exploits of his climbing dog in Christchurch
                    Meadow. This free and easy manner clung to him in later life and accompanied him
                    into the Dublin drawing-rooms, where it was often exaggerated by absence of
                    mind. His fondness for dogs and animals generally was a passion through life,
                    and he was also very fond of children, who, with their usual discrimination,
                    gave him their confidence in return. He λvas an adept in various savage sports,
                    more especially in throwing the boomerang.</p>

                <p>Whately was a man loved and reverenced by a narrow circle, hated, or at least
                    distrusted, by a much larger number. This was largely owing to his own
                    intellectual characteristics; for, with a remarkably fair and lucid mind, his
                    sympathies were narrow, and by his blunt outspokenness on points of difference
                    he alienated many. With no mystical fibre in his own constitution, the
                    Tractarian movement was incomprehensible to him, and was the object of his
                    bitter dislike and contempt. The doctrines of the Low Church party seemed to him
                    to be almost equally tinged with superstition. In short, it is admitted even by
                    his admirers that he had a tendency to depreciate those minds which could not
                    rest content with his own “common-sense” view of Christianity. Seeing so clearly
                    himself, he could not believe that there might be things which he could not see.
                    Though a great logician, there was nothing philosophical or speculative about
                    his mind, and he took a practical, almost business-like view of Christianity,
                    which seemed to High Churchmen and Evangelicals alike little better than
                    Rationalism. In this they did Whately less than justice, for his belief in
                    Christianity as understood by himself was thoroughly genuine, and his religion
                    was to him a real thing. But he may be said to have continued into our own times
                    the typical Christianity of the 18th century—the Christianity of the theologians
                    who went out to fight the Rationalists with their own weapons. It is to Whately
                    essentially a belief in certain matters of fact, to be accepted or rejected
                    after an examination of “evidences.” Hence his endeavour always is to convince
                    the logical faculty, and his Christianity inevitably appears as a thing of the
                    intellect rather than of the heart. Whately himself was well aware that he was
                    out of harmony with the general tendency of his time, and even Broad Church
                    theology has in general proceeded since upon other lines than his. Nevertheless,
                    though in no sense a fruitful or suggestive mind, his clear and massive
                    intellect inspired general respect, and his books well repay reading by the
                    shrewdness of their observation, the acuteness of the reasoning, the faculty of
                    telling illustration, and the uniform excellence of style. Whately’s qualities
                    are exhibited at their best in his <hi rend="italic">Logic,</hi> which is, as it
                    were, the quintessence of the views which he afterwards applied to different
                    subjects. He has written nothing better than the luminous Appendix to this work
                    on “Ambiguous Terms.” (A. SE.)</p>
