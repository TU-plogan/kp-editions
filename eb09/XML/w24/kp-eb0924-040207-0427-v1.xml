                    water is of the utmost importance for the healthiness of towns. When the
                    population of a district is scattered it is possible to supply individual wants
                    by means of streams, springs, or shallow wells; but when a number of people are
                    congregated within the limited area of a town the natural supply of water in
                    this area is liable to be insufficient, and is also in danger of being
                    contaminated by sewage and house refuse. Accordingly, works for the collection,
                    storage, purification, and distribution of water are indispensable necessities
                    in towns, for the preservation of health and the promotion of cleanliness. The
                    remains of aqueducts near Rome and at other places (see <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    undertaken many centuries ago; and water for irrigation and other purposes has
                    for ages been stored, in the rainy season, in tanks by the natives of India.
                    Artificial provisions for the supply of water were, however, entirely neglected
                    in Europe during the Middle Ages, and the colossal works of earlier times were
                    allowed to fall into decay; and most of the present systems of water-supply are
                    of comparatively modern date.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Origin of Supply.</hi><hi rend="italic">Rainfall.—</hi> All
                    supplies of fresh water come primarily from the clouds, though portions may
                    eventually be drawn from the bowels of the earth. Water when distilled is
                    obtained in its purest form; and the heat of the sun is continually drawing up
                    large quantities of moisture from sea and land, forming clouds which return it
                    as rain to the earth. Some of the rain is quickly evaporated from the surface of
                    the earth, and returned to the clouds; some sinks into the ground to feed
                    springs and underground stores of water; and some passes into streams and
                    rivers, whence it flows into the sea, from which the greater portion of the rain
                    is derived. The available water-supply of any district, accordingly, principally
                    depends on the rainfall of the locality and the extent of the gathering ground.
                    The rainfall varies greatly in different places, and at different periods of the
                    year (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology);</hi> and, in England alone, the
                    average annual rainfall at the Stye, the wettest part of the lake district in
                    Cumberland, is about eight times the rainfall at Hunstanton, the driest locality
                    in Norfolk. The rainfall, moreover, varies from year to year; and the driest
                    years must be taken into consideration in estimating the available
                    water-supply.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Evaporation.—</hi> The proportion of the rainfall which is
                    actually serviceable for water-supply depends greatly upon the season of the
                    year in which the rain falls; for evaporation is very active in the hot season,
                    whereas in the cold season its influence is slight. Accordingly, for
                    hydrological purposes, the year may be divided into two seasons in the latitudes
                    of the British Isles,—the warm season, extending from the beginning of May to
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n428/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0428-0403"/> end of October, and the cold season,
                    embracing the other half of the year. Comparatively little effect is produced by
                    variations in the amount of rain in the warm season, except in extreme cases,
                    owing to the large proportion drawn off by evaporation, whereas the rainfall
                    during the cold season is of the utmost importance for replenishing the sources
                    of supply which have been drained during the summer. The period of the year,
                    therefore, in which the rain falls is of more consequence than the total amount
                    in the year; and a drought is much more likely to result from a dry winter than
                    from a dry summer. Any deficiency in the supply is generally felt towards the
                    close of the warm season, when the reserves of water, furnished by the rains of
                    the preceding cold season, have been reduced to their lowest level by the
                    demands of the summer.</p>
                <p>Other circumstances also modify the influence of evaporation. Rain descending in
                    a heavy continuous fall, by sinking into the ground or escaping into the
                    watercourses, is less exposed to diminution by evaporation than several separate
                    showers of rain, equivalent in total volume, but spread over a longer period.
                    Forests and vegetation shelter the ground from the influence of evaporation; and
                    thereby, in spite of abstracting some of the moisture for their own
                    requirements, they augment the proportion of available rainfall. The nature and
                    slope of the surface stratum, moreover, notably affect the loss from
                    evaporation. Rain falling on an impermeable stratum is almost wholly evaporated
                    in hot weather, when the surface is flat; but it flows off from a steep slope
                    before evaporation can produce its full effect. Rain readily sinks into a porous
                    stratum; and when a depth of three or four feet below the surface is reached it
                    is to a great extent withdrawn from the influence of evaporation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Percolation.—</hi> The percolation of rain through porous
                    strata is the origin of springs and subterranean reservoirs of water, from
                    whence so many supplies are derived. Sand, gravel, chalk, and sandstone are very
                    absorbent strata; whilst the oolites and other limestones are permeable to a
                    smaller extent. The excess of rainfall over evaporation sinks into the ground
                    till it reaches the level of saturation of the stratum by previous rainfalls,
                    and adds to the underground supply. The water thus introduced is prevented from
                    sinking lower down into the earth by encountering an underlying impermeable
                    stratum; and it is hindered in flowing away to the lowest point of the outcrop
                    of the permeable stratum by friction, which causes the surface of saturation to
                    slope towards its outlet, the inclination varying with the head of water and the
                    resistance offered to its flow. The amount of percolation depends upon the
                    rainfall, the porosity of the stratum, and the extent of its exposed surface;
                    and it varies inversely as the evaporation, being greatest in winter and during
                    heavy long-continued ‘rainfalls, and least in the summer and with short showers
                    of rain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Watercourses.—</hi> On impermeable strata, the whole of the
                    rain not removed by evaporation finds its way into the watercourses. The
                    streams, however, draining these strata have a very variable discharge, as they
                    are rapidly swollen after a heavy fall of rain, and soon subside (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">River Engineering),</hi> whilst in fine summer weather they
                    are liable to be dried up. Accordingly, torrential streams, in their natural
                    condition, are not suitable for water-supply, as they tend to fail when they are
                    most wanted, and owing to their rapid flow they carry along a large quantity of
                    matter in suspension. The flow of streams draining permeable strata is more
                    regular, both on account of the smaller fall generally of the river-bed, and
                    also owing to the rainfall being delayed by percolation in its passage to the
                    river. Some of the rain sinking into a permeable stratum tends to find an outlet
                    outside the valley in which it falls, but most of it reappears again in the form
                    of springs which feed the river gradually at a lower part of its course; and the
                    loss which may occur is more than compensated for by the greater regularity of
                    flow. In olden times, towns, villages, and monasteries were established on the
                    banks of these streams, owing to the ready, ample, and never-failing
                    water-supply thus ensured.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sources of Supply.</hi><hi rend="italic">Tanks.—</hi> The
                    simplest method of procuring pure water is to collect the rain as it falls from
                    the clouds; and this method is a necessity where, as in tropical countries,
                    there is an excessive rainfall during one period of the year, followed by a long
                    drought, unless the rain sinks into a permeable stratum whence it can
                    subsequently be drawn. These open tanks, however, excavated in the ground, have
                    to be numerous, and often large in extent, to collect sufficient rain to supply
                    the wants of the surrounding population for several months; and the water in
                    them is subject to loss from evaporation during the dry season.</p>
                <p>The collection of rain-water is also advantageous in the rural districts of
                    temperate regions, especially for large institutions and isolated mansions and
                    farms, where, by a simple arrangement of gutters and pipes, a large proportion
                    of the rain falling on the sloping roofs can be stored in underground tanks. In
                    large towns, the rainwater is liable to contamination by smoke, dust, and other
                    impurities, and is only serviceable for gardens and water-closets, or where
                    softness is of more consequence than purity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Springs.—</hi> A very valuable source of water-supply is
                    provided by springs. These springs appear at the lowest point S of the outcrop
                    of a permeable stratum, where it rests upon an impermeable stratum (fig. 1); and
                    they constitute the outflow of the rain which has percolated through that
                    stratum. A spring depends for its supply upon the extent of the underground
                    reservoir furnished by the permeable stratum; and its discharge is regulated by
                    its level in relation to the line of saturation of the stratum and the
                    resistance offered to its flow. The gathering ground of a spring consists of the
                    portions AB, DS of the permeable stratum drained by it which are actually
                    exposed at the surface, provided the surface slope is not very steep, and also
                    of any impermeable surface strata BCD sloping from a higher level towards the
                    permeable outcrop. The position of the spring is determined by the dip AS of the
                    underlying impermeable stratum and the line of least resistance to the
                    underground flow. When the permeable stratum covers the surface, and is of small
                    extent, as when it forms a thin cap to a hill, an outflow only occurs after a
                    fall of rain. Where a permeable stratum, with a limited gathering ground, has a
                    sufficient depression at some point to cause the line of saturation to sink
                    occasionally below the level of the outcrop, the outflowing spring is
                    intermittent; and the time of the appearance of such springs (or bournes, as
                    they are termed) can be accurately predicted by observing the rise of the water
                    in the neighbouring wells sunk into these permeable strata. A spring is
                    generally clear, and free from organic impurities, as particles in suspension
                    are removed by the natural filtration, and organic matters are <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n429/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0429-0404"/> oxidized and eliminated in the passage of the
                    water through the ground. The water, however, collects any soluble gases and
                    salts which exist in the strata through which it flows; and most springs contain
                    some inorganic compounds in solution, depending upon the nature of the strata
                    and the distance traversed. Occasionally springs are so strongly impregnated
                    with certain substances as to receive specific names, such as sulphuretted,
                    chalybeate, and saline springs; but in such cases they are of more value for
                    medicinal purposes than as sources of water-supply. The abundant springs derived
                    from the chalk, though containing considerable quantities of carbonate of lime,
                    are quite suitable for domestic purposes. Springs from large underground
                    supplies possess the advantage of a fairly constant temperature, as their
                    sources are protected from atmospheric changes; but underground waters are
                    subject to the rise of temperature, experienced in descending below the surface
                    of the earth, of 1° F., on the average, for each 52 feet of depth.</p>
                <p>Small springs frequently supply little hamlets; and a shallow tank, formed at the
                    spring, into which the water trickles, serves as a reservoir, which is gradually
                    filled, and from which water is readily drawn. Large springs may afford adequate
                    supplies for towns; but before relying upon such a source it is essential to
                    gauge their discharge at the close of the autumn, in a dry year, so as to
                    ascertain their sufficiency under unfavourable conditions. When springs have
                    been selected, it only remains for the engineer to design suitable conduits for
                    conveying the water to the place to be supplied. The fine chalk-water springs of
                    Amwell and Chadwell, in Hertfordshire, have been thus utilized by the New River
                    Company for supplying London, by means of a conduit 40 miles long, completed in
                    1613; and the springs issuing from the Malvern Hills furnish Malvern with a
                    plentiful supply of the purest water.</p>
                <p>Springs were naturally much prized in ancient times, when the simplest means of
                    procuring water had to be resorted to; and ignorance of their real origin led to
                    their being the subject of mythological legends. They were used for the supply
                    of public fountains by the Greeks and Romans (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Fountain),</hi> and provided water for some of the Roman aqueducts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Streams and Rivers.—</hi> In olden times, the only other
                    obvious sources of water-supply, besides rain and springs, were the watercourses
                    which carried off the surplus rainfall. Streams and rivers afford the most ample
                    supply, but they become turbid in flood-time; and when they have a rapid fall,
                    and drain an impermeable basin, they fail in times of drought. These objections
                    have, however, been overcome by settling-tanks, filter-beds, and
                    storagereservoirs,—so that now the principal supplies are drawn from these
                    sources. The increase, indeed, of population, and especially the introduction of
                    the system of discharging the sewage of towns into the adjacent streams, have
                    polluted many rivers. Fortunately, in process of time, some of the organic
                    impurities are removed by aquatic animals and plants, and some become oxidized
                    and thus rendered innocuous (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Water),</hi> —so that,
                    after a sufficient length of unpolluted flow, the river again becomes suitable
                    for supply. The enactments against river-pollution have attacked this evil at
                    its source; but some rivers, passing through large manufacturing centres, are
                    hopelessly contaminated with refuse products. The best sources of water are
                    found in streams draining uncultivated mountainous districts, where a plentiful
                    rainfall on steep impervious strata affords a very pure though somewhat
                    intermittent supply. The freedom from habitations, the rapid flow of rain off
                    the surface, the absence of organic impurities and of soluble salts, prevent any
                    chance of contamination beyond occasional discoloration by peat. Distance,
                    however, from hilly regions and a considerable population render it frequently
                    necessary to resort to larger rivers, which, passing towns and villages in their
                    course, become more or less contaminated, and, being fed by springs from
                    permeable strata, contain the salts dissolved by those springs. London, for
                    instance, draws its principal supplies from the Thames and the Lea; and, though
                    microscopical investigations and the reports of the water-examiners are not
                    always reassuring about the qualities of the water thus supplied and the
                    recuperative powers of nature, waters containing some organic matters and
                    certain kinds of micro-organisms do not appear to be injurious, as is evidenced
                    by the general absence of specific diseases in the inhabitants supplied from
                    these sources.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wells.—</hi> There are two distinct kinds of wells, namely,
                    shallow wells, sunk into a superficial permeable stratum; and deep wells, sunk
                    through an impermeable stratum into an underlying permeable stratum. Both kinds
                    of wells tap the underground waters which are the sources of springs, and
                    furnish artificial outlets for waters which would either find a natural outlet
                    in springs at the outcrop, or which, owing to a depression of the strata, may
                    not possess a natural outlet at a low enough level ever to drain the lower part
                    of the underground reservoir.</p>
                <p>Shallow wells, sunk in the ordinary manner, have long been used for collecting
                    moderate supplies of water, where a permeable stratum, such as the Bagshot
                    sands, or the gravel covering parts of the London basin, overlies a watertight
                    stratum such as the London Clay, especially where a slight depression in the
                    impervious stratum towards the centre, or a considerable expanse of the surface
                    stratum, prevents a ready outflow from the permeable beds. Many parts of London
                    were supplied for a long time in this manner; for the rain percolating the bed
                    of gravel flowed into the wells sunk in it, from whence the water could be drawn
                    up. Indeed, as pointed out by Professor Prestwich, the growth of London was
                    restricted, till the regular establishment of waterworks, to those districts
                    possessing a gravel subsoil, in which water could be readily procured, as no
                    such facilities existed where the clay rose to the surface. The sites also of
                    many of the older towns and villages were doubtless determined by similar
                    considerations. Shallow wells are still very useful in supplying scattered
                    populations, but they are exposed to the worst forms of contamination when the
                    houses are near together. Any surface impurities are washed in with the rain;
                    frequently cesspools are given an outlet into the permeable stratum from which
                    the water-supply is derived; and pumping in the well, to increase the supply,
                    creates a flow from the contaminated areas to the well. Such utter neglect of
                    sanitary precautions has led to serious outbreaks of illness; and the sparkling
                    water from some of the old wells in the City of London has proved very
                    deleterious, from the infiltration into them of the decaying matter from
                    graveyards and elsewhere. Shallow wells, in fact, must be resorted to with great
                    caution, and only when an absence of habitations, or a thorough inspection of
                    the district drained by the well, affords assurance of freedom from organic
                    pollution.</p>
                <p>Deep wells, passing generally through impervious beds into a permeable
                    water-bearing stratum to a depth at which an adequate supply of water is
                    obtained, are mostly free from organic impurities, partly owing to the
                    protection of the superincumbent impervious stratum, and partly to the
                    filtration any impurities must undergo before reaching the well. The wells are
                    usually formed by sinking a shaft lined with brick for the upper portion, and
                    then carrying down a boring below to the requisite depth. The level of the water
                    in the well depends upon the water-level in the <pb break="no"

                    raised by pumping to the surface. Occasionally, owing to a depression of the
                    strata, the top of the well is below the level of the lowest part of the outcrop
                    of the permeable stratum into which the well is sunk, and the water rises in the
                    well directly this stratum is reached, and flows over if the hydrostatic
                    pressure is sufficient to overcome the friction. These latter wells, known as
                    Artesian wells, have been already described (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Artesian
                        Wells);</hi> and the methods of boring other deep wells are precisely
                    similar. The most favourable strata for deep wells in England are the Chalk,
                    Oolites, New Red Sandstone, and Lower Greensand. The yield of these wells
                    depends upon the extent of the portion of the underground reservoir which they
                    can drain; and the reservoir depends for its supply, as in the case of springs,
                    on the extent of the stratum exposed at the surface, the drainage it may receive
                    from adjoining impermeable strata, and the amount of rainfall over these areas.
                    As these points can only be roughly estimated, it is impossible to judge of the
                    yield beforehand; and much depends on the fissures the well may happen to
                    pierce, as the main flow in many rocks takes place along their fissures. It is
                    disadvantageous to sink a well where the superincumbent impervious stratum is
                    very thick, not merely because of the depth that has to be sunk before reaching
                    water, but also on account of the slow rate of the underground flow at a long
                    distance from the outcrop, and owing to the compression of the porous stratum by
                    the mass above it. For instance, the deep well on Southampton Common, sunk
                    through 465 feet of impervious beds, has only yielded a small supply of water,
                    though carried 852 feet into the chalk. A well may also prove a failure owing to
                    a fault or an impervious barrier interrupting the underground flow, if it is
                    sunk on the side of the fault or barrier away from which the dip of the stratum
                    inclines. Thus a well sunk at A (fig. 2) will receive the water flowing along
                    the permeable stratum; whilst an adjacent deeper well at B will yield no water,
                    on account of the interruption of the flow. As there is a limit to the
                    underground waters, only a limited number of wells can be advantageously sunk
                    within a certain area; and a multiplication of wells, such as has occurred in
                    the London basin, permanently lowers the water-level of the underground
                    reservoir, and involves an increased lift in pumping to maintain the supply.
                    Wells drawing their supplies from the same sources as springs reduce the yield
                    of the springs issuing from the strata which they pierce; and when these springs
                    feed rivers the volume of these rivers is thereby somewhat diminished. Wells,
                    however, sunk into strata draining to the sea-coast merely intercept water which
                    otherwise would be absolutely lost. A useful well for small supplies is a tube
                    well, which consists of a series of strong wrought-iron pipes, between 1 and 2
                    inches in diameter, the bottom length being terminated in a point, and
                    perforated with little holes for a short distance up. The point is driven into
                    the ground by a falling weight, as in pile-driving; and, as the tube descends,
                    fresh lengths of pipe are screwed on the top. When the perforated pipe reaches a
                    water-bearing stratum, the water enters through the holes and is raised by a
                    pump (compare descriptions and diagrams of tube-wells under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Petroleum,</hi> vol. xviii. pp. 716-718).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Extension of Supply.</hi></p>
                <p>A supply obtained from wells may be increased by reaching the water flowing
                    through undrained fissures or lying in untouched cavities, either by sinking
                    fresh wells, or by driving headings from the bottom of existing wells in various
                    directions, both of which courses were adopted for extending the Brighton
                    water-supply. Continued pumping sometimes improves the supply when the stratum
                    is well saturated and the drain is not sufficient to lower the water-level
                    permanently. This result is due to the steepening of the gradient of flow
                    towards the well by the depression of the water-level in the well, which
                    increases the velocity of flow, whereby the channels of access are cleared out
                    and enlarged, so that the water flows more readily and quickly into the well
                    than at the commencement.</p>
                <p>The supply from springs and streams can only be increased by storing up the
                    excess of supply in the wet season, to make up for the deficiency in the dry
                    season. This can be accomplished by means of storage reservoirs, which sometimes
                    are found suitably provided by nature in the form of lakes, or may be
                    constructed in mountain valleys by means of dams.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Reservoirs.</hi><hi rend="italic">Lakes as Reservoirs.—</hi>
                    A lake is a natural reservoir of water, caused by the influx of a stream into a
                    depression of an impermeable stratum, which is barred to a certain height by a
                    ridge across its outlet, over which the water has to rise before it can flow
                    away (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lake).</hi> The water of lakes is generally of
                    exceptional purity, owing to its being usually supplied by the drainage from the
                    impervious uncultivated ground of uninhabited mountainous districts, and its
                    general freedom from pollution, and on account of the lake serving as a deep
                    subsiding reservoir for any matters in suspension contained in the inflowing
                    streams, of which the Lake of Geneva in relation to the turbid upper Rhone is a
                    notable instance. Glasgow is supplied with excellent water from Loch Katrine
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqueduct,</hi> vol. ii. p. 224); it was at one time
                    proposed to supply Edinburgh from St Mary’s Loch, and London from Bala Lake; and
                    works for the conveyance of water from Thirlmere, in Cumberland, to Manchester
                    are in progress. To increase the storage capacity of a lake intended to serve as
                    a reservoir, and avoid injury to vested interests, the ordinary water-level of
                    the lake has to be raised by heightening the barrier at its outlet. By this
                    means the lake is not unduly lowered by the drain upon it during the dry season,
                    and compensation water is provided to supply the water-rights along the stream
                    below. The extent to which the water-level of the lake has to be raised depends
                    upon the area of the lake, the influx into it, and the supply drawn off; thus
                    Loch Katrine, with an area of 3000 acres, needed only a rise of 4 feet in order
                    that, with a maximum lowering of 7 feet, it might provide a storage of 5687
                    million gallons for a supply of fifty million gallons per day; whereas the
                    water-level of Thirlmere, with an existing area of only 350 acres, requires
                    raising 50 feet to furnish a storage of 8100 million gallons for a similar daily
                    supply. The amount of water that can be collected depends on the catchment area,
                    and the rainfall of the driest years, less the loss from evaporation; and the
                    supply which can be relied upon from any definite gathering ground is given by
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n431/mode/1up"

                    daily supply in gallons, A is the catchment area in acres, R is the average
                    annual rainfall and E the loss from evaporation, both in inches.<note

                    The storage capacity must be regulated by the number of consecutive days, in
                    time of drought, that the supply might have to be drawn from the reservoir
                    without its receiving any accession of water. This period has been variously
                    estimated at from 70 to 300 days according to the locality; for, owing to the
                    smaller fluctuations in the rainfall and in the periods of drought in very rainy
                    districts, and the less amount of evaporation, a much smaller storage suffices
                    for very wet districts than for very dry ones.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Storage Reservoirs.—</hi> Where no natural lake is available
                    for a reservoir, an artificial lake may be formed by constructing a dam across a
                    narrow gorge of a mountainous valley, thereby impounding, in the winter, the
                    stream draining the valley, and storing up a supply for the following summer. To
                    prevent an escape of the water thus impounded, the reservoir must be formed on
                    an impervious stratum, and all cracks and fissures closed, or the bed and banks
                    must be rendered watertight by a surface layer of impervious material.
                    Occasionally the configuration of the ground and the amount of storage required
                    render it necessary to form a series of impounding reservoirs at different
                    levels along a valley, thereby increasing the number, but keeping down the
                    height of the dams.</p>
                <p>For instance, in supplying Manchester from the Longdendale valley, six large
                    reservoirs, having a total area of 497 acres, and a capacity of 4160 million
                    gallons, were formed in steps by dams from 70 to 100 feet high (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Aqueduct,</hi> vol. ii. p. 224).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Reservoir Dams.</hi></p>
                <p>The capacity of a reservoir depends upon the form and levels of the valley in
                    which it is situated, and the height of the dam retaining it. As, however, the
                    extent of the water surface is considerably increased by raising the
                    water-level, an additional height of dam adds largely to the capacity of a
                    reservoir. Thus Thirlmere, with an existing maximum depth of 108 feet, will have
                    its area increased from 350 to 800 acres by raising the barrier at its outlet 50
                    feet. Accordingly, dams of considerable height are sometimes erected: as, for
                    instance, the Entwistle embankment of the Bolton waterworks, retaining a
                    reservoir 120 feet deep, the Villar dam, for the supply of Madrid, founded 158½
                    feet below the water-level of its reservoir (fig. 7), and the Furens dam, near
                    St Étienne, with a height of 164 feet at the water-level (fig. 5); whilst the
                    Gileppe dam, near Verviers, was made 147¾feet high (fig. 6) in preference to
                    four dams of 95 feet.</p>
                <p>A reservoir dam is constructed either with earthwork in an embankment sloped on
                    each side, and with a watertight puddle or concrete trench along the centre, or
                    of masonry. Earthwork embankments have, till within the last three or four
                    years, been exclusively adopted in Great Britain; whilst masonry dams have been
                    long ago constructed in Spain, and more recently introduced into France.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Earthen Embankments.—</hi> In moist climates, and for moderate
                    heights, embankments of earth are adopted with advantage for reservoir dams,
                    more especially when ample materials can be readily obtained, either by
                    excavations in the reservoir, thus enlarging its capacity, or elsewhere near at
                    hand, and where a rock foundation is not easily attainable. All loose material
                    must be removed from the site of the dam; and the puddle trench in the centre
                    must be carried down to a solid impervious bed (fig. 3). The embankment must be
                    brought up in thin layers carefully punned or rolled, the most retentive
                    materials being placed near the middle, and the looser materials towards the
                    outside. The inner slope, facing the reservoir, is usually made 3 to 1, and
                    pitched on the surface to protect it from the wash of the waves. The outer slope
                    is formed to the angle of stability of the material employed, generally 2 to 1;
                    and occasionally berms are introduced, diminishing the liability to slips (fig.
                    4). The best puddled clay is used for the central trench; but the remainder of
                    the embankment should not be composed exclusively of clay, as stiff clay under
                    the influence of the weather, especially on the exposed outer slope, tends to
                    slip. An earthen dam possesses ample stability if it is perfectly solid; but it
                    may fail from the infiltration of water through it, owing to faulty
                    construction, or from settlement, leading to its overtopping by the water in the
                    reservoir.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Masonry Dams.—</hi> In hot dry countries, an earthen embankment
                    is liable to crack and become somewhat disintegrated; and high embankments,
                    owing to their flat side slopes, require a very large amount of material.
                    Accordingly, in Spain, masonry dams have been adopted; and they are preferable
                    to earthen dams when the height exceeds about 80 feet, and where a rock
                    foundation can be secured. The Spanish masonry dam of Puentes (Lorca), 164 feet
                    high, was indeed built upon piles; but it was eventually undermined, and
                    settled; and the outburst of the water from the reservoir on its failure in 1802
                    caused the loss of 608 lives. Besides a solid rock foundation, the conditions of
                    stability of a masonry dam are that the maximum pressure shall not exceed the
                    limit that the masonry can sustain without injury, and that the lines of
                    resultant pressures, with the reservoir empty and full, shall not anywhere pass
                    outside the middle third of the section of the dam, so as to prevent the
                    possibility of tension at the faces. With the reservoir empty, the pressures on
                    the dam are merely those due to its weight; and the line of resultant pressures
                    is the locus of the points of intersection of the verticals from the centres of
                    gravities of the several portions of the dam above a series of horizontal lines,
                    with the base lines of those portions (figs. 5 and 8). With the reservoir full,
                    the water exerts a horizontal thrust against the inner face of the dam, equal to
                    the weight of a column of water having the depth of the water resting against
                    the dam, and acting at the centre of pressure, which is at two-thirds of the
                    depth down from the water-level. The line of resultant pressures, in this case,
                    is the locus of the points obtained by the intersection of the resultant lines
                    of the pressures of the masonry and <pb break="no"

                    different distances from the top, with the horizontal base lines of these
                    portions (figs. <hi rend="italic">5</hi> and 8). The direction and amount of the
                    resultant are readily obtained graphically by the parallelogram of forces, the
                    point of application being at the intersection of the vertical from the centre
                    of gravity with the horizontal line one-third up from the base <hi rend="italic"
                        >; for,</hi> by drawing the horizontal and vertical lines proportionate in
                    length to the water-pressure and weight of the dam respectively, the diagonal
                    represents the resultant of these forces both in magnitude and direction. When
                    the inner face of the dam is battered, the weight of water resting on this face
                    must be added to the weight of the dam when the reservoir is full. The resultant
                    pressures necessarily increase with the depth; and the maximum pressure is at or
                    near the base of the inner face when the reservoir is empty, and of the outer
                    face when the reservoir is full. The top has only to be made wide enough to
                    resist the shock of the waves and floating ice in the reservoir; but the base,
                    having to bear the weight of the dam together with the water-pressure, requires
                    widening out adequately for the safe limit of pressure on the masonry not to be
                    exceeded; and, as the water-pressure with the full reservoir deflects the
                    resultant towards the outer face, this face is given a considerable batter (fig.
                    5). All dams have to be raised high enough not to be overtopped by the highest
                    waves in a storm, depending on the size and exposure of the reservoir.</p>
                <p>Sections of three of the largest masonry dams erected within the last twenty-five
                    years, namely, Furens, Gileppe, and Villar (figs. <hi rend="italic">5,</hi> 6,
                    and 7), as well as the Vyrnwy rubble concrete dam, now in course of construction
                    (fig. 8), drawn to the same scale, illustrate the forms adopted for these dams.
                    The Furens and Villar dams follow closely the theoretical requirements; whilst
                    the Gileppe and Vyrnwy dams, with their excess of thickness, impose an
                    unnecessary weight on the base, and absorb extra material, without any adequate
                    compensating advantage. Provision, however, was made in the section of the
                    Gileppe dam to admit of its being raised at some future time, and for a roadway
                    along the top, which in some measure accounts for its excess of width; and the
                    Gileppe and Vyrnwy dams are the first examples of such structures in Belgium and
                    Great Britain.</p>
                <p>The Furens dam (fig. 5), constructed in 1859-66, across the Gouffre d’Enfer, for
                    forming a reservoir with a capacity of 56½million cubic feet, has a maximum
                    height of 183 feet, and a length along the top of 337 feet; and the maximum
                    pressure on the masonry is 6 Ί tons per square foot on the inner face, a few
                    feet above the base, with the reservoir empty; whereas, with the reservoir full,
                    the maximum pressure on the outer face is under 6 tons. No allowance was made
                    for the arched form of the dam, in plan, towards the reservoir, which reduces
                    the pressure, due to the head of water, at the lower part where the valley is
                    very contracted, and would have admitted of the omission of the projecting outer
                    portion for the bottom 60 feet. A very low limit of pressure, in addition to the
                    excess of strength just referred to, was adopted, owing to the unprecedented
                    height of the Furens dam. By raising, however, the limit to</p>
                <p>6⋅6 tons per square foot, it was possible to reduce the section of the Ban dam,
                    138 feet in height at the water-line, making it 110¼ feet wide at the base, as
                    compared with 116½ feet for the Furens dam at the same depth; whilst with the
                    same limit applied to a dam of the full height of the Furens dam, the reduction
                    in width at the base would be from 161 feet to 154 feet.<note anchored="true"

                    raising of the limit of pressure, which might be safely effected, would be of
                    little advantage for dams down to a depth of about 100 feet, as the reduction in
                    width is restricted by the condition of the middle third; but beyond that depth
                    the width is regulated by the pressure.</p>
                <p>The Gileppe dam (fig. 6), built in 1869-75, having a maximum height of 154 feet,
                    and a length along the top of 771 feet, retains a reservoir with a capacity of
                    423¾ million cubic feet. The average pressure on the base is 8⋅2 tons per square
                    foot; so that, even allowing for the specific gravity of the masonry being about
                    one-seventh greater at Gileppe than at Furens, the maximum pressure on the
                    Gileppe dam is considerably greater than on the Furens dam, in spite of its
                    greater base and the smaller head of water (compare figs. 5 and 6), owing to the
                    excess of material employed in its construction.</p>
                <p>The Villar dam (fig. 7), built across the river Lozoya in 1870-78, convex towards
                    the reservoir as at Furens and Gileppe, has a maximum height of 168⅔ feet, and a
                    length along the top of 546 feet; and it forms a reservoir having a capacity of
                    70⅔ million cubic feet. It differs very little in height and type from the
                    Furens dam; but the form given to the batter of the outer face is calculated to
                    render the pressures more uniform towards the base.</p>
                <p>The Vyrnwy dam (fig. 8), now (1888) in course of construction, across the Vyrnwy
                    in Montgomeryshire, for forming a reservoir, 1100 acres in area, to supply 40
                    million gallons per day to Liverpool, is to sustain a maximum head of water of
                    only 70½ feet; but, as it has to be carried down about 60 feet below the
                    surface, in the centre of the valley, to reach solid rock, its maximum height is
                    about 140 feet, and its length along the top is 1350 feet. The maximum pressure
                    on the inner face with the reservoir empty has been estimated at 8⋅7 tons per
                    square foot, and with the reservoir full at 6⋅7 tons on the outer face. These
                    pressures are considerably in excess of the maxima pressures on the Furens dam,
                    though the head of water to be supported is much less, and the width at the base
                    is greater in proportion to the depth. The pressures at the base in the Vyrnwy
                    and Gileppe dams show that a superabundant mass of material in a masonry dam,
                    whilst involving a larger outlay, imposes a greater pressure upon the masonry,
                    whereas the stability is ample in the Furens type; and the oozing of water
                    through the dam should be provided against by the quality of the materials and
                    workmanship, rather than by an extra thickness of masonry.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Accessory Works.—</hi> Sometimes a small dam is placed across
                    the upper end of a reservoir, so as to form a small settling reservoir, in which
                    the inflowing stream can deposit any sediment before passing into the main
                    reservoir.</p>
                <p>A waste weir is provided at a suitable place in the dam with its sill slightly
                    lower than the highest proposed water-level in the reservoir, so that the
                    surplus water, when this level is reached, may flow over into the lyewash. The
                    length of the weir should be made sufficient for the discharge over it to pass
                    off the inflow during a flood, so as to ensure the dam against being overtopped
                    by a rise of water in the reservoir, which would be fatal to an earthen dam. To
                    provide for a large discharge without a great length of weir, the sill of the
                    weir may be placed somewhat lower, and planks placed temporarily across it to
                    retain the water at its highest level on the approach of the summer.</p>
                <p>The water is drawn off from the reservoir, as required for supply, through an
                    outlet culvert passing from a low level in the reservoir into a conduit in the
                    valley below. This culvert was formerly frequently placed through the lowest
                    part of the dam, being readily formed during the construction of the dam, and
                    giving command of all the water in the reservoir. Accidents, however, have often
                    been traced to the unequal settlement of the earthen embankment near the
                    culvert, or to infiltration of water into the embankment, either by escaping
                    from the culvert fractured by settlement, or by finding a passage along the
                    outside line of the culvert or pipes. Thus the bursting of the Dale Dike
                    embankment, 95 feet high, near Sheffield, in 1864, on the occasion of the first
                    filling of the reservoir behind it, having a capacity of 114 million cubic feet,
                    which entailed the loss of 238 lives, was attributed to the unequal settlement
                    and consequent cracking of the puddle wall over the trench in the rock in which
                    the outlet pipes were laid, aggravated in this instance by the defectiveness of
                    the material in the main bank, the rough manner in which the bank was raised,
                    and the rapid filling of the reservoir. The percolation of the water under
                    pressure along the line of outlet pipes was the cause of the gradual failure of
                    the embankment, 41 feet high, across the Lynde Brook, Worcester, Mass., which
                    burst in 1876 and set free a reservoir with a capacity of 110 million cubic
                    feet.</p>
                <p>No possible considerations can justify the burying of outlet pipes at the base of
                    a high embankment, with the valves regulating the discharge at the outer
                    extremity, whereby the water-pressure always acts along the whole length of the
                    pipes, and their inspection is impracticable. In some cases a valve-tower is
                    erected in the centre of the embankment, by which means the water can be shut
                    off from a portion of the pipes. If, however, the outlet pipes are carried under
                    the embankment, they should be laid in the solid ground, and should be commanded
                    along their entire length by a valve-tower placed at the inner toe of the
                    embankment (fig. 4). Nevertheless, it is far safer to carry the outlet pipes in
                    a tunnel constructed through the side of the valley, beyond one end of the
                    embankment. In the case of masonry dams, the outlet is generally constructed in
                    the solid rock distinct from the dam; but at Villar the outlet culvert has been
                    carried through the centre of the dam (fig. 7).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Conveyance of Supply.</hi></p>
                <p>A reservoir in a mountain valley is at a sufficient elevation for the water to
                    flow by gravitation to the locality to be supplied; and it is only necessary to
                    form a conduit by canals, tunnels, aqueducts, and pipes, of adequate size in
                    relation to the gradient, to convey the daily supply required (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Hydromechanics).</hi> In olden times hills were contoured,
                    and valleys were crossed by colossal aqueducts, at great expense, to obtain a
                    regular inclination, which was reduced by the circuitous route that had to be
                    taken (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqueduct). Now,</hi> however, hills are pierced
                    by tunnels; and, by the employment of castiron, deep wide valleys can be crossed
                    by inverted siphons following the depressions of the land,—so that a much
                    straighter course is attainable, affording better gradients, and therefore
                    enabling smaller conduits to be adopted, which is of great importance when long
                    distances have to be traversed. Thus the waters of Thirlmere, after being
                    discharged through a tunnel formed under the Kirkstone Pass at the south end of
                    the lake, instead of at the natural outlet to the north, will be conveyed to
                    Manchester by a conduit 96 miles long, with a total fall of 178 feet. Portions
                    of the route are in tunnels, 7 feet square, the longest tunnel being a little
                    over 3 miles long; and there are several inverted siphons, to be formed of five
                    cast-iron pipes, each 3⅓ feet in diameter, the longest siphon being 3⅓ miles,
                    and that under the river Lune having to bear a water-pressure of 416 feet. The
                    water from the Vyrnwy reservoir will be conveyed to Liverpool in a conduit 67
                    miles long, of which 4 miles will be in tunnel, and will furnish a supply of 40
                    million gallons per day. A large supply of water from the river Verdon for the
                    district round Aix, serving for irrigation and manufactures, as well as for
                    domestic purposes, is conveyed across the valley of St Paul in an inverted
                    siphon formed of two wrought-iron tubes, each <hi rend="italic">5¾</hi> feet in
                    diameter.</p>
                <p>The water obtained from rivers in low districts, and from wells, has to be raised
                    by pumping to the height necessary to obtain a proper pressure for supply; and
                    the pumps have to be in duplicate, to prevent a failure in the supply in the
                    event of a break-down. Thus the water-supply of London has to be raised by
                    pumping to fill the service reservoirs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Purification.</hi></p>
                <p>The water obtained for supply is frequently not sufficiently pure to be at once
                    distributed for domestic purposes. The impurities to which water is liable are
                    of three kinds, namely, particles of matter in suspension, inorganic substances
                    in solution, and organic matters in solution or of extreme minuteness. Suspended
                    matters are readily removed by subsidence if the particles are heavy, and by
                    filtration if the particles are flocculent or light. Some inorganic compounds
                    are readily removed, whilst others cannot be dealt with in a practical manner.
                    The removal of organic impurities is of the most importance, and the most
                    difficult, which has led to the great care exercised in selecting unpolluted
                    supply.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Settling-Reservoirs.—</hi> Allusion has already been made to
                    subsiding reservoirs formed at the head of large storage reservoirs; the object
                    of these, however, is rather to prevent the accumulation of silt and sand in the
                    principal reservoir than for the purpose of purification, but the principle is
                    the same. Supplies from large reservoirs are generally free from matters in
                    suspension, except sometimes during heavy floods, owing to the subsidence in the
                    reservoir itself; but river supplies have often to be led into
                    settling-reservoirs, where the water, whilst at rest, can deposit its heavier
                    particles before passing on to the filter-beds for the removal of the lighter
                    portions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Filter-Beds.—</hi> Over the bottom of brick tanks layers of
                    clean material are spread, decreasing in coarseness from small rubble to sharp
                    sand, with a total average thickness of about 4 feet. The actual filtration is
                    effected by the upper layer of sand; and the lower layers allow the passage of
                    the water unaccompanied by the sand. The efficiency of the filtration depends
                    upon the slowness of the passage of the water, which should not exceed a flow
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n434/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0434-0409"/> of from 2½ to 3 gallons per square foot of
                    area per hour. The filter must periodically be cleaned by scraping off the top
                    surface of the sand, which becomes choked with the matter removed from the
                    water; and after a time a fresh layer of sand has to be provided. Filtration,
                    though in itself a purely mechanical operation, has been found to reduce the
                    organic impurities in the water, which must be due either to their oxidation
                    from exposure in thin layers to the air in the process of filtering or to the
                    actual removal of very minute organisms floating in the water, or probably to
                    both causes combined.</p>
                <p>Filters of spongy iron mixed with gravel were set up at the Antwerp waterworks in
                    1881, and arrested a quantity of matter which had passed through an upper layer
                    of sand, and proved very efficient agents for purification. Their large cost,
                    however, their becoming rapidly clogged and caked on the top, necessitating the
                    removal of the upper layer of sand to break up the hard top iron crust, and the
                    rather frequent renewal of the iron required, as compared with sand, were a bar
                    to the extension of the system, which had become inadequate for its work.
                    Eventually, it was found that the purification could be effected more
                    economically and rapidly, and quite as effectually, by scattering cast-iron
                    borings in the water as it flowed through horizontal revolving cylinders,
                    furnished with projecting plates fastened at intervals round the inside, which,
                    in revolving, scooped up the iron at the bottom, which had fallen through the
                    water, and discharged it on reaching the top. The iron is first converted into
                    ferrous oxide, FeO, which dissolves, at least partly, as bicarbonate, and then
                    by further oxidation into ferric oxide, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, which readily precipitates, and is easily removed
                    by filtration through sand, a small portion only of the oxide remaining in
                    solution. Iron appears to purify water from organic matter, partly by its fatal
                    influence on the growth and even life of micro-organisms, and partly by dragging
                    down the floating organisms in the process of precipitation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Softening Water.—</hi> Many waters drawn from springs, wells,
                    and rivers fed by springs contain inorganic salts in solution, and, though
                    innocuous and pleasant for drinking, are not good for general domestic and
                    manufacturing purposes, owing to their curdling soap and encrusting kettles,

                    mainly due to salts of lime, which are found in large quantities in waters drawn

                    slightly soluble carbonate of lime, CaO.CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, of
                    which chalk and other limestones are mainly composed, by combination with free
                    carbonic acid, CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. It is only therefore necessary
                    to remove half of the carbonic acid from the bicarbonate to reconvert it into
                    the insoluble carbonate. This can be done either by boiling, which drives off
                    the excess of carbonic acid, depositing the carbonate of lime which forms the
                    troublesome incrustation in pipes and boilers where chalk water is used, or by
                    adding caustic lime, CaO, to the water, which, combining with the excess of
                    carbonic acid, reduces the bicarbonate, forming carbonate of lime, which is
                    precipitated. This reaction is indicated by the formula CaO + CaO.2CO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2CaO.CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and is the
                    basis of Dr Clark’s process for softening water. To indicate the degree of
                    hardness of various waters, Dr Clark’s scale of 1 degree of hardness for each
                    grain of chalk in 1 gallon of water is employed. Some waters have 22°, or even
                    more degrees of hardness; and all waters are termed hard which contain more than
                    5°; but by the softening process waters of 22° of hardness can be reduced to
                    about 5°. The remaining or permanent hardness consists of sulphate of lime and
                    other soluble salts. The conversion of the bicarbonate in the process of
                    softening is rapid; but the difficulty of dealing with the fine precipitate,
                    which requires time to settle, has hindered the general adoption of the process,
                    though it has been applied successfully at various works deriving their supply
                    from chalk wells. The precipitation of the carbonate of lime in the softening
                    process has been observed to remove to a great extent the micro-organisms in the
                    water, confirming the view expressed above, that precipitation sweeps down with
                    it the minute germs, as in this case the chemical action could not influence
                    them. The waters obtained from mountainous districts are very soft, and
                    therefore very valuable for manufacturing districts; but they have more action
                    upon lead, and are more liable to absorb organic impurities than water highly
                    charged with inorganic salts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Storage.</hi><hi rend="italic">Quantity of Daily
                        Supply.—</hi> The water-supply required is estimated in gallons per head of
                    population, with additions in manufacturing districts for trade purposes. The
                    consumption varies greatly in different towns, ranging from about 12 to 50
                    gallons per head per day; and it depends more upon the fittings and other
                    sources of waste than upon the habits of the population, though the consumption
                    per head is greater in the wealthier quarters. An ample supply, for domestic and
                    general requirements, is from 20 to 25 gallons per head daily. The actual rate
                    of consumption varies with the time of day, and also with the period of the
                    year, being greatest between 7 and 10 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.μ.,</hi> and in
                    June, July, and August, and least from 9 P.M. to 5 A.Μ., and in January,
                    February, and March.</p>
                <p>Where the quality of the supply drawn from different sources varies, as in London
                    (the water from the deep wells in the chalk being far superior to that derived
                    from the Lea), and where filtration has to be largely adopted, it is unfortunate
                    that the best supply cannot be devoted to drinking and cooking, and the inferior
                    in quality and unfiltered waters used for cleaning, for gardens, stables,
                    water-closets, flushing sewers, watering the streets, and extinguishing fires.
                    Besides, however, the cost of a duplicate system of mains and pipes, with the
                    addition, in London, of difficulties between independent companies, the
                    carelessness of persons in drawing from the two supplies has been considered a
                    bar to this separation. It is possible, however, that, when the population
                    becomes still more dense, and pure water more difficult to obtain, these
                    objections may be overruled, and the purest supply devoted to special uses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Service-Reservoir.—</hi> To provide a sufficient reserve for
                    sudden demands, such as for a fire, and to ensure an adequate supply to every
                    house, a service-reservoir has to be constructed, into which the water from the
                    source of supply is led. The reservoir consists generally of a brick or concrete
                    tank, rendered inside with cement, sunk in the ground, and roofed over with
                    brick arches resting on the side walls and intermediate pillars, over which a
                    covering of earth is spread. By this means light and heat are excluded, which,
                    together with a depth of at least 15 feet of water, prevents the growth of
                    minute aquatic plants, of which the germs are found in some well waters,
                    particularly from the New Red Sandstone, and maintains the water at a tolerably
                    even temperature. The reservoir should have a capacity of not less than
                    twenty-four hours’ supply, and should be at a sufficient elevation to command
                    the whole of the district it serves, and if possible afford a good pressure on
                    the fire-hydrants. Where a town stands at very different levels, separate
                    reservoirs at different elevations for supplying the high-level and low-level
                    districts are advisable, to equalize the pressure.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Distribution.</hi></p>
                <p>The water is led from the service-reservoir through castiron mains to the branch
                    mains, from which the service pipes convey it to the several houses. Lead is
                    generally preferred for house connexions, owing to the facility with which it
                    can be adapted to structural requirements. The only objection to it is that it
                    is attacked by some very soft waters, oxide of lead being formed, which is
                    partially soluble and very injurious to health. With free carbonic acid,
                    however, the pipe becomes coated with carbonate of lead, which is insoluble in
                    water and protects the pipe from further action. Peat also in water protects the
                    lead pipes, by depositing a surface film. In the case of hard waters, the lead
                    soon becomes coated with sulphate of lime. Accordingly, it is only under
                    exceptional conditions that the employment of lead for pipes is deleterious; but
                    it should be prohibited for the lining of cisterns where the water may be stored
                    for long periods.</p>
                <p>Domestic filters are very valuable for local well and spring supplies, and afford
                    an additional safeguard against accidental impurities in public supplies (see
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Filter).</hi><hi rend="italic">Intermittent and
                        Constant Supply.—</hi> Formerly the common form of supply was on the
                    intermittent system. On this plan, each house is provided with a cistern, into
                    which water from the main is admitted for a short period, once or twice a day,
                    by means of a valve on each service main, which is opened and closed by the
                    turncock for each separate district. When the cistern is filled, the inlet pipe
                    is closed by the rising of the floating ball shutting the ball tap. The supply
                    is, accordingly, limited to the contents of the cistern, except during the short
                    period the water is turned on; and the cistern is proportioned to the
                    accommodation of the house. The water in these open cisterns is liable to
                    contamination from impurities of various kinds settling in them and not being
                    cleaned out; and it is often exposed to heat, a smoky atmosphere, and dust, and
                    sometimes to sewage gas. Moreover, in the event of a fire, the turncock has to
                    be summoned before a supply of water can be obtained. Accordingly, the adoption
                    of the constant system has been urged, and in many places carried out. The
                    advantages of drawing a fresh supply always direct from the main, and of having
                    an ample supply constantly at hand to meet any emergency are unquestionable; but
                    the constant supply of water -necessitates the strengthening and very careful
                    inspection of the pipes, joints, and fittings, to prevent fracture and avoid
                    leakage under a continual and increased pressure, and is liable to lead to a
                    careless waste of water if unchecked by a meter. Before substituting a constant
                    for an intermittent supply, it is essential to overhaul thoroughly the pipes and
                    joints, and to substitute screwdown taps, which close gradually, for the leaky
                    suddenly-closing plug-taps, which throw a sudden pressure on the pipes. Waste in
                    water-closets can be stopped by the insertion of a waste preventer, which only
                    allows a definite quantity of water to pass each time the plug is raised (see
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sewerage).</hi> The detection of accidental waste from
                    leakages has been much facilitated by the introduction of a waste-water meter,
                    which records graphically, on a revolving cylinder, the amount of water which is
                    passing the place where the meter is fixed. By fixing the meter on one of the
                    district mains at night, when most of the recorded flow is running to waste, and
                    shutting off successively the service pipes through which water is heard to be
                    flowing, the change in the diagram of flow at each closing of a service pipe
                    localizes the position and extent of each source of waste, showing at what
                    places leaks must be occurring, and which are the worst, needing attention
                    first. This method of inspection was first adopted at Liverpool in 1873; and,
                    besides effecting a considerable economy, it enabled the constant service to be
                    restored, which the previous waste had rendered impracticable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Water-Meters.—</hi> There are two classes of water-meters, —the
                    positive and the inferential. The positive meter, such as Kennedy’s and Frost’s
                    piston meters, measures the actual quantity of water passed through it, as
                    recorded by the strokes of a piston working in the cylinder, which is
                    successively filled from the top and bottom, and affords a measure of the water
                    introduced; whilst the inferential meter, such as that of Siemens, measures only
                    the revolutions of a turbine actuated by the flow of the passing water, of which
                    the quantity is deduced from the velocity. The positive meter is more accurate,
                    and measures very small flows; whereas the turbine meter may sometimes not be
                    turned by very small flows which are gradually increased. Measurement by meter
                    would seem naturally to follow the adoption of the constant service for domestic
                    supply, as well as for manufactories. Its general adoption has, however, been
                    hindered by the fear that a charge by quantity, instead of by rental, might
                    press unduly upon the poorer classes, and induce them to stint themselves of a
                    proper supply, and also the difficulty of obtaining a very cheap and at the same
                    time a perfectly trustworthy meter of adequate durability. To avoid the
                    possibility of checking a sufficient use of water in the poorer tenements, it
                    has been proposed to allow a definite supply at the ordinary rate, and only to
                    charge by meter for any excess over this amount. <hi rend="smallcaps">(l. f.
