                    other distinguished men among his pupils. Wyttenbach’s own father was also a
                    theological professor of considerable note, first at Bern, and then at Marburg.
                    His removal to Marburg, which took place in 1756, was partly due to old
                    associations, for the elder Wyttenbach had studied there under the famous
                    Christian Wolff, and embodied the philosophical principles of his master in his
                    own theological teaching. Soon after the Wyttenbachs settled in Germany the
                    great war broke out, and the region around Marburg suffered severely, so that
                    the scenes and excitement of military life must have powerfully affected the
                    growth of the boy’s somewhat sensitive character. After a careful preliminary
                    education, partly in the schools of Bern and Marburg, partly by private tutors,
                    and always under the eye of a severe but conscientious and affectionate father,
                    young Wyttenbach entered at the age of fourteen the university of Marburg, and
                    passed through a four years’ course there. His parents intended that he should
                    become a Lutheran pastor. The first two years were given up to general
                    education, principally to mathematics, “philology,” and history. The professor
                    of mathematics, Spangenberg, acquired great influence over young Wyttenbach. He
                    is said to have taught his subject with great clearness, and with equal
                    seriousness and piety, often referring to God as the supreme mathematician, who
                    had constructed all things by number, measure, and weight. “Philology” in the
                    German universities of that age meant Hebrew and Greek. These two languages were
                    generally handled by the same professor, and were taught almost solely to
                    theological students. Wyttenbach’s university course at Marburg was troubled
                    about the middle of the time by mental unrest, due to the fascination exercised
                    over him by Bunyan’s <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim's Progress.</hi> Like Bunyan
                    himself, he believed that he was doomed to perdition, and that he had committed
                    the inexpiable sin against the Holy Ghost. The disorder was cured by
                    Spangenberg. The principal study of the third year was metaphysics, which took
                    Wyttenbach entirely captive. The fourth and last year was to be devoted to
                    theology and Christian dogma. Wyttenbach had hitherto submitted passively to his
                    father’s wishes concerning his career, in the hope that some unexpected
                    occurrence might set him free. But he now turned away from theological lectures,
                    and privately devoted his time to the task of deepening and extending his
                    knowledge of Greek literature. His father was wise enough to leave him to follow
                    his own bent. To use Wyttenbach’s own words, he looked up to every Greek book as
                    a temple of wisdom. But the struggle for knowledge was hard, and taxed all his
                    powers. He possessed at the time, as he tells us, no more acquaintance with
                    Greek than his own pupils at a later time could acquire from him during four
                    months’ study. He was almost entirely without equipment beyond the bare texts of
                    the authors. Each author only yielded after a protracted siege. But Wyttenbach
                    was undaunted, and four years’ persistent study gave him a knowledge of Greek
                    such as few Germans of that time possessed. His love for philosophy carried him
                    towards the Greek philosophers, especially Plato. He describes himself as
                    walking about the meadows near Marburg, conning portions of his text of Plato,
                    which he had taken to pieces for easier carriage. During this period Ruhnken’s
                    notes on the Platonic lexicon of <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi> fell into his
                    hands. Ruhnken was for him almost a superhuman being, whom he worshipped day and
                    night, and with whom he imagined himself as holding converse in the spirit.
                    Taking up the works of Julian, he emended them on the principles of Ruhnken.
                    When Wyttenbach was twenty-two he determined to seek elsewhere the aids to study
                    which Marburg could not afford. His father, fully realizing the strength of his
                    son’s pure passion for scholarship, permitted and even advised him to seek Heyne
                    at Göttingen. From this teacher he received the utmost kindness and
                    encouragement, and he was urged by him to dedicate to Ruhnken the first fruits
                    of his scholarship. Wyttenbach therefore set to work on some notes to Julian,
                    Eunapius, and Aristaenetus, and Heyne wrote to Ruhnken to bespeak his favourable
                    consideration for the work. Before it reached him Ruhnken wrote a kind letter to
                    Wyttenbach, which the recipient “read, re-read, and kissed,” and another on
                    receipt of the tract, in which the great scholar declared that he had not looked
                    to find in Germany such knowledge of Greek, such power of criticism, and such
                    mature judgment, especially in one so young. Wyttenbach was now able with
                    boldness to devote himself to the career of a scholar. He studied with ardour
                    the works of the great scholars of the Netherlands, and in his morning and
                    evening petitions prayed that it might be given him to see Valckenaer and
                    Ruhnken in the flesh. By Heyne’s advice, he now worked hard at Latin, which he
                    knew far less thoroughly than Greek, and we soon find Heyne praising his
                    progress in Latin style to both Ruhnken and Valckenaer. He now wrote to ask
                    their advice about his scheme of coming to the Netherlands to follow the
                    profession of a scholar. Ruhnken strongly exhorted Wyttenbach to follow his own
                    example, for he too had been designed by his parents for the Christian ministry
                    in Germany, but had settled at Leyden on the invitation of Hemsterhuis.
                    Valckenaer’s answer was to the same effect, but he added that Wyttenbach’s
                    letter would have been pleasanter to him had it been free from excessive
                    compliments. These letters were forwarded to the elder Wyttenbach, with a strong
                    recommendation from Heyne. The old man had been himself in Leyden in his youth,
                    and entertained an admiration for the scholarship of the Netherlands; so his
                    consent was easily won. Young Wyttenbach reached Leyden in 1770. According to
                    his own description, he approached the gates of the city with a feeling of
                    religious awe such as might have passed over an ancient visitant to Athens and
                    the Acropolis. As he neared Ruhnken’s door, the words of Homer “surely there is
                    some god within” were in his mind. He was delighted to find the great man
                    entirely free from the pomposity and assumption which had made many of the
                    German professors disagreeable to him. A year was spent with great contentment,
                    in learning the language of the people, in attending the lectures of the great
                    “duumviri” of Leyden, and in collating MSS. of Plutarch. At the end of 1771 a
                    professor was wanted at Amsterdam for the College of the Remonstrants. By the
                    recommendation of Ruhnken, wyttenbach obtained the chair, which he filled with
                    great success for eight years. His lectures took a wide range. Those on Greek
                    were repeated also to the students of the university of Amsterdam (the
                    “Athenaeum”). In 1775 a visit was made to Paris, which was fruitful both of new
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n760/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0760-0715"/> friendships and of progress in study. About this
                    time, on the advice of Ruhnken, Wyttenbach began the issue of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic">Critica,</hi> which appeared at
                    intervals for the next thirty years. The object professed in the preface was to
                    help in rescuing classical studies from the neglect into which they had fallen,
                    by creating an interest in new works of merit, through critical notices,
                    embodying the results of original research by the writer himself. It was in fact
                    a kind of critical review written by one man. The methods of criticism employed
                    were in the main those established by Hemsterhuis, and carried on by Valckenaer
                    and Ruhnken, and the publication met with acceptance from the learned all over
                    Europe. In 1777 the younger Burmann (“Burmannus Secundus ”) retired from his
                    professorship at the Athenaeum, and Wyttenbach hoped to succeed him. When
                    another received the appointment, he was sorely discouraged. Only his regard for
                    Ruhnken and for Dutch freedom (in his own words “Ruhnkeni et Batavae libertatis
                    cogitatio ”) kept him in Holland. For fear of losing him, the authorities at
                    Amsterdam nominated him in 1779 professor of philosophy. Some of his lectures
                    given in this capacity were worked up for publication; in particular a treatise
                    on logic belongs to this period. In philosophy Wyttenbach never shook off the
                    influence of Wolff, and the Kantians were irate because he failed to appreciate
                    their master. In 1785 Toll, Burmann’s successor, resigned, and Wyttenbach was at
                    once appointed to succeed him. His full title was “professor of history and
                    eloquence and Greek and Latin literature.” He had hardly got to work in his new
                    office when Valckenaer died, and he received a call to Leyden. Greatly to
                    Ruhnken’s disappointment, he declined to abandon the duties he had so recently
                    undertaken. In 1787 began the internal commotions in Holland, afterwards to be
                    aggravated by foreign interference. Scarcely during the remaining thirty-three
                    years of Wyttenbach’s life was there a moment of peace in the land. He held
                    entirely aloof from factions, and yearned continually after quiet and
                    reconciliation. About this time two requests were made to him for an edition of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Moralia</hi> of Plutarch, for which a recension of the
                    tract “De sera numinis vindicta” had marked him out in the eyes of scholars. One
                    request came from the famous “Societas Bipontina,” the other from the delegates
                    of the Clarendon Press at Oxford. Wyttenbach, influenced at once by the
                    reputation of the university, and by the liberality of the Oxonians in tendering
                    him assistance of different kinds, declined the offer of the Bipontine
                    Society,—very fortunately, since their press was soon destroyed by the French.
                    The fortunes of Wyttenbach’s edition curiously illustrate the text “habent sua
                    fata libelli.” The first portion was safely conveyed to Oxford in 1794. Then war
                    broke out between Holland and Great Britain. Randolph, Wyttenbach’s Oxford
                    correspondent, advised that the next portion should be sent through the British
                    ambassador at Hamburg, and the MS. was duly consigned to him “in a little chest
                    well protected by pitch.” After sending Randolph a number of letters without
                    getting any answer, Wyttenbach in disgust put all thought of the edition from
                    him, and a shudder ran through his frame whenever Plutarch was mentioned. At
                    last, after simultaneous letters had been despatched to a good many delegates of
                    the Clarendon Press, the missing box was discovered in a forgotten corner at
                    Hamburg, where it had lain for two years and a half. The work was finally
                    completed in 1805. Meanwhile Wyttenbach received repeated invitations to leave
                    Amsterdam, which were refused. One came from his native city Bern, another from
                    Leyden, where vacancies had been created by the refusal of professors to swear
                    allegiance to the new Dutch republic set up in 1795, in which Wyttenbach had
                    acquiesced. But he only left Amsterdam in 1799, when on Ruhnken’s death he
                    succeeded him at Leyden. Even then his chief object in removing was to
                    facilitate an arrangement by which the necessities of his old master’s family
                    might be relieved. His removal came too late in life, and he was never so happy
                    at Leyden as he had been at Amsterdam. Before long appeared the ever-delightful
                    <hi rend="italic">Life of David Ruhnken.</hi> Though written in Latin, this
                    biography deserves to rank high in the modern literature of its class. It is
                    composed in a style that is lucid, flowing, and graceful, not imitated from any
                    one ancient author, but (a few grammatical matters apart) such as we can imagine
                    that some gifted Roman of the classical time might well have struck out for
                    himself. One of Ruhnken’s friends called it “a Milesian tale,” partly from the
                    fascination of the style, and partly because the book often took such a wide
                    range that Ruhnken was lost amid extended observations springing out of his
                    relation to the classical studies of his age. Of Wyttenbach’s life at Leyden
                    there is little to tell. The continual changes in state affairs greatly
                    disorganized the universities of Holland, and Wyttenbach had to work in face of
                    much detraction; still his success as a teacher was very great. In 1805 he
                    narrowly escaped with his life from the great gunpowder explosion, which killed
                    150 people, among them the Greek scholar Luzac, Wyttenbach’s colleague in the
                    university. One of Wyttenbach’s letters gives a vivid account of the disaster.
                    During the last years of his life he suffered severely from illness and became
                    nearly blind. After the conclusion of his edition of Plutarch’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Moralia</hi> in 1805, the only important work he was able to
                    publish was his well-known edition of Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Phaedo.</hi>
                    Many honours were conferred upon him both at home and abroad, and in particular
                    he was made a member of the French Institute. Shortly before his death, he
                    obtained the licence of the king of Holland to marry his sister’s daughter,
                    Johanna Gallien, who had for twenty years devoted herself to him as housekeeper,
                    secretary, and aider in his studies. The sole object of the marriage was to
                    secure for her a better provision after her husband’s death, because as the
                    widow of a professor she would be entitled to a pension. Johanna Gallien was a
                    woman of remarkable culture and ability, and wrote works held in great repute at
                    that time. On the festival of the tercentenary of the foundation of the
                    university of Marburg, celebrated in 1827, the degree of doctor was conferred
                    upon her. Wyttenbach died of apoplexy in 1820, and he was buried in the garden
                    of his country house near Amsterdam, within sight, as he noted, of the dwellings
                    of Descartes and Boerhaave.</p>
                <p>Although his work can hardly be set on the same level as that of Hemsterhuis,
                    Valckenaer, and Ruhnken, yet he was a very eminent exponent of the sound methods
                    of criticism which they established. These four men, more than any others after
                    Bentley, laid the foundations of Greek scholarship as.it exists to-day. The
                    precise study of grammar, syntax, and style, and the careful criticism of texts
                    by the light of the best manuscript evidence, were upheld by these scholars in
                    the Netherlands when they were almost entirely neglected elsewhere on the
                    Continent, and were only pursued with partial success in England. Wyttenbach may
                    fairly be regarded as closing a great period in the history of scholarship. He
                    lived indeed to see the new birth of German classical learning, but his work was
                    done, and he was unaffected by it. Wyttenbach’s criticism was less rigorous,
                    precise, and masterly, 'but perhaps more sensitive and sympathetic than that of
                    his great predecessors in the Netherlands. In actual acquaintance with the
                    philosophical writings of the ancients, he has probably never been surpassed. In
                    character he was upright and simple-minded, but shy and retiring, and often
                    failed to make himself appreciated. His life was not passed without strife, but
                    his few friends were warmly attached to him, and his many pupils were for the
                    most part his enthusiastic admirers. Wyttenbach’s biography was written in a
                    somewhat dry and lifeless manner by Mahne, one of his pupils, who also published
                    some of his letters. His <hi rend="italic">Opuscula,</hi> other than those
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Critica,</hi> were collected in
                    two volumes (Leyden, 1823). (J. S. R.)</p>
