                    1887.</p><p/></note> (of which her novels were the mainstay for the last twenty
                    years of her life) it appears that the industrial distress described in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mildred Arkell</hi> is a reminiscence of the collapse of the glove
                    trade in Worcester, consequent on Huskisson’s tariff reforms in 1823, from which
                    her father suffered along with other English glove manufacturers. She married
                    young, it is said, and after her marriage lived for the most part in France, her
                    husband being “at the head of a large shipping and banking firm abroad.” She
                    first came before the public in her own name as the author of a temperance tale
                    <hi rend="italic">(Danesbwry House),</hi> which had gained the prize of &lt;£100
                    offered by the Scottish Temperance League. This was in 1860; but it appears from
                    the memoirs already referred to that “for many years” before this she had been a
                    regular contributor of stories anonymously, month after month, to Mr Harrison
                    Ainsworth’s magazines, Bentley’s <hi rend="italic">Miscellany,</hi> and
                    Colburn’s <hi rend="italic">New Monthly. Danesbury House</hi> was very
                    favourably reviewed, her genuine gifts as a story-teller making themselves
                    apparent in spite of the didactic purpose of the tale; but Mrs Wood’s first
                    great success was made in the following year with <hi rend="italic">East
                    Lynne,</hi> one of the most popular novels of the century. A long review in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> in which a place was claimed for her in the
                    foremost rank of novelists, was the loudest note in a general chorus of praise,
                    and fairly established her position. The praise of the critics continued
                    throughout the next half-dozen of her novels, which followed one another with
                    great rapidity: <hi rend="italic">The Channings</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mrs
                    Halliburton'</hi><hi rend="italic">'s</hi><hi rend="italic">Troubles,</hi> in
                    1862; <hi rend="italic">Verner’s Pride</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Shadow of
                    Ashlydyat,</hi> in 1863; <hi rend="italic">Lord Oakburn’s Daughters, Oswald
                    Cray,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trevlyn Hold,</hi> in 1864. These works were
                    held to confirm the promise of <hi rend="italic">East Lynne,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Shadow of Ashlydyat</hi> was pronounced to be (as it is still
                    generally considered) the best of them all. Complaints of sameness,—almost
                    inevitable, considering the rate of production, — of commonplaceness of
                    sentiment and material, and of a certain narrowness and insufficiency in her
                    conceptions of poetical justice first began to be heard in connexion with <hi
                    rend="italic">Mildred Arkell</hi> (1865), and became louder as the fertile
                    novelist continued to pour forth her stories with inexhaustible fluency. She
                    became owner of the <hi rend="italic">Argosy</hi> in 1867, and her stories
                    quickly raised it to an enormous circulation. She had a certain triumph over her
                    critics with the <hi rend="italic">Johnny Ludlow</hi> tales, an imitation of
                    Miss Mitford’s <hi rend="italic">Tales of Our Village.</hi> Mrs Wood’s name was
                    not put to them as they appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Argosy,</hi> and when
                    the first series was collected and published separately in 1874 they excited
                    among reviewers an approach to the enthusiasm with which her first efforts had
                    been welcomed. Undoubtedly Mrs Wood possessed many of the qualities of a
                    first-rate story-teller,—great simplicity of style, unfailing fluency, a lively
                    interest in prominent traits of character, abundant circumstantiality, skill in
                    exciting curiosity and keeping up suspense, and withal a wonderful clearness of
                    method. Amidst her crowd of characters and incidents you are never puzzled or
                    perplexed, and she very rarely lapses into tediousness. If ever she is tedious,
                    it is from repeating herself. Her “criticism of life” is not very broad or very
                    profound, though it is generally for moral edification; she is simply an
                    excellent story-teller out of the ordinary materials of the craft. In private
                    life Mrs Wood seems to have been a most amiable person: her son gives a very
                    lovable picture of her. Her death took place on 10th February 1887, at the age
                    of seventy-three. She was active in her work till the very last, and left
                    several completed stories, short and long, ready for publication.</p>
