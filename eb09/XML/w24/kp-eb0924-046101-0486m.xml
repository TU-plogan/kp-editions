                <p><label type="entry">WEALTH</label>. The most commonly accepted definition of
                    wealth is that it consists of all useful and agreeable things which possess
                    exchange value, and this again is generally regarded as coextensive with all
                    desirable things except those which do not involve labour or sacrifice for their
                    acquisition in the quantity desired. On analysis it will be evident that this
                    definition implies, directly, preliminary conceptions of utility and value, and,
                    indirectly, of sacrifice and labour, and these terms, familiar though they may
                    appear, are by no means simple and obvious in their meaning. Utility, for the
                    purposes of economic reasoning, is usually held to mean the capacity to satisfy
                    a desire or serve a purpose (J. S. Mill), and in this sense is clearly a much
                    wider term than wealth. Sunshine and fresh air, good temper and pleasant
                    manners, and all the infinite variety of means of gratification, material and
                    immaterial, are covered by utility as thus defined. Wealth is thus a species of
                    utility, and in order to separate it from other species some <hi rend="italic"
                    >differentia</hi> must be found. This, according to the general definition, is
                    exchange value, but a little reflexion will show that in some cases it is
                    necessary rather to contrast value with wealth. “Value,” says Ricardo, expanding
                    a thought of Adam Smith, “essentially differs from riches, for value depends not
                    on abundance but on the difficulty or facility of production.” According to the
                    well-known tables ascribed to Gregory King, a deficiency of a small amount in
                    the annual supply of corn will raise its value far more than in proportion, but
                    it would be paradoxical to argue that this rise in value indicated an increase
                    in an important item of national wealth. Again, as the mines of a country are
                    exhausted and its natural resources otherwise impaired, a rise in the value of
                    the remainder may take place, and as the free gifts of nature are appropriated
                    they become valuable for exchange, but the country can hardly be said to be so
                    much the wealthier in consequence. And these difficulties are rather increased
                    then diminished if we substitute for value the more familiar concrete term
                    “money-price,”—for the contrast between the quantity of wealth and its nominal
                    value becomes more sharply marked. Suppose, for example, that in the total money
                    value of the national inventory a decline were observed to be in progress,
                    whilst at the same time, as is quite possible, an increase was noticed in the
                    quantity of all the important items and an improvement in their quality, it
                    would be in accordance with commonsense to say that the wealth of the country
                    was increasing and not decreasing.</p>
                <p>So great are these difficulties that some economists <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> Ricardo) have proposed to take utility as the direct measure of
                    wealth, and, as Mr Sidgwick has pointed out, if double the quantity meant double
                    the utility this would be an easy and natural procedure. But even to the same
                    individual the increase in utility is by no means simply proportioned to the
                    increase in quantity, and the utility of different commodities to different
                    individuals, and <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> of different amounts, is
                    proverbial. The very same things may to the same individual be productive of
                    more utility simply owing to a change in his tastes or habits, and a different
                    distribution of the very same things, which make up the wealth of a nation,
                    might indefinitely change the quantity of utility, but it would be paradoxical
                    to say that the wealth had increased because it was put to better uses.</p>
                <p>We thus seem thrown back on value as the essential characteristic, allowance
                    being made for any change in the standard of value; but there are still
                    difficulties to be overcome. Some things that undoubtedly possess value or that
                    can command a price are immaterial, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the advice of a
                    lawyer or physician or the song of a <hi rend="italic">prima donna,</hi> and,
                    although perhaps the skill of a workman (in any grade of the social scale) might
                    be considered as attached to the man, as a coal mine is attached to a place, it
                    is more in accordance with popular usage to consider skill as immaterial, whilst
                    at the same time it seems equally natural <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> to
                    confine the term wealth to material things in the common sense. Again, the
                    credit system of a country is a product of great labour and sacrifice, it is
                    most closely connected with the production of its material wealth in the
                    narrowest sense, and it certainly commands a pecuniary value, and yet credit is
                    more generally held to be a representative rather than a part of wealth, owing
                    apparently to its insubstantial character. Apart from the question of
                    materiality some writers have insisted on relative permanence and possibility of
                    accumulation as essential attributes of wealth, and have thus still further
                    narrowed the scope of the definition.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that it is on many grounds desirable in economics to use
                    terms as far as possible in their popular acceptations; but this rule must
                    always be subordinate to the primary object in view. In nearly every department
                    of knowledge in which popular terms have been retained it has been found
                    necessary either constantly to use qualifying adjectives where the context is
                    not a sufficient guide, and in some cases, when analysis discloses very
                    different elements, to make a selection. Sometimes it has been found convenient
                    to use a term with some variation in the definition according to the branch of
                    the subject in hand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On
                    the uses and difficulties of definitions in political economy compare Mr
                    Sidgwick’s <hi rend="italic">Principles,</hi> bk. i. ch. ii., and Cairnes’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Logical Method of Political Economy.</hi></p></note> Applying
                    these rules to the definition of wealth, perhaps the best solution is that which
                    is generally connected with German economists <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi>
                    Held). Wealth consists of utilities, and in the first great department of
                    economics—the <hi rend="italic">consumption</hi> of wealth —it is utility with
                    which we are principally concerned,— the idea of value, for example, being
                    overshadowed. The most general law of the consumption of wealth is that
                    successive portions of any stock give a diminishing amount of utility when
                    consumed. Then in the department of the <hi rend="italic">production</hi> of
                    wealth the most important characteristics are the labour and sacrifice necessary
                    to put the utilities <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n487/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0487-0462"/> desired iuto the things and to place the things
                    where they are wanted. The idea of value is again secondary and subordinate. We
                    can readily see the part played by nature, labour, and capital respectively in
                    the production of any commodity without considering the <hi rend="italic"
                    >effects</hi> on its value of the various factors; we can understand the
                    principles of division of labour and of the relative productiveness of large and
                    small industries without entering into questions of value except in the most
                    general manner. In the department of the <hi rend="italic">distribution</hi> of
                    wealth the fundamental conception is the right of appropriation; and accordingly
                    J. S. Mill very properly commences this part of his subject by an account of the
                    relative advantages of the socialistic and individual systems of property. It is
                    quite possible under the former to conceive of all the distribution being made
                    without any exchange and with reference simply to the wants or the deserts of
                    the members of the society. Thus it is not until we arrive at the department of
                    the <hi rend="italic">exchange</hi> of wealth that the characteristic of value
                    becomes predominant, although of course value is closely connected with utility
                    and labour and sacrifice.</p>
                <p>Usually, however, it will be found that in most cases anything which can fairly
                    be classed as wealth in one department is also wealth in the others, and thus
                    the definition is reached that wealth in general consists of all “consumable
                    utilities which require labour for their production and can be appropriated and
                    exchanged.” It only remains to add that “utilities” may be divided into “inner”
                    and “outer” (to translate the German literally), —the “inner” being such as are
                    simply sources of personal gratification to their possessor, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> a good ear for music; the “outer” utilities again may be divided
                    into “free” and “economic,” the former, as a rule, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    sunlight, not being the result of labour and not capable of appropriation or
                    exchange, and the latter as a rule possessing each of these marks. It is these
                    “economic utilities” which constitute wealth in the specific sense of the term,
                    although its use may be extended by analogy to include almost all utilities. (J.
