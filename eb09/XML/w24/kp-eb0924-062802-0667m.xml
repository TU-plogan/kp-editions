                <p><label type="entry">WOLF</label>. The zoological position and general characters
                    of the wolf <hi rend="italic">(Canis</hi><hi rend="italic">lupus)</hi> are
                    described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> (vol. xv. p. 438),
                    where the difficulties that naturalists meet with in separating and defining the
                    numerous variations of the animals called wolves, dogs, jackals, and foxes are
                    shown. The true wolves are (excluding some varieties of the domestic dog) the
                    largest members of the genus, and have a wide geographical range, extending over
                    nearly the whole of Europe and Asia, and North America from Greenland to Mexico,
                    but they are not found in South America or Africa, being replaced in both of
                    these continents by various species of jackals and foxes. As might be expected
                    from this extensive range, and the varied character of the climatic conditions
                    of the countries they inhabit, they present great diversities of size, length
                    and thickness of fur, and coloration, although resembling each other in all
                    important structural characters. These differences have given rise to a supposed
                    multiplicity of species, expressed by the names of <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lupus, C. lycaon</hi> (Central Europe), <hi rend="italic">C.
                    laniger</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C. niger</hi> (Tibet), <hi rend="italic">C.

                    rend="italic">C. mexicanus, &amp;c.,</hi> of North America, but it is very
                    doubtful whether these ought to be distinguished as other than local varieties.
                    In North America there is a second distinct smaller species, called the coyote
                    or prairie wolf <hi rend="italic">(Canis latrans),</hi> and perhaps the Japanese
                    wolf <hi rend="italic">(C.</hi></p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">hodophylax)</hi> may also be distinct, although, except for its
                    smaller size and shorter legs, it is scarcely distinguishable from the common
                    species. Though generally distributed throughout the Indian peninsula, the wolf
                    is not found in Ceylon nor in Burmah and Siam. The ordinary colour of the wolf
                    is a yellowish or fulvous grey, but specimens have been met with almost pure
                    white and others entirely black. In northern countries the fur is longer and
                    thicker, and the animal generally larger and more powerful than in the southern
                    portion of its range. Its habits are similar everywhere, and it is still, and
                    has been from time immemorial, especially known to man in all the countries it
                    inhabits as the devastator of his flocks of sheep. Wolves do not catch their
                    prey by lying in ambush, or stealing up close to it, and making a sudden spring
                    as the cat tribe do, but by fairly running it down in open chase, which their
                    speed and remarkable endurance enable them to do, and usually, except during
                    summer, when the young families of cubs are being separately provided for by
                    their parents, they assemble in troops or packs, and by their combined and
                    persevering efforts are able to overpower and kill even such great animals as
                    the American bison. It is singular that such closely allied species as the
                    domestic dog and the Arctic fox are among the favourite prey of wolves, and, as
                    is well known, children and even full-grown people are not unfrequently the
                    objects of their attack when pressed by hunger. Notwithstanding the proverbial
                    ferocity of the wolf in a wild state, many instances are recorded of animals
                    taken when quite young becoming perfectly tame and attached to the person who
                    has brought them up, when they exhibit many of the ways of a dog. They can,
                    however, rarely be trusted by strangers.</p>
                <p>The history of the wolf in the British Isles, and its gradual extirpation, has
                    been thoroughly investigated by Harting in his work on <hi rend="italic">Extinct
                    British, Animals,</hi> from which the following account is abridged. To judge by
                    the osteological remains which the researches of geologists have brought to
                    light, there was perhaps scarcely a county in England or Wales in which, at one
                    time or another, wolves did not abound, while in Scotland and Ireland they must
                    have been still more numerous. The fossil remains which have been discovered in
                    Britain are not larger than, nor in any way to be distinguished from, those of
                    European wolves of the present day. Wolf-hunting was a favourite pursuit of the
                    ancient Britons as well as of the Anglo-Saxons. In Athelstan’s reign these
                    animals abounded to such an extent in Yorkshire that a retreat was built by one
                    Acehom, at Flixton, near Filey, wherein travellers might seek refuge if attacked
                    by them. As is well known, great efforts were made by King Edgar to reduce the
                    number of wolves in the country, but, notwithstanding the annual tribute of 300
                    skins paid to him during several years by the king of Wales, he was not
                    altogether so successful as has been commonly imagined. In the reign of Henry
                    III. wolves were sufficiently numerous in some parts of the country to induce
                    the king to make grants of land to various individuals upon the express
                    condition of their taking measures to destroy these animals wherever they could
                    be found. In Edward II.’s time, the king’s forest of the Peak, in Derbyshire, is
                    especially mentioned as infested with wolves, and it was not until the reign of
                    Henry VII. (1485-1509) that wolves appear to have become finally extinct in
                    England. This, however, is rather a matter of inference from the cessation of
                    all mention of them in local records than from any definite evidence of their
                    extirpation. Their last retreat was probably in the desolate wolds of Yorkshire.
                    In Scotland, as might be supposed from the nature of the country, the wolf
                    maintained its hold for a much longer period. There is a well-known story of the
                    last of the race being killed by Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel in 1680, but there
                    is evidence of wolves having survived in Sutherlandshire and other parts into
                    the following century (perhaps as late as 1743), though the date of their final
                    extinction cannot be accurately fixed. In Ireland, in Cromwell’s time, wolves
                    were particularly troublesome, and said to be increasing in numbers, so that
                    special measures were taken for their destruction, such as the offering of large
                    rewards for their heads, and the prohibition (in 1652) of the exportation of
                    “wolf-dogs,” the large dogs used for hunting the wolves. The active measures
                    taken then and later reduced their numbers greatly, so that towards the end of
                    the century they became scarce, but, as in the case of the sister island, the
                    date of their final disappearance cannot now be ascertained. It has been placed,
                    upon the evidence of somewhat doubtful traditions, as late as 1766.</p>
                <p>It is entirely owing to their insular position that the British Islands have been
                    able to clear themselves of these formidable and destructive animals, for the
                    neighbouring country of France, with no natural barriers to prevent their
                    incursions from the vast continent to the east, is still liable every winter to
                    visits from numbers of them, as the following figures indicate. Government
                    rewards were paid in 1883 for 1316 wolves destroyed, in 1884 for 1035, in 1885
                    for 900, and in 1886 for 760. The increase of the reward just before the
                    first-named date seems thus to have had some effect in lessening the number. (W.
