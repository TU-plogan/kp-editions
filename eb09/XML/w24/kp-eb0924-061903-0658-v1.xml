                <p><label type="entry">WITCHCRAFT</label>. This subject has already been considered
                    in its general aspects under <hi rend="smallcaps">Astrology, Demonology,
                        Divination, Magic,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Spiritualism.</hi> In this
                    place what will be mainly attempted will be to illustrate the position assumed
                    by the law towards a crime which was regarded for centuries not only as possible
                    but also as specially noxious. It is a long interval from the Twelve Tables to
                    the Bill of Rights, but the lawyers of the latter age accepted the existence of
                    witchcraft with a faith almost as unquestioning as those of the former, and
                    comparatively few were they, whether lawyers or laymen, who in the interval
                    dared to raise their voices against the prevailing superstition. The writings of
                    Shakespeare and the other Elizabethan dramatists are sufficient of themselves to
                    show the universal prevalence of the belief in England. For the purposes of this
                    article witchcraft may be taken to include any claim of a power to produce
                    effects by other than natural causes. By whatever name such a power might be
                    called in a particular case, whether witchcraft, conjuration, sorcery,

                    Exercise of magical and diabolical arts rendered the magicians themselves liable
                    to be burned alive, and those who consulted them to crucifixion. Even the
                    possession of magical books was criminal. To administer a love potion, even
                    though harmless, was punished by labour in the mines, or relegation and fine in

                    rendered every one, whatever his rank, liable to torture. To teach or to learn

                    witchcraft was that, although according to the better opinion the offence was in
                    itself the subject of both secular and ecclesiastical cognizance, in fact it was
                    on the continent of Europe seldom punished by the secular power, except as the
                    mere executive of ecclesiastical sentences. The earliest ecclesiastical decree

                    bull against witchcraft. In the 15th a vigorous crusade was begun by the bull
                    “Summis desiderantes affectibus” of Innocent VIII. in 1484. Under the authority
                    of this bull Sprenger and Kramer (Latinized into “Institor ”) were appointed
                    inquisitors, and five years later they published the famous work <hi

                    deals with the practice at length. One or two of the more interesting points of
                    practice deserve a brief notice. Witnesses incompetent in ordinary cases were on
                    account of the gravity of the offence admissible on a charge of witchcraft
                    against but not for the accused. An alleged witch was to be conjured by the
                    tears of our Saviour and of our Lady and the saints to weep, which she could not
                    do if she were guilty. The authors explain that witchcraft is more natural to
                    women than to men, on account of the inherent wickedness of their hearts. In the
                    Roman and Greek Churches the form of <hi rend="smallcaps">Exorcism</hi><hi

                    England as lately as 1603. The 72d canon of that year forbade attempts by the
                    clergy at casting out devils by fasting and prayer unless by special licence
                    from the bishop. No such canon appears among the Irish canons of 1634. On one
                    occasion in 1612 punishment of the exorcised demons was attempted. The bishop of
                    Beauvais, in a document which Garinet has preserved, pronounced sentence of
                    excommunication against five such demons.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    felony until the Act of Henry VIII. The earliest trial recorded in England was
                    in a secular court. In 1324 several persons were appealed before the coroners of
                    the king’s household, and the record, certifying acquittal by a jury, was then

                <p>In proceedings against a woman the doctrine of coercion by the husband (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Women)</hi> did not apply. A distinction, more curious than
                    important, was drawn between conjurers, witches, and sorcerers. Conjurers by
                    force of magic words endeavoured to raise the devil and compel him to execute
                    their commands. Witches by way of friendly conference bargained with an evil
                    spirit that he should do what they desired of him. Sorcerers or charmers, by the
                    use of superstitious forms of words or by means of images or other
                    representations of persons or things, produced strange effects above the
                    ordinary course of nature. Legislation on the subject began in the pre-Conquest
                    codes. Thus the laws of Ethelred banished witches, soothsayers, and magicians.
                    The laws of Canute included love-witchcraft under heathendom. It was evidently
                    regarded as a survival of paganism. The first Act after the Conquest was passed
                    in 1541 (33 Hen. VIII. c. 8), which dealt with a somewhat remarkable mixture of
                    offences. It declared felony without benefit of clergy various kinds of
                    sorceries, discovery of hidden treasure, destruction of a neighbour’s person or
                    goods, making images and pictures of men, women, children, angels, devils,
                    beasts, and fowls, and pulling down crosses. The Act having been repealed at the
                    accession of Edward VI., another Act on similar lines but distinguishing
                    different grades of witchcraft was passed in 1562. By this Act, 5 Eliz. c. 16,
                    conjuration and invocation of evil spirits, and the practice of sorceries,
                    enchantments, charms, and witchcrafts, whereby death ensued, were made felonies
                    without benefit of clergy and punishable with death. If only bodily harm ensued,
                    the punishment for a first offence was a year’s imprisonment and the pillory,
                    and for a second death. If the practice was to discover hidden treasure or to
                    provoke to unlawful love, the punishment for a first offence was the same as in
                    the last case, for a second imprisonment for life and forfeiture of goods. At
                    the accession of James L, perhaps in compliment to the king’s position as an
                    expert and specialist in the matter, was passed 1 Jac. I. c. 12, which continued
                    law for more than a century. The strange verbiage of the most important section
                    of the Act is worth quoting in full. “If any person or persons shall use,
                    practise, or exercise any <pb break="no"

                    any dead man, woman, or child out of his, her, or their grave or any other place
                    where the dead body resteth, or the skin, bone, or any part of any dead person,
                    to be employed or used in any manner of witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or
                    enchantment, or shall use, practise, or exercise any witchcraft, enchantment,
                    charm, or sorcery, whereby any person shall be killed, destroyed, wasted,
                    consumed, pined, or lamed in his or her body or any part thereof,” every such
                    offender is a felon without benefit of clergy. The Act further punished with
                    imprisonment for a first offence, and for a second made it felony without
                    benefit of clergy, to declare by witchcraft where treasure was, to provoke to
                    unlawful love, or to attempt to hurt cattle, goods, or persons. This Act was
                    repealed in 1736 by 9 Geo. II. c. <hi rend="italic">5.</hi> It will be noticed
                    that in all the Acts it was necessary (except in the case of love-philtres) that
                    injury should have been caused or intended or gain made. There were statutes
                    which, although not directly concerned with witchcraft, aimed at the suppression
                    of analogous offences. Thus multiplication of gold and silver (by means of the
                    philosopher’s stone) was made felony in 1403 by <hi rend="italic">5 Hen.</hi>
                    IV. c. 4. This was repealed by 1 Will, and Μ. c. 30,—it is said, by the
                    influence of Robert Boyle. Numerous Acts dealing with the practice of palmistry
                    and fortune-telling by Egyptians or Gipsies were passed at different times,
                    beginning in 1530 with 22 Hen. VIII. c. 10. They are now superseded by the
                    provisions of the Vagrant Act of 1824.</p>
                <p>Trials for witchcraft in England do not seem to have been proportionately as
                    numerous or to have been accompanied with such circumstances of cruelty as those
                    in most other countries. This may be accounted for partly by the diminishing
                    authority of the church courts, partly by the absence of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Torture</hi> (g ’.u) as a recognized means of procedure, though no doubt it
                    was too often used in an informal manner. The pricking of the body of an alleged
                    witch by Hopkins the witch-finder and similar wretches in order to find the
                    insensible spot or devil’s mark, the proof by water (a popular survival of the
                    old water ordeal), and similar proceedings, if not judicial torture, at least
                    caused as much pain to the victims. Charges of witchcraft seem to have been made
                    with great frequency against persons of rank during the Wars of the Roses for
                    political purposes. The cases of the duchess of Gloucester and Jane Shore will
                    at once occur to the mind, and neither Edward IV. nor his queen were exempt. The
                    duke of Clarence was accused of imputing witchcraft to the former; and the
                    latter and her mother, the duchess of Bedford, were charged with having obtained
                    the promise of marriage from the king by magical means. Trials in England were
                    most numerous in the 17th century. In the case of the Lancashire witches in 1634
                    seventeen persons were condemned on the evidence of one boy. In the period from
                    1645 to 1647 between two and three hundred are said to have been indicted in
                    Suffolk and Essex alone, of whom more than half were convicted.<note

                        type="authorial"><p>In this case, tried at the assizes at Bury St Edmunds on
                            March 16, 1664-65, two widows named Rose Cullender and Annie Duny were
                            accused of bewitching young children. The main points of the evidence
                            were these. There had been a quarrel between the accused and the parents
                            of the children, and the accused had uttered threats against them. The
                            children fell into fits and vomited crooked pins, and once one of them
                            vomited a twopenny nail with a broad head; they cried out the names of
                            the accused in their fits; they could not pronounce the words “Lord,”
                            “Jesus,” or “Christ” in reading, but when they came to “Satan” or
                            “devil” they cried, “This bites, but makes me speak it right well.” One
                            of the children fell into a swoon after being suckled by one of the
                            accused, and out of the child’s blanket fell a great toad which exploded
                            in the fire like gunpowder, and immediately afterwards the alleged witch
                            was seen sitting at home maimed and scorched. Evidence of finding the
                            witch’s mark was given, and then evidence of reputation, viz., that the
                            accused, besides being themselves accounted witches, had had some of
                            their kindred condemned as such. A farmer swore that once when his cart
                            had touched Cullender’s house it overturned continually and they could
                            not get it home. Sir Thomas Browne testified that the swooning fits were
                            natural, heightened to great excess by the subtlety of the devil
                            co-operating with the witches. Experiments upon the children were then
                            made in court by bringing them into contact with the witches and others.
                            These were of so unsatisfactory a nature that many present openly
                            declared that they thought the children impostors. The chief baron in
                            his summing up said that there were such creatures as witches was
                            undoubted, for the Scriptures affirmed it and the wisdom of nations had
                            provided laws against such persons. The report alleges that after
                            conviction of the accused the children immediately recovered.</p></note>
                    In many of these trials the accused confessed before execution. The reasons
                    which urged them to confess not only impossibilities, but impossibilities of the
                    most revolting kind, are not very easy to discover. In some cases, no doubt, the
                    object was to escape the misery of life as a reputed witch. The theory of
                    witchcraft, too, was universal and well known, and the revolting details of
                    worship of the devil and of the witches’ sabbath must have been familiar to all.
                    Torture, as the Milan case shows (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Torture),</hi> might
                    force from the accused confession of an impossible crime, and even without
                    torture instances have been known in modern times where women have charged
                    themselves with offences in which they were the only believers.<note

                <p>Towards the end of the 17th century the feeling towards witchcraft began to
                    change. The case of Hathaway in 1702 no doubt accelerated the decay of the old
                    belief. He was convicted of cheating and assault by falsely pretending to be
                    bewitched and by making an attack on an alleged witch.<note anchored="true"

                    convicted at Hertford, but not executed. A case said to have occurred in 1716
                    does not rest on good authority. This change of feeling was no doubt caused to a
                    great extent by the works of writers, few in number but strong in argument, who
                    from the time of Reginald <hi rend="smallcaps">Scot (j.v.)</hi> struck at the
                    very foundations of the popular belief. One of the most interesting but
                    least-known writers is George Gifford, whose views are in the nature of a
                    compromise. His point is that the devil may deceive not only witches but their
                        accusers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    must be very seldom. As lately as 1718 Dr Hutchinson, bishop of Down and Connor,
                    thought it worth while to argue against witchcraft, but rather from the popular
                    than the scientific point of view.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    little to shake the prevailing opinion. Coke, Bacon, and Hale certainly admitted

                    subject; and Blackstone in guarded language said that its exclusion from the
                    list of crimes was not to be understood as implying a denial of the possibility
                    of such an offence, though, following Addison, he would not give credit to any
                    particular modern instance.</p>
                <p>In the present state of the law pretended supernatural powers may be such as to
                    bring those professing them under the criminal law, or to make void a transfer
                    of property caused by belief in their existence. The Act of 1736 enacted that
                    any person pretending to use witchcraft, tell fortunes, or discover stolen goods
                    by skill in any occult or crafty science, was to be imprisoned for a year, to
                    stand in the pillory, and to find sureties for good behaviour. This is still
                    law, except as to the pillory. By the Vagrant Act of 1824, 5 Geo. IV. c. 83, s.
                    4, any person pretending or professing to tell fortunes, or using any subtle
                    craft, means, or device, by palmistry or otherwise, to deceive and impose on any
                    of Her Majesty’s subjects, is to be deemed a rogue and vagabond. Under this Act
                    a person may be convicted for attempting to deceive by falsely pretending to
                    have the supernatural faculty of obtaining from invisible agents and the spirits
                    of the dead answers, messages, and manifestations of power, viz., noises, raps,
                    and the winding up of a musical box.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> The principal Act of the Scottish parliament
                    was 1563, c. 73 (ratified and confirmed in 1649), making it a capital offence to
                    use witchcraft, sorcery, or necromancy, or to pretend to such knowledge, or to
                    seek help from witches. It was repealed by 9 Geo. II. c. 5. Trials were either
                    before the ordinary courts or, more frequently, before special tribunals erected
                    by the authority of commissions from time to time issued by the privy council,
                    often on the petition of a presbytery or the General Assembly. Boxes were placed
                    in the churches to receive accusations. The frequency of cases is shown by an
                    order of parliament in 1661 that justices depute should go once a week at least
                    to Musselburgh and Dalkeith to try persons accused of witchcraft. In these
                    trials evidence of the wildest description was admitted. Anything was relevant,
                    especially if sworn to by a professed witch-finder or witch-pricker, a position
                    in which one Kincaid, like Hopkins in England, attained special eminence.
                    Torture was used in most cases, and in an aggravated form, as it was supposed
                    that the devil protected his votaries from the effects of ordinary torture. A
                    special form of iron collar and gag called “the witch’s bridle” was generally
                    used. The details of the trials in Pitcairn’s <hi rend="italic">Criminal
                        Trials</hi> are utterly revolting, especially those of Bessie Dunlop in 1576
                    and of Dr Fian in 1590. One of the charges in the former case is very
                    remarkable, and the accused herself confessed it, that she acted under the
                    guidance of the spirit of Thome Reid who had been killed at Pinkie in 1547. In
                    some cases a charge of witchcraft was joined with a charge of another crime, as
                    of murder in the master of Orkney’s case, of treason in Dr Fian’s, accused of
                    raising a storm at sea when the king was on a voyage.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>All these cases will be found in vol. i.
                            of Pitcairn. In one case (noted at p. 216), a jury having acquitted an
                            accused woman who had confessed under torture, the king had them tried
                            for wilful error.</p></note> James VI. was frequently present in person
                    at trials for witchcraft, and the most horrible cases recorded are those which
                    occurred in his reign. The full pleadings in a charge are given in the case of
                    Margaret Wallace.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>Pitcairn, vol. iii. p. 508.</p></note> It is noticeable that the
                    articles of dittay began by resting the criminality of sorcery upon the divine
                    law as contained in the 20th chapter of Leviticus and the 18th chapter of
                    Deuteronomy. The punishment was generally burning. The last execution took place
                    in 1722, after conviction before the sheriff of Sutherland. As to pretended
                    powers, the Act of 1736 applies to Scotland, and at common law obtaining money
                    by pretending to tell fortunes or recover property by enchantment is punishable
                    as falsehood, fraud, and wilful imposition.</p>

                    Elizabeth was adopted almost word for word by 28 Eliz. c. 2 (I.). The only other
                    Act of the Irish parliament bearing on the question was 10 Car. I., sess. 2, c.
                    19 (I.), enacting that if a person bewitched in one county died in another the
                    person guilty of causing his death might be tried in the county where the death
                    happened. It is remarkable that this Act is based upon an English Act, 2 and 3
                    Edw. VI. c. 24, dealing with the venue in criminal trials, but the English Act
                    does not mention witchcraft. 28 Eliz. c. 2 was not repealed until 1821 by 1 and
                    2 Geo. IV. c. 18, so that Ireland appears to be distinguished as the last
                    country in which penalties against witchcraft were retained in statute law.</p>

                    sorcerers, with death those who exercised magic themselves. The “Chambre

                    resulted in the condemnation in 1680 of a woman named Voisin for sorcery and

                    1811 in the department of Yonne. The slander consisted in an allegation by the
                    defendant that the complainants had danced around the devil, who was seated on a
                    gilded arm-chair as president of the dance. The tribunal of police thought the
                    matter more a subject of ridicule than of injury and dismissed it, but this
                    judgment was quashed by the court of cassation on the ground that the charge was
                    one which might trouble the public peace. In Spain and Italy there is a
                    considerable body of legislation on the subject of witchcraft. For instance, the

                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Partida vii. tit.

                    witches, especially in love matters. A distinction was drawn between divination
                    by astronomy, which was legitimate, and that by augury from birds or by
                    incantation over water or a mirror. On the Continent, as in England, there was
                    during two centuries a steady flow of literary attack on the reasonableness of
                    belief in witchcraft. The earliest attack was made in Germany, the country which
                    had distinguished itself by the vigour of its prosecutions of the crime.
                    Cornelius Agrippa, in his <hi rend="italic">De Occulta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Philosophia,</hi> was not entirely orthodox on the subject; and it was more

                    Wier or Weier in 1563, twenty-one years earlier than Reginald Scot’s work. Wier

                    Germany, and by B. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bekker</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.ν.)</hi>
                    in the Netherlands. The work of Spee, originally published anonymously, appears
                    to have caused a great sensation at the time and to have caused a relaxation of
                    prosecutions in order to give opportunity for further inquiry. The work takes
                    the form of fifty-two doubts, the first of which is “An Sagae Striges seu
                    Malefici revera existant ?” The general conclusion is that, although witches
                    exist in general, the question of their operation in particular cases is open to
                    so much doubt that it would be well to suspend proceedings for a time. The
                    writer did not profess entire disbelief, as did Bekker. The main idea of <hi
                        rend="italic">De Betooνerde Wereld</hi> of the latter is that good and evil
                    spirits could have no effect or influence on earthly affairs, for spirit could
                    not act on matter. All prosecutions for witchcraft were therefore unjust, and
                    against the honour of God and the advantage of man. During the same period other
                    writers both lay and legal treated the question incidentally. Montaigne was
                    sceptical; Montesquieu, while not actually intimating disbelief, enjoined the
                    greatest care in trying accusations. As in England, the current of literary
                    feeling was not uniformly op posed to popular belief, for Wier was answered by
                    Bodin, and Luther and other eminent writers no doubt had full faith in the
                    existence of witchcraft.</p>
