                    and from this habit is commonly reputed to have its name; but since it is in
                    some parts of England also known as “Woodspeight” (erroneously written
                    “Woodspite”)—the latter syllable being cognate with the German <hi rend="italic"
                    >Specht</hi> and the French <hi rend="italic">Ëpeiche,</hi> to say nothing
                    possibly of the Latin <hi rend="italic">Picus</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the
                    vulgar explanation seems open to doubt.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The number of English names, ancient and modern, by which
                    these birds are known is very great, and even a bare list of them could not be
                    here given. The Anglo-Saxon was <hi rend="italic">Higera</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Higere,</hi> and to this may plausibly be traced “Hickwall,”
                    now-a-days used in some parts of the country, and the older “Hickway,” corrupted
                    first into “Highhaw,” and, after its original meaning was lost, into “Hewhole,”
                    which in North America has been still further corrupted into “Highhole” and more
                    recently into ‘ ‘ High-holder.” Another set of names includes “Whetile” and
                    “Woodwale,” which, different as they look, have a common derivation perceptible
                    in the intermediate form “Witwale.” The Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wodake</hi> ( = Woodhack) is another name apparently identical in meaning with
                    that commonly applied to Woodpecker.</p><p/></note> More than 300 species of
                    Woodpecker have been described, and they have been very variously grouped by
                    systematists; but all admit that they form a very natural Family <hi
                    rend="italic">Picidae,</hi> which according to the view taken in this series of
                    articles belongs to the Order <hi rend="italic">Picariae.</hi> Prof. Huxley <hi
                    rend="italic">{Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1867, p. 467) would separate the
                    Woodpeckers still more under the name of <hi rend="italic">Celeomorphae,</hi>
                    and Prof. Parker <hi rend="italic">{Trans. R. Microsc. Society,</hi> 1872, p.
                    219) ∙would raise them still higher as <hi rend="italic">Saurognathae.</hi> They
                    are generally of bright particoloured plumage, in which black, white, brown,
                    olive, green, yellow, orange, or scarlet—the last commonly visible on some part
                    of the head—mingled in varying proportions, and most often strongly contrasted
                    with one another, appear; while the less conspicuous markings take the form of
                    bars, spangles, tear-drops, arrow-heads, or scales. Woodpeckers inhabit most
                    parts of the world, with the exception of Madagascar and the Australian Region,
                    save Celebes and Flores; but it may be worth stating that no member of the group
                    is known to have occurred in Egypt.</p>
                <p>Of the three British species, the Green Woodpecker, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gecinus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Picus viridis,</hi> though almost unknown in
                    Scotland or Ireland, is the commonest, frequenting wooded districts, and more
                    often heard than seen, its laughing cry (whence the name “Yaffil” or “Yaffle,”
                    by which it is in many parts known), and undulating flight afford equally good
                    means of recognition, even when it is not near enough for its colours to be
                    discerned. About the size of a Jay, its scarlet crown and bright yellow rump,
                    added to its prevailing grass-green plumage, make it a sightly bird, and hence
                    it often suffers at the hands of those who wish to keep its stuffed skin as an
                    ornament. Besides the scarlet crown, the cock bird has a patch of the same
                    colour running backλvard from the base of <pb break="no"

                    conspicuous colour, generally red, on this part is characteristic of very many
                    Woodpeckers, and careless writers often call it “mystacial,” or some more
                    barbarously “moustachial,” Considering that moustaches spring from above the
                    mouth, and have nothing to do with the mandible or lower jaw, no term could be
                    more misleading.</p></note> Woodpeckers in general are very shy birds, and to
                    observe the habits of the species is not easy. Its ways, however, are well worth
                    watching, since the ease with which it mounts, almost always spirally, the
                    vertical trunks and oblique arms of trees as it searches the interstices of the
                    bark for its food, flying off when it reaches the smaller or upper
                    branches—either to return to the base of the same tree and renew its course on a
                    fresh line, or to begin upon another tree near by—and the care it shews in its
                    close examination, will repay a patient observer. The nest almost always
                    consists of a hole, chiselled by the birds’ strong beak, impelled by very
                    powerful muscles, in the upright trunk or arm of a tree, the opening being quite
                    circular, and continued as a horizontal passage that reaches to the core, whence
                    it is pierced downward for nearly a foot. There a chamber is hollowed out in
                    which the eggs, often to the number of six, white, translucent, and glossy, are
                    laid with no bedding but a few chips that may have not been thrown out.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It often happens that, just
                    as the Woodpecker’s labours are over, a pair of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Starlings</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.ν.)</hi> will take possession of the
                    newly-bored hole, and, by conveying into it some nesting-furniture, render it
                    unfit for the rightful tenants, who thereby suffer ejectment, and have to begin
                    all their trouble again. It has been stated of this and other Woodpeckers that
                    the chips made in cutting the hole are carefully removed by the birds to guard
                    against their leading to the discovery of the nest. The present writer has had
                    ample opportunity of observing the contrary as regards this species and, to some
                    extent, the Pied Woodpecker next to be mentioned. Indeed there is no surer way
                    of finding the nest of the Green Woodpecker than by scanning the ground in the
                    presumed locality, for the tree which holds the nest is always recognizable by
                    the chips scattered at its foot.</p></note> The young are not only hatched
                    entirely naked, but seem to become fledged without any of the downy growth
                    common to most birds. Their first plumage is dull in colour, and much marked
                    beneath with bars, crescents, and arrowheads.</p>
                <p>Of generally similar habits are the two other Woodpeckers which inhabit
                    Britain—the Pied or Greater Spotted, and the Barred or Lesser Spotted
                    Woodpecker— <hi rend="italic">Bendrocopus major</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D.
                    minor—</hi> each of great beauty, from the contrasted white, blueblack, and
                    scarlet that enter into its plumage. Both of these birds have an extraordinary
                    habit of causing by quickly-repeated blows of their beak on a branch, or even on
                    a small bough, a vibrating noise, louder than that of a watchman’s rattle, and
                    enough to excite the attention of the most incurious. Though the Pied Woodpecker
                    is a resident in Britain, its numbers receive a considerable accession nearly
                    every autumn.</p>
                <p>The three species just mentioned are the only Woodpeckers that inhabit Britain,
                    though several others are mistakenly recorded as occurring in the country—and
                    especially the Great Black Woodpecker, the <hi rend="italic">Picus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">martius</hi> of Linnaeus, which must be regarded as the type of
                    that genus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    expression <hi rend="italic">Picus</hi><hi rend="italic">martius</hi> was by old
                    writers used in a very general sense for all birds that climbed trees, not only
                    Woodpeckers, but for the <hi rend="smallcaps">Nuthatch</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tree-creeper</hi><hi rend="italic">{qq.v.)</hi> as well. The
                    adjective <hi rend="italic">martius</hi> loses all its significance if it be
                    removed from <hi rend="italic">Picus,</hi> as some even respectable authorities
                    have separated it.</p></note> This fine species considerably exceeds the Green
                    Woodpecker in size, and except for its red cap is wholly black. It is chiefly an
                    inhabitant of the fir forests of the Old World, from Lapland to Galicia, and
                    across Siberia to Japan.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The persistency with which many writers on British birds have for years
                    included this species among them is a marvellous instance of the durability of
                    error, for not a case of its asserted occurrence in this country is on record
                    that will bear strict investigation, and the origin of the mistake has been more
                    than once shewn.</p></note> In North America this species is replaced by <hi
                    rend="italic">Picus pileatus,</hi> there generally known as the Logcock, an
                    equally fine species, but variegated with white; and further to the southward
                    occur two that are finer still, <hi rend="italic">P. principalis,</hi> the
                    Ivory-billed Woodpecker, and <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >imperialis.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Picinae</hi> indeed flourish in the New
                    World, nearly one-half of the described species being American, but out of the
                    large number that inhabit Canada and the United States there is here room to
                    mention only a few.</p>
                <p>First of these is the Californian Woodpecker, <hi rend="italic">Melanerpes
                    formicivorus,</hi> which has been said to display an amount of providence beyond
                    almost any other bird in the number of acorns which it collects and, as shewn in
                    the accompanying figure, fixes tightly in holes which it purposely makes in the
                    bark of trees, and thus “a large pine forty or fifty feet high will present the
                    appearance of being closely studded with brass nails, the heads only being
                    visible.” An extraordinary thing is that this is not done to furnish food in
                    winter, for the species migrates, and after journeying a thousand miles or more
                    only returns in spring to the forests where its supplies are laid up. It has
                    been asserted that the acorns thus stored are always those which contain a
                    maggot, and, being fitted into the sockets prepared for them cup-end foremost,
                    the enclosed insects are unable to escape, as they otherwise would, and are thus
                    ready for consumption by the birds on their return from the south. But this
                    statement has again been contradicted, and moreover it is alleged that these
                    Woodpeckers follow their instinct so blindly that “they do not distinguish
                    between an acorn and a pebble,” so that they “fill up the holes they have
                    drilled with so much labor, not only with acorns but occasionally with stones”
                    (c∕. Baird, Brewer, and Ridgway, <hi rend="italic">North American Birds,</hi>
                    ii. pp. 569-571).</p>
                <p>The next North-American form deserving notice is the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colaptes,</hi> represented in the north and east by <hi rend="italic">C.
                    auratus,</hi> the Goldenwinged Woodpecker or Flicker, in most parts of the
                    country a familiar bird, but in the south and west replaced by the allied <hi
                    rend="italic">C. rnexicanus,</hi> easily distinguishable among other
                    characteristics by having the shafts of its quills red instead of yellow. It is
                    curious, however, that, in the valleys of the upper Missouri and Yellowstone
                    rivers, where the range of the two kinds overlaps, birds are found presenting an
                    extraordinary mixture of the otherwise distinctive features of each, and these
                    birds have been described as hybrids. It would be premature to say whether this
                    view be correct or not, and in regard to it Dr Coues has well remarked <hi
                    rend="italic">{Birds of the Northwest,</hi> p. 294), “that it is only in virtue
                    of missing links we are enabled to predicate species in any case,” thereby
                    indicating the possibility (not entertained for the first time) that these
                    supposed hybrids are examples of the more generalized form of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colaptes,</hi> which becomes differentiated further to the north and south into
                    the specialized <hi rend="italic">C. auratus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C.
                    rnexicanus.</hi> Thus the subject is one highly interesting to the student of
                    evolution.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>When more is
                    known it will very likely be found that a somewhat similar state of things
                    exists in the Palaearctic area in regard to the various local races of, or
                    “species” allied to, <hi rend="italic">Dendrocopus major</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">D. minor</hi> respectively. At present the only cases that seem to
                    be strictly parallel are those furnished by the genera <hi rend="italic"

                    >Euploeamus {cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Pheasant).</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>Some other Woodpeckers deserve especial notice,—among them the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colaptes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Soroplex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >campestris,</hi> which inhabits the treeless plains of Paraguay and La Plata,
                    and had become fully adapted to a territorial mode of life, as long ago observed
                    by Azara and Darwin, but yet has readily returned, since the opportunity has
                    been afforded, to the arboreal habits of its relatives, as remarked by Mr Hudson
                    <hi rend="italic">{Proc. Zook Society,</hi> 1'870, pp. 158-160). A similar
                    provision of habit and haunt obtains in a South-African Woodpecker, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gco-colaptes olivaceus,</hi> which lives almost entirely on the

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Picidae</hi> offer a fruitful ground for taxonomical

                    be but nearly allied. Some of the most striking of these differences often lie
                    in the form and development of the hyoid bones, and of the muscles which work
                    the extensile tongue. Unhappily the subject does not seem to have been pursued
                    by any other investigator; but it may be mentioned that some limited researches
