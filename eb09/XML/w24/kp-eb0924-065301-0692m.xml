                    Oxfordshire, England, is situated on a stream formerly called the Ennis and now
                    the Glyme, which separates Old and New Woodstock, about 8 miles north-west of
                    Oxford. The church of St Mary Magdalene, in New Woodstock, is of Norman date,
                    but has been greatly altered by restoration, and now has Decorated chancel with
                    Perpendicular additions, clerestoried nave, Decorated north aisle and Early
                    English south aisle retaining a portion of the Norman doorway, Perpendicular
                    west porch, and Perpendicular west tower. The church contains many interesting
                    monuments. The town-hall, erected in 1766 after the designs of Sir William
                    Chambers, includes a market-place and the fire brigade station, with public hall
                    and council-chamber above. Almshouses were erected in 1798 by Caroline, duchess
                    of Marlborough, and endowed with .£3500, which has been increased by bequest at
                    different periods. The town is dependent chiefly on agriculture, but the
                    manufacture of leather gloves has been carried on from an early period. By the
                    Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, the borough (area about 30 acres), formerly
                    governed by a charter of Charles IL, was placed under a corporation. The
                    population of the parliamentary borough (area 20,804 acres), which had been
                    extended in 1832 and ceased to þe separately represented in 1885, was 7033 in
                    1881.</p>
                <p>The old manor house of Woodstock, which is supposed to have been built upon the
                    site of a Roman villa, was at an early period a royal residence. Here Alfred the
                    Great is said to have resided while translating Boetius. At a witenagemot held
                    at Woodstock by King Ethelred a code of laws was published for the government of
                    the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Henry I. made Woodstock a favourite residence, and
                    formed a zoological garden there. Woodstock was the scene of Henry II.’s
                    courtship of Rosamond Clifford, and his frequent visits to the place led to the
                    building of the nucleus of the town of New Woodstock. A first assize was held at
                    Woodstock in 1184. It sent representatives to parliament from 1301-2 till 1885.
                    It was incorporated by Henry VI. in 1453, and the charter was confirmed and
                    extended by successive monarchs, that granted by Charles II. remaining the
                    governing charter till 1882. Queen Elizabeth was a prisoner at Woodstock from
                    May 1554 till May 1555, and after her accession to the throne visited it in 1566
                    and again in 1575. In 1576 she made the town a staple of wool and yarn.
                    Woodstock was visited by James I. and by Arabella Stuart. During the Civil War
                    it was the scene of frequent military operations, and after a siege it
                    surrendered to the parliament 20th April 1646. After the battle of Blenheim the
                    manor of Woodstock was by Act 3 and 4 of Queen Anne, chap. 4, bestowed in
                    perpetuity on John duke of Marlborough. Blenheim palace, built by the duke from
                    the designs of Sir John Vanbrugh, was completed in 1715. In 1723 the old manor
                    house was destroyed and the site levelled.</p>
