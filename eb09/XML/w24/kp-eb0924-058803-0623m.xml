                    in moist situations. They are not unrepresented in the tropics, but have
                    hitherto not been discovered in Australia or the South Sea Islands. Their leaves
                    are deciduous, alternate, simple, generally much more long than broad, whence
                    the term willow-leaved has become proverbial. At their base they are provided
                    with stipules, which are also modified to form the scales investing the winter
                    buds. The flowers are borne in catkins or amenta, which are on one tree male
                    only, on another female. Each male flower consists of a small scale or bract, in
                    whose axil are usually two, sometimes three, rarely five stamens, and still more
                    rarely a larger number. In addition there is a small glandular disk, which
                    assumes different shapes in different species. The female flowers are equally
                    simple, consisting of a bract, from whose axil arises usually a very short
                    stalk, surmounted by two carpels adherent one to the other for their whole
                    length, except that the upper ends of the styles are separated into two stigmas.
                    When ripe the two carpels separate in the form of two valves and liberate a
                    large number of seeds, each provided at the base with a tuft of silky hairs, and
                    containing a straight embryo without any investing perisperm or albumen.
                    Fertilization is effected by insects, especially by bees, which are directed in
                    their search by the colour and fragrance of the flowers.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n624/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0624-0589"/>
                <p>Some pollen must also be transported by the wind to the female flowers. The tuft
                    of hairs at the base of the seed doubtless facilitates rapid dispersion of the
                    seed, early germination of which is rendered desirable owing to its tenuity and
                    the absence of any perisperm. Although the limitations of the genus are well
                    marked, and its recognition in consequence easy, it is otherwise with regard to
                    the species. The greatest difference of opinion exists among botanists as to
                    their number and the bounds to be assigned to each. The cross-fertilization that
                    takes place between the species of coursé intensifies the difficulty. Andersson,
                    a Swede, spent nearly a quarter of a century in their investigation, and
                    ultimately published a monograph which is the standard authority on the subject.
                    He admits about a hundred species. Some botanists have enumerated eighty species
                    from Great Britain alone, while others count only a dozen or fifteen. To
                    illustrate the great perplexity surrounding the subject, we may mention that to
                    one species, <hi rend="italic">S. nigricans,</hi> one hundred and twenty
                    synonyms have been attached. Some of these are doubtless such as no botanist,
                    with adequate material for forming an opinion, would accept; but, after making
                    the necessary deductions for actual mistakes and misstatements, there still
                    remains a large number upon which legitimate differences of opinion prevail.
                    Andersson says that he has rarely seen two specimens of this species which were
                    alike in the collective characters offered by the stature, foliage, and catkins.
                    No better example could be found of the almost limitless variation in so-called
                    species, so that the attempt to define the indefinable can at best result only
                    in an arbitrary grouping.</p>
                <p>Few genera have greater claims to notice from an economic point of view. As
                    timber trees many of the species are valuable from their rapidity of growth and
                    for the production of light durable wood, serviceable for many purposes. Among
                    the best trees of this kind are <hi rend="italic">S. fragilis,</hi> especially
                    the variety known as <hi rend="italic">S. fragilis,</hi> var. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Russelliana,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">S. alba,</hi> the white or Huntingdon
                    willow. These trees are usually found growing by rivers’ banks or in other moist
                    situations, and are generally pollarded for the purpose of securing a crop of
                    straight poles. This plan is, however, objectionable, as inducing decay in the
                    centre of the trunk. Where poles are required, it is better to treat the trees
                    as coppice and to cut the trunk level with the soil. <hi rend="italic">S'.
                    Capraea, a</hi> hedgerow tree, generally grows in drier situations. It is a
                    useful timber tree, and its wood, like that of Ä <hi rend="italic">alba,</hi> is
                    prized in the manufacture of charcoal. Its catkins are collected in England in
                    celebration of Palm Sunday, the gaily-coloured flowers being available in early
                    spring when other decorations of the kind are scarce. Certain sorts of willow
                    are largely used for basket-making and wicker-work. The species employed for
                    this purpose are mostly of shrubby habit, and are known under the collective
                    name of osiers. The best for planting, according to Mr Scaling, is the bitter
                    osier, S', <hi rend="italic">purpurea</hi>; planted on rich, well-drained soil,
                    subject to occasional immersion, this willow may be grown profitably for
                    basket-work. It is also well adapted for forming wind-breaks or screens, or for
                    holding the banks of streams and preventing the removal of the soil by the
                    current. <hi rend="italic">S. viminalis</hi> is one of the best of the green
                    osiers, suitable for hoops and valuable for retaining the soil on sloping
                    embankments. <hi rend="italic">S. vitellina</hi> yields the yellow osiers.
                    Osiers are largely imported into England from Belgium and France, but might with
                    advantage be much more abundantly grown in the United Kingdom than they are.
                    They are easily propagated by truncheons or cuttings, inserted in a slanting
                    direction into the soil for a depth of 8 to 10 inches. Mr Scaling recommends
                    that they be planted 18 inches apart, thus employing about 20,000 cuttings per
                    acre, the whole cost of planting being estimated ait £25 the acre. A crop is
                    obtained the third year after planting, and one may be expected annually for the
                    succeeding ten years. The average yield is cited at 6 to 7⅛ tons, ranging in
                    price from £2, 10s. to £3, 10s. a ton (unpeeled). Land unsuitable for root or
                    grain crops can be utilized for the growth of osiers; but, as in the case of all
                    other plants, good cultivation, including the selection of sorts appropriate to
                    the locality, drainage, manure, &amp;c., ensures the best return. N. <hi
                    rend="italic">acuminatu</hi> and other species do well by the seaside, and are
                    serviceable as wind-screens, nurse-trees, and hedges. <hi rend="italic">S.
                    daphnoides, S. repens,</hi> and other dwarf kinds are useful for binding heathy
                    or sandy soil. In addition to their use for timber or basket-making, willows
                    contain a large quantity of tannin in their bark. A bitter principle named <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Salicin</hi> (g ’.τ.) is also extracted from the bark. As
                    ornamental trees some willows also take a high rank. The λvhite willow is a
                    great favourite, while the drooping habit of the weeping willow renders it very
                    attractive. Though named <hi rend="italic">S. bαbyloηica,</hi> it is really a
                    native of China, the willow of the Euphrates (Ps. cxxxvii.) being in all
                    probability <hi rend="italic">Populus euphraiica.</hi><hi rend="italic">S.
                    babylonien</hi> is sometimes spoken of as Pope’s willow, having been cultivated
                    by that poet, of as Napoleon’s willow, because his tomb at St Helena is
                    overshadowed by a tree of this species, from which many offsets exist or are
                    reputed to exist in modern gardens. <hi rend="italic">S. regalis</hi> has very
                    white, silvery leaves. <hi rend="italic">S. rosrnarinifolia</hi> is remarkable
                    for its very narrow leaves, —purplish above, silvery beneath.</p>
