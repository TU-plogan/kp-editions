                    Mainz and 20 miles north-west of Heidelberg. The town is irregularly built, and

                    formerly contained many ecclesiastical buildings, now represented by eight
                    churches, two of which, however, are no longer used for divine service. The
                    principal church and chief building is the spacious Romanesque cathedral, which
                    ranks beside the cathedrals of Spires and Mainz among the famous ecclesiastical
                    edifices of the Rhine. This magnificent building, with four round towers, two
                    large domes, and a choir at each end, has a specially imposing exterior, though
                    the impression produced by the interior is also one of great dignity and
                    simplicity, heightened by the natural colour of the red sandstone of which it is
                    built. In this last particular it differs from the cathedrals of Mainz and
                    Spires, where the natural colour of the stone no longer appears in the interior.
                    Only the lower part of the western towers belongs to the original building
                    consecrated in 1110; the remainder dates from 1181, with the exception of the
                    west choir and the vaulting, which were built in the 13th century, and the
                    elaborate south portal, which was added in the 14th century. The ornamentation
                    of the older parts is simple to the verge of rudeness; and even the more
                    elaborate later forms show no high development of workmanship. The church is 485
                    feet long and 114 feet wide; the transepts, which are at the west end, are about
                    120 feet long (inside measurement), and the choir is 160 feet high. The
                    cathedral belongs to the Roman Catholic community, who possess also the church
                    of St Martin and the Liebfrauenkirche, a handsome Gothic edifice outside the
                    town, finished in 1467. The principal Protestant place of worship is Trinity
                    church, built in 1726. Second in interest to the cathedral is the church of St
                    Paul, also in the Romanesque style, and dating from 1102-16, with a choir of the
                    early 13th century. It is adjoined by the remains of an abbey and cloisters of
                    various epochs. Since 1881 this church has contained an interesting museum of
                    national antiquities. The late Romanesque St Andrew’s church is also used for
                    secular purposes. The synagogue, an unassuming building erected in the 11th
                    century and restored in the 13th, is now completely modernized. The Jewish
                    community of Worms (about 1400 in number) claims to be the most ancient in
                    Germany, and to have existed continuously since before the Christian era, though
                    the earliest authentic mention of it occurs in 588. A curious tradition,
                    illustrating the efforts of the dispersed people to conciliate their oppressors,
                    asserts that the Jews of Worms gave their voice against the crucifixion, but
                    that their messenger did not arrive at Jerusalem until after the event.</p>
                <p>The town-house of Worms was restored in 1884. The Bischofshof, in which the most
                    famous diet of Worms (1521) was held, is now replaced by a handsome modern
                    residence. The Luginsland is an old watch-tower of the 13th century. Worms also
                    contains numerous schools and a richly endowed hospital. In the Luther-Platz
                    rises the imposing Luther monument (unveiled in 1868), consisting of a series of
                    twelve statues on a platform 16 feet square. In the centre the colossal statue
                    of Luther rises, on a pedestal at the base of which are sitting figures of Peter
                    Waldus, Wycliffe, Huss, and Savonarola, the heralds of the Reformation; at the
                    corners of the platform, on lower pedestals, are statues of Luther’s
                    contemporaries, Melanchthon, Reuchlin, Philip of Hesse, and Frederick the Wise
                    of Saxony, between which are allegorical figures of Magdeburg (mourning), Spires
                    (protesting), and Augsburg (confessing). The greater part of the work, which
                    took nine years to execute, was designed by Rietschel, and carried out after his
                    death in 1861 by Kietz, Dondorf, and Schelling.</p>
                <p>The trade and industry of Worms are not unimportant. The leading resource of the
                    inhabitants is wine-growing, the most famous vintage being known as
                    Liebfrauenmilch, grown on vineyards near the Liebfrauenkirche. Luginlander and
                    Katterlocher are also well-known varieties. The manufacture of patent leather
                    employs 3000 hands. Machinery, chicory, slates, &lt;fcc., are also produced.
                    Worms possesses a river-harbour, and carries on some trade by water. The
                    population in 1885 was 21,903, of whom about one-third were Roman Catholic. In
                    its prosperous days Worms is estimated to have had from 40,000 to 70,000
                    inhabitants.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Borbetomagus,</hi> the name by which Worms was known in Roman
                    times, seems to indicate a Celtic origin for the town. The modern name is
                    usually connected with Wurm or Lindwurm, the German word for a dragon. Drusus is
                    said to have erected a fort on the site of the town in 14 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> As a settlement of the Germanic tribe of the Vangiones, it existed
                    under Roman protection till about the middle of the 5th century. The Burgundians
                    then took it and made it their capital, and its name appears in many of the
                    heroic legends of that people. King Gunther and Brunhilde held their court at
                    Worms; and here Sigfried wooed the fair Chriemhild. The “Rosengarten,” often
                    mentioned in these legends, lay on the opposite bank of the Rhine. Under the
                    Franconians this town was also important; and it was a frequent residence of
                    Charlemagne and his successors. The scene of the graceful though unhistorical
                    romance of Eginhard and Emma, the daughter of Charlemagne, is laid at Worms. The
                    first bishop of Worms of whom anything authentic is known was Erembert (670),
                    though an “episcopus Vangionum” is said to have attended a council at Cologne in
                    347. Worms seems to have thriven under the bishops,'but the citizens invariably
                    espoused thecause of the emperors against them, and were rewarded by privileges
                    which fostered the trade of the town and eventually led to its recognition as a
                    free imperial city. Worms was frequently visited by the imperial court, and won
                    the proud title of “Mother of Diets.” The most famous diet was that held in
                    1521, at which Luther appeared to defend his doctrines before Charles V. Four
                    years later the town formally embraced Protestantism. Worms preserved a
                    tolerable prosperity even through the hardships of the Thirty Years’ War; but in
                    1689 it was laid in ashes by the French, a blow from which it has never
                    thoroughly recovered. The peace of Lunéville annexed it in 1801 to France; but
                    in 1815 it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, being then an unimportant town with 6250
                    inhabitants.</p>
