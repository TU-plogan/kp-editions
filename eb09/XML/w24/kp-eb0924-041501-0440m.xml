                    minister of the Independent meeting at Haberdashers’ Hall. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Improvement of the Mind</hi> (1741) Watts has expounded his method
                    of study, but the precepts there laid down can hardly be said to be justified by
                    his example, for it is overwork at this period of his life that is believed to
                    have caused the weak and uncertain health of his subsequent years. Probably it
                    was as much from this cause as from diffidence that he deferred preaching his
                    first sermon till the day he entered on his twenty-fourth year. Meantime he
                    resided as tutor in the family of Sir John Hartopp at Stoke Newington, where he
                    probably prepared the materials of his two educational works,— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Logick, or the Right Use of Reason in the Enquiry after Truth</hi> (1725), and
                    <hi rend="italic">The Knowledge of the Heavens and the Earth Made Easy, or the
                    First Principles of Geography and Astronomy Explained</hi> (1726). His <hi
                    rend="italic">Logic,</hi> Dr Samuel Johnson states, “had been received into the
                    universities,” but this must be regarded rather as an indication of the
                    decadence of logical studies there than a proof of the special excellence of the
                    work. What merits it possesses are of a hortatory and moral kind, and, as Sir
                    William Hamilton says, it is “not worth reading as a book of logic.” In his
                    twenty-fourth year Watts was chosen assistant to Dr Chauncy, pastor of the
                    Independent congregation, Mark Lane, London, and two years later he succeeded as
                    sole pastor. The state of his health led to the appointment of an assistant in
                    1703. In 1704 the congregation removed to Pinner’s Hall, and in 1708 they built
                    a new meeting-house in Bury Street. In 1712 Watts took up his residence with Sir
                    Thomas Abney of Abney Park, where he spent the remainder of his life, the
                    arrangement being continued by Lady Abney after her husband’s death. Watts
                    preached only occasionally, devoting his leisure chiefly to the writing of
                    hymns, the preparation of his sermons for publication, and the composition of
                    theological works. Being little over 5 feet in height, and far from robust in
                    health, he did not specially excel as an orator, although the felicity of his
                    illustrations, his transparent sincerity, and his benevolent wisdom gave to his
                    preaching an exceptional charm. His religious opinions were more liberal in tone
                    than was at that time common in the community to which he belonged; his views
                    regarding Sunday recreation and labour were scarcely of Puritanical strictness;
                    his Calvinism was modified by his rejection of the doctrine of reprobation, and
                    he was in the habit of representing the heaven of the Christian as affording
                    wide scope for the exercise of the special habits and tastes formed by the
                    employments of earth. For an estimate of Watts as a hymn writer, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hymns,</hi> vol. xii. p. 593. He died 25th November 1748, and
                    was buried at Bunhill Fields, where a tombstone was erected to his memory by Sir
                    John Hartopp and Lady Abney. A memorial was also erected to him in Westminster
                    Abbey, and a memorial hall, erected in his honour at Southampton, was opened 6th
                    May 1875.</p>
