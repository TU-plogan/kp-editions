                    form it may be regarded as an irregular polygon, with two large re-entering
                    angles on the south-west and south-east. Its length from N.E. to S.W. is 42
                    miles, while from east to west it measures 40 miles. The total area is 505,864
                    acres, whereof 4958 acres are foreshore, and 8519 are water. No part of the
                    county touches the sea, unless-the estuary of the Kent be regarded as such.</p>
                <p>Physically the county may be roughly divided into four areas. (1) The great
                    upland tract in the northeastern part, bordering on the western margin of
                    Yorkshire and part of Durham, consists mainly of a wild moorland area, rising to
                    elevations of 2780 feet in Dun Fell, 2803 in Dufton Fell, 2591 feet in Mickle
                    Fell, 2008 Nine Standards, 2328 High Seat, 2323 Wilbert Fell, and Swarth Fell
                    2235 feet above the sea. (2) The second area comprises about a third of the
                    massif of the Lake District proper, with its eastward continuation, the Langdale
                    and Ravenstonedale Fells, and also the fells of Middleton and Barbon farther
                    south. These include Helvellyn (3118 feet), Bow Fell (2959), Pika Blisca (2304),
                    Langdale Pike (2300), High Street (2663), Fairfield (2950), the Calf (2220),
                    besides others of considerable elevation. All but the lower parts of the valleys
                    within these two areas lie at or above 1000 feet above Ordnance datum; and more
                    than half the remainder lies between that elevation and 1750 feet, the main mass
                    of high land lying in the area first mentioned. (3) The third area includes the
                    comparatively low country between the northern slopes of that just described and
                    the edge of the uplands to the north-east thereof. This includes the so-called
                    Vale of Eden. About three-fifths of this area lies between the 500 and the 1000
                    feet contour. (4) The Kendal area consists mainly of undulating lowlands, varied
                    by hills ranging in only a few cases up to 1000 feet. More than half this area
                    lies below the 500-feet contour. Westmorland may thus be said to be divided in
                    the middle by uplands ranging in a general southeasterly direction, and to be
                    bordered all along its eastern side by the elevated moorlands of the Pennine
                    chain. The principal rivers are—in the northern area the higher part of the
                    Tees, the Eden with its main tributaries, the Lowther and the Eamont, and in the
                    southern area the Lune and the Kent, with their numerous tributary becks and
                    gills. The lakes include Ullswater (the greater part), Windermere (the whole),
                    Grasmere, Hawes Water, and numerous smaller lakes and tarns, which are chiefly
                    confined to the north-western parts of the county. Amongst the other physical
                    features of more or less interest are numerous crags and scars, chiefly in the
                    neighbourhood of the lakes; others are Mallerstang Edge, Helbeck, above <pb

                    Orton Scars; and the limestone crags west of Kirkby Lonsdale. Amongst the
                    waterfalls are Caldron Snout, on the northern confines of the county, flowing
                    over the Whin Sill, and Stock Gill Force, Rydal Force, Colwith Force, and
                    Dungeon Gill Force, all situated amongst the volcanic rocks in the west. Hell
                    Gill, near the head, of the Eden, and Stenkrith, near Kirkby Stephen, are
                    conspicuous examples of natural arches eroded by the streams flowing through
                    them. <hi rend="underline">Am</hi> ongst the more striking hills outside the
                    massif of the Lake District are Wilbert Fell, Roman Fell, Murton Pike (1949
                    feet), Dufton Pike (1578 feet), and Knock Pike (1306 feet).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The geological formations represented in
                    Westmorland are :—(A) (1) recent deposits, and (2) glacial drift; (B) New Red
                    rocks—(1) Upper New Red, and (2) Lower New Red or Permian; (C) Carboniferous
                    rocks—(1) Coal-Measures and Millstone Grit, (2) Yoredale Rocks and Mountain
                    Limestone, including the Roman Fell beds, Calciferous Sandstones, and the Lower

                    and (3) Cambrian rocks; (E) Metamorphic rocks of different ages; and (F) various
                    Plutonic rocks.</p>
                <p>Alluvium in some form or another occurs as marginal deposits alongside streams,
                    or as deltas where streams enter lakes, or where they spread at the foot of a
                    hill-side. Peat forms a mantle of varying thickness on the damper or the more
                    shady parts of nearly all the uplands, ranging locally up to a thickness of 10
                    feet, and occurs on the sites of old tarns or of old swamps. Screes of rock
                    waste are of general occurrence about the lower parts of nearly all the crags,
                    and as such they play an important part in the scenery of the district. Glacial
                    deposits, in the form of boulder clay, of sand and gravel, or of boulders, are
                    extensively distributed over the lowlands, and to a variable distance up the
                    hill-sides also. They seldom much exceed 100 feet in thickness; but their
                    occurrence is of considerable importance in relation to the scenery, and still
                    more so to the character of the subsoil. Boulders of various kinds are scattered
                    far and wide over nearly all but the highest parts of the county.</p>
                <p>Between the period represented by the boulder clay and the next older deposit in
                    Westmorland a great hiatus exists, which is elsewhere represented by several
                    very important geological formations. Here the newest rock next in the series is
                    the St Bees Sandstone and the gypseous shales at its base, which together
                    probably represent the Bunter series. These soft red sandstones, flags, and
                    marls with gypsum are all confined to the northern part of the county, where
                    they form much of the low ground extending along the foot of the Cross Fell
                    escarpment from the county boundary east of Penrith south-eastward to Kirkby
                    Stephen. Some of the prettiest scenery of these parts (Crowdundle Beck; Mill
                    Beck, Dufton; and Podgill, Kirkby Stephen) owes its character to these rocks.
                    The stone is used extensively for building. Gypsum occurs in workable quantities
                    in the shales near the base. Where fully developed these rocks are not less than
                    2000 feet in thickness. The next formations in descending order consist of the
                    Magnesian Limestone (0-30 feet), the Helton Plant Beds (0-40 feet), the Penrith
                    Sandstone and its horizontal equivalents the Brockrams (0-1200 feet). All these
                    are older than the rocks previously mentioned, but belong to the same series.
                    They occur in the same tract of country.</p>
                <p>The highest rocks of the Carboniferous age in Westmorland are represented by a
                    tiny patch of true Coal-Measures, let down, and so preserved from denudation, by
                    one of the great Pennine faults, between Brough and Barras, in north-eastern
                    Westmorland. These rocks consist of several thick and valuable seams of coal,
                    and of beds of fireclay equally valuable, interbedded with several hundred feet
                    of the usual sandstones and shales.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    in Westmorland. Millstone Grit of the ordinary type underlies these
                    Coal-Measures, and is seen to perhaps a thickness of nearly 2000 feet. Except a
                    small patch exposed near Appleby, and also another near Kirkby Lonsdale, the
                    remainder of the Millstone Grit is confined to the higher parts of the wild
                    moorlands along the eastern border of the county. The highest member of the
                    second subdivision of the Carboniferous is the Yoredale Rocks, which form the
                    chief mass of the hills forming the Westmorland part of the great central
                    watershed of northern England. Most of the Cross Fell escarpment, of Stainmoor,
                    and of the higher parts of the valley of the Eden consist of these rocks, as do
                    also much of the lowlands. They consist essentially of a series of thin beds of
                    limestone, parted by variable thicknesses of sandstone and shales, with here and
                    there a thin coal-seam. Their thickness ranges from 1500 to 2500 feet. The
                    Borradale coal-seam, and the Tan Hill seam, in these rocks, have long been
                    worked for local purposes. Below the Yoredale Rocks limestone preponderates, and
                    the grey limestones of this series form very conspicuous and striking features
                    in the landscape around Kendal, Beetham, and Farleton; Kirkby Stephen, Orton,
                    and Shap; Brough, Helgill, and Murton, and thence north-westward. Near Kirkby
                    Stephen is nearly 2000 feet of this limestone, locally almost undivided. Near
                    Kendal, at Barbon, between Ravenstonedale and Shap Wells, and near Helton occur
                    masses of red gravelly conglomerate and red sandstones belonging to the Upper
                    Old Red. The materials of the conglomerate largely consist of rocks foreign to
                    the district. For a period of immense length preceding the deposition of the
                    Upper Old Red the older rocks of Westmorland seem to have been exposed to a
                    complicated series of disturbances and denudations, with, as a result, the
                    removal from some areas of a thickness of strata above (rather than below) 5
                    miles in thickness. It was across the upturned and denuded ends of this vast
                    pile of rock that the Upper Old Red was laid down. The older strata, grouped
                    under D above, are therefore separated from the Upper Old Red by an unconformity
                    representing the removal from this area, and the accumulation in some unknown
                    area elsewhere, of a pile of rock 5 miles in thickness. This is one of the
                    greatest breaks yet made known in the whole of the geological record.</p>
                <p>The Siluro-Cambrian rocks are perhaps more fully developed in Westmorland and
                    Cumberland than they are anywhere else,—the aggregate thickness of strata
                    referable to one or other of the horizons in this group being at least 6 miles.
                    The highest member of this series is the Kirkby Moor Flags, which consist of a
                    considerable thickness of mudstones and sandstones, much disturbed and contorted
                    in places, and form the whole of the low hill country on the east side of the
                    turnpike road between Kendal and Kirkby Lonsdale, and extending thence eastward
                    to a little beyond the Lune. Lithologically and palaeontologically these rocks
                    agree in a general way with the Ludlow rocks of Shropshire. Their highest beds
                    are unconformable to the Upper Old Red, sometimes violently so. These rocks
                    graduate downward into the Bannisdale Slates, 5200 feet of close alternations of
                    flaggy grits and rudely cleaved sandy mudstones. These rocks occupy a large area
                    around Kendal, and to the south-west of that town. They also form a large part
                    of the Howgill Fells. These in turn graduate downward into the Coniston Grits
                    and Flags, which consist of 7000 feet of alternations of tough micaceous grits
                    and rudely-cleaved mudstones,—the whole mass tending near its base to pass into
                    finely-striped and cleaved mudstones, the Coniston Flags. The tough and durable
                    nature of the harder beds of this series gives rise to a series of mammillated
                    hills. All the rocks of the series here referred to give rise to a type of
                    scenery different in many essential respects from that resulting from the waste
                    of any other rocks in Westmorland, so that the hill scenery south of a line
                    joining Ambleside and Shap Wells is distinctly different from that to the north
                    of that line. Near their base the argillaceous members of the series graduate
                    downwards into a few hundred feet of pale grey-green mudstone, with a peculiar
                    porcellanous texture; and these, in their turn, graduate downwards into a small
                    thickness of pitch-black mudstones, with much the general character of indurated
                    fuller’s earth, and usually crowded with graptolites having the general facies
                    of those elsewhere found in the Llandeilo rocks. The pale grey beds are the
                    Stockdale Beds, or ‘ ‘ pale slates.” The Graptolitic Mudstones locally have at
                    their base a conglomerate, which consists of rolled fragments of rocks from
                    various horizons in the older series. In general terms these two groups of rocks
                    may be described as occurring along a narrow outcrop extending from near
                    Ambleside to Shap Wells. They reappear also near Dufton and at Cautla. In
                    Westmorland the Llandovery beds of Wales appear to be absent, as the rocks next
                    older than the Graptolitic Mudstones consist of rocks characterized by fossils
                    of an unmistakably Bala type. The Westmorland type of these rocks consists of a
                    mass of alternations of volcanic tuffs and lavas, with the marine equivalents of
                    these, and with limestones and shales, the whole series thinning as it is traced
                    toward the centre of the Lake District near the head of Windermere. The Coniston
                    Limestone is the best known member of this series. The series as a whole,
                    however, finds its best and most fully-developed representatives outside the
                    area of old subaerial volcanic cones and craters on whose surface the Coniston
                    Limestone lies. The calcareous members of this series are usually replete with
                    well-preserved fossils in great variety. The series under notice forms some
                    conspicuous features along the foot of the Cross Fell escarpment. Rising from
                    beneath these series just mentioned comes the vast pile of old volcanic
                    ejectamenta, largely subaerial in the typical district, which is known as the
                    Borradale Volcanic Series (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Cumberland).</hi> Outside
                    the massif of the Lake District we meet with the submarine equivalents of these
                    subaerial accumulations. These are well seen at Milburn. They consist of many
                    thousands of feet of alternations of submarine tuffs, with shales and mudstones,
                    seemingly identical in character with the Skiddaw Slates, which in the centre of
                    the Lake District mainly lie at the base of the volcanic rocks. The next type
                    may be described as a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0548-0515"/> vast pile of old marine sedimentary
                    accumulations, ten or more thousand feet in total thickness, and mainly
                    consisting of alternations of indurated shales, mudstones, and flags, with
                    subordinate beds of grit. This is the Skiddaw Slate, which may be conveniently
                    examined on and around Murton Pike, near Appleby. The same general type of
                    strata prevails over a very wide area. The bottom of these rocks has never been
                    reached. The principal areas of metamorphic rocks in Westmorland are situated in
                    the volcanic area. Rocks more or less altered by deep-seated action occur also
                    around the Shan Granite. The alteration of the volcanic rocks here takes the
                    form of an approach to the mineral characters of granite; but there is no
                    passage from the one to the other. The sedimentary rocks are altered also, more
                    or less, but in a different way: the calcareous beds are developed into idocrase
                    rocks, the cleavage in the Coniston Flags is sealed or welded up anew, while the
                    grits are rendered more or less quartzitic.</p>
                <p>Amongst the plutonic rocks the chief is the well-known granitic porphyry,
                    fragments of which occur in the Upper Old Red near Shap. There are many intrudes
                    of diorite, gabbro, felsite, mica trap, and the like,—all Post-Silurian and
                    Pre-Carboniferous in age. Another well-known plutonic rock, of later date than
                    the Carboniferous period, is the Whin Sill, an intrusive sheet of dolerite,
                    which has eaten its way into the Carboniferous rocks over hundreds of square
                    miles in the north of England. It forms the most characteristic feature of the
                    sombre and gloomy fell-side recess known as “High Cup Gill,” or Haikable, near
                    Appleby; and it also forms the λvaterfall known as Caldron Snout. It is the
                    newest intrusive rock known in Westmorland.</p>
                <p>The whole county is traversed in many directions by great numbers of faults. One
                    set, the Pennine faults, call for a brief notice here. Two lines of disturbance
                    continued northward from the Craven faults enter the county east of Kirkby
                    Lonsdale. One ranges north-north-eastwards, on the east of the Barbon Fells, and
                    lets in the Carboniferous rocks forming Gragreth, throwing down about 2000 feet
                    on the east; it ranges by Dent, and east of Sedbergh, entering the county again
                    in the valley between Clouds and the Ravenstonedale Fells. Here its effects are
                    as strikingly exhibited as at Gragreth, as the Millstone Grit summit of Wilbert
                    Fell on one side of the fault is let down to the same level as the summits of
                    the Silurian hills on the other. The second set of faults referred to throws
                    down in the opposite direction, letting down the Millstone Grit, the Yoredale
                    Rocks, the Mountain Limestone, and finally, as its throw diminishes, the Old
                    Red, against the foot of the Silurian massif of the Barbon Fells. This fault
                    ranges parallel to the general course of the Lune nearly as far northward as
                    Sedbergh, where it is joined by another set ranging east-north-east, which joins
                    the set first described as ranging north-north-east to Ravenstonedale at a point
                    near the county boundary north of Cautla. Thence the conjoined faults run
                    northward in a very complex manner, producing some important effects upon the
                    scenery about the foot of Mallerstang. Near Kirkby Stephen its throw changes
                    from a downthrow to the east to one in the opposite direction, which throw
                    increases rapidly in amount as the faults trend northwards, until at the foot of
                    Stain-moor, below Barras, its throw amounts to quite 6000 feet down to the west;
                    and we find the important patch of Coal-Measures above noticed let down in
                    consequence. At this point it changes in direction, running north-westerly, with
                    many complications, past Brough, Helton, Dufton, and Milburn, out of the county
                    at the foot of Cross Fell. Along this line it throws down to the southwest
                    several thousands of feet; and it is to the complicated disturbances
                    accompanying this great dislocation that nearly the whole of the more striking
                    physical features of North Westmorland owe their origin. It is in connexion with
                    the same important sets of disturbances also that the existence of most of the
                    mineral veins of the district is due.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate. —</hi> The rainfall is exceptionally heavy. The
                    largest quantity recorded appears to be that in the mountains along the county
                    boundary west of Grasmere, where the mean amounts to as much as 140 inches. At
                    Sty Head the rainfall in 1872 amounted to 243 ’ 98 inches. The area of greatest
                    rainfall forms a rude ellipsoid around these two places, lying with its longest
                    dimensions towards the south-east, nearly coinciding with the distribution of
                    land above 1500 feet. The heaviest precipitation takes place in the months of
                    January, September, and October, and the smallest in July. At Grasmere, well in
                    the heart of the mountains, but farther east, and at a much lower elevation, the
                    mean rainfall for the past twenty years has been 80 inches, rain of '01 inch or
                    more falling on about 210 days of the year. Between Grasmere and Shap the
                    rainfall diminishes somewhat in the mountain areas. But in the lower ground
                    still farther east the rainfall steadily but more rapidly diminishes, until at
                    Milburn (644 feet) the mean for the last ten years has been about 33 inches on
                    175 days in the year. At Kendal the mean appears to be about 50 inches, and the
                    number of wet days about 190 in the year; at Kirkby Lonsdale it is rather less,
                    and at Kirkby Stephen less again. The mean temperature for January is between
                    38° and 39° F., February 40°-41°,</p>
                <p>March 4l’-42°, April 46°-47°, May 51°, June 58°, "July 60°-61 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> β</hi>, August 60°, September 56", October 49", November
                    42°, and December 38°-40°. The principal characteristic of the climate is the
                    preponderance of cloudy, wet, and cold days, especially in the spring and the
                    autumn,—combining to retard the growth of vegetation. The late stay of cold
                    winds in the spring has much to do with the same, especially in the
                    lowlandsextending along the foot of the Cross Fell escarpment from Brough
                    north-westwards. Here, for weeks at a time, prevails a kind of cyclone revolving
                    on a horizontal axis parallel to the escarpment,—the “helm-wind.” The remarkable
                    feature connected with it is that, when the wind is rushing furiously from the
                    slopes of the escarpment in the direction of the low grounds, little movement of
                    the air can be detected on the summit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flora and Fauna.—</hi> Among the denizens of the mountains are
                    several plants distinctly alpine in character; and others, more or less boreal
                    in their principal stations, are here found at nearly their southernmost point
                    of distribution. Bog plants are also conspicuous in their variety, and include
                    several forms of some rarity. The lichens, mosses, and ferns are well
                    represented. Of trees the oak and the common elm do not seem quite at home
                    anywhere except in the more sheltered nooks, and in parks and other cultivated
                    places. But the place of the common elm is well supplied by the wych elm, which
                    grows to great perfection. In place of the oak the sycamore is seen almost
                    everywhere in the lower lands; and there are probably few parts of England where
                    the ash thrives so well, or attains to so large dimensions. On the higher lands,
                    up to the upper limit of woodland growth, the birch, the hazel, and the mountain
                    ash, and, in limestone districts especially, the yew are the prevailing trees.
                    The alder is abundant, and willows of various kinds occur. The upland character
                    of the region affects also its fauna. The badger, the polecat, and perhaps even
                    the wild cat are still met with in Westmorland. The lineal descendants of the
                    wild red deer range over a carefully-preserved remnant of the primeval forest in
                    more than one place. The raven, the peregrine, and the buzzard may still be
                    seen, and the moors sustain a considerable variety of birds other than grouse.
                    The whistle of the golden plover and the note of the curlew are intimately
                    associated with the scenery of the moory uplands. In the lowlands the avifauna
                    is characterized rather by the absence of many forms common in the south than by
                    the presence of birds elsewhere rare. The ornithologist cannot, however, help
                    being struck with the comparative abundance of the redstart, the wood wren, and
                    the grasshopper warbler, none of them very common in other parts of England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> Coal, the most important mineral product,
                    occurs in connexion with the Carboniferous rocks, but most of the seams are thin
                    and their quality is inferior, so that they have long ceased to have the
                    industrial importance they once possessed. Fireclays of excellent quality and of
                    unusual thickness occur with the coals at Argill, but have not hitherto been
                    turned to industrial account. Amongst the building-stones those of the New Red
                    certainly deserve the first rank. The warm-tinted, easily-worked, and durable
                    Penrith Sandstone furnishes one of the finest building-stones in the kingdom;
                    while the associated Brockrams are in their own way hardly less valuable; and
                    the same may be said of the St Bees Sandstone, whence the materials used on so
                    many of the larger public buildings of the northern part of the county have been
                    derived. The Carboniferous rocks nearly everywhere furnish durable freestones
                    and good flags. The Silurian rocks likewise yield building-stones, but somewhat
                    difficult to work. Some of the thinner beds of Carboniferous sandstone are
                    occasionally quarried for roofing purposes. The Coniston Flags are quarried at
                    several places on the south side of the county; while in the north-western parts
                    cleaved beds of volcanic ash, belonging to the Borradale Series, have long
                    furnished an ample supply of the well-known “green slates.” Amongst stones
                    available for ornamental purposes the Shap granite-porphyry is undoubtedly the
                    finest, as its choice for decorative purposes in our large cities has shown
                    abundantly. In the way of marbles there are the bituminous limestones at the
                    base of the Yoredale Rocks, and the encrinital limestones nearer their top, both
                    much appreciated; while among limestones of different character there are the
                    mottled and variegated limestones of several places in the neighbourhood of
                    Kendal in the southern and of Asby in the northern parts of the county.
                    Well-chosen specimens of Brockram have a pleasing effect when polished. Gypsum
                    is worked extensively in· the New Red rocks in the neighbourhood of Kirkby Thore
                    and Temple Sowerby. Amongst the ores of the useful metals those of lead are of
                    prime importance. The rich lodes of Greenside mines were until lately reckoned
                    amongst the finest of their kind in the United Kingdom, and they have also
                    supplied considerable quantities of silver, which has been extracted from the
                    lead. These were worked in the volcanic rocks. Copper and zinc ores also occur
                    in small quantities. Haematite has been discovered here and there at many
                    points, especially where calcareous strata have been affected by infiltration
                    from the New Red rocks.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> According to the Agricultural Returns for
                    1887 the total extent of green crops was 10,232 acres; of corn crops, 19,124,
                    whereof 17,320 were of oats, and only 469 of wheat, and 118 of rye;
                    seed-grasses, 14,951; and 207,017 acres of permanent pasture. The total number
                    of horses is given as 8547; of cows and heifers in milk or in calf, 24,097; of
                    other cattle, 39,225; of sheep, 334,978; and of pigs, 4731. There were 59
                    holdings of less than an acre; 495 of from 1 to 5 acres; 792 of from 5 to 20;
                    819 of from 20 to 50; 790 of from 50 to 100; 641 from 100 to 300; 64 from 300 to
                    500; 31 from 500 to 1000; and 3 holdings of above 1000 acres. The total number
                    of owners is stated in the <hi rend="italic">Return of Owners of Land,</hi>
                    1873, as 4376; the extent of lands held by them was 335,160 acres, with a gross
                    estimated rental of £442,320, while 114,282 acres were commons or waste land.
                    Seven proprietors then owned more than 5000 acres each :—earl of Lonsdale,
                    39,229; Sir H. J. Tufton, 16,094; marquis of Headfort, 12,851; Hon. Mary Howard,
                    8868; W. Wilson, 8690; G. E. Wilson, 7630; W. H. Wakefield, 5584. A large part
                    of Westmorland was formerly in the hands of what are called “statesmen,” whose
                    holdings were usually of small extent, but were sufficient, with careful
                    management, for the respectable maintenance of themselves and their families.
                    The proportion of landowners of this class is now, however, comparatively small.
                    The meadow-land yields grass of first-rate quality. Grass of inferior value
                    characterizes the pasturelands; while on the fell (or unenclosed) land, except
                    in limestone areas, the herbage consists chiefly of the coarser kinds of grass,
                    bents, and heather. These, however, furnish nourishment for the hardier breeds
                    of sheep, which are pastured there in large numbers. It is from the sale of
                    these, of their stock cattle, horses, and pigs, and of their dairy produce that
                    the staple of the farmers’ income is derived.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> The manufacturing industries, owing to the
                    absence of any large supplies of native fuel, are not numerous. The principal is
                    woollen manufacture in one form or another, and this is chiefly confined to the
                    low country in and near Kendal. Bobbin-making, fulling, snuff-grinding, and
                    several small industries are carried on at a profit, owing to the water-power
                    available at so many points. Paper-making is also carried on.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> There are five lieutenancy subdivisions,
                    and two police divisions. There are 109 civil parishes in the county. It is in
                    the diocese of Carlisle, is in the York military district, and forms part of the
                    northern circuit. There is one court of quarter sessions for the county, and
                    five petty sessional divisions. The assizes are now held at Carlisle. The
                    principal town is Kendal, which had in 1881 a population of 13,696. Other towns,
                    all much less important as regards both size and population, are Appleby, Kirkby
                    Lonsdale, Bowness, Kirkby Stephen, Ambleside, Shap, and Orton. The county sends
                    two members to parliament, representing the Northern (or Appleby) and the
                    Southern (or Kendal) Divisions respectively.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> According to the census of 1881 there were
                    64,191 inhabitants (31,515 males, 32,676 females), the decrease since 1871 being
                    819. The proportion of population to acreage is 1 person to 7 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 80 acres. The people of Westmorland may be described
                    as a prevalently tall, wiry, long-armed, big-handed, dark-grey-eyed,
                    fresh-coloured race. In disposition they are a cautious, reserved, staid,
                    matter-of-fact, sober-minded, unemotional race, somewhat slow-witted, but not by
                    any means dull, and are thrifty beyond measure. The general character of the
                    dialects of Westmorland is that of a basis of Anglian speech, influenced to a
                    certain extent by the speech current amongst the non-Anglian peoples of
                    Strathclyde. This is overlain to a much greater though variable extent by the
                    more decidedly Scandinavian forms of speech introduced at various periods
                    between the 10th and the 12th centuries. Three well-marked, dialects can be made
                    out.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities and History.—</hi> Amongst the oldest monuments of
                    Westmorland are the circular earthworks called King Arthur’s Round Table and
                    Maybrough, both close to Penrith. Barrows and tumuli are common in the wilder
                    parts of the county, more especially along the limestone hills near Orton.
                    Traces of earthworks, regarded as Celtic, occur near Crosby Ravensworth, and at
                    a few other places. Rude stone circles and other structures of the same nature
                    exist' at several places between Ravenstonedale and Shap. Stone implements of
                    the Neolithic type and implements of bronze have been found all over the county.
                    Cup-marked stones have been noticed near Penrith. At Brough church was found a
                    slab bearing an inscription variously regarded as Greek, or Celtic, or
                    Scandinavian. Well-marked traces of the occupation of the county by the Romans
                    exist in their roads, their camps, theiι∙ altars, and their coins. Monuments of
                    later date, prior to the reign of Rufus, are exceedingly rare, and are chiefly
                    confined to objects of an ecclesiastical character, which mostly owe their
                    preservation to their having been worked up as building material in some of the
                    older churches. Good examples are to be found at Kirkby Stephen, Long Marton,
                    Bongate, and other churches. Vestiges of late Norman work, rarely earlier than
                    12th century, are preserved in several of the churches, and in a few of the
                    castles. In the case of the castles especially it is evident that their sites
                    had been used as strongholds through a long succession of periods, extending in
                    some cases far back into prehistoric times. From the 12th century downward each
                    period of the history of Westmorland may be said to be fairly well represented.
