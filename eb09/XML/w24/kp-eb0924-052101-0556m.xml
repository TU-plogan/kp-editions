                    Harbour is upwards of 60 miles, and its greatest breadth from east to west 34
                    miles. The area is 576,588 acres, or about 901 square miles.</p>
                <p>The coast-line does not present any striking features, and owing to the number of
                    sandbanks navigation is dangerous near the shore. The only inlet of importance
                    on the east coast and the only safe harbour is Wexford Harbour, which owing to a
                    bar is not accessible to large vessels at ebb-tide. On the south coast are the
                    fishing harbours of Crossfarnogue and Fethard. Several islets adjoin the coast.
                    South from Crossfarnogue Point are the Saltee Islands, and Coningmore and
                    Coningbeg, beyond the latter of which is the Saltee lightship. South-east from
                    Greenore Point is the Tuskar Rock.</p>
                <p>The basis of the county is clay-slate, and the surface is chiefly a series of
                    verdant low hills, except towards the northern and western boundaries. The
                    clay-slate formation is interrupted by patches of quartz rock near Gorey, one
                    south of Enniscorthy, and another south of Wexford. To the north of Gorey there
                    is a protrusion of greenstone trap. The elevated ridge on the northwestern
                    boundary forms the termination of the granitic range in Wicklow, and in Croghan
                    Kinshela, on the borders of Wicklow, rises to a height of 1985 feet. On the
                    western border, a granitic range, situated chiefly in Carlow, extends from the
                    valley of the Slaney at Newton-barry to the confluence of the Barrow with the
                    Nore at New Ross. In the southern district, a hilly region, reaching in Forth
                    Mountain a height of 725 feet, forms with Wexford Harbour the northern
                    boundaries of the baronies of Forth and Bargy, a peninsula of flat and fertile
                    land. Carboniferous limestone crops to the surface on the southern shore of
                    Wexford Harbour, and forms also the extremity of Hookhead Point. Marble is
                    quarried on the right bank of the Barrow, and ochres are dug on the coast
                    districts. The river Slaney enters the county at its north-western extremity,
                    and flows south-east to Wexford Harbour. Its chief tributary is the Bann, which
                    flows south-westwards from the borders of Wicklow. The Barrow forms the western
                    boundary of the county from the Blackstairs range of mountains till its
                    confluence with the Suit at Waterford Harbour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agricultτιre.—</hi> The soil for the most part is a cold and
                    stiff clay resting on clay-slate. The interior and western districts have it
                    much inferior to those round the coasts. In the south-eastern peninsula of Forth
                    and Bargy the soil is a rich alluvial mould mixed with coralline sandstone and
                    limestone. The peninsula of Hookhead, owing to the limestone formation, is
                    specially fruitful. In the western districts of the county there are large
                    tracts of turf and peat-moss. In 1876, according to the <hi rend="italic">Return
                    of Owners of Land,</hi> Wexford was divided among 1757 proprietors possessing
                    573,052 aδres at an annual value of £374,517, or about 13s. an acre all over. Of
                    these proprietors 581 possessed less than 1 acre. There were about 4500 acres of
                    waste or common land. The following proprietors possessed upwards of 8000 acres
                    :—Lord Carew, 17,831; Lady Adelaide Forbes, 15,216; marquis of Ely, 14,023;
                    Viscount Powerscourt, 11,730; Lord Templemore, 11,327; William Orme Foster,
                    9724; Hon. Mrs Deane Morgan, 9413; Anne Colclough, 9328; Sir Janies Power, 8599;
                    F. A. Leigh, 8281; and representatives of J. H. R. Rowe, 8003. Out of a total
                    area of 575,700 acres in 1886, there were 202,543 acres, or 35’2 per cent.,
                    under crops, including meadow and clover, 303,788 or 52 ’ 8 per cent, under
                    grass, 431 acres fallow, 10,583 woods and plantations, 15,090 bo» and marsh,
                    19,082 barren mountain land, and 24,183 water, roads, fences, &amp;c. The total
                    number of holdings in 1886 was 16,074, of which only 16 were above 500 acres in
                    extent, 1045 between 100 and 500 acres, 2429 between 50 and 100, 2703 between 30
                    and 50, 3019 between 15 and 30, 3081 between 5 and 15, 2161 between 1 and 5, and
                    1620 not exceeding 1 acre. The decline in the area under crops between 1849 and
                    1886 has been much below the average for Ireland—from 245,514 acres to 202,543.
                    In 1876 the area was 221,018 acres, so that there has been a large decline
                    within the last ten years. In the area under meadow and clover there has been an
                    increase from 39,343 in 1849 to 61,327 in 1876 and 64,064 in 1886, but within
                    the last ten years the area has been fluctuating. There has been no marked
                    change in the area under green crops, which was 44,735 acres in 1849, 50,498 in
                    1876, and 45,958 in 1886. The area under corn crops has, however, declined
                    nearly a half, being in 1849 163,321 acres, in 1876 109,193 acres, and in 1886
                    only 92,512 acres. Of green crops there lias been since 1849 a great increase in
                    the area under turnips, and a corresponding decrease in the area under potatoes:
                    in 1849 they were respectively 9763 and 32,017 acres, and by 1876 they had
                    changed to 19,704 and 23,974 acres, and by 1886 to 21,857 and 18,888 acres.
                    There were also in 1886 2848 acres under mangel-wurzel and beetroot, and 3365
                    under other green crops. Of the corn crops the area under wheat has declined
                    from 44,592 acres in 1849 to 6948 in 1876 and 4541 in 1886, the area under oats
                    from 80,166 acres to 47,065 in 1876 and 50,381 in 1886, while that under barley
                    and here increased from 36,563 acres in 1849 to 51,321 acres in 1876, but since
                    then has declined to 35,036 acres. The number of horses in 1886 was 27,878, of
                    which 942 were used for recreation. Mules numbered 1767, and asses 8031. Cattle
                    numbered 126,410, of which 37,936 were milch cows. The number of sheep was
                    122,373, of which 48,243 were one year old and upwards. Pigs numbered 67,478,
                    goats 6369, and poultry 571,107, of which 34,293 were turkeys and 60,414
                    geese.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communications.—</hi> The Dublin, Wicklow, and Wexford Railway
                    intersects the county; and from Wexford a branch of the Great Southern and
                    Western passes north-westwards joining the lines to Kilkenny and Kildare. The
                    river Slaney is navigable for barges to Enniscorthy, and the Barrow for large
                    vessels to New Ross.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> Except in the town of Wexford the
                    manufactures and trade are of small importance. There are important fisheries at
                    Wexford, and one or two fishing villages along the south coast. The fishing
                    grounds are good.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> According to the
                    calculation of De Burgo the population in 1760 was 66,804; the parliamentary
                    census of 1812 places it at 112,000; in 1821 it amounted to 170,806, in 1841 to
                    202,033, in 1861 to 143,954, in 1871 to 132,666, and in 1881 to 123,854 (60,928
                    males and 62,926 females). Roman Catholics in 1881 formed 91 <hi

                    -</hi> 3 per cent, could read but not write, and 33 ’ 2 per cent, could neither

                    English, and 512 could speak English and Irish. By the Act of 1885 Wexford,
                    which formerly returned two members to parliament, was divided into two
                    parliamentary divisions, North and South, each returning one member, the borough
                    of Wexford, which formerly returned one member, and. the portion of the borough
                    of New Ross within the county, being merged in the South Division. The principal
                    towns are Wexford (12,163), New Ross (of which a portion containing 6375 is in
                    this county, the other portion containing 295 inhabitants being in Kilkenny),
                    Enniscorthy (5666), and Gorey (2450). The county is divided into ten baronies,
                    and contains 144 parishes and 1600 town-lands. Episcopally it is in Ferns
                    diocese, except a small portion, which is in Dublin. Judicially it is in the
                    Leinster circuit, and assizes are held at Wexford, and quarter sessions at
                    Enniscorthy, Gorey, New Ross, and Wexford. There are eleven petty sessions
                    districts, and parts of two others. Wexford includes the poor law unions of
                    Gorey and Wexford, and parts of Enniscorthy, New Ross, and Shillelagh. It is
                    within the Cork military district, and along with Kilkenny, Tipperary, and
                    Waterford forms No. 69 subdistrict, the brigade depot of which is at Clonmel.
                    There are barrack stations at Wexford, Duncannon Fort, and New Ross.</p>

                    the peculiar territory of the Mac-morroughs, overlords of Leinster, who had
                    their chief residence at Ferns. Dermod Macmorrough, having been deposed from the
                    kingdom of Leinster, asked help of Henry II., king of England, who authorized
                    him to raise forces in England for the assertion of his claim. He secured the
                    aid of Strongbow by promising him the hand of Eva, and in addition obtained
                    assistance from Robert Fitzstephen and Maurice Fitzgerald of Wales. On the 1st
                    May 1169 Fitzstephen landed at Bagenbon on the south side of Fethard, and after
                    four days’ siege captured the town of Wexford from its Danish inhabitants. After
                    this Dermod granted the territory of Wexford to Fitzstephen and Fitzgerald and
                    their heirs for ever. Macmorrough having died in 1172, Strongbow became lord of
                    Leinster. At first Henry II. retained Wexford in his own possession, but in 1174
                    he committed it to Strongbow. The barony of Forth is almost entirely peopled by
                    the descendants of those who accompanied these English expeditions. Wexford was
                    one of the twelve counties into which the conquered territory in Ireland <pb

                    of the possessions of William Mareschal, earl of Pembroke, who had married
                    Strongbow’s daughter. Through the female line it ultimately passed to John
                    Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, who in 1446 was made earl of Waterford and baron of
                    Dungarvan. In 1474 George Talbot was seneschal of the liberty of Wexford. The
                    district was actively concerned in the rebellion of 1641; and during the
                    Cromwellian campaign the town of Wexford was on 9th October 1649 carried by
                    storm, and a week later the garrison at New Ross surrendered,—a “seasonable
                    mercy,” according to Cromwell, as giving him an “opportunity towards Munster.”
                    Wexford was the chief seat of the rebellion of 1798, the leaders there being the
                    priests. Evidences of the Danish occupation are seen in the numerous raths,
                    especially at Dunbrody, Enniscorthy, and New Ross. Among the monastic ruins
                    special mention may be made of Dunbrody abbey, of great extent, founded in 1182
                    for Cistercian monks by Henry de Montmorency, marshal of Henry II.; Tintern
                    abbey, founded in 1200 by William Mareschal, earl of Pembroke, and peopled by
                    monks from Tintern abbey in Monmouthshire; the abbey of St Sepulchre, Wexford,
                    founded shortly after the invasion by the Roches, lords of Fermoy; Ferns abbey,
                    founded by Dermod Macmorrough; and the abbey of New Ross, founded by St Alban in
                    the 6th century. There are a considerable number of old castles, including
                    Ferns, dismantled by the Parliamentary forces under Sir Charles Coote in 1641,
                    and occupying the site of the old palace of the Macmorroughs; the massive pile
                    of Enniscorthy, founded by Raymond le Gros; Carrick Castle, near Wexford, the
                    first built by the English; and the fort of Duncannon, which has been garrisoned
                    since the time of the Spanish Armada, and caused some trouble to Cromwell when
                    in Wexford.</p>
