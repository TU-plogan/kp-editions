                    the age of twelve was removed to the free grammar school at Thame, where his
                    studies were interrupted by civil war skirmishes. He was then placed under the
                    tuition of his brother Edward (1627-55), of Trinity College; “while he continued
                    in this condition his mother would alwaies be soliciting him to be an apprentice
                    which he could never endure to heare of” <hi rend="italic">{Life,</hi> 1848, p.
                    33). He was entered at Merton College in 1647, and made postmaster. In 1652 “he
                    began to exercise his natural and insatiable genie he had to musick” <hi
                    rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> 53), and was examined for the degree of B.A. He
                    engaged a musicmaster, and obtained permission to use the Bodleian, “which he
                    took to be the happiness of his life.” He was admitted M.A. in 1655, and in the
                    following year published a volume of sermons of his late brother Edward.
                    Dugdale’s <hi rend="italic">Warwickshire</hi> came into his hands, and he
                    describes how “his tender affections and insatiable desire of knowledge were
                    ravished and melted downe by the reading of that book. What by musick and rare
                    books that he found in the public library, his life, at this time and after, was
                    a perfect Elysium” <hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> p. 68). He now began
                    systematically to copy monumental inscriptions and to search for antiquities in
                    the city and neighbourhood. He went through the Christ Church registers, “at
                    this time being resolved to set himself to the study of antiquities.” Dr John
                    Wallis, the keeper, allowed him free access to the university registers in 1660;
                    “here he layd the foundation of that book which fourteen years afterwards he
                    published, viz., <hi rend="italic">Hist,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Antiq. Univ. OxonP</hi> He steadily investigated the muniments of
                    all the colleges, and in 1667 made his first journey to London, where he visited
                    Dugdale, who introduced him into the Cottonian library, and Prynne showed him
                    the same civility for the Tower records. On October 22, 1669, he was sent for by
                    the delegates of the press, “that whereas he had taken a great deal of paines in
                    writing the <hi rend="italic">Hist. and Antiq. of the Universitie of 0xon,</hi>
                    they would for his paines give him an 100 <hi rend="italic">li.</hi> for his
                    copie, conditionally, that he would suffer the book to be translated into
                    Latine” <hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> 167). He accepted the offer and set to
                    work to prepare his English MS. for the translators, Richard Peers and Richard
                    Reeve, both appointed by Dr Fell, dean of Christ Church, who undertook the
                    expense of printing. The translation was supervised by Fell, with whom and the
                    translators Wood has endless quarrels about alterations of his text. In 1674
                    appeared <hi rend="italic">Historia et Antiquitates Universitatis
                    Oxoniensis,</hi> handsomely printed “e Theatro Sheldoniano,” in two folio
                    volumes, the first devoted to the university in general and the second to the
                    colleges. Copies were widely distributed, and university and author received
                    much praise. On the other hand, Bishop Barlow told a correspondent that “not
                    only the Latine but the history itself is in many things ridiculously false” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Genuine Remains,</hi> 1693, p. 183). In 1678 the university
                    registers which had been in his custody for eighteen years were removed, as it
                    was feared that he would be implicated in the Popish Plot. To relieve himself
                    from suspicion he took the oaths of supremacy and allegiance. During this time
                    he had been gradually completing his great work, which was produced by a London
                    publisher in 1691-92, 2 vols, folio, <hi rend="italic">Athenae Oxonienses: an
                    Exact History of all the Writers and Bishops who have had their Education in the

                    for the said time.</hi> On 29th July 1693 he was condemned in the
                    vice-chancellor’s court for certain libels against the late earl of Clarendon,
                    fined, banished from the university until he recanted, and the book burnt. The

                    Bishop Burnet in a <hi rend="italic">Letter to the Bishop of Lichfield and
                    Coventry,</hi> 1693, 4to, and defended by his nephew Dr Thomas Wood, in a <hi

                    rend="italic">An Appendix to the Life of Bishop Seth Ward,</hi> 1697, 8vo. On
                    9th October 1695 Wood had an interview with the earl of Clarendon, but was not
                    able to get his fine remitted. After a short illness he died 28th November 1695,
                    in his sixty-third year, and was buried in the ante-chapel of St John Baptist
                    (Merton College), in Oxford, where he superintended the digging of his own grave
                    but a few days before.</p>
                <p>He is described as “a very strong lusty man,” of uncouth manners and appearance,
                    not so deaf as he pretended, of reserved and temperate habits, not avaricious,
                    and a despiser of honours. He received neither office nor reward from the
                    university which owed so much to his labours. He never married, and led a life
                    of self-denial, entirely devoted to antiquarian research. Bell-ringing and music
                    were his chief relaxations. His literary style is poor, and his taste and
                    judgment are frequently warped by prejudice, but his two great works and
                    unpublished collections form a priceless source of information on Oxford and her
                    worthies. He was always suspected of being a Boman Catholic, and invariably
                    treated Jacobites and Papists better than Dissenters in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Athenae,</hi> but he died in communion with the Church of England.</p>
                <p>Wood’s original manuscript (purchased by the Bodleian in 1846), was first
                    published by John Gutch, as <hi rend="italic">The History and Antiquities of the
                    Colleges and Halls in the University of Oxford, with a continuation,</hi>
                    1786-90, 2 vols. 4to, and <hi rend="italic">The History and Antiquities of the
                    University of Oxford,</hi> 1792-96, 3 vols. 4to, with portrait of Wood. To these
                    should be added <hi rend="italic">The Antient and Present State of the City of
                    Oxford, chiefly collected by A. a ÌVood, with additions by Sir J. Peshall,

                    Oxford in 1751,12mo. Some letters between Aubrey and Wood were given in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</hi> (3d ser., ix., x., xi.). Wood consulted
                    Dr Hudson about getting a third volume of the <hi rend="italic">Athenae</hi>
                    printed in Holland, saying, “When this volume comes out I’ll make you laugh” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Reliq. Hearnianae,</hi> i, 59). This was included in a second
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Athenae</hi> published by Tonson in 1721, 2
                    vols, folio, “very much corrected and enlarged, with the addition of above 500
                    new lives.” The third appeared as “a new edition, with additions, and a
                    continuation by Philip Bliss,” 1813-20, 4 vols. 4to. The Ecclesiastical History
                    Society proposed to bring out a fourth edition, which stopped at the <hi
                    rend="italic">Life,</hi> ed. by Bliss, 1848, 8vo (see <hi rend="italic">Gfeηt.
                    Mag.,</hi> N.S., xxix. 135, 268). Dr Bliss's interleaved copy is in the
                    Bodleian, and Dr Griffiths announced in 1859 that a new edition was contemplated
                    by the Press, and asked for additional matter (see <hi rend="italic">Notes and
                    Queries,</hi> 2d ser., vii. 514, and 6th ser., vi. 5, 51). Wood bequeathed his
                    library (127 MSS. and 970 printed books) to the Ashmolean Museum, and the
                    keeper, William Huddesford, printed a catalogue of the MSS. in 1761. In 1860 the
                    whole collection was transferred to the Bodleian, where 25 volumes of Wood’s
                    MSS. had been since 1690. Many of the original papers from which the <hi
                    rend="italic">Athenae</hi> was written, as well as several large volumes of
                    Wood’s correspondence and all his diaries, are in the Bodleian.</p>
                <p>The chief authority is the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of wood written by
