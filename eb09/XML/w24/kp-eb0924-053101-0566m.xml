                <p><label type="entry">WHEAT</label><hi rend="italic">(Triticum),</hi> the most
                    important and the most generally diffused of cereal grasses, is an annual plant,
                    with hollow, erect, knotted stems, and produces, in addition to the direct
                    developments from the seedling plant, secondary roots and secondary shoots
                    (tillers) from the base. Its leaves have each a long sheath encircling the stem,
                    and at the junction of the blade or “flag” with the sheath a small whitish
                    outgrowth or “ligula.” The inflorescence or ear consists of a central stalk bent
                    zigzag, now to the one side, now to the other, thus forming a series of notches
                    (see fig. 1), and bearing a number of flattened spikelets, one of which grows
                    out of each notch and has its inner or upper face pressed up against it. At the
                    base of each spikelet are two empty boat-shaped glumes or “chaff-scales,” one to
                    the right, the other to the left, and then a series of flowers, 2 to 8 in
                    number, closely crowded together; the uppermost are abortive or sterile,—indeed,
                    in some varieties only one or two of the flowers are fertile. Each flower
                    consists of an outer or lower glume, called the flowering glume, of the same
                    shape as the empty glume and terminating in a long, or it may be in a short, awn
                    or “beard.” On the other side of the flower and at a slightly higher level is
                    the “palea,” of thinner texture than the other glumes, with infolded margins and
                    with two ribs or veins. These several glumes are closely applied one to the
                    other so as to conceal and protect the ovary, and they only separate to allow of
                    the passage of the empty anthers after fertilization. Within the pale are two
                    minute, ovate, pointed, white membranous scales called “Iodides.” These contain
                    three stamens with thread-like filaments and oblong, two-lobed anthers. The
                    stamens are placed round the base of the ovary, which is a rounded or oblong
                    body, much smaller than the glumes, covered with down, and surmounted by two
                    short styles, extending into feathery brush-like stigmas. The ripe fruit or
                    grain, sometimes called the “berry,” the matured state of the ovary and its
                    contents, is oblong or ovoid, with a longitudinal furrow on one side. The ovary
                    adheres firmly to the seed in the interior, so that on examining a longitudinal
                    section of the grain by the microscope the outer layer is seen to consist of
                    epidermal cells, of which the uppermost are prolonged into short hairs to cover
                    the apex of the grain. Two or three layers of cells inside the epidermis
                    constitute the tissue of the ovary, and overlie somewhat similar layers which
                    form the coats of the seed. Within these last is a layer of square cells larger
                    and more regular in form than those on each side; these contain the gluten or
                    nitrogenous matter upon which so much of the nutritive value of the seed
                    depends. This thin layer of gluten cells contains the albumen or perisperm,
                    which constitutes the great mass of the seed, being composed of numerous cells
                    of irregular form and size filled with starch grains. These layers of cells
                    become more or less dry and inseparable one from another, forming the substance
                    known as “bran.” At the lower end of the albumen, and placed obliquely, is the
                    minute embryo-plant, which derives its nourishment in the first instance from
                    the albumen; this is destined to form the future plant.</p>
                <p>Such in brief is the general structure of the wheat plant as we now know it. Of
                    its principal variations mention will be made below. What was its origin is not
                    known; and opinion has differed as to whether more than one species is involved
                    or whether all the varieties now known may not have been originally derived from
                    one. The prevalent opinion among botanists is that the wheat plant is nowhere
                    found in a wild condition.</p>
                <p>Recently, however, M. Frédéric Houssay is alleged to have discovered the plant
                    wild in the mountains to the east of Kurdistan; but the statement requires
                    confirmation. Some of the species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Aegilops</hi>
                    (now referred to <hi rend="italic">Triticum</hi> by Bentham and Hooker and by
                    Haeckel) may possibly have been the sources of our cultivated forms, as they
                    cross freely with wheats. Haeckel, the latest monographer of the genus,
                    considers that there are three species. ( 1 ) <hi rend="italic">Triticum</hi><hi

                    Hissarlik, as is shown by the grain<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    found in those localities. (2) <hi rend="italic">T. sativum,</hi> is the
                    ordinary cultivated wheat, of which Haeckel recognizes three principal races,
                    <hi rend="italic">spelia, dicoccum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tenax.</hi> Spelt
                    wheats (see fig. 2) were cultivated by the aboriginal Swiss, by the ancient
                    Egyptians, and throughout the Roman empire. The variety <hi rend="italic"
                    >dicoccum</hi> was also cultivated in prehistoric times, and is still grown in
                    southern Europe as a summer wheat and one suitable for starch-making. Other
                    sub-varieties of <hi rend="italic">T. tenax</hi> are <hi rend="italic"
                    >compactum,</hi><hi rend="italic">turgidum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >durum</hi> (see below). (3) The third species, <hi rend="italic">T.
                    polonicum,</hi> or Polish wheat, is a very distinct-looking form, with long
                    leafy glumes; its origin is not known. As these varieties intercross with each
                    other, the presumption is that they, like the species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aegilops,</hi> which also intercross with wheat, may have all originated from
                    one common stock.</p>
                <p>Basing his conclusions upon philological data, such as the names of wheat in the
                    oldest known languages, the writings of the most ancient historians, and the
                    observations of botanical travellers, De Candolle infers that the original home
                    of the wheat plant was in Mesopotamia, and that from thence its cultivation
                    extended in very early times to the Canaries on the west and to China on the
                    east. In the western hemisphere wheat was not known till the 16th century.
                    Humboldt mentions that it was accidentally introduced into Mexico with rice
                    brought from Spain by a negro slave belonging to Cortes, and the same writer saw
                    at Quito the earthen vase in which a Flemish monk had introduced from Ghent the
                    first wheat grown in South America.</p>
                <p>As might be anticipated from the cultivation of the plant from time immemorial
                    and from its wide diffusion throughout the eastern hemisphere, the varieties of
                    wheat—that is, of <hi rend="italic">T. sativum—</hi> are very numerous and of
                    every grade of intensity. Those cases in which the variation is most extreme
                    some botanists would prefer to consider as forming distinct species; but others,
                    as De Vilmorin, having regard to the general facts of the case and to the
                    numerous intermediate gradations, look upon all the forms as derivatives from
                    one. In illustration of this latter point it may be mentioned that not only do
                    the several varieties run one into the other, but their chemical composition
                    varies likewise according to climate and season. According to Prof. Church,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Food Grains
                    of India,</hi> p. 94.</p><p/></note> even in the produce of a single ear there
                    may be 3 to 4 per cent, more of albuminoid matters in some grains than in
                    others; but on the average the proportion of gluten to starch is as 9’ll to 100.
                    From the point of view of agriculture (see vol. i. p. 354) it is generally of no
                    great moment what rank be assigned to the various forms. It is only important to
                    take cognizance of them for purposes of cultivation under varying circumstances.
                    Hence we only allude to some of the principal variations and to those
                    characteristics which are found to be unstable. (1) Setting aside differences of
                    constitution, such as hardihood, size, and the like, there is relatively little
                    variation in the form of the organs of vegetation. This indicates that less
                    attention has been paid to the straw than to the grain, for it is certain that,
                    were it desirable, a great range of variation might be induced in the foliage
                    and straw. As it is, some varieties are hardier and taller than others, and the
                    straw more solid, varying in colour and having less liability to be “laid”; but
                    in the matter of “tillering,” or the production of side-shoots from the base of
                    the stem, there is much difference. De Vilmorin points out that wheats of cold
                    countries have flexible, thin, hollow straw, elongated fragile ears, and soft
                    floury seeds; Hunter’s wheat may be cited as a good example. Wheats of hotter
                    countries have a more solid, rigid straw, the ears short, stout, com- 1&gt;act,
                    the glumes provided with long awns or beards, and the seed ιard and homy. Spring
                    wheats procured from northern latitudes mature more rapidly than those from
                    temperate or hot climates, whilst the reverse is the case with autumn wheats
                    from the same source. The difference is accounted for by the greater amount of
                    light which the plants obtain in northern regions, and, especially, by its
                    comparatively uninterrupted continuance during the growing period, when there
                    are more working hours for the plants in the day than in more southern climes.
                    Autumn wheats, on the other hand, are subjected to an enforced rest for a period
                    of several months, and even when grown in milder climates remain quiescent for a
                    longer period, and start into growth later in spring,—much later than varieties
                    of southern origin. These latter, accustomed to the mild winters of those
                    latitudes, begin to grow early in spring, and are in consequence liable to
                    injury from spring frosts. Wheats of dry countries and of those exposed to
                    severe winds have, says De Vilmorin, narrow leaves, pliant straw, bearded ears,
                    and velvety chaff,—characteristics which enable them to resist wind and drought.
                    Wheats of moist climates, on the other hand, have broader leaves, to admit of
                    more rapid transpiration. No doubt careful microscopic scrutiny of the minute
                    anatomy of the leaves of plants grown under various conditions would reveal
                    further adaptations of structure to external conditions of climate. At any rate,
                    it is certain that, as a general rule, the hard wheats are almost exclusively
                    cultivated in hot, dry countries, the spelt wheats in mountainous districts and
                    on poor soil, turgid wheats, like the Egyptian, in plains or in ill-drained
                    valleys,—the best races of wheat being found on rich alluvial plains and in
                    fertile valleys. The wheat used in the neighbourhood of Florence for
                    straw-plaiting is a variety with very slender stalks. The seed is sown very
                    thickly at the beginning of winter and pulled, not cut, about the end of May,
                    before the ear is ripe. In the United Kingdom ordinary wheat, such as old red
                    Lammas and Chiddam’s white, is used for straw-plaiting, the straw being cut some
                    time before the berry ripens. The propensity to “tiller” is of the greatest
                    importance, as it multiplies the resources of the farmer. An instance of this is
                    given in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> (1768), where it
                    is stated that one seedling plant in the Cambridge botanic garden was divided
                    into eighteen parts, each of which was replanted and subsequently again divided,
                    till it produced sixty-seven plants in one season. In March and April of the
                    following year these were again divided and produced 500 plants, which in due
                    time yielded 21,109 ears. (2) The variations in root-development have not been
                    much attended to, although it would be well to study them in order to ascertain
                    the degree of adaptability to various depths and conditions of soil. (3) A most
                    important difference is observable in the liability to attacks of rust <hi
                    rend="italic">{Puecinia),</hi> some varieties being almost invariably free from
                    it, while others are in particular localities so subject to it as to be not
                    worth cultivating. (4) Velvet-chaffed wheats do best in poor soil, and bearded
                    wheats are usually hardiest. (5) The ears vary, not only in size, but also in
                    form, this latter characteristic being dependent on the degree of closeness with
                    which the spikelets are set on. In such varieties as Talavera the spikelets are
                    loose, while in the club and square-headed varieties they are closely packed.
                    The form of the ear depends on the relative width of the anterior and posterior
                    surfaces as compared with that of the lateral surfaces. In the square-headed
                    varieties the lateral surfaces are nearly as wide as the median ones, owing to
                    the form and arrangement of the spikelets. The number of abortive or sterile
                    spikelets at the top of the ear also varies: in some cases nearly all the
                    spikelets are fertile, while in others several of the uppermost ones are
                    barren.</p>
                <p>The classification of the different varieties of cultivated wheat has occupied
                    the attention of many botanists and agriculturists. The latest and fullest
                    account is that of Μ. Henry de Vilmorin in his <hi rend="italic">Les Blés
                    Meilleurs</hi> (Paris, 1881). The classification adopted by this writer is
                    based, in the first instance, on the nature of the ear: when mature its axis or
                    stem remains unbroken, as in the true wheats, or it breaks into a number of
                    joints, as in the spelt wheats. In the first class the ripe grain readily
                    detaches itself from the chaffscales, while in the spelts it is more or less
                    adherent to them, or not readily separable from them. The true wheats are
                    further subdivided into soft wheats, turgid wheats (<hi rend="italic">T.
                    turgidum),</hi> hard wheats <hi rend="italic">( T. durum),</hi> and Polish
                    wheats (<hi rend="italic">T. polonicum).</hi> In the soft wheats the
                    chaff-scales are boat-shaped, ovoid, of the consistence of parchment, and
                    shorter than the spikelet; the seed is floury, opaque, white, and easily broken.
                    In the turgid wheats the glumes have long awns, and the seed is turgid and
                    floury, as in the soft wheats. In the hard wheats the outer glumes are keeled,
                    sharply pointed, awned, and the seed is elongated and of hard glassy texture,
                    somewhat translucent, and difficult to break owing to its toughness. These seeds
                    are richer in nitrogen than the soft wheats, so that an approximate notion of
                    the richness in albuminoids may be gained by simply inspecting the cut surface
                    of the seed. The Polish wheat, rarely if ever cultivated in the United Kingdom,
                    has very large lanceolate glumes, longer than the spikelet, and elongated glassy
                    seeds. Further subdivisions are made, according to the presence or absence of
                    awns (bearded and beardless wheats), the colour of the ears (white,
                    fawn-coloured, or red), the texture of the ears (glabrous— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> smooth—or downy), and the colour of the seed or “berry.” In the
                    jointed or spelt wheats the distinctions lie in the presence of awns, the
                    direction of the points of the glumes (straight, bent outwards, or turned
                    inwards), the form of the ear as revealed on a cross section, and the entire or
                    cleft palea. As illustrating the fact of the occasional instability of these

                    will correspond with its aspect. The division into spring wheat and winter wheat
                    is an agricultural one solely. Any variety may be a spring or a winter wheat
                    according to the time at which it is sown. In the summer wheats it may often be
                    observed that the median florets do not fill out so fully as in the autumn
                    wheats. Among the turgid wheats there is a frequent tendency in the spike to
                    branch or become compound, — a tendency which is manifested to a less degree in
                    other forms. The Egyptian, or so-called “mummy” wheat is of this character, the
                    lower part of the spike branching out into several subdivisions. This
                    multiplication of the seed-bearing branches might at first sight be considered
                    advantageous; but in practice the quality of the grain is found to be inferior,
                    as if the force that should have been devoted to the maturation of the grain
                    were, in a measure, diverted and expended in the production of additional
                    branches to the spike.</p>
                <p>With regard to the chemical composition of the ripe grain, the Rothamsted
                    experiments reveal a singular uniformity, even under very varied conditions of
                    manuring, and even where much diversity was apparent in the constitution of the
                    straw. A high or low percentage of nitrogen in the grain was also shown to
                    depend more directly on the degree of ripening, as influenced by the character
                    of the season, than on difference in manure; but it depends more upon the
                    variety than upon soil or nutrition.</p>
                <p>Apart from the botanical interest of these diversities, as indications of the
                    faculty of variation in plants, and possibly as clues to the genealogy and
                    origin of the cultivated plant, their practical importance is very great. Some
                    varieties are suited to hot, others to cold countries; some will flourish on one
                    description of soil, others on another. Hence the paramount importance of
                    ascertaining by experiment, not only what are the best varieties, but which are
                    the best adapted for particular localities and particular climatic conditions.

                    particular square-headed variety grown on rich soil in the north of France. A
                    good selection of seed, according to the nature of the soil, demands, says De
                    Vilmorin, intelligence and accurate knowledge on the part of the farmer. If a
                    good variety be grown in poor soil, the result will be unprofitable, while, if
                    bad wheat be grown on good soil, the result may be nil. In botanical collections
                    there exist, it is stated, herbarium specimens or other evidences of plants
                    grown in Norway as far north as lat. 65° (Schubeler), in Switzerland at an
                    elevation of 1200 feet above the valley of Zermatt (or 6500 feet above the sea),
                    near the straits of Magellan, as well as in Teneriffe, the Cape of Good Hope,
                    Abyssinia, Rodriguez, the Philippine Islands, and the Malay Archipelago. These
                    widely - separated localities show the great area over which the culture is
                    possible, and illustrate the powers of adaptation of the plant. The requirements
                    of the consumer have also to be considered: for some purposes the soft wheats,
                    with their large relative proportion of starch, are the best, for others the
                    hard wheats, with their larger quantity of gluten. With the modern processes of
                    milling, the hard wheats are preferred, for they make the best flour; and in
                    North America the spring wheats are, as a rule, harder than the winter wheats.
                    The soft wheats are those which are most general in European cultivation, and,
                    as a rule, the beardless varieties, though more tender, are preferred. The
                    bearded varieties are supposed to be hardier; at any rate they defy the ravages
                    of predatory birds more completely than the unarmed varieties, and they are
                    preferable in countries liable to storms of wind, as less likely to have their
                    seeds detached. Hard wheats are specially employed in Italy for the fabrication
                    of macaroni. Polish wheat is used for similar purposes. Spelt wheats are grown
                    in the colder mountainous districts of Europe; their flour is very fine, and is
                    used especially for pastry-making; but, owing to the construction of the grain,
                    it requires special machinery for grinding (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Flour).</hi></p>
                <p>The following passage, reproduced from a German source in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agricultural Science</hi> (January 1887), may serve still further to illustrate
                    the fitness of particular varieties for special purposes.</p>
                <p>“Innumerable experiments have shown that the value of wheat for seed increases
                    with the size of the grain: the larger kernel yields a stronger plant, and this
                    will bear a heavier crop; the smaller grain contains the larger proportion of
                    gluten, yields a better flour, and brings a higher price; but with the smaller
                    yield per acre the profit may be less. The ‘ volume-weight ’ is dependent more
                    on the well-rounded form of the grain than on its size; when about alike in
                    respect to shape, the market value of the grain is closely proportionate to its
                    weight per bushel. Grain of a higher specific gravity is usually richer in
                    gluten. Richness in this constituent is of the greatest importance, as affecting
                    the market value of the grain; it gives better baking qualities to the flour,
                    besides a higher nutritive value, and is accompanied with greater richness in
                    phosphate, also an important constituent of animal food. The proportion of
                    gluten in wheat is determined largely by the climate, and especially by the
                    proximity of the sea. Insular England produces a wheat grain with high absolute
                    weight, but as a rule with less gluten than the wheat of eastern Europe. English
                    wheat, and wheat in general grown in an ocean climate, seldom contains over ten
                    per cent, of gluten, while in eastern Europe and in the western United States
                    the proportion rises to twenty per cent, and above. Vigorous English seed wheat
                    sown in eastern Europe yields larger crops than the native seed, and a grain
                    richer in gluten than the parent, though not so rich as wheat from native
                    seed.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Ritthausen,

                <p>It is, however, to be observed that proximity to the sea does not produce soft
                    wheat poor in gluten in Italy, Algeria, and other warm and tropical regions,
                    where the plant is cultivated quite as much under the influence of the sea as in
                    England. The soft wheat of Great Britain is to be explained rather by the
                    mildness of the climate and the relative constancy of the temperature.</p>
                <p>Wheat begins to grow at a temperature of 5° C. (41° Fahr.); and, when the
                    aggregate temperature, as represented by the sum of the daily means, has mounted
                    up to 185° Fahr., the germ begins to escape from the husk, if the seed be not
                    deeply buried; but if it is deeply bïiried, an amount of heat is required
                    greater in proportion to the depth. If the seed lies at a depth lower than a
                    foot from the surface, it rarely germinates. The seedling plant ceases to grow
                    if the mean temperature of the day rema⅛s below 42° Fahr. When the young plants
                    have been influenced by an aggregate temperature amounting to 1896° Fahr, from
                    the period when sown, or 1715° from the period of germination, branching or
                    “tillering” goes on freely, and the young ears are formed. Under the influence
                    of a mean temperature of 55°, or a little above, the flowers are produced. A
                    still higher daily mean is required for the full development and ripening of the
                    grain. The figures here cited are given by Risler and are calculated for the
                    climate of Paris; but, of course, the same principles apply in the case of other
                    countries. The amount of light and of moisture has also to be taken into
                    account. The fact that the wheat plant requires less water than other cereals,
                    and therefore does not suffer so much from drought, is one of great importance
                    to the cultivator, and furnishes one reason for the greater proportionate
                    culture of wheat in the eastern than in the western counties of England.</p>
                <p>As for the soil requirements, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Agriculture,</hi> vol. i.
                    p. 357. The following figures, cited by De Vilmorin from Joulie, will give an
                    idea of the nature and amount of the demands made upon the soil by a wheat crop:
                    in order to yield a crop of 44⅜ bushels of wheat to the acre, the soil must
                    supply to the crop during its growth in round numbers—202 lb of nitrogen, 81 lb
                    of phosphoric acid, 55 lb of lime, 26 ïb of magnesia, and 255 lb of potash.</p>
                <p>The numerous varieties of wheat now in cultivation have been obtained either by
                    selection or by cross-breeding. In any wheat-field there may be observed on
                    close inspection plants differing in character from the majority. If seeds of
                    these “sporting” plants be taken and grown in another season, they may (or may
                    not) reproduce the particular variation. If they do, and the same process of
                    selection be continued, the variation becomes in time “fixed,” though it is
                    always more or less liable to revert to its original condition. By continuously
                    and systematically selecting the best grains from the best ears, Major Hallett
                    has succeeded in introducing “pedigree wheats” of fine quality. But even greater
                    results may be expected from cross-breeding, or the fertilization of the flowers
                    oí one description of wheat by the pollen of another. This has been attempted by
                    Shireff, Le Conteur, Maund, and others in the past, and more recently by H. de
                    Vilmorin and Messrs Carter. Under natural circumstances wheat is
                    self-fertilized: that is to say, the pollen of any given flower impregnates the
                    stigma and ovule of the same flower, the glumes and coverings of the flower
                    being tightly pressed round the stamens and stigmas in such a way as to prevent
                    the access of insects and to ensure the deposit of the pollen upon the stigmas
                    of the same flower. This process of self-fertilization is the usual method, and
                    no doubt keeps the variety true or unmixed; but the occasional presence of
                    varieties in a wheat-field shows that cross-fertilization is sometimes secured.
                    The stamens of the wheat plant may frequently be seen protruding beyond the
                    glumes, and their position might lead to the inference that cross-fertilization
                    was the rule; but on closer examination it will be found that the anthers are
                    empty or nearly so, and that they are not protruded till after they have
                    deposited the pollen upon the stigma. The separation of the glumes, which occurs
                    at the time of fertilization, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n569/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0569-0534"/> and which permits the egress of the useless
                    stamens after that operation, is stated to occur only under certain conditions
                    of temperature, when the heat, in fact, is sufficient to cause the lodicles of
                    the flower to become turgid and thus to press apart the glumes. A temperature of
                    about 75 <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> Fahr. is found by Messrs Carter to be
                    the most favourable. From what has been said it will be evident that the
                    artificial fertilization of wheat is a very delicate operation. The glumes have
                    to be separated and the anthers cut away before the pollen is fully formed, care
                    being taken at the same time not to injure the stigma, and specially not to
                    introduce, on the scissors or otherwise, any pollen except that of the variety
                    desired. De Vilmorin’s experiments have shown that all the varieties will
                    intercross, and that even such a distinct form as the Polish is no exception.
                    From this he concludes that all the forms have originated from one stock and are
                    to be comprised within one species. In the progeny of these crossed wheats,
                    especially in the second generation, much variation and difference of character
                    is observable,—a phenomenon commonly noticed in the descendants from crosses and
                    hybrids and styled by Naudiu “irregular variation.” Sometimes characteristics
                    appear in the crossed wheats which are not found in the parent varieties,
                    although they occur in other wheats. Thus, De Vilmorin records the presence of
                    turgid wheats among seedlings raised from a soft wheat fertilized with the
                    pollen of a hard variety, and spelt wheats among the descendants of a soft
                    crossed with a turgid wheat. Other of De Vilmorin’s experiments were made with
                    the practical object of obtaining improved varieties or forms specially suitable
                    to particular localities. Among those he has raised is one named “Dattel,” which
                    is highly esteemed; it was got from the red Chiddam, a valuable variety, but one
                    in which the straw is defective. By crossing the red Chiddam with the pollen of
                    Prince Albert a new variety has been produced which is stated to be early, very
                    productive, and of good quality, as far as both grain and straw are concerned.
                    Among many varieties raised by Messrs Carter some are very interesting: in one
                    case the seed-parent was a short-strawed, downy-chaffed, awnless variety, the
                    pollenparent a large bearded American wheat. The offspring exceeded the
                    seed-parent in stature by a foot, and had a smooth chaff and stout thickset ears
                    with minute awns. Some of the crosses were made with the view to secure denser
                    production of awns and thus to render the ears “bird-proof”; others were devised
                    with a view of securing an early ripening variety, which was effected by
                    crossing with the Talavera, a known early variety. The progeny was ready for
                    cutting (in the neighbourhood of London) on 21st July 1886.</p>
                <p>To show how considerable may be the variations in the produce yielded by
                    different varieties, the following figures, taken from the ‘ ‘ memoranda sheet”
                    of the Rothamsted experiments, may be cited. For twelve successive years
                    (1871-1882) Sir John Lawes cultivated 26 varieties of wheat, each variety each
                    year in a different field and under different conditions of manuring. From
                    various circumstances satisfactory averages were obtained during only eight
                    years (1871-1878). The mean produce of all the varieties taken together during
                    that period was 43⅜ bushels (dressed corn) per acre; the lowest average produce
                    was 36⅜ bushels per acre, furnished by Hallett’s original red; and the highest
                    produce was 53∣ bushels per acre, yielded by Rivett’s red. As to manuring, the
                    highest mean produce (51f bushels per acre) from 25 varieties taken together was
                    obtained in 1878 on a field where all the 25 varieties were manured with 2 cwts.
                    of nitrate of soda, the previous crop having been turnips, for which farmyard
                    dung was applied, the turnips being partly consumed on the land, partly removed.
                    Here again Rivett’s red furnished the best crop (66⅜ bushels per acre). This
                    variety in almost—but not in all—cases gave the highest produce. The lowest mean
                    produce from all the varieties taken together was 211 bushels per acre in
                    1879,—a most disastrous season. In that year even Rivett’s red furnished no more
                    than 16 bushels per acre, among the lowest on the record, but nearly twice as
                    much as red Rostock, which in the same year yielded only 8⅛ bushels per acre,
                    the manuring consisting of 2 cwts. of nitrate of soda after clover, partly cut,
                    partly <hi rend="italic">‘ ‘ fed.”</hi> This same variety in another year and
                    under a different condition of manuring yielded 57 bushels per acre. The
                    disastrous effect, of the season of 1879 was manifested not only in diminished
                    produce but in lessened germinative power; in the season following white wheats
                    appear to have been the worst, the most satisfactory crop in 1880 being yielded
                    by Webb’s “challenge,” seeds of which were received direct from Stourbridge and
                    not grown on the Rothamsted farm, as in the case of the other varieties. As to
                    the weight per bushel of the grains of the different varieties at Rothamsted,
                    there was a more limited range than in the case of the absolute weight, the
                    highest mean (63⅞ ïb per bushel) being yielded by the “red nursery” variety, the
                    lowest by Rivett’s red (58f), the general average of all the varieties amounting
                    to 61⅛ lb per bushel. The effect of the bad season of 1879 was also shown here:
                    the general average in that year was only 53⅛ lb per bushel, while in 1876 it
                    was 63∣ for the same varieties. The greatest weight per bushel does not
                    therefore correspond in all cases with the absolute amount of crop per acre, for
                    a small crop often yields grain of relatively heavy weight. Nor does the same
                    condition of manuring that brings an abundant crop necessarily yield a
                    proportionate return calculated in weight per bushel. The greatest weight per
                    bushel (63⅜ lb in 1876) was secured on the same plot which in the same year
                    yielded less than an average crop, 42⅜ bushels per acre, very little difference
                    being observable in the different varieties in point of quality, though much in
                    quantity. The lowest average weight per bushel (56f- lb), however, corresponded
                    with a very low total produce, 23⅜ bushels per acre in 1880, on a poorly manured
                    plot. These figures, added to those representing the cost for rent and taxes,
                    manure, labour, and expenses of production generally, and considered in
                    connexion with the enormous supplies imported from abroad, will show how great
                    are the risks attendant upon wheat cultivation in the United Kingdom under
                    existing circumstances; but of course they are of little value as regards the
                    growth of wheat in India and the colonies.</p>
                <p>The production of wheat, with the use of wheat bread, has increased enormously
                    since the extension of railways has made possible the transportation of grain
                    for great distances by land. The annual crop of the world is now estimated at
                    nearly two thousand millions of bushels. Of late years the increase of
                    production has been most notable in southern Russia, Australia, India, and North
                    America.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a

                <p>Wheat is sometimes grown as a forage crop. A variety has been introduced from
                    Japan by Messrs Sutton which seems to be very useful for this purpose. Although
                    it takes a longer time to mature its seed, it flowers a fortnight earlier than
                    other varieties. It seems also to be a hardy plant, having withstood
                    successfully eight degrees of frost. From a crop sown on 27th August a sample
                    was cut on the following 13th October, with a stem more than 2 feet in length
                    and very thick and succulent, and the autumn was not very genial. This variety
                    tillers well, so that it makes a complete mass of green stuff, which is very
                    serviceable either for feeding sheep or for “soiling.” (Μ. T. Μ.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Insects, &amp;c., injurious to Wheat.</hi></p>
                <p>It will be convenient to arrange the insects injurious to wheat under the natural
                    orders to which they belong, and afterwards to describe one or two other forms
                    of animal life, such as the myriapod, <hi rend="italic">Polydesmus,</hi> and the
                    nematode worm which causes the ear-cockle, for, although these are not insects,
                    they must be taken into account in any description of the animal pests of the
                    wheat crop.</p>
                <p>The order <hi rend="italic">Orthoptera</hi> contains the mole cricket, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gryllotalpα vulgaris,</hi> one of the largest insects found in
                    Great Britain. It is 2 inches or a little more in length, of a brownish colour,
                    and covered over by velvety hairs; it is easily recognized by the peculiar
                    character of its anterior legs, which are very strong and short and laterally
                    compressed. These insects lead a subterranean life, burrowing through loose
                    sandy soil by means of their fore limbs, which are structurally well adapted for
                    digging. The sexes pair about the middle of June, and the female lays from 200
                    to 400 eggs in an oval chamber excavated some inches below the level of the
                    ground. After laying her eggs, she does not, as is very generally the case
                    amongst insects, die, but lives to keep guard over the eggs and the young
                    larvae, which appear in about three weeks; many of the latter, however, she
                    eats. The young larvae at first resemble black ants; they are very voracious and
                    feed upon the young tender rootlets of corn and other plants. The adults prefer
                    an animal diet, but do great damage by cutting through any roots which they
                    encounter in their subterranean burrowings, and as these are winding and
                    extensive considerable injury is caused to the crops. One of the natural enemies
                    of mole crickets is the mole, which devours them readily; they are also eaten by
                    those birds which scratch the soil for worms. They appear to be very sensitive
                    to smell, and a dressing of a quart of paraffin oil to 1 cwt. of ashes or mould,
                    or watering with solutions of quassia and soft soap, will often rid the field of
                    them.</p>
                <p>The corn thrips, <hi rend="italic">Thrips</hi><hi rend="italic">cerealium,</hi>
                    is a member of the order <hi rend="italic">Thysanoptera,</hi> which is by some
                    authorities associated with the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0570-0535"/><hi rend="italic">Orthoptera.</hi> It is a minute
                    insect about 2 mm. long, with a black and brown coloration. The male is
                    wingless; the female bears four long narrow wings fringed with long hairs. The
                    antennae are eight-jointed. The legs terminate in characteristic swellings;
                    there are no claws. The insects are very active. The larvae are whitish yellow,
                    with bright red eyes, and acquire their wings after the fourth casting of the
                    skin. The damage done to corn crops by these minute insects is often very
                    serious; they secrete themselves under the paleae surrounding the seed, and feed
                    upon the soft juices of the latter. In addition to this, they sometimes cause
                    injury to the plant by attacking the stalk whilst it is soft and full of sap.
                    Owing to their very small size it is exceedingly difficult to devise means for
                    getting rid of them; much may be done, however, to prevent their appearance by
                    keeping the land clean and free from weeds, which harbour them, and by
                    destroying all refuse in which they may breed, and ploughing in the stubble to a
                    considerable depth.</p>
                <p>The most injurious form amongst the <hi rend="italic">Hemi∙</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >plera</hi> is <hi rend="italic">Siphonophora</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Kirby); it attacks wheat chiefly in England, but is also found upon oats,
                    barley, and rye. The young <hi rend="italic">Aphides</hi> attack the leaf blades
                    whilst young and tender, and when the ear begins to appear it is covered with
                    numbers of these insects in every stage of development, from the young larva to
                    the perfect insect. The larvae are of a green or dark green colour, with brown
                    antennae and yellow and black legs. The female, which produces the young
                    viviparously, has a green abdomen, bearing two horns posteriorly; the rest of
                    the body is brownish green, the legs black and yellow, the eyes red. The winged
                    females, which appear late in the season, lay eggs; but whether these eggs serve
                    to carry the species over the winter or whether this is done by hibernating
                    larvae is not definitely known. Both larvae and females producing them have been
                    found amongst the roots of the wheat plant during the winter. This <hi
                    rend="italic">Aphis</hi> is known to occur upon several of the common grasses of
                    England; hence any grasses growing in a wheat field should be destroyed as much
                    as possible when the pest is in the neighbourhood. Deep ploughing and rotation
                    of crops may also be recommended. In cases where the insects are noticed at an
                    early stage, a dressing of soot or gas lime will serve to check them. Their
                    numbers are kept down by lady-birds <hi rend="italic">{Coccinella),</hi> which
                    should never be killed, and also by two species of ichneumons <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The order <hi rend="italic">Diptera</hi> includes several insects which are very
                    harmful to corn crops. The frit fly, <hi rend="italic">Oscinis vastator,</hi> is
                    a very active small fly, with a greenish black metallic lustre, about 2 to 3 mm.
                    in length. The larvae are yellow or light brown, pointed anteriorly. The flies
                    emerge from the chrysalis about April, and the female deposits her little red
                    eggs upon the under surface of the leaf of the wheat; the larva when it is
                    hatched creeps down and bores its way into the terminal bud of the plant, thus
                    arresting all growth of the ear. The larva assumes the chrysalis state inside
                    one of the outermost leaf sheaths. There are believed to be two broods each
                    year. If, as seems probable, the pupae pass the winter amongst tire stubble or
                    grass weeds, it is important that these should either be burnt or ploughed
                    deeply in.</p>
                <p>Two closely allied species of flies also attack corn crops; they are <hi
                    rend="italic">Chlorops taeniopus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chlorops</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lineata.</hi> The former is of a light straw colour, with three
                    longitudinal dark stripes, and a greenish black abdomen; the antennae are black,
                    the eyes greenish; and the dark feet have a stripe of lighter colour. It is
                    about 3 to 4 mm. long. The injury to the crops is caused by the fly laying its
                    eggs between the leaves of the young plant; the larvae which hatch out from
                    these bore their way down the stem from the base of the ear to the first joint,
                    and there they form swellings known to the farmer as the “gout.” The ear is
                    aborted or misformed. The dampest part of the field is most subject to attack.
                    <hi rend="italic">Ch.</hi><hi rend="italic">lineata</hi> is about 2 mm. long;
                    the antennae have their two proximal joints yellow, whilst the third is black on
                    its outer side; in its habits this insect resembles <hi rend="italic">Ch.
                    taeniopus,</hi> but attacks chiefly barley crops.</p>
                <p>The daddy long-legs, <hi rend="italic">Tipula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >oleracea,</hi> causes great damage to corn and other crops by the larvae
                    gnawing the young plants whilst they are still below the level of the ground.
                    The female deposits her eggs in the ground, or near it in some grass, &amp;c.,
                    choosing as damp a place as possible. The larva is provided with a very tough
                    skiu and may measure 1⅜ inches in length. It is apodal, and bores its way
                    beneath the surface of the earth by alternately contracting and expanding. It
                    assumes the pupal condition during the later half of the summer. The pupae are
                    provided with backward! y directed spines, by means of which they raise
                    themselves above the level of the ground. As a means of preservation against
                    this pest, ditches and other damp places should be cleaned out. Rooks, which
                    devour the larvae at a great rate, should be encouraged; and deep ploughing to
                    bury the eggs and the larvae should be practised, and the land dressed with some
                    such poisonous substance as gas lime before breaking up.</p>
                <p>Two species of <hi rend="italic">Cecido∙ myia</hi> are most destructive to wheat.
                    <hi rend="italic">Cecido-rnyia</hi><hi rend="italic">tritici,</hi> the wheat
                    midge, has been known in Great Britain for over a century. This fly is a little
                    over 2 mm. in length, of an orange yellow colour, with black eyes; the female is
                    provided with a long ovipositor, by means of which it deposits ten or more eggs
                    in the ears of wheat. The larvae hatch out in about ten days. They are at first
                    transparent, but become yellow, and their colour gradually deepens. Most of the
                    larvae fall off the plant and bury themselves in the ground, where they change
                    into pupae; some, however, remain in the ear and are found in some numbers in
                    chaff. The perfect insect emerges from the pupa in the spring. It is probable
                    that more than one brood is produced during the season. The damage caused to the
                    crop is due to the larva feeding upon the soft tissue of the ear and thus
                    causing the seed to be imperfect; some authorities state that it also devours
                    the pollen. Since the larvae exist in chaff, great care must be taken that this
                    does not prove a source of infection, and land which has been badly affected
                    must be ploughed deep, in order to bury them. <hi rend="italic">C.
                    destructor</hi> is well known under the name of the Hessian fly. It was first
                    noticed in Great Britain during the summer of 1886, in Hertfordshire, and within
                    a few months its presence was reported throughout the eastern half of England
                    and Scotland,— a circumstance which led some authorities to believe that it had
                    existed in Great Britain for some little time; there has been, however, no
                    definite proof of this. The fly has been known in North America since 1776,
                    where it has done very extensive damage, especially during warm moist summers.
                    It is known to occur throughout central Europe; in 1879 it made its appearance
                    in Russia, and in four years had spread over the greater part of that country.
                    The female fly is about 3 mm. long, brownish in colour, but becoming black in
                    the thorax and head. The wings are fringed, rounded at their ends, and the third
                    nerve is branched. The antennae are also fringed and consist of two globular
                    basal joints, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n571/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0571-0536"/> and 14 to 16 smaller joints, which diminish in
                    length towards the ends. The male fly is smaller than the female; the abdomen
                    terminates in two claspers. The female lays in the spring 40 or more eggs upon
                    the leaves of the corn plants,—wheat, barley, and rye; oats are not affected.
                    The larvae are hatched in about 5 or 6 days, and make their way down to the
                    axils of the leaves, feeding upon the sap which is passing up the stem. After a
                    few weeks they are transformed into the “flax seed” pupae, which are usually
                    found just above the second joint of the stem. From these pupae the autumn brood
                    of flies emerge; these lay eggs, and their larvae tide over the winter in the
                    pupal condition. Sometimes only one brood is produced in the year. The injury
                    done to the plant by the larvae living upon the sap usually causes the infected
                    plants to bend over just above the second joint; this renders them easily
                    distinguishable from the healthy plants. The numbers of this most injurious
                    insect are fortunately kept down to a considerable extent by parasites. Five
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Chalcididae</hi> are known to be parasitic on <hi
                    rend="italic">C. destructor</hi> in America and six in Russia. Fortunately these
                    are not absent in Great Britain. When a crop has been infected by this pest, the
                    corn should be reaped above the second joint, and the stubble carefully ploughed
                    in. A sharp look-out should be kept for the appearance of the “flax seed” both
                    in the plant and in samples of corn, especially if the latter has been badly
                    cleaned. Some species of wheat seem to have a greater power of resisting the
                    attacks of this insect than others, but as yet very little definite information
                    can be given on this point. These two pests do damage to the amount of millions
                    of pounds every year in North America; but none of those mentioned before them
                    are either common or destructive on that continent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cephïispygmaeus</hi> belongs to that destructive group of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Hymeno-pterα,</hi> the saw-flies, and is commonly known as the
                    corn saw-fly. The insect is black in colour, with a large head and prominent
                    eyes. The mouth parts are yellow, and in the male the legs are the same colour.
                    The female is darker and has its black ovipositor slightly exposed. Whilst the
                    wheat is still young and tender, the female pierces the stalk below the forming
                    ear and there deposits an egg. The larva, which hatches out in about ten days,
                    is when full-grown about half an inch long, whitish in colour, with a brown
                    head. It differs from the ordinary saw-fly larva in having but three pairs of
                    legs. This larva bores its way down the stem, cutting through the knots, and
                    about harvest time it cuts the stem nearly through at its base. The larva
                    assumes the pupal stage in the lowest part of the stem and remains in this
                    condition till the following spring, when the perfect insect emerges. Plants
                    which have been affected by this insect can easily be recognized by their thin
                    empty ears. Since the insect passes the winter in the stubble, every effort
                    should be made to destroy this wherever the disease has been prevalent.</p>
                <p>The caterpillars of some species of <hi rend="italic">Leρidoptera</hi> do
                    considerable damage to corn crops. On the Continent the larvae of <hi
                    rend="italic">Agrotis</hi><hi rend="italic">clavis (segetum)</hi> devour the
                    roots of wheat and are especially destructive to autumn-sown crops. <hi
                    rend="italic">Tinea grαnellα,</hi> a member of the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tineidae,</hi> causes much harm to grain in store. This small moth, of a dusky
                    white colour, lays one or two minute eggs upon each grain; as soon as they are
                    hatched, the caterpillars bore their way into the grain, and by means of a web
                    bind several grains together. Through these it bores minute passages and lives
                    in them, devouring the substance of the grain. The larvae ultimately withdraw to
                    the angles and corners of the granary; hence, wherever this pest is prevalent,
                    care must be taken to keep the building free from dust, cobwebs, &amp;c. There
                    is a member of the <hi rend="italic">Coleoρtera</hi> which is frequently
                    mistaken for the above-mentioned pest. This beetle is known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trogosita mauritanica</hi>; it is supposed to have been introduced from Africa.
                    The larva is ∣ inch long, with a whitish body, bearing tufts of hairs and a
                    brown head. It gnaws the corn grains and lives on their contents. The beetle is
                    carnivorous, and is said to compensate for the damage its larva causes by
                    devouring the above-mentioned <hi rend="italic">Tinea, graneUa.</hi></p>
                <p>Another beetle, <hi rend="italic">Calandra</hi><hi rend="italic">granaria,</hi>
                    the corn weevil, also attacks stored grain. The eggs are deposited in the grains
                    of corn and the larva spends its life therein, living upon the substance of the
                    grain, and ultimately turning to a pupa. It leaves the grain first upon
                    attaining the mature state.</p>
                <p>The larvae of <hi rend="italic">Elater (Agriotes)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lineatus</hi> and of other species of this genus are amongst the most
                    destructive insects known to agriculturists. They are commonly known as
                    wire-worms from the exceedingly tough character of their skins. The mature
                    beetles are known as skip-jacks, from the power they possess of regaining their
                    normal position when placed on their back by means of a loose articulation
                    between the pro-thorax and the meso-thorax. This when put in action causes the
                    beetle to jump into the air, and they usually fall on their feet. The wire-worms
                    have a rather flattened body, yellowish brown in colour; it consists of twelve
                    segments, and bears three pairs of legs. The larvae live for several years, and
                    then, burying themselves deep in the earth, emerge as the perfect insect in
                    about a fortnight. The beetles pair in June, and the female deposits her eggs
                    upon blades of grass or the sheathing leaves of corn. The best preventative for
                    this pest is clean farming and scarifying the land after harvest, so as to kill
                    all roots which might serve as food for the wire-worms. When a crop is badly
                    attacked, soot or gas lime may be applied and the land well rolled to compress
                    the earth. The numbers of the larvae are to some extent kept down by moles and
                    insectivorous birds.</p>
                <p>The cockchafer, <hi rend="italic">Melolontha vulgaris,</hi> is injurious to corn
                    crops, in both its mature and its larval condition. During the former state it
                    devours the leaves of wheat and of most other grasses, trees, and shrubs. The
                    larva, which is very voracious, lives upon roots. This larva is very thick and
                    fleshy, of a whitish hue, with three · pairs of legs; it usually lies in a
                    curled-up position. The larval condition lasts several years; but ultimately the
                    larvae become pupae, and in this condition live through the winter. Much may be
                    done to prevent the spread of this pest by shaking the cockchafers from the
                    trees, amongst the leaves of which they hang, and destroying them. They are
                    eagerly eaten by pigs and poultry.</p>
                <p>An allied but much smaller species of beetle, <hi rend="italic">Anisoplia
                    horticola,</hi> with much the same habits as the above, also occurs in England,
                    and attacks wheat and grass crops.</p>
                <p>Millepedes, although they are not insects, but one of the groups which compose
                    the larger division <hi rend="italic">Tracheata,</hi> must be included in an
                    account of the pests which attack wheat. The English species which is most
                    destructive to wheat, barley, and oats is <hi rend="italic">Polydesmτιs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">complanatus.</hi> Millepedes pass their life underground, and are
                    sometimes mistaken for wire-worms, but can be at once distinguished by the great
                    number of their legs. They affect damp places, which should be drained, and no
                    rubbish or litter should be left Ivin" about.</p>
                <p>Ear-cockle is due to the parasitism of a small white nematoid worm, known
                    variously as <hi rend="italic">Anguillula ( Vibrio)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tritici</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tylenchus</hi><hi rend="italic">scandens</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">tmtici.</hi> These worms cause the formation of a brownish
                    black gall upon the wheat ear. When the ear ripens and falls to the ground, the
                    nematodes escape from the gall and live in the damp earth. Ultimately they make
                    their way on to a young plant, and, as the ear forms, they pass into it and pair
                    inside the gall which has been caused by their presence. The female lays
                    numerous eggs, from which young nematodes hatch out, until the gall is quite
                    full of them. As long as the gall remains hard, the larvae are motionless; but
                    they become active in moisture, and develop into the adult state. If the
                    surrounding conditions are unfavourable they will remain in the larval state for
                    years. They are capable of resisting great extremes of heat and cold, and are
                    apparently unaffected by many poisons. Allied species affect the roots of wheat,
                    grasses, and other plants.</p>
