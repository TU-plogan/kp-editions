                <p><label type="entry">WOLFRAM VON ESCHENBACH</label>, mediaeval German poet, lived
                    in the latter part of the 12th and the early part of the 13th century. Little is
                    known about the facts of his life, and such knowledge as we possess is derived
                    wholly from his own writings. He belonged to a poor but noble family. He speaks
                    of himself as a Bavarian, and refers to the count of Wertheim as his feudal
                    lord. His home was the castle of Eschenbach (near Ansbach), and in the
                    churchyard at Eschenbach what was said to be his grave was shown as late as the
                    beginning of the 17th century. He spent some time at the court of Hermann,
                    landgrave of Thuringia, where he met Walther von der Vogel weide, to whom he
                    makes two references in his works. Wolfram survived Hermann, who died in 1216.
                    His residence at the Thuringian court led to his being included among the poets
                    who were afterwards said to have taken part in a great competition for poetic
                    supremacy at the Wartburg. Wolfram seems to have been happily married, and to
                    have had children. In politics he was a supporter of the emperor Otho IV. He
                    understood French, but could neither read nor write.</p>
                <p>His greatest work is <hi rend="italic">Parzival,</hi> an epic poem completed
                    between 1205 and 1215. It combines the story of the Holy Grail with incidents
                    from the legends of southern France about the old princes of Anjou and from the
                    legendary history of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. To Wolfram’s
                    contemporary, Gottfried of Strasburg, the style of this poem seemed abstract and
                    obscure; aud <hi rend="italic">Parzival</hi> certainly lacks the lightness and
                    grace of Gottfried’s masterpiece <hi rend="italic">Tristan.</hi> It has,
                    however, high imaginative qualities, and, regarded as a whole, is the most
                    splendid achievement in the literature of Germany during the period of Middle
                    High German. Even in Wolfram’s day the poem produced a profound impression, and
                    in the 15th century it was still so warmly appreciated that it was one of the
                    earliest works made accessible to the public through the invention of printing.
                    The principal authority used by Wolfram seems to have been the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conte del Gral</hi> of Chrestien de Troyes. He mentions, besides this work, a
                    poem by Kiot, a Provençal poet; but nothing is known of Kiot, and it may be that
                    he never really existed. Whatever may have been the sources of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parzival,</hi> Wolfram gave to everything he borrowed from others a wholly new
                    character, impressing upon it strongly the mark of his own great ideal spirit.
                    Besides his chief work and various lyrics he composed two epic fragments, <hi
                    rend="italic">Titurel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Willehalm,</hi> the former
                    before <hi rend="italic">Parzival,</hi> the latter after. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Titurel,</hi> a love-tale, belongs to the same cycle of legends as the story of
                    <hi rend="italic">Parzival,</hi> and, so far as form is concerned, it is the
                    brightest and most artistic of Wolfram’s works. <hi rend="italic">Willehalm</hi>
                    presents the legendary history of St William of Orange, a contemporary of
                    Charlemagne. The so-called third part of this poem was continued by Ulrich von
                    Tiir-heim about 1250, the first part by Ulrich von dem Tiirlin between 1252 and
                    1278.</p>
                <p>A complete edition of wolfram’s works was issued by Lachmann in 1833. Bartsch
                    afterwards published, with notes, an edition of <hi rend="italic">Ραrzirαl</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Titurel.</hi> There are renderings into modern German by
                    San-Marte and Simrock. See San-Marte’s <hi rend="italic">Parziυal-Studieη,</hi>
                    and essays by Bartsch, Pfeiffer, Rochat, and Zingerle in Pfeiffer’s <hi
