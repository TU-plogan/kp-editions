                    substance of his thinking on these doctrines he embodied, towards the end of his
                    life, in the one book by which he is now remembered, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Religion of Nature Delineated,</hi> the first edition of which was privately
                    printed in 1722, and the second, revised, in 1724. He died in October of the
                    same year.</p>
                <p>Wollaston’s <hi rend="italic">Religion of Nature,</hi> which falls between
                    Clarke’s <hi rend="italic">Discourse of the Unchangeable Obligations of Natural
                    Religion and.</hi> Butler’s <hi rend="italic">Sermons,</hi> was one of the
                    popular philosophical books of its day. More than 10,000 copies of it were sold
                    in a few years. It was highly valued by Bishop Butler and a favourite book of
                    Queen Caroline, the wife of George IL, and she ordered the numerous quotations
                    from Latin, Greek, and Hebrew in the notes to be translated into English for her
                    use. To the 8th edition (1750) was added a life of the author. Though the book
                    is now remembered chiefly for the theory of the nature of moral good and evil
                    advocated in it, it was rather its defence of natural religion, and its bold,
                    sometimes original, penetrating, and often eloquent discussion of great ethical
                    religious problems which secured for it “deserved reputation.” It was designed
                    to be an answer to the two questions—Is there such a thing as natural religion?
                    and If there is, what is it? Wollaston starts with the assumption that religion
                    and morality are identical, and labours to show that ι ’ eligion is “the pursuit
                    of happiness by the practice of <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> and reason.” The
                    moral theory on which he values himself as propounding a view met with nowhere
                    else is that moral evil is the practical denial of a true proposition and moral
                    good the affirmation of it. To steal is wrong because it is to deny that the
                    thing stolen is what it is—the property of another. In Wollaston’s view
                    “happiness” occupies a large place. He makes pain an evil and pleasure a good.
                    Happiness is a duty and an end to be aimed at by every intelligent being. He
                    makes the production of happiness also the test of the lightness or wrongness of
                    all social regulations. But he admits that in this world happiness and virtue
                    only <hi rend="italic">tend</hi> to coincide, and derives from their defective
                    coincidence his argument for a state of future rewards and punishments.</p>
                <p>In addition to this work Wollaston published anonymously a small book <hi
                    rend="italic">on the Design of the Book of Ecclesiastes, or the Unreasonableness
                    of Mens Restless Contention for the Present Enjoyments, represented in an
                    English Poem,</hi> London, 1691. The subject of the book is sufficiently
                    indicated in its title, and was in form and argument so worthless that its
                    author consulted his reputation by immediately suppressing it. It is now very
                    scarce. The university library of Cambridge possesses a copy.</p>
