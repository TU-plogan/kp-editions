                <p><label type="entry">WHALEBONE</label> is the inaccurate name under which the
                    baleen plates of the right whale are popularly known; and the trade-name of
                    whale-fin, which the substance receives in commerce, is equally misleading.
                    Three kinds of whalebone are recognized by traders—the Greenland, yielded by the
                    Greenland whale, <hi rend="italic">Balaena mysticetus</hi>; the South Sea, the
                    produce of the Antarctic black whale, <hi rend="italic">B. australis’,</hi> and
                    the Pacific or American, which is obtained from <hi rend="italic">B.
                        japonica.</hi> Of these the Greenland whalebone is the most valuable. It
                    formed the only staple known in earlier times, when the northern whale fishery
                    was a great and productive industry. This whalebone usually comes into the
                    market trimmed and clean, with the hairy fringe which edges the plates removed.
                    To prepare whalebone for its economic applications, the blades or plates are
                    boiled for about twelve hours, till the substance is quite soft, in <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n564/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0564-0529"/> which state it is cut either into narrow
                    strips or into small bristle-like filaments, according to the use to which it is
                    to be devoted.</p>
                <p>Whalebone possesses a unique combination of properties which render it peculiarly
                    and almost exclusively suitable for several purposes. It is light, flexible,
                    tough, and fibrous, and its fibres run parallel to each other without
                    intertwisting. It has been found practicable to employ flexible steel for
                    several purposes to which whalebone was formerly applied, especially in the
                    umbrella and corset industries, in which steel is now almost exclusively used.
                    Whalebone is, however, still in large demand among dressmakers and milliners;
                    but it is principally used in the brush trade. In cases where bristles are too
                    soft and weak, and where the available vegetable fibres possess insufficient
                    elasticity and durability, whalebone offers the great advantage of being
                    procurable in strips or filaments, long or short, thick or thin, according to
                    requirement. Hence it is principally used for making brushes for mechanical
                    purposes, such as machines for road-sweeping, chimney-sweeping, boiler-flue
                    cleaning, the cleaning of ships’ bottoms, and for stable use, &amp;c. The use of
                    whalebone in brush-making was originally patented by Samuel Crackles in 1808,
                    and various special machines have been adapted for cutting the material into
                    filaments. When whalebone came into the English market in the 17th century it
                    cost at first about £700 per ton. In the 18th century its price ranged from £350
                    to £500 per ton, but early in the 19th century it fell as low as £25. Later it
                    varied from £200 to £250; but with the decrease in whaling the article has
                    become very scarce, and upwards of £1500 per ton is now paid for Greenland
