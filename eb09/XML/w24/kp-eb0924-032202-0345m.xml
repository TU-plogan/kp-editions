                <p><label type="entry">WALDENSES, <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi></label>, a name
                    given to the members of an heretical sect which arose in the south of France
                    about 1170. The history of the sects of the Middle Ages is obscure, because the
                    earliest accounts of them come from those who were concerned in their
                    suppression, and were therefore eager to lay upon each of them the worst
                    enormities which could be attributed to any. In later times the apologists of
                    each sect reversed the process, and cleared that in which they were interested
                    at the expense of others. In early times these sectaries produced little
                    literature of their own; when they produced a literature at the beginning of the
                    15th century they attempted to claim for it a much earlier origin. Hence there
                    is confusion on every side; it is difficult to distinguish between various sects
                    and to determine their exact opinions or the circumstances under which they came
                    into being. The polemical conception which has done much to perpetuate this
                    confusion is that of the historical continuity of Protestantism from the
                    earliest times. According to this view the church was pure and uncorrupt till
                    the time of Constantine, when Pope Sylvester gained the first temporal
                    possession for the papacy, and so began the system of a rich, powerful, and
                    worldly church, with Rome for its capital. Against this secularized church a
                    body of witnesses silently protested; they were always persecuted but always
                    survived, till in the 13th century a desperate attempt was made by Innocent III.
                    to root them out from their stronghold in southern France. Persecution gave new
                    vitality to their doctrines, which passed on to Wycliffe and Huss, and through
                    these leaders produced the Reformation in Germany and England.</p>
                <p>This view rests upon a series of suppositions, and is entirely unhistorical. So
                    far as can be discovered the heretical sects of the Middle Ages rested upon a
                    system of Manichaeism which was imported into Europe from the East (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Manichaeism).</hi> The Manichaean system of dualism, with its
                    severe asceticism, and its individualism, which early passed into antinomianism,
                    was attractive to many minds in the awakening of the 11th century. Its presence
                    in Europe can first be traced in Bulgaria soon after its conversion in 862,<note

                    >Histoire des Cathares,</hi> i. 7.</p></note> where the struggle between the
                    Eastern and Western churches for the new converts opened a way for the more
                    hardy speculations of a system which had never entirely disappeared, and found a
                    home amongst the Paulicians in Armenia. The name of Cathari, taken by the
                    adherents of this new teaching, sufficiently shows the Oriental origin of their
                    opinions, which spread from Bulgaria amongst the Slavs, and followed the routes
                    of commerce into central Europe. The earliest record of their presence there is
                    the condemnation of ten canons of Orleans as Manichees in 1022, and soon after
                    this we find complaints of the prevalence of heresy in northern Italy and in
                    Germany. The strongholds of these heretical opinions were the great towns, the
                    centres of civilization, because there the growing sentiment of municipal
                    independence, and the rise of a burgher class through commerce, created a spirit
                    of criticism which was dissatisfied with the worldly lives of the clergy and
                    their undue influence in affairs.</p>
                <p>The system of Catharism recognized two classes of adherents, <hi rend="italic"
                    >credentes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">perfecti.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >perfecti</hi> only were admitted to its esoteric doctrines and to its
                    superstitious practices. To the ordinary men it seemed to be a reforming agency,
                    insisting on a high moral standard, and upholding the words of Scripture against
                    the traditions of an <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0346-0323"/> overgrown and worldly church. Its popular aim and
                    its rationalistic method made men overlook its real contents, which were not put
                    clearly before them. It may be said generally that Catharism formed the abiding
                    background of mediaeval heresy. Its dualistic system and its antisocial
                    principles were known only to a few, but its anti-ecclesiastical organization
                    formed a permanent nucleus round which gathered a great deal of political and
                    ecclesiastical discontent. When this discontent took any independent form of
                    expression, zeal, which was not always accompanied by discretion, brought the
                    movement into collision with the ecclesiastical authorities, by whom it was
                    condemned as heretical. When once it was in conflict with authority it was
                    driven to strengthen its basis by a more pronounced hostility against the system
                    of the church, and generally ended by borrowing something from Catharism. The
                    result was that in the beginning of the 13th century there was a tendency to
                    class all bodies of heretics together: partly their opinions had coalesced;
                    partly they were assumed to be identical.</p>
                <p>Most of these sects were stamped out before the period of the Middle Ages came to
                    a close. The Waldenses, under their more modern name of the Vaudois, have
                    survived to the present day in the valleys of Piedmont, and have been regarded
                    as at once the most ancient and the most evangelical of the mediaeval sects. It
                    is, however, by no means easy to determine their original tenets, as in the 13th
                    and 14th centuries they were a body of obscure and unlettered peasants, hiding
                    themselves in a corner, while in the 16th century they were absorbed into the
                    general movement of the Reformation. As regards their antiquity, the attempts to
                    claim for them an earlier origin than the end of the 12th century can no longer
                    be sustained. They rested upon the supposed antiquity of a body of Waldensian
                    literature, which modern criticism has shown to have been tampered with. The
                    most important of these documents, a poem in Provençal, “La Nobla Leyczon,”
                    contains two lines which claimed for it the date of 1100</p>

                    oldest MS. existing in the Cambridge university library the figure 4 had been
                    imperfectly erased before the word “cent,” a discovery which harmonized with the
                    results of a criticism of the contents of the poem itself. This discovery did
                    away with the ingenious attempts to account for the name of Waldenses from some
                    other source than from the historical founder of the sect, Peter Waldo or
                    Valdez. To get rid of Waldo, whose date was known, the name Waldenses or
                    Vallenses was derived from Vallis, because they dwelt in the valleys, or from a
                    supposed Provençal word Vaudes, which meant a sorcerer.</p>
                <p>Putting these views aside as unsubstantial, we will consider the relation of the
                    Waldenses as they appear in actual history with the sects which preceded them.
                    Already in the 9th century there were several protests against the rigidity and
                    want of spirituality of a purely sacerdotal church. Thus Berengar of Tours
                    (999-1088) upheld the symbolic character of the Eucharist and the superiority of
                    the Bible over tradition. The Paterines in Milan (1045) raised a protest against
                    simony and other abuses of the clergy, and Pope Gregory VII. did not hesitate to
                    enlist their Puritanism on the side of the papacy and make them his allies in
                    imposing clerical celibacy. In 1110 an apostate monk in Zeeland, Tanchelm,
                    carried their views still further, and asserted that the sacraments were only
                    valid through the merits and sanctity of the ministers. In</p>
                <p>France, at Embrun, Peter de Bruys founded a sect known as Petrobrusians, who
                    denied infant baptism, the need of consecrated churches, transubstantiation, and
                    masses for the dead. A follower of his, a monk, Henry, gave the name to another
                    body known as Henricians, who centred in Tours. The teachers of these new
                    opinions were men of high character and holy lives, who in spite of persecution
                    wandered from place to place, and made many converts from those who were
                    dissatisfied at the want of clerical discipline which followed upon the struggle
                    for temporal supremacy into which the reforming projects of Gregory VII. had
                    carried the church.</p>
                <p>It was at this time (1170) that a rich merchant of Lyons, Peter Waldo, sold his
                    goods and gave them to the poor; then he went forth as a preacher of voluntary
                    poverty. His followers, the Waldenses, or poor men of Lyons, were moved by a
                    religious feeling which could find no satisfaction within the actual system of
                    the church, as they saw it before them. Like St Francis, Waldo adopted a life of
                    poverty that he might be free to preach, but with this difference that the
                    Waldenses preached the doctrine of Christ while the Franciscans preached the
                    person of Christ, Waldo reformed teaching while Francis kindled love; hence the
                    one awakened antagonisms which the other escaped. For Waldo had a translation of
                    the New Testament made into Provençal, and his preachers not only stirred up men
                    to more holy lives but explained the Scriptures at their will. Such an
                    interference with the ecclesiastical authorities led to difficulties. Pope
                    Alexander III., who had approved of the poverty of the Waldensians, prohibited
                    them from preaching without the permission of the bishops (1179). Waldo answered
                    that he must obey God rather than man. The result of this disobedience was
                    excommunication by Lucius III. in 1184. Thus a reforming movement became heresy
                    through disobedience to authority, and after being condemned embarked on a
                    course of polemical investigation how to justify its own position. Some were
                    readmitted into the Catholic Church, and one, Durandus de Osca (1210), attempted
                    to found an order of Pauperes Catholici, which was the forerunner of the order
                    of St Dominic. Many were swept away in the crusade against the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Albigenses</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> Others made an
                    appeal to Innocent III., protesting their orthodoxy. Their appeal was not
                    successful, for they were formally condemned by the Lateran council of 1215.</p>
                <p>The earliest definite account given of the Waldensian opinion is that of the
                    inquisitor Sacconi about 1250.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>D’Argentré, <hi rend="italic">Collectio Judiciorum de Novis
                    Erroribus,</hi> i. 50, &amp;c.</p></note> He divides them into two classes,
                    those north of the Alps and those of Lombardy. The first class hold (1) that
                    oaths are forbidden by the gospel, (2) that capital punishment is not allowed to
                    the civil power, (3) that any layman may consecrate the sacrament of the altar,
                    and (4) that the Roman Church is not the church of Christ. The Lombard sect went
                    farther in (3) and (4), holding that no one in mortal sin could consecrate the
                    sacrament, and that the Roman Church was the scarlet woman of the Apocalypse,
                    whose precepts ought not to be obeyed, especially those appointing fast-days.
                    This account sufficiently shows the difference of the Waldenses from the
                    Cathari: they were opposed to asceticism, and had no official priesthood; at the
                    same time their objection to oaths and to capital punishment are closely related
                    to the principles of the Cathari. Their other opinions were forced upon them by
                    their conflict with the authority of the church. When forbidden to preach
                    without the permission of the bishop, they were driven to assert the right of
                    all to preach, without distinction of age or sex. This led to the further step
                    of setting up personal merit rather than ecclesiastical ordination as the ground
                    of the priestly office. From this <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n347/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0347-0324"/> followed again the conclusion that obedience was
                    not due to an unworthy priest, and that his ministrations were invalid.</p>
                <p>These opinions were subversive of the system of the mediaeval church, and were
                    naturally viewed with great disfavour by its officials; but it cannot fairly be
                    said that they have much in common with the opinions of the Reformers of the
                    16th century. The mediaeval church set forth Christ as present in the orderly
                    community of the faithful; Protestantism aimed at setting the individual in
                    immediate communion with Christ, without the mechanical intervention of the
                    officers of the community; the Waldenses merely set forward a new criterion of
                    the orderly arrangement of the church, according to which each member was to sit
                    in judgment on the works of the ministers, and consequently on the validity of
                    their ministerial acts. It was a rude way of expressing a desire for a more
                    spiritual community. The earliest known document proceeding from the Waldensians
                    is an account of a conference held at Bergamo in 1218 between the Ultramontane
                    and the Lombard divisions, in which the Lombards showed a greater opposition to
                    the recognized priesthood than did their northern brethren.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Preger, <hi rend="italic">Beiträge zur
                    Geschichte der Waldesier.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>As these opinions became more pronounced persecution became more severe, and the
                    breach between the Waldenses and the church widened. The Waldenses withdrew
                    altogether from the ministrations of the church, and chose ministers for
                    themselves whose merits were recognized by the body of the faithful. Election
                    took the place of ordination, but even here the Lombards showed their difference
                    from the Ultramontanes, and recognized only two orders, like the Cathari, while
                    the northern body kept the old three orders of bishops, priests, and deacons.
                    Gradually the separation from the church became more complete: the sacraments
                    were regarded as merely symbolical; the priests became helpers of the faithful;
                    ceremonies disappeared; and a new religious society arose equally unlike the
                    mediaeval church and the Protestantism of the 16th century.</p>
                <p>The spread of these heretical sects led to resolute attempts at their
                    suppression. The crusade against the Albigensians could destroy prosperous
                    cities and hand over lands from a heedless lord to one who was obedient to the
                    church; but it could not get rid of heresy. The revival of preaching, which was
                    the work of the order of St Dominic, did more to combat heresy, especially where
                    its persuasions were enforced by law. The work of inquisition into cases of
                    heresy proceeded slowly in the hands of the bishops, who were too busy with
                    other matters to find much time for sitting in judgment on theological points
                    about which they were imperfectly informed. The greatest blow struck against
                    heresy was the transference of the duty of inquiry into heresy from the bishops
                    to Dominican inquisitors. The secular power, which shared in the proceeds of the
                    confiscation of those who were found guilty of heresy, was ready to help in
                    carrying out the judgments of the spiritual courts. Everywhere, and especially
                    in the district round Toulouse, heretics were keenly prosecuted, and before the
                    continued zeal of persecution the Waldenses slowly disappeared from the chief
                    centres of population and took refuge in the retired valleys of the Alps. There,
                    in the recesses of Piedmont, where the streams of the Pelice, the Angrogne, the
                    Clusone, and others cleave the sides of the Alps into valleys which converge at
                    Susa, a settlement of the Waldensians was made who gave their name to these
                    valleys of the Vaudois. In the more accessible regions north and south heresy
                    was exposed to a steady process of persecution, and tended to assume shifting
                    forms. Among the valleys it was less easily reached, and retained its old
                    organization and its old contents. Little settlements of heretics dispersed
                    throughout Italy and Provence looked to the valleys as a place of refuge, and
                    tacitly regarded them as the centre of their faith. At times attempts were made
                    to suppress the sect of the Vaudois, but the nature of the country which they
                    inhabited, their obscurity, and their isolation made the difficulties of their
                    suppression greater than the advantages to be gained from it. However, in 1487
                    Innocent VIII. issued a bull for their extermination, and Alberto de’ Capitanei,
                    archdeacon of Cremona, put himself at the head of a crusade against them.
                    Attacked in Dauphiné and Piedmont at the same time, the Vaudois were hard
                    pressed; but luckily their enemies were encircled by a fog when marching upon
                    their chief refuge in the valley of the Angrogne, and were repulsed with great
                    loss. After this Charles II., duke of Piedmont, interfered to save his
                    territories from further confusion, and promised the Vaudois peace. They were,
                    however, sorely reduced by the onslaught which had been made upon them, and lost
                    their ancient spirit of independence. When the Lutheran movement began they were
                    ready to sympathize with it, and ultimately to adapt their old beliefs to those
                    of the rising Protestantism. Already there were scattered bodies of Waldenses in
                    Germany who had influenced, and afterwards joined, the Hussites and the Bohemian
                    Brethren.</p>
                <p>The last step in the development of the Waldensian body was taken in 1530, when
                    two deputies of the Vaudois in Dauphiné and Provence, Georges Morel and Pierre
                    Masson, were sent to confer with the German and Swiss Reformers. A letter
                    addressed to Oecolompadius<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Scultetus, <hi rend="italic">Annales,</hi> ii. 294, &amp;c.</p></note> gives
                    an account of their practices and beliefs at that time, and shows us a simple
                    and unlettered community, which was the survival of an attempt to form an
                    esoteric religious society within the mediaeval church. It would appear that its
                    members received the sacraments of baptism and the holy communion from the
                    regular priesthood, at all events sometimes, but maintained a discipline of
                    their own and held services for their own edification. Their ministers were
                    called <hi rend="italic">barba,</hi> a Provençal word meaning <hi rend="italic"
                    >guide.</hi> They were chosen from among labouring men, who at the age of
                    twenty-five might ask the body of ministers to be admitted as candidates. If
                    their character was approved they were taught during the winter months, when
                    work was slack, for a space of three or four years; after that they were sent
                    for two years to serve as menial assistants at a nunnery for women, which
                    curiously enough existed in a recess of the valleys. Then they were admitted to
                    office, after receiving the communion, by the imposition of hands of all
                    ministers present. They went out to preach two by two, and the junior was bound
                    absolutely to obey the senior. Clerical celibacy was their rule, but they admit
                    that it created grave disorders. The ministers received food and clothing from
                    the contributions of the people, but also worked with their hands; the result of
                    this was that they were very ignorant, and also were grasping after bequests
                    from the dying. The affairs of the church were managed by a general synod held
                    every year. The duties of the barbas were to visit all within their district
                    once a year, hear their confessions, advise and admonish them; in all services
                    the two ministers sat side by side, and one spoke after the other. In point of
                    doctrine they acknowledged the seven sacraments, but gave them a symbolical
                    meaning; they prayed to the Virgin and saints, and admitted auricular
                    confession, but they denied purgatory and the sacrifice of the mass, and did not
                    observe fasts or festivals. After giving this account of themselves they ask for
                    information about several points in a way which shows the exigencies of a rude
                    and isolated society, and finally they say that they have been much disturbed by
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n348/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0348-0325"/> Lutheran teaching about freewill and
                    predestination, for they had held that men did good works through natural virtue
                    stimulated by God’s grace, and they thought of predestination in no other way
                    than as a part of God’s foreknowledge.</p>
                <p>Oecolampadius gave them further instruction, especially emphasizing the
                    wrongfulness of their outward submission to the ordinances of the church: “God,”
                    he said, “is a jealous God, and does not permit his elect to put themselves
                    under the yoke of Antichrist.” The result of this intercourse was an alliance
                    between the Vaudois and the Swiss and German Reformers. A synod was held in 1532
                    at Chanforans in the valley of the Angrogne, where a new confession of faith was
                    adopted, which recognized the doctrine of election, assimilated the practices of
                    the Vaudois to those of the Swiss congregations, renounced for the future all
                    recognition of the Roman communion, and established their own worship no longer
                    as secret meetings of a faithful few but as public assemblies for the glory of
                    God.</p>
                <p>Thus the Vaudois ceased to be relics of the past, and became absorbed in the
                    general movement of Protestantism. This was not, however, a source of quiet or
                    security. In France and Italy alike they were marked out as special objects of
                    persecution, and the Vaudois Church has many records of martyrdom. The most
                    severe trial to which the Vaudois of Piedmont were subjected occurred in 1655.
                    The Congregation <hi rend="italic">de Propaganda Fide</hi> established, in 1650,
                    a local council in Turin, which exercised a powerful influence on Duke Charles
                    Emmanuel II., who ordered that the Vaudois should be reduced within the limits
                    of their ancient territory. Fanaticism took advantage of this order; and an
                    army, composed partly of French troops of Louis XIV., partly of Irish soldiers
                    who had fled before Cromwell, entered the Vaudois valleys and spread destruction
                    on every side. They treated the people with horrible barbarity, so that the
                    conscience of Europe was aroused, and England under Cromwell called on the
                    Protestant powers to join in remonstrance to the duke of Savoy and the French
                    king. The pen of Milton was employed for this purpose, and his famous sonnet is
                    but the condensation of his state papers. Sir Samuel Morland was sent on a
                    special mission to Turin, and to him were confided by the Vaudois leaders copies
                    of their religious books, which he brought back to England, and ultimately gave
                    to the university library at Cambridge. Large sums of money were contributed in
                    England and elsewhere, and were sent to the suffering Vaudois.</p>
                <p>By this demonstration of opinion peace was made for a time between the Vaudois
                    and their persecutors; but it was a treacherous peace, and left the Vaudois with
                    a hostile garrison established among them. Their worship was prohibited, and
                    their chief pastor, Leger, was obliged to flee, and in his exile at Leyden wrote
                    his <hi rend="italic">Histoire Générale des Eglises Vaudoise s</hi> (1684). The
                    revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685 began a new period of persecution,
                    which aimed at entire extermination. This was found so difficult that the
                    remnant of the Vaudois, to the number of 2600, were at last allowed to withdraw
                    to Geneva. But the love of their native valleys was strong among the exiles, and
                    in 1689 one of their pastors, Henri Arnaud, led a band of 800 men to the
                    reconquest of their country. His first attempts against the French were
                    successful; and the rupture between Victor Amadeus, duke of »Savoy, and Louis
                    XIV. brought a sudden change of fortune to the Vaudois. They were recognized
                    once more as citizens of Savoy, and in the war against France which broke out in
                    1696 the Vaudois regiment did good service for its duke. The peace of Utrecht
                    saw the greater part of the French territory occupied by the Vaudois annexed to
                    Savoy, and, though there were frequent threatenings of persecution, the idea of
                    toleration slowly prevailed in the policy of the house of Savoy. The Vaudois,
                    who had undergone all these vicissitudes, were naturally reduced to poverty, and
                    their ministers were partially maintained by a subsidy from England, which was
                    granted by Queen Anne. The 18th century, however, was a time of religious
                    decadence even among the Alpine valleys, and the outbreak of the French
                    Revolution saw the Vaudois made subjects of France. This led to a loss of the
                    English subsidy, and they applied to Napoleon for an equivalent. This was
                    granted, and their church was organized by the state. On the restoration of the
                    house of Savoy in 1816 English influence was used on behalf of the Vaudois, who
                    received a limited toleration. From that time onwards the Vaudois became the
                    objects of much interest in Protestant countries. Large sums of money were
                    collected to build hospitals and churches among their valleys, and they were
                    looked upon as the possible centre of a Protestant church in Italy. Especially
                    from England did they receive sympathy and help. An English clergyman, Dr Gilly,
                    visited the valleys in 1823, and by his writings on the Vaudois Church attracted
                    considerable attention, so that he was enabled to build a college at La Torre.
                    Moreover, Dr Gilly’s book <hi rend="italic">(A Visit to the Valleys of
                    Piedmont),</hi> chancing to fall into the hands of an officer who had lost his
                    leg at Waterloo, Colonel Beckwith, suggested an object for the energies of one
                    who was loth at the age of twenty-six to sink into enforced idleness. Beckwith
                    visited the valleys, and was painfully struck by the squalor and ignorance of a
                    people who had so glorious a past. He settled among them, and for thirty-five
                    years devoted himself to promote their welfare. He married a Vaudois peasant
                    girl, lived amongst the people, and established no fewer than 120 schools.
                    Moreover he brought back the Italian language which had been displaced by the
                    French in the services of the Vaudois Church, and in 1849 built a church for
                    them in Turin. He lived in La Torre till his death in 1862, and the name of the
                    English benefactor is still revered by the simple folk of the valleys whom he
                    did so much to civilize.</p>
                <p>According to the latest official returns the Waldensian Church had, in 1886-87,
                    43 churches and 38 mission stations throughout Italy. The ordained pastors
                    numbered 37, evangelists 6, and male and female teachers 56, the total number of
                    salaried agents being 124. The church had 4005 members, and the day schools were
                    attended by 2206 scholars, the Sunday schools by 2482. The total income, about
                    three-fourths of it contributions from the United Kingdom and other Protestant
                    countries of northern Europe, amounted to upwards of £10,000.</p>
                <p>The literature on the subject of the Waldensian and other sects is copious. For
                    their rise the most important authorities are to be found in Moneta, <hi
