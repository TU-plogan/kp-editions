                    truly pronounced to be the “most magnificent of the ancient feudal mansions of
                    the English nobility still used as a residence.” Its position is at once
                    commanding and picturesque, standing as it does on a rock overhanging the Avon.
                    Its principal features are Caesar’s Tower, 147 feet high, built in the 14th
                    century; the Gateway Tower, in the centre; and Guy’s Tower, 128 feet, also of
                    the 14th century. There is a fine collection of pictures. The Great Hall and the
                    family apartments were destroyed by fire in 1871, but have been restored. In the
                    collegiate church of St Mary Warwick possesses one of the most interesting
                    ecclesiastical buildings in the country. We learn from Domesday that a church
                    existed before the Conquest, but of its foundation nothing is really known. It
                    was made collegiate by Roger de Newburgh, the second Norman earl. It was
                    dissolved by Henry VIII. in 1545, by whom it was granted to the burgesses of the
                    town, with an estate then worth £58, 14s. 4d. to maintain it, together with the
                    king’s school. A great part of the church was destroyed by fire in 1694, and
                    afterwards rebuilt. The glory of this church, however, is the Beauchamp Chapel,
                    founded by Earl Richard Beauchamp by will, and commenced in 1443 and completed
                    1464. It is one of the finest examples of pure Gothic in the kingdom. In the
                    centre of the chapel is the splendid tomb of the earl. The church of St
                    Nicholas, near the entrance to the castle grounds, is modern, with a tower and
                    spire, and was erected towards the end of the 18th century. St Paul’s is new.
                    The priory of St Sepulchre was founded by Henry de Newburgh on the site of an
                    ancient church for a society of canons regular. It is now a private residence.
                    One of the most interesting places in Warwick is the hospital of Robert Dudley,
                    earl of Leicester, one of the most picturesque examples of halftimber buildings
                    in England. It was originally used as the hall of the united guilds of the Holy
                    Trinity, the Blessed Virgin, and St George the Martyr. The earl of Leicester, by
                    an Act of Incorporation obtained in 1571, founded the hospital for the reception
                    of twelve poor men possessing not more than £5 a year, and a master. The first
                    master, appointed by the earl himself, was the famous Puritan, Thomas
                    Cartwright. There are numerous charities in the town, the principal being those
                    of Henry VIII., Sir Thomas White, and Thomas Oken. The first is derived from the
                    tithes of St Mary, St Nicholas in Warwick, the parish of Budbrooke, and
                    Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire, together with the rents of houses and lands
                    in the borough. It produces about £3000 a year, and is used for paying the
                    stipends of the vicar and an assistant minister for St Mary’s, the vicars of St
                    Nicholas and Budbrooke, the mayor, the town-clerk, yeoman, serjeant-at-mass, and
                    a beadle; while £460, 10s. is annually given in aid of the king’s school. By the
                    charity of Sir Thomas White the sum of £100 is lent, without interest, to young
                    tradesmen for a period of nine years. From the funds left for that purpose by
                    Thomas Oken, allowances are made to the poor. The area of the borough is 5512
                    acres; the population in 1861 was 10,570, in 1871 10,986, and in 1881
                    11,800.</p>
                <p>A fortress is said to have been erected here as early as the year 50, by P.
                    Octavius Scapula, and it is supposed to have been the praesidium Romanorum at
                    which a cohort of Dalmatian horse was stationed. It was destroyed by the Danes
                    in one of their incursions into Mercia, and in 915 Alfred’s daughter Ethelfleda
                    built the fortress on which the castle now stands. The town is mentioned in
                    Domesday, where we learn that “in the borough the king has in his demesne 113
                    houses, and the king’s barons have 112, from which the king receives Danegeld.
                    The bishop of Worcester has 9 dwellings, the bishop of Chester 7, the abbot of
                    Coventry 36, and four were destroyed to enlarge the castle.” In the time of
                    Edward the Confessor the sheriffwick of Warwick, with the borough and royal
                    manors, rendered £65, and “thirty-six sextars of honey, or £24, 6s. instead of
                    honey <hi rend="italic">(pro omnibus quae ad mel pertinebant).</hi> Now, with
                    the <hi rend="italic">forra</hi> of the royal manors and pleas of the county, it
                    pays per annum £145 by weight, £23 for the custom of dogs, 20s. for a sumpter
                    horse, £10 for a hawk, and 100s. for Queengold. Besides this it renders
                    twenty-four sextars of honey of the larger measure, and from the borough six
                    sextars of honey, at the sextar for 15d.” The celebrated Thurkill (or Turchill)
                    was the last Saxon earl of Warwick.</p>
                <p>William the Conqueror began his first northern campaign in 1068, and the first
                    place where his presence is distinctly recorded is Warwick. He erected here one
                    of his strong fortifications on the site of the old one. Not a vestige of it now
                    exists, but, as Mr Freeman writes, “the mound itself still remains, a monument
                    of the wisdom and energy of the mighty daughter of Aelfred, while the keep of
                    William has so utterly perished that its very site can only now be guessed
                    at.”</p>
                <p>Of the earls of Warwick who may be noticed, of course the legendary Guy, with the
                    numerous traditions relating his wonderful achievements, stands first. In proof
                    of his prowess do not his gigantic helmet, his furnace-like pot, and his mighty
                    fork remain in the castle to this day, to testify against all unbelievers?
                    Prominently in history we have Guy de Beauchamp, who came to the title in 1298,
                    and who was called by the favourite Piers Gaveston “the Black Hound of Arden.”
                    He was instrumental in taking Piers prisoner, and in leading him to Blacklow
                    Hill, close to Warwick, and there beheading him in 1311. Richard Nevil, the
                    famous “king-maker” (see below), assumed the title in right of his wife Anne,
                    and was slain at the battle of Barnet, 1471. Then the unfortunate George
                    Plantagenet, duke of Clarence, was created earl by his brother Edward IV., but
                    afterwards perished, it is said, by being drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine. The
                    title has frequently lain dormant. In 1547 it was revived in favour of the
                    Dudleys, when Viscount Lisle was created earl by Edward VI. It became extinct in
                    1589, and in 1618 was renewed in the person of Robert, Lord Rich, whose eldest
                    son was lord high admiral for the Commonwealth. Again the title became extinct
                    in 1759. The castle had long been in the possession of the Greville family,
                    having been granted to Sir Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, by James I. when it was
                    in a ruinous condition, and he restored it, at a cost, it is said, of £20,000.
                    Dugdale says he made it “not only a place of great strength, but extraordinary
                    delight, with most pleasant gardens, walks, and thickets, such as this part of
                    England can hardly parallel; so that now it is the most princely seat that is
                    within the midland parts of this realm.” He died from the effects of a wound
                    inflicted by his own servant, September 8, 1628. His successor, Robert Greville,
                    was the son of Fulke’s first cousin, and is the Lord Brooke who is famous in the
                    civil war between Charles and the Parliament, and was appointed
                    commander-in-chief of the Parliamentary forces of Warwickshire and
                    Staffordshire. He was engaged in the first fight of the war at Edge Hill, and
                    was killed at the siege of Lichfield cathedral, on March 1, 1643. The title of
                    earl of Warwick was bestowed on Francis, eighth Lord Brooke, by George II. in
                    1746. His son George, who succeeded to the title in 1773, was a great benefactor
                    of the borough, and was lavish in his expenditure on the castle.</p>
