                    (1802-1875), the practical founder of modern telegraphy, was born at Gloucester
                    in February 1802, his father being a music-seller in that city. In 1806 the
                    family removed to London. Wheatstone’s education was carried on in several
                    private schools, at which he appears to have displayed no remarkable
                    attainments, being mainly characterized by a morbid shyness and sensitiveness
                    that prevented him from making friends. About 1816 he was sent to his uncle, a
                    musical instrument maker in the Strand, to learn the trade; but with his

                    he continued making experiments in acoustics, following out his own ideas and
                    devising many beautiful and ingenious arrangements. Of these the
                    “acoucryptophone” was one of the most elegant—a light box, shaped like an
                    ancient lyre and suspended by a metallic wire from a piano in the room above.
                    When the instrument was played, the vibrations were transmitted silently, and
                    became audible in the lyre, which thus appeared to play of itself. On the death
                    of his uncle in 1823 Wheatstone and his brother took up the business; but
                    Charles never seems to have taken a very active part in it, and he virtually
                    retired after six years, devoting himself to experimental research, at first
                    chiefly with regard to sound. In 1823 he published his first paper, “New
                    Experiments on Sound,” in Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Annals of Philosophy,</hi>
                    and was greatly encouraged by the appreciative translations which appeared in
                    several Continental journals. Wheatstone’s shyness still clung to him; for,
                    although he occasionally read a paper to scientific societies when a young man,
                    he never could become a lecturer. Hence many of his investigations were first
                    described by Faraday in his Friday evening discourses at the Royal Institution.
                    By 1834 Wheatstone’s originality and resource in experiment were fully
                    recognized, and he was appointed professor of experimental philosophy at King’s
                    College, London, in that year. This appointment was inaugurated by two events,—a
                    course of eight lectures on sound, which proved no success and was not repeated,
                    and the determination by means of a revolving mirror of the speed of electric
                    discharge in conductors, a piece of work leading to enormously important
                    results. The great velocity of electrical transmission suggested the possibility
                    of utilizing it for sending messages; and, after many experiments and the
                    practical advice and business-like cooperation of Cooke, a patent for an
                    electric telegraph was taken out in their joint names in 1837. Wheatstone’s
                    early training in making musical instruments now bore rich fruit in the
                    continuous designing of new instruments and pieces of mechanism. His life was
                    uneventful except in so far as the variety of his work lent it colour. He became
                    a fellow of the Royal Society in 1837; in 1847 he married; and in 1868, after
                    the completion of his masterpiece, the automatic telegraph, he was knighted.
                    While in Paris perfecting a receiving instrument for submarine cables, Sir
                    Charles Wheatstone caught cold, and died on 19th October 1875.</p>
                <p>Wheatstone was enthusiastic in his work; and, in spite of the invincible
                    repugnance to public speaking, he could explain his machines and describe
                    results to his friends with animation and remarkable clearness. Owing to the
                    cast of his mind he could only undertake work with some distinct end or definite
                    application in view; hence he applied himself chiefly to the useful embodiment
                    of scientific principles, and to researches designed to throw light on such
                    subjects as the interference of mental impressions with the evidence of the
                    senses. As a natural consequence of the nervous enthusiasm which possessed him,
                    several researches which had been commenced, and sometimes carried to a
                    considerable distance, were relinquished as new sources of interest presented
                    themselves, and remained unfinished at his death. Many of his ideas were
                    expanded and appropriated by other workers, more persevering, if less original,
                    who carried them into effect. Wheatstone’s physical investigations are described
                    in more than thirty-six papers in varions scientific journals, the more
                    important being in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comptes Rendus,</hi> and the British Association <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reports.</hi> They naturally divide themselves into researches on sound, light,
                    and electricity, but extend into other branches of physics as well. But his best
                    work by far was in the invention of complicated and delicate mechanism for
                    various purposes, in the construction of which he employed a staff of workmen
                    trained to the highest degree of excellence. For his insight into mechanism and
                    his power over it he was unequalled, except perhaps by Babbage. A cryptographic
                    machine, which changed the cipher automatically and printed a message, entirely
                    unintelligible until translated by a duplicate instrument, was one of the most
                    perfect examples of this. Cryptography had a great fascination for Wheatstone;
                    he studied it deeply at one time, and deciphered many of the MSS. in the British
                    Museum which had defied all other interpreters. In acoustics his principal work
                    was a research on the transmission of sound through solids (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Telephone),</hi> the explanation of Chladni’s figures of
                    vibrating solids, various investigations of the principles of acoustics and the
                    mechanism of hearing, and the invention of new musical instruments, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the concertina. The kaleidophone, intended to present
                    visibly the movements of a sonorous body, consisted of a vibrating wire, which
                    could be varied in length, carrying a silvered bead reflecting a point of light.
                    The motion of the bead was thus shown by persistence of the successive images on
                    the retina, and mazy lines of light traced out its successive positions. A
                    photometer was constructed on the same principle. In light there are a series of
                    papers on the eye, on the physiology of vision, on binocular vision, including
                    the invention of one of the most popular of scientific toys, the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Stereoscope</hi><hi rend="italic">(q∙v.'),</hi> and on colour.
                    The polar clock, devised for use in place of a sun-dial, applies the fact that
                    the plane of polarization of sky light is always 90° from the position of the
                    sun; hence by measuring the azimuthal angle of the plane, even when the sun is
                    below the horizon, correct apparent solar time may be obtained. In 1835, in a
                    paper on ‘ ‘ The Prismatic Decomposition of Electrical Light,” he proved that
                    sparks from different metals give distinctive spectra, which could be used as a
                    means of detecting them. This is the fundamental experiment of chemical analysis
                    by spark spectra. But it is by his electrical work that Wheatstone will best be
                    remembered. Much of this, such as the famous “bridge” for measuring resistances
                    that bears his name, will be found described under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Electricity</hi> (vol. viii. p. 44). He not only guided the growth of
                    scientific telegraphy on land wires, but made the earliest experiments with
                    submarine cables, foreseeing the practicability of this means of communication
                    as early as 1840. For short descriptions of the “A, B, C” telegraph
                    instrument—so popular before the introduction of the telephone—and of the
                    automatic transmitter, by which messages may be sent at the rate of 500 words a
                    minute, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Telegraph.</hi> He also devised printing
                    telegraph receivers of various forms, electrical chronoscopes, and many forms of
                    electrical recording apparatus,—amongst others two sets of registering
                    meteorological instruments, of which the earlier, described in 1842, was
                    afterwards developed by Secchi and Van Rysselberghe (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Thermometer,</hi> vol. xxiii. p. 293), but the later, put forward in 1867,
                    included metallic thermometers and was less successful.</p>
