                <p><label type="entry">WARWICK</label>, a midland county of England, is bounded on

                    and Gloucester, and on the W. by Worcester. Its greatest length from north to
                    south is 50 miles, and its greatest breadth 33 miles. Its area is 566,458 acres,
                    or about 885 square miles. Camden describes it as being “divided into two parts,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Feldon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Woodland</hi> [or
                    Arden], that is into a plain champain and a woody country; which parts, the
                    Avon, running crookedlie from north-east to soutli-west, doth, after a sort,
                    sever one from the other.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface and Geology.—</hi> The surface of the county is of a
                    gently undulating nature. For a description of the scenery and early history the

                <p>The chief elevations are the Edge Hills on the southern border of the county,
                    where they rise in some places to about 800 feet above sea-level. In the same
                    neighbourhood are the Burton Dassett and Farnborough Hills; northeast of these
                    are the Napton and Shuckburgh Hills, and <pb break="no"

                    Some elevated land is found at Corley, Oldbury, Hartshill, &amp;c., in the north
                    of the county.</p>
                <p>The lofty elevation of the county in general is evidenced by the fact that rivers
                    flow from it in several directions, contributing to each of the three systems of
                    the Severn, Trent, and Thames. The Avon rises in Northamptonshire, and flowing
                    soutli-west through the county receives on its way the Swift, Sowe, Learn,
                    Itchene, Stour, Alne, and other tributaries, and falls into the Severn at
                    Tewkesbury. It is navigable for barges up to Stratford, and is rich in its
                    associations with Shakespeare. The Tame rises in Staffordshire, and flowing
                    through the northern portion of Warwickshire takes in the Cole, Blythe, Anker,
                    Rea, and other minor streams. A few small rivulets in the south of the county
                    fall into the Cherwell, a tributary of the Thames.</p>
                <p>The New Red Sandstone is the principal geological formation of the county, but
                    towards the south the Lias prevails. In the north central district there is a
                    large deposit of gravel, which consists of “small boulders and sea-worn pebbles,
                    and ancient rocks traceable to the parent beds in Yorkshire, Cumberland, and
                    Scotland, and commonly known as the northern drift. Quartz pebbles especially
                    abound in it; granite, gneiss, syenite, porphyry, slate, mica schist, trap, and
                    almost every other variety of the primary rocks may be collected.” The Lias is
                    near Edge Hill; the strata immediately below it consist of clay and ironstone,
                    rich in iron ore. The Upper Lias crosses the county by Henley-in-Arden,
                    Stratford, Kineton, Southam, and Rugby. With the exception of one coalfield,
                    small but rich, extending from Tamworth to near Wyken, about 15 miles, the New
                    Red Sandstone and Permian occupy the whole of the central part of the county. In
                    the north Upper Cambrian quartzites and shales are found, together with some
                    volcanic rocks. The Coal-Measures dip under the Lower Permian rocks, and in the
                    southern part of the field underlie the Trias. According to the report of the
                    Coal Commission in 1871, the area of the Warwickshire coal-field is 30 square
                    miles, the thickness of the coal being from 26 to 30 feet. The quantity raised
                    in 1870 was 647,540 tons, and in 1885 it was 1,281,724.</p>
                <p>The minerals of the county are limestone, freestone, iron, blue flagstone, marl,
                    and blue clay. The blue flagstone is found in many places, and ironstone at
                    Bedworth, Oldbury, and Merevale. The limestone quarries are principally at
                    Bearley, Grafton Court, Stretton, Prince-thorpe, Ufton, Harbury, Arlescote,
                    Bidford, Newbold-on-Avon, Stockton, and Southam; freestone is found largely
                    about Warwick, Leamington, Kenilworth, and Coventry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Agriculture.—</hi> The climate is generally mild
                    and healthy. The soil is on the whole good, and consists of various loams,
                    marls, gravels, and clays, well suited for most of the usual crops. It is rich
                    in pasture-land, and dairy farming is increasing. It has excellent orchards and
                    market gardens, and possesses some of the finest woodlands in England. Nearly
                    all the farm buildings are good; and many of the cottages of the labourers are
                    exceedingly picturesque. There are many charming villages in the county.
                    According to the agricultural returns, out of a total area of 566,458 acres
                    there were 496,429 acres under cultivation in 1887, corn crops occupying 105,039
                    acres, green crops 31,411, rotation grasses 40,783, permanent pasture 308,689,
                    and fallow 10,493; of the corn crops much the largest area was under wheat,
                    which occupied 43,728 acres, barley occupying 16,290, oats 26,297, rye 256,
                    beans 14,050, and pease 4418. Of the green crops turnips occupied 16,913 acres,
                    potatoes 4936 acres, while 4198 were under mangolds, 114 under carrots, 971
                    under cabbage, &amp;c., and 4279 under vetches and other green crops.</p>
                <p>The number of horses in 1887 was 20,769, cattle 107,555, of which 37,080 were
                    cows and heifers in milk or in calf, sheep 294,442, 172,151 of them one-year-old
                    and above, and pigs 37,092.</p>
                <p>According to the <hi rend="italic">Return of Owners of Land,</hi> 1873, the total
                    number of proprietors in the county was 51,516, possessing 541,022 acres, with a
                    gross annual rental of £3,318,304, or about £6, 2s. 8d. per acre all over. Of
                    these owners of land only 4622 had one acre and upwards. Of waste or common land
                    there was 1833 acres. The following possessed over 5000 acres:—Lord Leigh,
                    14,892 acres; Lord Willoughby de Broke, 12,621; earl of Aylesford, 12,159;
                    marquis of Hertford, 10,282; earl of Craven, 8448; earl of Warwick, 8263; Sir N.
                    W. Throckmorton, 7619; duke of Buccleuch, 6881; H. J. Lucy, 5766; W. S. Dugdale,
                    5689; Sir G. R. Philips, 5397; and C. N. Newdegate, 5318.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> The principal seats of manufacture in the
                    county are <hi rend="smallcaps">Birmingham</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Coventry</hi><hi rend="italic">(qq.v.).</hi> Suffice it to say here that in
                    Birmingham almost every article of use, from a pin to a steam engine, is
                    produced, and that Coventry has long been famous for its ribbons and watches,
                    and has recently won a well-merited reputation for bicycles and tricycles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> The county is well supplied with
                    excellently preserved roads. There are also a great number of canals giving
                    access to the Trent, the Mersey, the Thames, and the Severn. The London and
                    North-Western, the Great Western, the Midland, and various branch railways
                    traverse the county in various directions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population and Administration.—</hi> The population in 1871 was
                    634,189, and in 1881 737,339 (357,146 males and 380,193 females). More than half
                    the population is contained in the borough of Birmingham. The county is divided
                    into four hundreds :— (1) Hemlingford, (2) Knightlow, (3) Barlichway, (4)
                    Kineton. It has one city, Coventry (42,111), which is also a municipal borough;
                    five other boroughs—Birmingham (400,774), Leamington (22,979), Stratford-on-Avon
                    (8054), Warwick (11,800), and Sutton Coldfield (7737); and, besides the
                    boroughs, ten market towns, viz., Alcester (2430), Atherstone (4645), Coleshill
                    (2356), Henley in Arden (1119), Kenilworth (4150), Kineton (1053), Nuneaton
                    (8465), Rugby (9891), Solihull (5280), and Southam (1784). It is mostly in the
                    diocese of Worcester. It is in the midland judicial circuit, has one court of
                    quarter sessions, and is divided into fourteen petty and special sessional
                    divisions. The boroughs of Birmingham and Warwick have separate courts of
                    quarter sessions and commissions of the peace, and the city of Coventry and the
                    boroughs of Leamington and Stratford-on-Avon have commissions of the peace.</p>
                <p>By the Redistribution Bill of 1885 Warwickshire was for parliamentary purposes
                    divided into four boroughs and four county divisions. The boroughs are
                    Birmingham, Aston Manor, Coventry, and Warwick and Leamington united. Birmingham
                    has seven divisions, each returning a member—Bordesley, Central, East,
                    Edgbaston, North, South, and West; the other three boroughs return one member
                    each. The county divisions (Nuneaton, Rugby, Stratford-on-Avon, and Tamworth)
                    each return one member.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Warwickshire was occupied by the
                    British tribes Cornavii and Dobuni. The Romans named this part of England Flavia
                    Caesariensis, and many evidences of their occupation and works exist in the
                    county. It was crossed by the three great roads—Watling Street, the Fosse Way,
                    and Icknield Street; the last-named gives its name to a street in Birmingham
                    which is on the lines of the old Roman road. The Ridgeway borders a part of
                    Warwickshire on the west. Roman stations or camps were at Mancetter, High Cross,
                    Alcester, Chesterton, and other places; coins, pottery, and other remains have
                    been found at Warwick, Willoughby, Hampton-in-Arden, Birmingham, and elsewhere.
                    The Teutons followed the Romans, and after suffering many changes Warwickshire
                    became part of Mercia. From 593 to 918 it was the scene of frequent invasions,
                    conquests, and reconquests.</p>
                <p>Although Mercia was for the most part peopled by Angles, the Saxons seem to have
                    occupied the portion now known as Warwickshire in very considerable numbers;
                    for, if we except Alcester, Mancetter, and a few other places, nearly all the
                    towns and villages have Saxon names. Of the three hundred and sixty places in
                    the county mentioned in Domesday nearly all are of Saxon origin. As Verstegan
                    says,</p>
                <p>“In Foord, in Ham, in Ley, in Tun, The most of English surnames run.’’</p>
                <p>And these terminations are found in the vast majority of the names of places in
                    Warwickshire. This prevalence of the Saxons here is also confirmed by the fact
                    that Mr Kemble discovered no fewer than thirty-one Mark names in places in
                    Warwickshire. The Danes, although they made inroads into Warwickshire several
                    times, seem to have made no settlements in the county, the only names bearing
                    the Danish suffix <hi rend="italic">by</hi> being on the north-east border. In
                    later times the “king-maker” carl of Warwick made the county memorable by the
                    part he took in the Wars of the Roses. In the civil war under Charles I.
                    “scarcely a place of any note escaped” without a struggle: at Edge Hill the
                    first engagement was fought; Aston Hall was besieged; Birmingham was sacked and
                    burned by Prince Rupert; Coventry endured a siege; Warwick was the centre of
                    several encounters; and a skirmish took place near Southam.</p>
                <p>Few remains of Saxon architecture are to be found in the county, and these are of
                    minor importance. Saxon jewels have been found at Compton-Verney; a fine burial
                    urn filled with ashes, an iron sword, a spear head, and other relics, at Church
                    Over; in a tumulus or barrow, at Marston, were found two sepulchral urns, one of
                    them containing bones, a fibula, a pin, part of a sword, and two <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0405-0380"/> spear heads. In 1824 an Anglo-Saxon cemetery
                    was discovered on Watling Street, near Bensford Bridge, in which a large number
                    of articles, both of use and ornament, were found. Other burial places have been
                    opened, and similar remains found. Some good examples of Norman work exist in
                    the churches at Kenilworth, Ryton, Stoneleigh, Berkeswell, Wolston, and
                    Beaudesert. Of famous and interesting places may be mentioned the noble
                    structure Warwick Castle; the ruins of Kenilworth Castle and Maxstoke Priory;
                    Maxstoke Castle; Compton Wyniates; Temple Balsall church; the “three tall
                    spires” at Coventry, with the beautiful churches of St Michael, Holy Trinity,
                    and St John Baptist; Bagley Hall, Combe Abbey, Wroxhall Abbey, Newnham Padox,
                    Astley Castle, Arbury Hall, Walton Hall, Guy’s Cliff, Baddesley Clinton,
                    Tamworth Castle and church, Packington Hall, and Stoneleigh Abbey.</p>
                <p>Among the eminent persons connected with Warwickshire besides William Shakespeare
                    are John Rogers the martyr, Michael Drayton, Sir W. Dugdale, Dr Parr, Dr Joseph
                    Priestley, Matthew Boulton, John Baskerville, Walter Savage Landor, and Marian
