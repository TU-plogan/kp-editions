                    was Gottlieb Müller, who thought him self-willed and eccentric; and his first
                    important composition was an “Overture in B♭,” performed at the Leipsic theatre
                    in 1830. In that year he matriculated at the university, and took lessons in
                    composition from Theodor Weinlig, cantor at the Thomasschule. His “First
                    Symphony” was performed at the Gewandhaus concerts in 1833, and in the following
                    year he was appointed conductor of the opera at Magdeburg. The post was an
                    unprofitable one, and Wagner’s life at this period was very unsettled. He had
                    composed an opera called <hi rend="italic">Die Feen,</hi> adapted from Gozzi’s
                    <hi rend="italic">La Donna Serpente,</hi> and another, <hi rend="italic">Das
                    Liebesverbot,</hi> founded on Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic">Measure for
                    Measure,</hi> but these were never performed, and for some considerable time the
                    young composer found it difficult to obtain a hearing.</p>
                <p>In 1836 Wagner married Fräulein Wilhelmina Planer, an actress at the theatre at
                    Königsberg. He had accepted an engagement there as conductor, but, the lessee
                    becoming bankrupt, the scheme was abandoned in favour of a better appointment at
                    Riga. Accepting this, he remained actively employed until 1839, when he made his
                    first visit to Paris, taking with him an unfinished opera, for which he had
                    himself prepared a libretto, upon the lines of Lord Lytton’s novel <hi
                    rend="italic">Rienzi.</hi> The venture proved a most unfortunate one. Wagner was
                    unsuccessful in all his attempts to achieve popularity, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rienzi,</hi> destined for the Grand Opéra, was relentlessly rejected. He
                    completed it, however, and in 1842 it was produced at the court theatre in
                    Dresden, where, with Madame Schroeder Devrient and Herr Tichatschek <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n337/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0337-0314"/> in the principal parts, it achieved an immense
                    success', and undoubtedly laid the foundation of the great composer’s fame.</p>
                <p>Though, in completing <hi rend="italic">Rienzi,</hi> Wagner had put forth all the
                    strength he then possessed, that work was far from representing his preconceived
                    ideal. This he now endeavoured to embody in <hi rend="italic">Der Fliegende
                    Hollander,</hi> for which, as before, he composed both the libretto and the
                    music. In this fine work we find the first sign of his determination to
                    sacrifice all considerations of traditional form and symmetrical construction to
                    the dramatic exigencies of the story. It is true, this great principle was but
                    very faintly announced in the new work, and in an evidently tentative form; but
                    the success of the experiment was incontestable, though it took some time to
                    convince the world of the fact. The piece was warmly received at Dresden,
                    January 2, 1843; but its success was by no means equal to that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Rienzi.</hi> Spohr, however, promptly discovered its merits, and
                    produced it at Cassel some months later, with very favourable results.</p>
                <p>Wagner was now fairly launched upon his arduous career. On February 2, 1843, he
                    was formally installed as hofkapellmeister at the Dresden theatre, and he
                    celebrated the event by at once beginning the composition of a new opera. For
                    the subject of this he selected the legend of Tannhäuser, collecting his
                    materials from the ancient “Tannhäuser-Lied,”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Preserved in Uhland’s <hi rend="italic">Alte
                    hoch u. nieder-deutsche Volkslieder.</hi></p></note> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Volksbuch,</hi> Tieck’s poetical <hi rend="italic">Erzählung,</hi> Hoffmann’s
                    story of <hi rend="italic">Der Sängerkrieg,</hi> and the mediaeval poem on <hi
                    rend="italic">Der Wartburgkrieg.</hi> This last-named legend introduces the
                    incidental poem of “Loherangrin,” and led to the study of Wolfram von
                    Eschenbach’s <hi rend="italic">Parzival und Titurel,</hi> with strange effect
                    upon Wagner’s subsequent inspirations. But for the present he confined himself
                    to the subject in hand; and on October 19, 1845, he produced his <hi
                    rend="italic">Tannhäuser,</hi> with Madame Schroeder Devrient, Fräulein Johanna
                    Wagner,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The composer’s
                    niece.</p></note> Herr Tichatschek, and Herr Mitterwurzer in the principal
                    parts. Notwithstanding this powerful cast, the success of the new work was not
                    brilliant, for it carried still farther the principles embodied in <hi
                    rend="italic">Der Fliegende Hollander,</hi> and these principles were not yet
                    understood either by the public or the critics. But Wagner boldly fought for
                    them, and would probably have gained the victory much sooner than he did had he
                    not taken a fatally prominent part in the political agitations of 1849, after
                    which his position in Dresden became untenable. In fact, after the flight of the
                    king, and the subsequent suppression of the riots by troops sent from Berlin, a
                    formal act of accusation was drawn up against him, and he had barely time to
                    escape to Weimar, where Liszt was at that moment engaged in preparing <hi
                    rend="italic">Tannhäuser</hi> for performance at the court theatre, before the
                    storm burst upon him with a violence that seriously alarmed both his friends and
                    himself.</p>
                <p>Without the loss of a moment Liszt procured a passport, and escorted his guest as
                    far as Eisenach. Wagner proceeded in all haste to Paris, and thence to Zurich,
                    where, with few interruptions, he lived in strict retirement until the autumn of
                    1859. And it was during this period that most of his literary
                    productions—including <hi rend="italic">Oper und Drama, Ueber das Dirigiren, Das
                    Judenthum in der Musik,</hi> and other like works—were given to the world.</p>
                <p>We have spoken of Wagner’s incidental study of the legends of “Loherangrin” and
                    “Parzival” during the time that he was preparing the libretto of <hi
                    rend="italic">Tannhäuser.</hi> After the production of that opera he again
                    recurred to the subject, chose <hi rend="italic">Lohengrin</hi> as the title for
                    his next opera, and elaborated the conception with his usual minute and
                    affectionate care, carrying out his new principles somewhat farther than he had
                    hitherto ventured to do. He had completed the work before he fled from Dresden,
                    but could not get it produced. Hoping against hope, he took the score with him
                    to Paris, and, as he himself tells us, “when ill, miserable, and despairing, I
                    sat brooding over my fate, my eye fell on the score of my <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lohengrin,</hi> which I had totally forgotten. Suddenly I felt something like
                    compassion that the music should never sound from off the death-pale paper. Two
                    words I wrote to Liszt; his answer was the news that preparations were being
                    made for the performance of the work, on the grandest scale that the limited
                    means of Weimar would permit. Everything that care and accessories could do was
                    done to make the design of the piece understood. Liszt saw what was wanted at
                    once, and did it. Success was his reward; and with this success he now
                    approaches me, saying, ‘ Behold we have come thus far; now create us a new work,
                    that we may go farther ’.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lohengrin</hi> was, in fact, produced at Weimar, under Liszt’s
                    direction, on August 28, 1850. It was a severe trial to Wagner not to be
                    permitted to hear his own work, but he knew that all that could be done for it
                    was done, and he responded to Liszt’s appeal for a new creation by meditating
                    upon his famous tetralogy, <hi rend="italic">Der Ring des Nibelungen,</hi> the
                    four divisions of which— <hi rend="italic">Das Rheingold, Die Walküre,
                    Siegfried,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Götterdämmerung—</hi> though each as long
                    as an ordinary opera, are in reality but parts of one colossal whole. At this
                    time, also, he first began to lay out the plan of <hi rend="italic">Tristan und
                    Isolde,</hi> and to think over the possibilities of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parsifal.</hi></p>
                <p>It is in these later works, and in <hi rend="italic">Die Meistersinger von
                    Nürnberg,</hi> the first sketch for which had been made at Dresden in 1845, that
                    the genius of Wagner reaches its culminating point; and it is in these only that
                    his great plan for the reformation of the musical drama is fully and honestly
                    carried out. In order to understand this plan, we must first inquire what kind
                    of reformation was needed. What were the abuses that demanded redress? What were
                    the causes that had led to the decline of the opera from a higher state of
                    perfection than that which it exhibited in the middle of the 19th century—if,
                    indeed, it ever did exhibit a higher state of perfection than that? What, in
                    short, had been the history of the musical drama during the two centuries and a
                    half that had elapsed between its first invention and its arrival at the
                    condition in which Wagner found it when he first began to compose for the stage?
                    The story is a very simple one, and may be told in a very few words; but it was
                    not without an immensity of deep thought and earnest consideration that Wagner
                    was able to grapple with the gigantic practical difficulties with which the case
                    was surrounded.</p>
                <p>The possibility of constructing a musical drama on reasonable principles was
                    first seriously discussed during the closing years of the 16th century, at
                    certain <hi rend="italic">réunions</hi> of literary and artistic dilettanti, who
                    were accustomed to meet periodically at the palazzo of Giovanni Bardi, Conte di
                    Vernio, in Florence. The principal members of the little society were Ottavio
                    Rinuccini the poet, Vincenzo Galilei the father of the great astronomer, Giulio
                    Caccini, Jacopo Peri, Pietro Strozzi, and the Conte di Vernio himself. All these
                    earnest savants were deeply embued with the principles of the Renaissance, and
                    regarded the traditions of classical antiquity with a reverence which led them
                    to hold the greatest creations of modern art in undisguised contempt. The music
                    of Palestrina and the great composers of the contrapuntal schools they utterly
                    despised; and their one idea was to revive the system of declamation peculiar to
                    Greek tragedy, and by means of that to produce a form of drama which could be
                    consistently sung throughout as the trilogies of Aeschylus and Sophocles were
                    sung by the Greeks. So far their aim was identical with Wagner’s. The difference
                    lay in the means by which this aim was to be attained. Wagner himself tells us
                    that, while occupied upon <hi rend="italic">Lohengrin,</hi> he looked upon his
                    work as “an experiment towards determining whether or not opera was possible.”
                    And in other places he speaks of the question whether or not the modern spirit
                    can produce a theatre that shall stand in relation to modern culture as the
                    theatre of Athens stood in relation to the culture of ancient Greece. He
                    believed that this might be accomplished by reforming the opera from the
                    standpoint of Beethoven’s music. The friends of the Conte di Vernio had hoped to
                    accomplish it by restoring the actual music of the Greek drama. But this was
                    impossible. For Greek music was based upon a system of tonality which, even in
                    the time of Galilei, had been obsolete for centuries. The Greek scales and ours
                    differ so widely in their radical construction that no vocalist accustomed <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n338/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0338-0315"/> to the one could by any possibility sing the
                    other. Even Peri and Vincenzo Galilei must have known this. But, pretending to
                    ignore the fact, they made a compromise, and endeavoured to imitate what they
                    fondly conceived to be the Greek method of recitative, in the tonality of the
                    modern scales; and in this way they struck, not upon the form of which they were
                    in search—for that was irretrievably lost—but a new one, which rapidly developed
                    itself into the kind of music now called recitative. This recitative —the most
                    valuable artistic invention of the 17th century—they used as the basis of their
                    musical drama; and, after the lapse of two centuries and a half, Wagner
                    determined that this, and none other, must be the basis of his. Enriching it
                    with all the beautiful accessories that had been amassed by composer after
                    composer during its long period of progressive development, and notably with
                    other very important accessories of his own invention, he built his drama upon
                    it as completely as the first dramatic music was built upon it by the
                    frequenters of the Palazzo Bardi. And in this great fact lies the secret of his
                    gigantic reform.</p>
                <p>The first Italian opera ever publicly performed was Jacopo Peri’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Euridice,</hi> composed to a libretto written by Ottavio
                    Rinuccini, and produced at Florence in 1600, in honour of the marriage of Henry
                    IV. of France with Maria de’ Medici. This most interesting work, a rare printed
                    copy of which is preserved in the British Museum, is entirely in recitative; and
                    the music is so constructed throughout as to aid in the true dramatic expression
                    of the words, at the expense of all attempt at what is now called melody. The
                    operas of Monteverde, Cesti, Cavalli, and all the earlier composers of the 17th
                    century were conceived upon the same principle. But Alessandro Scarlatti
                    (1659-1725), aiming at higher musical perfection, and willing to sacrifice no
                    small amount of dramatic truth to its exigencies, introduced certain
                    constructive forms—notably that called the “da capo”—which, while adding to the
                    symmetrical beauty of the aria, tended eventually entirely to destroy its
                    dramatic force and its logical consistency as an exponent of the situation
                    presented upon the stage. Later composers carried this abuse very much farther.
                    Handel’s strong dramatic instinct kept him above the errors of his time; but his
                    contemporaries sinned more and more deeply until, for the sake of obtaining
                    popularity, they were ready to fill their operas with unmeaning passages,
                    introduced solely for the purpose of showing off the skill of the favourite
                    vocalists of the period. And so the abuse proceeded from worse to worse until,
                    under Γorpora (1686-1766) and Hasse (1699-1783), the opera at Naples and Dresden
                    became a mere concert sung upon the stage without any trace of dramatic
                    propriety whatever.</p>
                <p>And now arose a reformer whose work will be remembered as long as the musical
                    drama continues to exist. Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714—1785), disgusted with
                    his own want of success while writing in the vicious style of the period,
                    determined to reform it upon true dramatic principles; and in the preface to his
                    <hi rend="italic">Alceste</hi> (1767) he set forth those principles with a
                    clearness which cannot possibly be misunderstood. The history of his great
                    reform has already been narrated in detail (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gluck).</hi> A careful comparison of the argument laid down in the preface to
                    <hi rend="italic">Alceste</hi> with that set forth in Wagner’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oper und Drama</hi> will prove the aim of the two reformers to have been
                    absolutely identical. That a less perfect identity should have existed with
                    regard to the means they used for the attainment of their common end was
                    naturally to be expected. At the outset of their career both Gluck and Wagner
                    freely employed all the resources at their command, adding to them afterwards as
                    circumstances permitted. But between the production of Gluck’s latest and
                    Wagner’s first masterpiece art had made enormous strides; the advantage,
                    therefore, in this respect was immeasurably on Wagner’s side.</p>
                <p>In France Gluck’s principles were carried out more or less conscientiously by
                    Méhul, Cherubini, and Spontini. In Germany they bore still richer fruit.
                    Glorified by the genius of Mozart and Beethoven, and accepted without reserve by
                    Weber, Spohr, Marschner, and the most enlightened of their followers in the
                    German romantic school, they were professed, if not fully carried out, by
                    composers of every degree. But in Italy they produced no effect whatever. Though
                    Rossini sometimes invested his situations with a certain amount of dramatic
                    colouring, he never attempted anything farther than this; while Mercadante,
                    Bellini, Donizetti, and their imitators regarded melody, pure and simple, as the
                    highest, if not the only really important, attribute of art. Under their rule
                    the opera once more descended to the level of a concert on the stage. The effect
                    of their example upon the lower class of German composers was fatal, and ended
                    in the production of a form of <hi rend="italic">Singspiel,</hi> lacking all the
                    freshness of the Italian <hi rend="italic">Cantilena,</hi> and noticeable only
                    for its intolerable vapidity. Notwithstanding the attempts of Halévy and
                    Meyerbeer to perpetuate in France the traditions of a purer epoch, the musical
                    drama sank, under Auber and his imitators, to the level of a string of dance
                    tunes. The 19th century had witnessed tho birth of abuses as flagrant as those
                    against which Gluck had protested in the 18th. It was Wagner’s turn now to
                    effect the desired reform, and he effected it as completely as his predecessor
                    had done—but not in the same way. Gluck had begun by propounding a theory, and
                    carried on the good work by consistently putting it into practice. Wagner
                    theorized also; but for his ultimate triumph he was indebted to the power of his
                    own creative genius—to his ceaseless endeavour to realize the preconceived ideal
                    which neither theory nor desire for reform could ever tempt him to forget. “The
                    nature of the subject,” he says, “could not induce me, in sketching my scenes,
                    to consider in advance their adaptability to any particular musical form, the
                    kind of musical treatment being, in every case, suggested by the scenes
                    themselves. I never contemplated on principle, and as a deliberate reformer, the
                    destruction of the aria, the duet, or any other operatic form; but the disuse of
                    these forms followed naturally from the character of my subjects.” Surely no
                    frame of mind could be more free from prejudice than this.</p>
                <p>While exercising this unrestrained freedom of thought and action, Wagner found
                    one particular form more useful to him than any other. Mozart in <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Giovanni,</hi> and Weber in <hi rend="italic">Der Freischütz,
                    Euryanthe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oberon,</hi> had availed themselves of
                    certain characteristic musical phrases as exponents of emotional or scenic
                    complications of peculiar interest, and had emphasized their meaning by
                    repeating them at every recurrence of the dramatic situation. In modern musical
                    terminology a musical phrase of this kind is now called a “leading theme”
                    (“Leitmotif”). Wagner has employed this expedient more freely than any other
                    composer, and in a way peculiarly his own. Not only has he introduced in his
                    later works a leading theme for every one of the <hi rend="italic">dramatis
                    personae,</hi> and for every prominent feature in the scenery or action of the
                    play, but in many cases he even indicates the changing moods and passions of his
                    principal characters by distinct phrases, which he combines together with a
                    power of part-writing truly marvellous, interweaving them—as in “Siegfried’s
                    Trauermarsch,” in the <hi rend="italic">Götterdammerung—</hi> in such sort as to
                    present the whole story of a life and mission in the music of a single scene.
                    Short-sighted critics have dwelt too much upon the technical ingenuity displayed
                    in scenes of this description, and too little upon the expression thrown into
                    them by the power of Wagner’s genius. A diligent student may acquire sufficient
                    mastery over the art of part-writing to enable him to interweave his themes with
                    any amount of mechanical perfection, yet without a trace of the beauty displayed
                    by Sebastian Bach in the involutions of his counter-subjects, or by Wagner in
                    labyrinthine combinations used, not for the sake of vaunting his scholarship,
                    but as his most potent engines of dramatic expression. The plaintive wail of the
                    “Trauermarsch” appeals to hearers who know nothing at all of its ingenious
                    construction, and tells its tale to them beyond all possibility of
                    misunderstanding. It is at this point that genius steps in; and the power of
                    Wagner’s genius is irresistible.</p>
                <p>It was during the period of his exile that Wagner matured his plans and brought
                    his style to its culminating point of perfection; but it was not until some
                    considerable time after his return that any of the works he then meditated were
                    placed upon the stage. In 1855 he accepted an invitation to London, where he
                    conducted the concerts of the Philharmonic Society with great success. In 1857
                    he completed the libretto of <hi rend="italic">Tristan und Isolde</hi> at
                    Venice, taking as the basis of his scheme the Celtic legend modified by
                    Gottfried of Strasburg’s mediaeval treatment of the subject (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gottfried</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Romance).</hi> But the
                    music was not completed till 1859. In that year Wagner visited Paris for the
                    third time; and after much negotiation, in which he was nobly supported by the
                    Prince and Princess Metternich, <hi rend="italic">Tannhäuser</hi> was accepted
                    at the Grand Opéra. Magnificent preparations were made for its production. It
                    was rehearsed 164 times, 14 times with the full orchestra; and the scenery,
                    dresses, and stage accessories generally were placed entirely under the
                    composer’s direction. More than £8000 was expended upon the venture; and the
                    work was performed for the first time in the French language on March 13, 1861.
                    But, for political reasons, a powerful clique determined to suppress both the
                    piece and its composer. . A scandalous riot was inaugurated by the members of
                    the Parisian Jockey Club, who interrupted the performance with howls and
                    dogwhistles; and so great was the disturbance that after the third
                    representation the opera was withdrawn to reappear no more. Wagner was
                    broken-hearted. But the Princess Metternich continued to befriend him, and in
                    1861 he received through her intercession a pardon for his political offences,
                    with permission to settle in any part of Germany except Saxony. Even this
                    restriction was removed in 1862.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0339-0316"/>
                <p>Wagner now settled for a time in Vienna, where <hi rend="italic">Tristan und
                    Isolde</hi> was accepted, but abandoned after 57 rehearsals, through the
                    incompetence of the tenor, Herr Ander. <hi rend="italic">Lohengrin</hi> was,
                    however, produced on May 15, 1861, when Wagner heard it for the first time. His
                    circumstances were now extremely straitened; but better times were at hand. In
                    1863 he published the libretto of <hi rend="italic">Der Ping des
                    Nibelungen.</hi> King Louis II. of Bavaria was much struck with it, and in 1864
                    sent a private secretary to Wagner, who was then at Stuttgart, with an
                    invitation to come to Munich and carry on his work there. The invitation was
                    accepted with joy by the then almost despairing composer. The king gave him an
                    annual grant of 1200 gulden (£120), considerably enlarging it before the end of
                    the year, and placing a comfortable house in the outskirts of the city at his
                    disposal. The master celebrated his good fortune by composing a
                    “Huldigungsmarsch.” In the autumn he was formally commissioned to proceed with
                    the tetralogy, and to furnish proposals for the building of a theatre and the
                    foundation of a Bavarian music school. All seemed to promise well, but no sooner
                    did his position seem assured than a miserable court intrigue was formed against
                    him. His political misdemeanours at Dresden were quoted to his discredit and
                    made the excuse for bitter persecutions, and, notwithstanding King Louis’s
                    undiminished favour, the opposition was too strong to be resisted, and Wagner
                    was obliged to retire to Triebschen, near Lucerne, where he spent the next six
                    years in uninterrupted study.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Der Fliegende Hollander</hi> was performed at Munich in 1864;
                    and on June 10, 1865, <hi rend="italic">Tristan und Isolde</hi> was produced for
                    the first time, with Herr and Frau Schnorr in the principal parts. <hi
                    rend="italic">Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg,</hi> first sketched in 1845, was
                    completed in 1867, and first performed at Munich under the direction of Herr von
                    Bülow, June 21, 1868. The story, though an original one, is founded on an
                    episode in the life of Hans Sachs, the poet-cordwainer of Nuremberg; and Wagner
                    has combined its incidents with infinite ingenuity and humour. The success of
                    the opera was very great; but the production of the tetralogy was still
                    impracticable. The scheme for the new theatre, which was to have been designed
                    by the architect Semper, having been abandoned, there was no opera-house in
                    Germany fit for the production of a work designed on so colossal a scale. A
                    project was therefore started for the erection of a suitable building at
                    Baireuth. Wagner laid the first stone of this in 1872, and the edifice was
                    completed, after almost insuperable difficulties, in 1876.</p>
                <p>After this Wagner resided permanently at Baireuth, in a house named Wahnfried, in
                    the garden of which he himself built the tomb in which his remains now rest. His
                    first wife, Wilhelmina <hi rend="italic">(née</hi> Planer), having died in 1866,
                    he was united in 1870 to Liszt’s daughter Cosima, who had previously been the
                    wife of Herr von Bülow. Meantime <hi rend="italic">Der Ping des Nibelungen</hi>
                    was rapidly approaching completion, and on August 13, 1876, the introductory
                    portion, <hi rend="italic">Das Rheingold,</hi> was performed at Baireuth for the
                    first time, followed on the 14th by <hi rend="italic">Die Walküre,</hi> on the
                    16th by <hi rend="italic">Siegfried,</hi> and on the 17th by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Götterdämmerung.</hi> The success of the work, the story of which is founded on
                    the famous <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied,</hi> was very great; and the
                    performance, directed by Herr Hans Richter, excited extraordinary attention, but
                    the expenses attendant upon its production were enormous, and burdened the
                    management with a debt of £7500. A portion of this was raised by performances at
                    the Albert Hall, in London, at which the composer himself was present, in 1877.
                    The remainder was met by the profits upon performances of the tetralogy —or, as
                    Wagner himself called it, the “Bühnenfestspiel”— at Munich.</p>
                <p>Wagner’s next, last, and perhaps greatest work was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parsifal,</hi> based upon the legend of the Holy Grail, as set forth, not in
                    the legend of the <hi rend="italic">Mort d'Arthur,</hi> which fixes the home of
                    the sacred vessel at Glastonbury, but in the poems of Chrestien de Troyes and
                    Wolfram von Eschenbach, written in the 12th and 13th centuries, and other
                    less-known works (see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Romance,</hi> in which
                    the subject is treated in its various aspects). The libretto was complete before
                    his visit to London in 1877. The music was begun in the following year, and
                    completed at Palermo, January 13, 1882. The first sixteen performances took
                    place at Baireuth, in July and August 1882, under Wagner’s own directing, and
                    fully realized the expectations that had been formed of them. There can indeed
                    be no doubt that this last work, called by Wagner a “Bühnenweihfestspiel,” in
                    allusion to its mystically religious character, forms a fitting crown to his
                    already brilliant reputation. Unhappily, the exertion of directing so many
                    consecutive performances seems to have been too much for the veteran master’s
                    already failing strength, for towards the close of 1882 his health began to
                    decline rapidly. He spent the autumn at Venice, in the Palazzo Vendramini, on
                    the Grand Canal, and was well enough on Christmas Eve to conduct his own first
                    symphony (composed in 1833), at a private performance given at the Liceo
                    Marcello. But late in the afternoon of February 13, 1883, he was seized with a
                    sudden attack of faintness, and on that evening he calmly breathed his last.</p>
                <p>Wagner was buried at Wahnfried, in the tomb he had himself prepared, on February
                    18, and a few days afterwards King Louis rode to Baireuth alone, and at dead of
                    night, to pay his last tribute of respect to the master he had so generously
                    befriended.</p>
                <p>In private life Wagner was beloved and respected by all who knew him, though in
                    his public character he made himself innumerable enemies, and provoked an
                    immense amount of hatred— it must be confessed, not wholly undeserved—by the
                    violent and intemperate character of his writings. Though Meyerbeer had been
                    extremely kind to him in Paris, he spoke of him in <hi rend="italic">Oper und
                    Drama</hi> with the grossest disrespect. His utterly groundless prejudice
                    against Liszt was ultimately conquered by that great master’s beautiful
                    forbearance alone. But these things will be forgotten, while the brightness of
                    his genius will remain the lasting heritage of art. In person he was rather
                    below the middle height, erect in carriage, with commanding aspect and
                    remarkable quickness of speech and gesture. That his manners were to some extent
                    unconventional there can be no doubt, but those who knew him best deny that
                    there was even the semblance of truth in the absurd stories that were circulated
                    with regard to his extraordinary eccentricities.</p>
                <p>Besides the great dramatic works we have mentioned, Wagner composed the choral
                    music for Weber’s funeral (Dresden, 1844), <hi rend="italic">Das Liebesmahl der
                    Apostel</hi> (Dresden, 1847), <hi rend="italic">Eine Faustoνertüre</hi> (Paris,
                    1839), <hi rend="italic">Kaisermarsch</hi> (1871), <hi rend="italic">Siegfried
                    Idyl</hi> (1871), and a not very numerous collection of smaller pieces. His
                    literary works, published at Leipsic in 1871, fill nine thick volumes. (W. S.
