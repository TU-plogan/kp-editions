                    is a generic term which includes a great variety of different substances. But
                    when we compare any two species we always find more of agreement than of
                    difference in properties which suggest that all waters consist essentially of
                    the same thing, which is only modified differently in the several varieties by
                    the nature or proportion of impurities. This surmise is confirmed by the results
                    of scientific inquiry. In all ordinary waters, such as are used for primary
                    purposes, the impurities amount to very little by weight— as a rule to less than
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th of 1 per
                    cent.</p>
                <p>Of all natural stores of water the <hi rend="italic">ocean</hi> is by far the
                    most abundant, and from it all other water may be said to be derived. From the
                    surface of the ocean a continuous stream of vapour is rising up into the
                    atmosphere to be recondensed in colder regions and precipitated as rain, snow,
                    or sleet, &amp;c. Some <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    11</hi> ths of these precipitates of course return directly to the ocean; the
                    rest, falling on land, collects into pools, lakes, rivers, &amp;c., or else
                    penetrates into the earth, perhaps to come to light again, or to be brought to
                    light, as springs or wells.</p>
                <p>As all the saline components of the ocean are nonvolatile, rain-water, in its
                    natural state, can be contaminated only with atmospheric gases—oxygen, nitrogen,
                    and carbonic acid. So we should presume, and so it is, except that these gases,
                    having different rates of solubility, are not associated in rain-water (or
                    natural water generally) in the proportions characteristic of their source.
                    Thus, for instance, while atmospheric air contains 21 per cent. by volume of
                    oxygen, a solution of air in water contains about 34⋅0 per cent. of that gas.
                    Besides, rain-water, for the reason stated, contains perceptible traces of
                    ammonia, combined as a rule, at least partly, with nitric acid, which latter is
                    being produced wherever an electric discharge pervades the atmosphere. This
                    electrically-produced nitrate of ammonia forms no doubt the primary source of
                    all organic nitrogen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lake</hi> waters, as a class, are relatively pure, especially
                    so if the mountain slopes over which the rain collects into a lake are
                    relatively free of soluble components. As an example we may refer to the water
                    of Loch Katrine (Scotland), which is almost chemically pure, apart from small,
                    but perceptible, traces of richly carboniferous matter taken up from the peat of
                    the surrounding hills, which impart to it a faint brownish hue, while really
                    pure water is blue.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">River</hi> water varies very much in composition even in the
                    same bed, as a river in the course of its journey towards the ocean passes from
                    one kind of earth to others; while, compared with spring-waters, relatively poor
                    in dissolved salts, rivers are liable to be contaminated with more or less of
                    suspended matter.</p>

                    class, clear of suspended, but rich in dissolved, mineral matter. Of ordinarily
                    occurring minerals only a few are perceptibly soluble in water, and of these
                    carbonate of lime, sulphate of lime, and common salt are most widely diffused.
                    Common salt, however, in its natural occurrence, is very much localized; and so
                    it comes that spring and well waters are contaminated <hi rend="italic"
                    >chiefly</hi> with carbonate and sulphate of lime. Of these two salts, however,
                    the former is held in solution only by the carbonic acid of the water, as
                    bicarbonate of lime. But a carbonate-of-lime water, if exposed to the
                    atmosphere, even at ordinary temperatures, loses its carbonic acid, and the
                    carbonate of lime crystallizes out. The fantastically shaped “stalactites” which
                    adorn the roofs and sides of certain caverns are produced in this manner.</p>
                <p>In the relatively rare cases where a spring water in the course of its migrations
                    meets with a deposit of common salt or other soluble salts, it dissolves more or
                    less of these and becomes a salt-water. Most salt-waters are substantially
                    solutions of common salt (chloride of sodium), associated with only little of
                    salts of potash and magnesia. But there are exceptions; in the so-called “bitter
                    waters” the dissolved matter consists chiefly of sulphate of magnesia and other
                    magnesia salts.</p>
                <p>Immense quantities of carbonic acid gas are being constantly produced in the
                    interior of the earth, probably by the action, at high temperatures, of steam on
                    the carbonates of lime and magnesia. Some of it collects and is stored up
                    temporarily in cavities, but the bulk streams out into the atmosphere, invisibly
                    as a rule, through what one might call the capillaries of the earth’s body; but
                    here and there it unites into veins and arteries and comes forth, it may be, as
                    a mighty carbonic acid spring. Carbonic acid being one and a half times as heavy
                    as atmospheric air, it may collect into pools or even lakes; the “Dog’s Grotto,”
                    near Naples, and the “Valley of Death,” in Asia Minor, are illustrative
                    examples; but, carbonic acid being a gas, and consequently diffusible, such
                    lakes can maintain their level only if there is a constant and abundant supply
                    of the gas from below.</p>
                <p>A far more frequent occurrence is that a mass of water and a mass of carbonic
                    acid meet within the earth. As a rule, the pressure on the gas is more than one
                    atmosphere, and the supply of the gas is abundant. The water then takes up
                    considerably more carbonic acid than it would under ordinary atmospheric
                    pressure, and if an outlet be provided, perhaps artificially by a boring, a
                    frothy mass of carbonic-acid water comes forth as a fountain, sometimes of great
                    volume. Such carbonic-acid waters are met with in many parts of the
                    world,—chiefly, however, in Germany. The well-known Apollinaris water is an
                    example. In this connexion we may refer also to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >soffioni</hi> of Tuscany— jets of steam charged with ammonia or vapour of boric
                    acid, which condense in the air and collect into “lagoons” of (substantially) a
                    very dilute solution of boric acid. Boric acid waters, however, appear to be
                    entirely confined to a limited district in Tuscany to the south of Volterra.</p>
                <p>In addition to its natural components, water is liable to be contaminated through
                    accidental influxes of foreign matter. Thus, for instance, all the Scottish
                    Highland lochs are brown through the presence in them of dissolved peaty matter.
                    Rivers flowing through, or wells sunk in, populous districts may be contaminated
                    with excrementitious matter, discharges from industrial establishments, &amp;c.
                    Our instinct rebels against the drinking of a contaminated water, and it guides
                    us correctly. Not that those organic compounds are in themselves hurtful. An
                    otherwise pure water, contaminated with, say, one ten thousandth of its volume
                    of urine, might be drunk with perfect confidence. Yet the presence of especially
                    nitrogenous organic matter is a serious source of danger, inasmuch as such
                    matter forms the natural food or soil for the development of micro-organisms,
                    including those kinds of bacteria which are now supposed to propagate infectious
                    diseases. Happily nature has provided a remedy. The nitrogenous organic matter
                    dissolved in (say) a river speedily suffers disintegration by the action of
                    certain kinds of bacteria, with formation of ammonia and other (harmless)
                    products of simple constitution; and the ammonia, again, is no sooner formed
                    than, by the conjoint action of other bacteria and atmospheric oxygen, it passes
                    first into (salts of) nitrous and then nitric acid. A water which contains
                    combined nitrogen in the form of nitrates only is, as a rule, safe organically;
                    if nitrites are present it becomes liable to suspicion; the presence of ammonia
                    is a worse symptom; and if actual nitrogenous organic matter is found in more
                    than microscopic traces the water is possibly (not necessarily) a dangerous
                    water to drink.</p>
                <p>Wanklyn’s method of water analysis is based upon these ideas. Starting with half
                    a litre of the water, he distils it with a small quantity of carbonate of soda,
                    and in the distillate determines the ammonia colorimetrically with Nessler’s
                    reagent (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mercury,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 34). When all the
                    saline ammonia (the <hi rend="italic">free</hi> ammonia) is thus eliminated,
                    alkaline permanganate of potash is added to the residue and the distillation
                    resumed. Part of the nitrogen of the organic matter is eliminated as ammonia; it
                    is determined in the distillate, by Nessler’s reagent, and reported as <hi
                    rend="italic">albumenoid</hi> ammonia. The results are customarily referred to
                    one million parts of water analysed. To give an idea of the order of quantities
                    here dealt with, let us say that a water yielding 0⋅1 part of free and 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 1 part of albumenoid ammonia would be condemned by
                    any chemist, as possibly dangerous. The peaty waters of the Scottish Highlands,
                    however, contain much of both ammonias, and yet are drunk by the natives with
                    perfect impunity.</p>
                <p>All waters, unless very impure, become safe by boiling, which process kills any
                    bacteria or germs that may be present.</p>
                <p>Of the ordinary saline components of waters, soluble magnesia and lime salts are
                    the only ones which are objectionable sanitarily if present in relatively large
                    proportion. Carbonate of lime is harmless; but, on the other hand, the widely
                    diffused notion that the presence of this component adds to the value of a water
                    as a drinking water is a mistake. The farinaceous part of food alone is
                    sufficient to supply all the lime the body needs; besides, it is questionable
                    whether lime introduced in any other form than that of phosphate is available
                    for the formation of, for instance, bone tissue.</p>
                <p>The fitness of a water for washing is determined by its degree of softness. A
                    water which contains lime or magnesia salts decomposes soap with formation of
                    insoluble lime or magnesia salts of the fatty acids of the soap used. So much of
                    the soap is simply wasted; only the surplus can effect any cleansing action. An
                    excellent and easy method for the determination of the hardness of a water has
                    been devised by Clark. A measured volume of the water is placed in a stoppered
                    bottle, and a standard solution of soap is then dropped in from a graduated
                    vessel, until the mixture, by addition of the last drop of soap, has acquired
                    the property of throwing up a peculiar kind of creamy froth when violently
                    shaken, which shows that all the soap-destroying components have been
                    precipitated. The volume of soap required measures the hardness of the water.
                    The soap-solution is referred to a standard by means of a water of a known
                    degree of hardness prepared from a known weight of carbonate of lime by
                    converting it into neutral chloride of calcium, dissolving this in water and
                    diluting to a certain volume. A water is said to have “1, 2, 3, . . . <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> degrees of hardness,” if it is equivalent in
                    soap-destroying power to a solution of carbonate of lime containing 1, 2, 3, . .
                    . <hi rend="italic">n</hi> grains of this salt per imperial gallon.</p>
                <p>That part of the hardness of a water which is actually owing to carbonate of lime
                    (or magnesia) can easily be removed in two ways. (1) By boiling, the free
                    carbonic acid goes off with the steam, and the carbonate of lime, being bereft
                    of its solvent, comes down as a precipitate which can be removed by filtration,
                    or by allowing it to settle, and decanting off the clear supernatant liquor. (2)
                    A method of Clark’s is to mix the water with just enough of milk of lime to
                    convert the free carbonic acid into carbonate. Both this and the original
                    carbonate of lime are precipitated, and can be removed as in the first case. See
                    p. 409 <hi rend="italic">infra.</hi></p>
                <p>From any uncontaminated natural water pure water is easily prepared. The
                    dissolved salts are removed by distillation; if care be taken that the steam
                    to-be condensed is dry, and if its condensation be effected within a tube made
                    of a suitable metal (platinum or silver are best, but copper or block tin work
                    well enough for ordinary purposes), the distillate can contain no impurities
                    except atmospheric gases, which latter, if necessary, must be removed by boiling
                    the distilled water in a narrow-necked flask until it begins to “bump,” and then
                    allowing it to cool in the absence of air. This latter operation ought, strictly
                    speaking, to be performed in a silver or platinum flask, as glass is appreciably
                    attacked by hot water. For most purposes distilled water, taken as it comes from
                    the condenser, is sufficiently pure.</p>
                <p>Pure water, being so easily procured in any quantity, is used largely as a
                    standard of reference in metrology and in the quantitative definition of
                    physical properties. Thus a “gallon” is defined as the volume at 62° F. of a
                    quantity of water whose uncorrected <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n425/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0425-0400"/> mass, as determined by weighing in air of 30-inch
                    pressure and 62° F. of temperature, is equal to 10 lb avoirdupois. The
                    kilogramme in like manner is the mass of 1 cubic decimetre of water, measured at
                    the temperature corresponding to its maximum density (4° C. ). The two fixed
                    points of the thermometer correspond—the lower (0° C., or 32° F.) to the
                    temperature at which ice melts, the upper (100° C. or 212° F. ) to that at which
                    the maximum tension of steam, as it rises from boiling water, is equal to 760
                    mm. or 30- inch mercury pressure. 30 inches being a little more than 760 mm.,
                    212° F. is, strictly speaking, a higher temperature than 100° C., but the
                    difference is very trifling. Specific heats are customarily measured by that of
                    water, which is taken as = 1. All other specific heats of liquids or solids
                    (with one solitary exception, formed by a certain strength of aqueous methyl
                    alcohol) are less than 1. The temperate character of insular climates is greatly
                    owing to this property of water. Another physiographically important peculiarity
                    of water is that it expands on freezing (into ice), while most other liquids do
                    the reverse. 11 volumes of ice fuse into only 10 volumes of water at 0° C.; and
                    the ice-water produced, when brought up gradually to higher and higher
                    temperatures, again exhibits the very exceptional property that it contracts
                    between 0° and 4° C. (by about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10000</hi> of its volume) and then expands again by more and
                    more per degree of increase of temperature, so that the volume at 100° C. is
                    1⋅043 times that at 4° C. Imagine two lakes, one containing ordinary water and
                    another containing a liquid which differs from water only in this that it has no
                    maximum density. Imagine both to be, say, at 5° C., and cold winter weather to
                    set in. Both lakes become colder, being cooled down by convection until they are
                    at 4° C. The imaginary lake then continues losing heat in the same way; in the
                    real lake the colder water floats on the surface and the underlying mass of
                    water can lose heat only by the slow process of conduction. The real lake
                    retains its heat more tenaciously, but for the reason stated will draw a sheet
                    of ice, while the imaginary lake is still on its way to 0° C. The latter,
                    indeed, if the winter is short, may fail to freeze altogether, while the former
                    does freeze superficially. In either the freezing is a slow process, because for
                    every pound of ice produced 80 pound-centigrade units of heat are set free. Let
                    us now assume that, after even the imaginary lake had drawn a sheet of ice, warm
                    weather sets in. In either case a layer of liquid water of 0° C. is formed on
                    the ice, and through it the heat from the air travels, in the imaginary case by
                    slow conduction, in the real case by quick convection. The real ice is the first
                    to disappear, and the upper strata of relatively cold water will soon come up to
                    4° C. by the prompt effect of convection, while in the case of the imaginary
                    lake it takes a far longer time before all the mass has come up to 4° C. by
                    conduction. From 4° C. upwards, heat is taken in at the same rate on both

                <p>In former times water was viewed as an “element,” and the notion remained in
                    force after this term (about the time of Boyle) had assumed its present meaning,
                    although cases of decomposition of water were familiar to chemists. In Boyle’s
                    time it was already well known that iron, tin, and zinc dissolve in aqueous
                    muriatic acid or vitriol with evolution of a stinking inflammable gas. Even
                    Boyle, however, took this gas to be ordinary air contaminated with inflammable
                    stinking oils. This view was held by all chemists until Cavendish, before 1784,
                    showed that the gas referred to, properly purified, is free of smell and
                    constant in its properties, which are widely different from those of air,—the
                    most important point of difference being that the gas when kindled in air burns
                    with evolution of much heat and formation of water. Cavendish, however, did not
                    satisfy himself with merely proving this fact qualitatively; he determined the
                    quantitative relations, and found that it takes very nearly 1000 volumes of air
                    to burn 423 volumes of “hydrogen” gas; but 1000 volumes of air, again, according
                    to Cavendish, contain 210 volumes of oxygen; hence, very nearly, 2 volumes of
                    hydrogen take up 1 volume of oxygen to become water. This important discovery
                    was only confirmed by the subsequent experiments of Humboldt and Gay-Lussac,
                    which were no more competent than Cavendish’s to prove that the surplus of 3
                    units (423 volumes instead of 420) of hydrogen was an observational error. (W.
