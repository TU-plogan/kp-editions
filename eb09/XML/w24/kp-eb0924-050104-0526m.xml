                    (1740-1793), German metallurgist, was born at Dresden in 1740. His father was a
                    bookbinder, and Wenzel began to learn the same trade; but finding it monotonous
                    he quietly left home and went to Holland at the age of fifteen. In Amsterdam he
                    took lessons in surgery and chemistry, and then entered the Dutch navy as a
                    surgeon. After some years a sea life lost its charm for him, and he resigned,
                    returning to his native land in 1766 to complete his chemical studies at
                    Leipsic. Wenzel now devoted his attention to metallurgy and assaying, working
                    for a time with great success in the town of his birth. He received a prize for
                    the best solution of a problem in workingmetals from the Copenhagen Society of
                    Sciences. He also made some very careful chemical experiments, particularly on
                    the mixture of solutions of various salts, and wrote several books on chemical
                    subjects; his claim for remembrance rests on one of these, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vorlesungen über die chemische Verwandtschaft der Körper.</hi> It was published
                    in 1777; a second edition appeared in 1782, and a third with additions in 1800.
                    In 1780 Wenzel received the appointment of director of mines at Freiberg from
                    the elector of Saxony, and in 1786 that of chemist in the porcelain works at
                    Meissen. He died at Freiberg on February 26, 1793.</p>
                <p>The discovery of the law of reciprocal proportions in chemistry (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Chemistry,</hi> vol. v. p. 463) has been claimed for Wenzel as
                    the result of his researches on the affinities of bodies; and, on the ground of
                    his work being prior to that of Richter, and much more accurate than the earlier
                    experiments of Bergmann on the same subject, he has been regarded as Dalton’s
                    precursor in laying the foundation of the atomic theory. It was pointed out by
                    Hess in 1840 that this was a mistake, since Wenzel’s researches led him to no
                    definite conclusions as to invariable and reciprocal proportions in the
                    combination of acids and bases, but rather pointed in the opposite direction.
                    Kopp overlooked this criticism in writing his great <hi rend="italic">Geschichte
                    der Chemie</hi> (1844-1847), which has deservedly taken the highest place as an
                    authority on chemical history; and, although in the supplementary work published
                    in 1873 he acknowledges his mistake as to Wenzel and confirms Hess’s statement,
                    the writers of text-books continue in many cases to give currency to the
                    erroneous view.</p>
