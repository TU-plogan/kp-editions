                    (1775-1853), to whose patience and ingenuity the decipherment of the cuneiform
                    inscriptions was originally due, was born at Münden in Hanover, June 9, 1775. He
                    was educated partly in his native town, partly at Ilfeld, where he remained till
                    1795, when he entered the university of Göttingen, and there became the friend
                    of Heyne, Tychsen, and Heeren. Heyne’s recommendation procured for him an
                    assistant mastership in the Göttingen gymnasium in 1797. While there he
                    published his work <hi rend="italic">De Pasigraphia sive Scriptlira</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Universali</hi> (1799), which first brought him into notice, and
                    led to his appointment in 1803 as prorector of the gymnasium of
                    Frankfort-on-the-Main, and shortly afterwards as conrector. Grotefend was best
                    known during his lifetime as a Latin and Italian philologist, though the
                    attention he paid to hi3 own language is shown by hi3 <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anfangsgründe der deutschen Poesie,</hi> published in 1815, and his foundation
                    of a society for investigating the German tongue in 1817. In 1821 he became
                    director of the gymnasium at Hanover, a post which he retained till his
                    retirement in 1849, four years before his death. In 1823-4 appeared his revised
                    edition of Wenck’s Latin grammar, in two volumes, followed by a smaller grammar
                    for the use of schools in 1826; in 1835-8 a systematic attempt to explain the
                    fragmentary remains of the Umbrian dialect, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rudimenta</hi><hi rend="italic">Linguoe Umbricoe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ex</hi><hi rend="italic">Inscriptionibus antiquis enodata(va</hi> eight parts);
                    and in 1839 a work of similar character upon Oscan <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Rudimenta</hi><hi rend="italic">Linguoe Oscoe).</hi> In the same year he
                    published an important memoir on the coins of Bactria, under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Münzen der griechischen,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ρarthischen,</hi><hi rend="italic">und indoskythischen Könige von
                    Bactrien und den Ländern am Indus.</hi> He soon, however,returned to his
                    favourite subject, and brought out a work in five parts, <hi rend="italic">Zur
                    Geographie und Geschichte von Altitalien</hi> (1840-2). Previously, in 1830, he
                    had written a preface to Wagenfeld’s translation of the spurious <hi
                    rend="italic">Sanchoniathon</hi> of Philo Byblius, which professed to have been
                    discovered in the preceding year in the Portuguese convent of Santa Maria de
                    Merinhao. But it was in the East rather than in the West that Grotefend did the
                    work which has given him a lasting name. The mysterious cuneiform inscriptions
                    of Persia had for some time been attracting attention in Europe; exact copies of
                    them had been published by the elder Niebuhr, who lost his eyesight over the
                    work; and Grotefend’s friend, Tych3en of Rostock, believed that he had
                    ascertained the characters in the column now known to be Persian to be
                    alphabetic. At this point Grotefend took the matter up. His first discovery was
                    communicated to the Royal Society of Göttingen in 1800, and reviewed by Tychsen
                    two years afterwards. In 1815 he gave an account of it in Heeren’s great work on
                    ancient history, and in 1837 published his <hi rend="italic">Neue Beiträge zur
                    Erläuterung der persepolitanischen Keilschrift.</hi> Three years later appeared
                    his <hi rend="italic">Neue Beitrage zur Erläuterung der babylonischen
                    Keilschrift.</hi> His discovery may be summed up as follows :—(1) that the
                    Persian inscriptions contain three different forms of cuneiform writing, so that
                    the decipherment of the one would give the key to the decipherment of the
                    others; (2) that the characters of the Persian column are alphabetic and not
                    syllabic; (3) that they must be read from left to right; (4) that the alphabet
                    consists of forty letters, including signs for long and short vowels; and (5)
                    that the Perse-politan inscriptions are written in Zend (which, however, is not
                    the case), and must be ascribed to the age of the Achaemenian princes. The
                    process whereby Grotefend arrived at these conclusions is a prominent
                    illustration of persevering genius. History made it clear that the monuments to
                    which the inscriptions were attached belonged to Cyrus and his successors, whose
                    names ought accordingly to be found in them. By a comparison of texts Grotefend
                    determined the groups of characters by which these names were expressed, and by
                    further observing what characters were common to the several groups, and of how
                    many characters each group consisted, he was able to assign the conjectural
                    values of <hi rend="smallcaps">d-a-r-h-e-u-sch</hi> or Darius to the letters of
                    a frequently recurring one. The native pronunciation of Darius was furnished by
                    Strabo and the Old Testament. The names of Xerxes and Artaxerxes were next
                    deciphered, and the phonetic powers of a good many characters were thus
                    ascertained. The correctness of the decipherment was verified, not only by the
                    fact that the right letters were always found in the right places in each name,
                    but also by the discovery that the word which invariably followed each name, and
                    therefore presumably meant “king,” when read by the new alphabet, presented the
                    same form as the Zend term for “monarch.” It w as clear that a solid basis had
                    been laid for the interpretation of the Persian inscriptions, and all that
                    remained was to work out the results of Grotefend’s brilliant discovery, a task
                    ably performed by Burnouf, Lassen, and Rawlinson. Grotefend died the 15th of
                    December 1853.</p>
