                    in November chaplain to Edward VI., and in July 1552 prebendary of Westminster.
                    On the accession of Mary in 1553 he took refuge on the Continent, staying
                    chiefly at Strasburg, where he acquired a competent knowledge of German, and
                    occupied himself also in collecting the “writings and stories of the learned and
                    pious sufferers in England,”—the result of his inquiries being afterwards
                    communicated to John Foxe, and incorporated by him in his <hi rend="italic">Book
                    of Martyrs.</hi> Returning to England under the new regime in 1558, he assisted
                    in the preparation of the new liturgy, and was also one of the eight Protestant
                    divines chosen to hold public disputes with the popish prelates. In 1559 he was
                    appointed to the mastership of Pembroke Hall, and in the same year he succeeded
                    Bonner as bishop of London, in which capacity he, along with Archbishop Parker,
                    shared in 1565 in the responsibility of suspending those of the London clergy
                    who refused to submit to the Act of Uniformity, on which account an indignant
                    mob of clergymen’s wives appeared before his house at St Paul’s, and were with
                    difficulty persuaded by one of the suspended clergymen to go away quietly. In
                    1570 Grindal was appointed to the see of York, from which he was translated to
                    Canterbury in February 1576. Having in the same year incurred the royal
                    displeasure by refusing to suppress the meetings held among the clergy for “the
                    exercise of prophesying,” he was ultimately, in June 1577, by order of the Star
                    Chamber confined to his house and sequestered for six months. As in November he
                    refused to make a formal submission to the queen, his suspension was continued
                    for several years; but though a petition for his restoration, which was drawn up
                    by convocation in 1580, was not immediately granted, it would appear that in
                    1582 he had resumed, at least partially, the exercise of his ecclesiastical
                    functions. About the end of this year the queen, on account of his blindness,
                    requested him to retire on a pension, but the negotiations connected with his
                    resignation were not completed till April 1583, and it was only after his death
                    at Croydon, July 6th of the same year, that Whitgift, who had been nominated his
                    successor, entered upon the see. Though <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0214-0203"/> Grindal yielded to the peremptory orders of
                    Elizabeth in regard to the clergy who refused to sign the Act of Uniformity, he
                    seems on all other occasions, while conducting himself with great moderation and
                    manifesting unvarying courtesy and an earnest desire to avoid every cause of
                    offence, to have strenuously upheld the spiritual independence of his office.
                    His aims were on the whole noble and unselfish, and he was zealous in his
                    endeavours to reform the abuses of his predecessor, to improve the moral and
                    intellectual status of the clergy, and as far as possible to conciliate and
                    reclaim the Puritans. He was sincerely attached to Protestantism, and laid much
                    stress on the function of preaching, a “gift” in which he himself is said to
                    have excelled. Grindal is alluded to (as Algrind) in the seventh “aeglogue” of
                    Spenser’s <hi rend="italic">Shepheards Calender.</hi></p>
