                    25th October 1759. He was educated at Eton and Oxford, and for some time studied
                    at the Inns of Court, but never practised at the bar. In February 1782 he was
                    elected a member of parliament for the county of Buckingham, and in the
                    September following he became secretary to his brother the marquis of
                    Buckingham, who had been named lord-lieutenant of Ireland. On the overthrow of
                    the cabinet of Lord Shelburne in the following year he returned to England, and
                    in December he was appointed by his cousin Pitt paymaster-general of the forces.
                    In 1789 he was chosen speaker of the House of Commons, but he vacated the chair
                    in the same year, and was transferred to the Upper House with the title of Lord
                    Grenville, on being appointed secretary of state. He exchanged this office in
                    1791 for that of secretary of foreign affairs, being regarded by Pitt as the
                    person best fitted to carry out his policy in reference to France. Along with
                    Pitt he resigned office in 1801, on account of the king declining to grant any
                    concessions to the Catholics; and when Pitt, on accepting office in 1804, did
                    not stipulate for Catholic emancipation he declined to join his ministry, and
                    entered into a close alliance with Fox. On the death of Pitt in 1806 he became
                    the nominal head of the Government of “All the Talents,” whose military projects
                    resulted very unsuccessfully, but which deserves to be remembered with honour on
                    account of the Act for the abolition of the slave trade. Its influence was,
                    however, considerably weakened by the death of Fox; and as the king in March
                    1807 demanded from Grenville an assurance that he would initiate no measures for
                    the relief of the Catholics he and his colleagues found it necessary to resign.
                    His colleagues were not unanimous in approving of his conscientiousness, and
                    Sheridan expressed the opinion of more than himself when he remarked: “I have
                    known many men knock their heads against a wal <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>,
                    but I never before heard of a man collecting bricks and building a wall for the
                    express purpose of knocking out his own brains against it.” Lord Grenville never
                    again held office. He continued to be one of the principal supporters of
                    Catholic emancipation, and during the remainder of his political career
                    generally voted with the Whigs, although in 1815 he separated himself from Lord
                    Grey and supported the warlike policy of Lord Liverpool. In 1819, when the
                    marquis of Lansdowne brought forward his motion for an inquiry into the cause of
                    the distress and discontent in the manufacturing districts, Grenville delivered
                    an alarmist speech in which he advocated the adoption of severely repressive
                    measures. He died at his residence, Dropmore, Buckinghamshire, 12th January
                    1834.</p>
                <p>Though the talents of Lord Grenville were not of a high order, his
                    straightforwardness, great industry, political knowledge, firmness of mind, and
                    moderate opinions secured him considerable political influence. He can also lay
                    claim to be enrolled among those English statesmen who have distinguished
                    themselves in literature. Besides editing the letters of the earl of Chatham to
                    his nephew Thomas Pitt, afterwards Lord Camelford, he printed for private
                    circulation an edition of Homer with annotations, and also a small volume
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Nugoe</hi><hi rend="italic">Metrical</hi> consisting
                    of translations into Latin from Greek, English, and Italian. In 1809 he was
                    chosen chancellor of the university of Oxford. He married in 1792 Anne Pitt,
                    daughter of Lord Camelford, but had no issue, and the title became extinct.</p>
