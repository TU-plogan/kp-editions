                    >Ceylon,</hi> in which he says: “The filaments at the bottom of the stem [coir

                    as the Jew’s mallow, from the fact that the leaves have long been used in
                    Palestine, Egypt, and Arabia as a potherb.</p>
                <p>The seeds of the jute plant are sown in April or May and the plant is cut down
                    close to the roots just before flowering. The tops are then clipped off and the
                    stems made into bundles, which are placed in tanks or ditches and covered with
                    turf or other heavy substance^ to keep the bundles under water. Here they are
                    watched anxiously day by day till the fibre separates easily from the central
                    woody portion. The period of retching or soaking takes from eight to ten days;
                    if allowed to remain too long, the fibre rapidly decays. In drying also the
                    fibre generally becomes of a deeper colour. When the fibre is ready for
                    manipulation, the operator descends into the tank or ditch, and taking 10 to 15
                    bundles, strips off the barky fibre and washes thoroughly, and by a dexterous
                    movement of the wrist spreads and separates the fibres over the surface of the
                    water. The fibre soon becomes clean, and is hung over bamboo framework to dry.
                    The fibre thus obtained is fine, long, and silky, but the short staple and the
                    portion near the root held in the hand of the operator during washing, which
                    frequently has bark attached, are the portions generally selected to make gunny
                    bags or cloth of.</p>
                <p>The kind of cloth known as gunny, tat, choti, &amp;c., is woven in various
                    lengths and widths for use as bedding, bags, &lt;fec., and formerly, more than
                    at present, every man, woman, and child, boatmen, husbandmen, and others, in
                    their spare moments, distaff in hand, wove gunny cloth. Even the Hindu widow,
                    saved from death and despised by all, made her life less miserable by making
                    gunny cloth, and thus rendering herself to an extent independent of her family.
                    On the eastern frontier women are clothed in it, and the poor cover themselves
                    with it at night. In the Malayan Archipelago it is no unusual sight to see a
                    poor Chinese coolie with a dress made of gunny cloth. The great and most
                    important use, however, to which gunny cloth is applied is in making bags
                    wherein to pack rice, linseed, sugar, cotton, and other products for
                    shipment.</p>
                <p>As soon as this cheap, strong, and serviceable material became known, the
                    manufacture speedily assumed enormous proportions, and vast quantities of jute
                    were imported into Dundee for the manufacture of gunny <hi rend="superscript">
                    z</hi> bags and cloth alone. The Dundee mills, in the early period of this
                    trade, had only Indian hand-woven gunnies to compete with. The introduction of
                    the latest machinery of the most approved patterns into Bengal, the chief seat
                    of this industry in India, has, however, had the effect of giving India the
                    opportunity of competing with the Dundee mills on advantageous<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0335-0316"/> terms, and now India supplies vast quantities of
                    gunnies to Europe, Egypt, Ceylon, the Malayan Archipelago, China, and the United
                    States. In America alone it is computed that the annual average outturn of
                    cotton is 3,500,000 bales, each bale requiring 6 yards of wrapping material, and
                    of this one-third at least is supplied in gunny cloth. In 1872-73 6,105,275
                    gunnies and 64,347 pieces were exported from India, whilst in 1876-77, during a
                    period of eleven months, 30,110,616 gunny bags and 5,262,835 yards of gunny
                    cloth were exported to foreign countries. These figures do not include what is
                    sent coastwise or what is used for packing exported Indian produce.</p>
                <p>Bombay too has machinery for weaving jute, but has not as yet done much to
                    compete with Bengal, and indeed there appears little hope for Bombay unless
                    large quantities of jute can be made to grow on the spot, since, apart from the
                    cost of carriage, the juices in the jute plant, as in many other plants, become
                    resinified by drying, and therefore require operating upon whilst perfectly
                    fresh, being attended after treatment with more difficulty in manipulation and a
                    less outturn of fibre.</p>
                <p>The excellent gunny bags sent to England are often used for repacking for
                    exportation, and large quantities find their way to paper mills.</p>
