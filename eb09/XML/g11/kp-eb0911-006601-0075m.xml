                    general view.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1 represents a section of the earth by a plane which is drawn through its
                    centre 0. Then, the earth being sufficiently near a sphere for our purpose, we
                    may regard the section PQRS as a circle, where the points P, Q, R, S are the
                    intersections of the lines 0A, OB, 0C, OD with the surface of the earth. If a
                    stone be dropped from a point A above the surface of the earth, it will fall to
                    the ground at P. The spectator would also notice that, if a stone were dropped
                    from B or C or D, it would fall upon the ground at the points Q, R, S
                    respectively. From A the stone would appear to fall downwards, from C it appears
                    to move upwards, from B the spectator would see the stone moving to the left,
                    while from D it appears to move to the right. One feature of these motions could
                    not fail to be noticed: they all tend to the centre of the earth. The spectator
                    might therefore sum up his experience in the following statement :—</p>
                <p>J <hi rend="italic">body dropped from a point above the surface of the earth
                    always falls in a straight line which is directed towards the centre of the
                    earth.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 1. <hi rend="italic">Attraction.—</hi> The familiar instance of the action of a
                    magnet upon a piece of iron will suffice to illustrate what is meant by the word
                    <hi rend="italic">attraction.</hi> In virtue of certain properties possessed by
                    the iron and the magnet, they are drawn together. The magnet draws the iron, and
                    the iron draws the maguet This particular kind of attraction is of a very
                    special character. Thus, for example, the magnet appears to have no appreciable
                    influence on a piece of wood or a sheet of paper, and has indeed no considerable
                    influence on any known substance except iron.</p>
                <p>By the attraction of gravitation, every body attracts every other body, <hi
                    rend="italic">whatever be the materials of which each is composed.</hi> In this
                    we see a wide difference between the attractions of gravitation and that form of
                    attraction which is known as magnetic attraction. Nor is the contrast between
                    the <hi rend="italic">intensities</hi> of these two different attractions less
                    striking. The keeper of a magnet is drawn to the magnet by two different forces
                    of attraction. The first of these is the gravitative attraction, which, so far
                    as we know at present, would be equally exerted, whether the magnetism were
                    present or not The second is the magnetic attraction. The latter is enormously
                    greater than the former; in fact, under ordinary circumstances as to
                    intensityand dimensions, the intensity of the attraction of gravitation will not
                    be nearly so much as a millionth part of the magnetic attraction.</p>
                <p>The intensity of the attraction of gravitation is indeed so small that, with one
                    conspicuous exception, we can only become aware of its existence by refined and
                    elaborate inquiries. That any two objects—for example, two books lying on the
                    table—do actually attract each other, there can be no doubt whatever; but the
                    intensity of this is so small that the attractive force cannot overcome the
                    friction of the table, and consequently we do not find that the books are drawn
                    together. It has, however, been found that the intensity of the attraction of
                    gravitation between two masses is directly proportional to the product of those
                    masses. Hence though the force is so small as to be almost inappreciable between
                    two bodies of moderate dimensions, yet when the masses of the two bodies, or of
                    even one of them, are enormously great, the intensity of the force will be
                    sufficiently large to be readily discernible. In this way it is that the
                    existence of the attraction of gravitation has been made known to us, and is, in
                    fact, identified with our daily experience,—indeed, with our actual existence.
                    The mass of the earth is so enormous that the attraction of gravitation which
                    exists between it and an object near the surface is readily appreciable. It is
                    this attraction of gravitation between the earth and any object which
                    constitutes that force which is referred to when we speak of the <hi
                    rend="italic">weight</hi> of the body. It is the attraction of gravitation which
                    causes bodies to fall to the surface of the earth; and it is easy to show that
                    the facts already presented with respect to the direction in which a falling
                    body moves are readily explained by the supposition that the motions are due to
                    an attractive influence exerted by the earth, or, to speak more correctly, to a
                    mutual attraction subsisting between the earth and the body.</p>
                <p>Let 0 be the centre of the earth, supposed to be a sphere, and let A be the
                    position of a body above its surface. Then, when the body is released, the
                    attraction must evidently cause the body to move along the line OA. The line OA,
                    in fact, is directed along a diameter of the sphere, and there is really no
                    reason why the stone should move te one side of the line more than to another.
                    We thus see that attraction would always tend to draw objects in a direction
                    poiuting towards the centre of the. earth. The observed facts are therefore
                    explained by the supposition that the earth possesses a power of attraction.</p>
                <p>§ 2. <hi rend="italic">Movement of a Falling Body.—</hi> Our knowledge of the
                    force of gravitation being ultimately founded on observation and experiment, it
                    will be convenient at this point to describe the experiments by which a
                    knowledge of the laws of motion of a falling body may be ascertained. We shall
                    first describe these experiments, and then we shall discuss the laws to which we
                    are conducted by their aid.</p>
                <p>A beginner is apt to be surprised when he is told that a heavy body and a light
                    body will fall to the ground in the same time if let drop from the same height..
                    Yet nothing can be easier than to prove this important fact experimentally. Take
                    a piece of cork in one hand and a bullet in the other, and drop these two
                    objects at the same moment from the same height. They will reach the ground
                    together. Nor will the results be different if we try a stone and a piece of
                    wood. If, however, one of the objects were a feather and the other were a stone,
                    then no doubt the latter would reach the ground long before the former. But this
                    arises from a cause quite different from gravity. It is the resistance of the
                    air which retards the motion ol the feather. Even the stone is retarded to a
                    certain extent by the resistance of the air; but the feather, on account of its
                    greater surface in proportion to its mass, is much more retarded. If we could
                    get rid of the influence of the air, the stone and the feather would be found to
                    fall to the ground in the same time. This can actually be verified by performing
                    the experiment (or a similar one) in a space from which the greater portion of
                    the air has been withdrawn by the aid of an air-pump. But the same thing can
                    also be shown in a much more simple manner.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n76/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0076-0067"/>
                <p>Lay a small flat feather upon the top of a penny piece held horizontally. Then
                    let the penny fall; it will be followed with equal rapidity by the feather,
                    which will be found to remain in contact with the penny throughout the entire
                    descent. In this case the penny piece displaces the air, and thus to a great
                    extent shields the feather from the resistance to which it would be exposed
                    without such protection; it is thus found that the two objects fall to the
                    ground from the same height at the same time.</p>
                <p>The various experiments to which we have referred suffice to establish the very
                    important result that <hi rend="italic">the time occupied by a body in falling
                    to the surface of the earth, if dropped from a point above it, is independent of
                    the mass of the body as well as of the materials of which the body is
                    composed.</hi></p>
                <p>There are, no doubt, certain apparent exceptions to the generality of this
                    statement. The law, as we have stated it, does surely not apply to the case of a
                    balloon or a live bird. In each of these cases the air is made, directly or
                    indirectly, to supply a force which overcomes the force of gravity and
                    neutralizes its effects; but <hi rend="italic">if there were no air,</hi> then
                    the balloon and the bird would fall to the ground in precisely the same time as
                    a 56 δ) weight would do when dropped from the same height. It will not be
                    necessary for us to introduce any further reference to the resistance of the
                    air, and we shall discuss the phenomena presented by falling bodies as they
                    would occur in a space from which the air has been removed.</p>
                <p>We have by these considerations cleared the way for a very important quantitative
                    determination. Taking a given interval of time,—for example, one seoond,—we see
                    that the height through which a heavy body will fall in one second depends
                    neither upon the mass of the body nor on the materials of which it is composed.
                    This is therefore a constant at any given place on the earth’s surface for every
                    description of body, and it is of fundamental importance to determine that
                    quantity accurately. By an indirect method, founded on pendulum observations, it
                    is possible to determine this quantity with far greater accuracy than would be
                    attainable by actually making the experiment. The value as thus found is
                    slightly different at different parts of the earth though constant at each one.
                    At any part of the United Kingdom it may be taken as 164 feet.</p>
                <p>When the distance which the falling body moves over in the first second has been
                    ascertained, it is possible to find the distance which will be accomplished in
                    two seconds, or indeed in any number. The difficulty of the question arises from
                    the circumstance that, as the velocity of the falling body is gradually
                    increasing, the distance moved over in the second second is greater than it was
                    in the first, and generally that the distance in any second is greater than the
                    distance accomplished in any previous second. Imagine the “lift” in a hotel to
                    be a room 164 feet high; then when the lift is at rest, a stone will take one
                    second to fall from the top of the room to the floor. But now suppose the
                    experiment to be repeated, when the lift is either ascending or descending. It
                    will be found that no matter what be the velocity of the lift, provided it
                    remains uniform for a second, and no matter whether the lift be ascending or
                    descending, the stone will still take exactly one second to fall from the
                    ceiling to the floor.</p>
                <p>To illustrate the important conclusions which can be drawn from this experiment,
                    let us make some suppositions with reference to the velocity of the lift.
                    Suppose that the lift is descending with a velocity of 5 feet per second. Then
                    since it is found that the stone will reach the floor in one second, it is
                    manifest that during that second the stone must actually have fallen through a
                    distance equal to the height of the room augmented by the 5 feet through which
                    the floor of the room has descended. The total distance traversed by the stone
                    is therefore 16 ’ l + 5 = 21∙1 feet. It is, however, to be observed that at
                    starting the stone must necessarily have had the same velocity as the lift, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e., 5</hi> feet per second. The observed facts can therefore be
                    explained by supposing that the stone retained its initial velocity of 5 feet
                    per second, and that gravity acted upon the stone so as to draw it 16∙1 feet
                    nearer the earth than it would have been had gravity not acted. On the other
                    hand, suppose that at the time when the experiment was made the lift was
                    ascending with an uniform velocity of 5 feet per second. Then the actual
                    distance travelled by the stone in falling will be less than the height of the
                    ceiling by the distance through which the floor has been raised, <hi
                    rend="italic">i,e.,</hi> 16 ’ 1 - 5 = 114 feet. Observation nevertheless shows
                    that the time occupied in falling from the ceiling to the floor is still one
                    second. The observed facts can be explained by remembering that at the moment of
                    starting, the stone must actually have had the same velocity as the lift, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> an upward velocity of 5 feet per second. If therefore
                    gravity had not acted, the stone would in one second have ascended through a
                    vertical distance of 5 feet. The observations are therefore explained by
                    supposing that gravity in this case also draws the body 164 feet nearer the
                    earth in one second than the body would have been had gravity not acted.</p>
                <p>By suitable contrivances it is possible to ascertain that a body dropped from
                    rest will in a time of two seconds move over a space of 64 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 4 feet. We have already seen that during the first
                    second the body will fall 164 feet. It follows that in the second second the
                    space described by a body falling freely from rest is 64 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 4 - 164 = 48 ’ 3. It is thus obvious that the space described in the
                    second second is three times as great as the space described in the first
                    second. To what is this difference to be ascribed 1 At the commencement of the
                    first second the body was at rest; at the conclusion of the first second the
                    body had attained a certain velocity, and with this velocity the body commenced
                    its motion during the second second. The total distance of 48 ’ 3 feet
                    accomplished during the second second is partly due to the velocity possessed by
                    the body at the <hi rend="italic">commencement,</hi> and partly to the action of
                    gravity <hi rend="italic">during</hi> that second. By the principle just
                    explained, we are able to discriminate the amounts due to each cause. It
                    appears, from the experiments already referred to, that during the second second
                    as during the first the effect of gravity is simply to make the body 164 feet
                    nearer the earth than it could otherwise have been. But the body moves
                    altogether 48 ∙3 feet in the second second, and as the action of gravity during
                    that second will only account for 164 feet, it follows that the residue,
                    amounting to 48 ’ 3 - 164 = 32 ’ 2 feet, must be attributed to the velocity
                    accumulated during the first second.</p>
                <p>We are therefore led to the very important result that a body falling freely from
                    rest in the United Kingdom will have acquired a velocity of 32 2 feet per second
                    when one second has elapsed. It need not be a matter for surprise that, though
                    at the close of the first second the velocity acquired is 32'2, the distance
                    moved over during that second is only 164. It will be remembered that the body
                    starts from rest, and that while in the act of falling its velocity is gradually
                    increasing. The body, therefore, moves much further in the last half of the
                    second than it did in the first half, and consequently the total distance
                    travelled must be lese than the distance which would have been accomplished had
                    the body been moving during the whole second with the velocity acquired at its
                    termination.</p>
                <p>It might not be easy to arrange a direct experiment to show how far the body will
                    fall during the third second; we can, however, deduce the result by reasoning
                    from what we have already learned, Let us suppose that the lift <pb break="no"

                    velocity of 32'2 feet per second. A body let drop from the ceiling during the
                    motion, will, as before, reach the floor in one second. The body will therefore
                    have acquired, <hi rend="italic">relatively to the moving lift,</hi> a velocity
                    of 32 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 2 feet per second. But the lift is itself
                    in motion with a velocity of 32'2 feet per second. The <hi rend="italic">actual
                    velocity</hi> of the body must be measured by its velocity relatively to the
                    lift·, added to the velocity of the lift itself. It therefore appears that the
                    body which, when it commenced to fall, had a velocity of 32 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 2 feet per second, acquires an equal amount during
                    its fall, so that at its close the body actually had a velocity of 32 <hi

                    acquires a velocity of 32 ’ 2 feet in the first second; it follows that at the
                    close of the first second the body is in the same condition as if it were let
                    fall from the ceiling of the lift, under the circumstances just described. The
                    motion during the third second is therefore commenced with the velocity of 64 ’
                    4 feet, and in consequence of this initial velocity alone a distance of 64 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4 feet will be accomplished in the third second. To
                    this must be added 16T feet, being the additional distance due to the action of
                    gravity, and therefore we have for the distance through which a body falling
                    freely from rest will move in the third second, 64 ’ 4 + 16T = 80 ’ 5. Similar
                    reasoning will show that the velocity acquired at the close of the third second
                    is 64 ’ 4 + 32 ’ 2 = 96 ’ 6. With this velocity the fourth second is commenced,
                    and therefore the distance accomplished during the fourth second is 96'6+ 16 1 =
                    112 7.</p>

                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">V</hi> denote the velocity acquired in <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> seconds by a body which has been dropped from a state of rest. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> denote the number of feet over which the body has moved.

                    rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>From these equations we can eliminate <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and obtain <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">=
                    2gs.</hi></p>
                <p>This expresses the velocity acquired in teπns of the distance through which the
                    force has acted.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto considered the movement of a falling body which was simply <hi
                    rend="italic">dropped.</hi> It remains to determine the effect on the movement
                    of the body which would be produced by a certain initial velocity. Let us for
                    simplicity take the case of a body thrown vertically downwards, and calculate
                    the distance through which the body will move in a certain time, as well as the
                    velocity which it will acquire. In the act of throwing the hand moves with a
                    certain velocity, and the body when released starts off with that velocity. It
                    will thus be observed that the act of throwing is merely to impart initial
                    velocity to the body. Let <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    ,</hi> be the initial velocity with which the body leaves the hand. Then the
                    velocity of the body at the moment of starting is precisely the same as it would
                    have been had it been dropped from rest <hi rend="italic">v'÷g</hi> seconds
                    previously. The velocity acquired at the end of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> seconds
                    is therefore the same as would have been acquired by a body which fell from rest
                    for a period of <hi rend="italic">if ÷g + t)</hi> seconds; whence we have <hi

                <p>The distance must obviously be equal to the difference between the distance
                    through which the body would drop from rest in (√÷g + i) seconds and the
                    distance through which a body would drop from rest in <hi rend="italic">v'

                <p>The case of a body projected vertically upwards seems at first to present
                    somewhat greater difficulties, but this is not really the case. Such problems
                    can always be readily solved by the help of the following general principle

                    rend="italic">v',</hi> then, if the influence of gravity were suspended, the

                <p>It is therefore obvious that the greatest altitude <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is
                    attained when i = √÷gr; in which case <hi rend="italic">h = v'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">÷2g,</hi> or <hi

                <p>As an illustration we may take the case of a body thrown vertically upwards with
                    an initial velocity of 40 feet per second, and inquire where that body will be
                    at the end of two seconds. Had gravity not acted, the body would, in two
                    seconds, have ascended to a height 2 × 40 = 80 feet. The action of gravity will
                    reduce this by ∙5&lt;∕2 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = <hi rend="italic"
                    >2g</hi> feet, and hence the actual height of the body will be 80 - <hi
                    rend="italic">2g</hi> feet, = 15’6 if <hi rend="italic">g</hi> be taken at
                    32‘2.</p>
                <p>§ 5. <hi rend="italic">Motion of a Projectile.—</hi> We have hitherto referred
                    only to the motion of a falling body in a vertical line; it will now be
                    necessary to examine some cases in which the motion of the body is not so
                    restricted. From a point on the mast of a steamer <hi rend="italic">g÷2</hi>
                    feet above the deck a ball is dropped, which falls upon the deck at a certain
                    point. When the steamer is at rest the time taken by the ball to fall will of
                    course be one second, and its path will be vertical; but when the steamer is
                    moving with uniform velocity it is found that the ball still falls precisely on
                    the same spot of the deck as when the steamer was at rest, and that the time
                    occupied in the descent is still one second. It is obvious that in this case the
                    ball does not move in a straight line at all, but in a curved path due to the
                    motion of the vessel compounded with the actual falling motion. We therefore see
                    that the effect of the motion of the vessel on the ball was to project that ball
                    with a certain initial horizontal velocity, but that notwithstanding that
                    initial velocity the ball still reaches the deck in one second. We are therefore
                    led to the general conclusion that <hi rend="italic">A body projected
                    horizontally will, at the end of</hi> t <hi rend="italic">seconds, have fallen
                    through a space of</hi> 16 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic"
                    >feet.</hi></p>
                <p>An experiment illustrating this result may be made in an exceedingly simple
                    manner. Take a marble in each hand, and throw one of the marbles horizontally at
                    the same time as you drop the other <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n78/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0078-0069"/> from the same height; you will find that the two
                    marbles reach the ground together. Suppose for simplicity that the height at the
                    moment when the marbles are released is 4 feet, then the time taken by one of
                    the marbles in falling is half a second. But as both marbles reach the ground
                    together, the experiment has really proved to us that a body at the height of 4
                    feet from the ground will if projected <hi rend="italic">horizontally</hi> reach
                    the ground in half a second. This is equally true whatever be the magnitude of
                    the velocity, t.e., whether it be 5, 10, or any other number of feet per
                    second.</p>
                <p>We have now studied the effect of gravity upon a body which has been projected
                    either in a vertical line or in a horizontal line. We have found that in each
                    case the effect of gravity is to bring the body <hi rend="italic">'5gC</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> feet nearer the surface of the earth in <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> seconds than it would have been had gravity not acted. We
                    are therefore tempted to inquire whether the same statement would not be true
                    for a body projected <hi rend="italic">in any direction.</hi> In every way in
                    which this suggestion can be tested it has been found to be verified, and there
                    cannot therefore be the slightest doubt that it is true.</p>
                <p>To illustrate this principle we may apply it to the case of a body projected in
                    any direction, and deduce the form of the path in which the body moves. Let 0
                    (fig. 2) be the point from which the body is projected, and let OP be the
                    direction in which the body would move after projection if it were not for
                    gravitation. In consequence of the first law of motion, we should find that if
                    it had not been for the action of gravity the ball would reach P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> in one second, P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> in two
                    seconds, &amp;c., where OP <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> =P <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> = P.P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>...
                    Gravitation will, however, make the body swerve from the direction OP <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, &amp;c., so that at the
                    end of one second the body is really found at the point A <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, at the end of two seconds at A <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, at the end
                    of three seconds at A <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, &amp;c. The curve drawn
                    through the points A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, A <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, A <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, &amp;c., which is actually described by
                    the body, can be readily constructed. Take, for example, i=3. If gravity had not
                    been acting, the body would in three seconds have reached the point P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. We can find where the body actually is by taking a
                    point A <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, which is vertically beneath P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> at the distance 16 T × 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    feet. Similarly we can find where the body is after any other specified number
                    of seconds, and thus we obtain the points A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, <hi rend="smallcaps">&amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>The equation of the curve is thus found. Take the line OP as the axis of <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> and let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> denote the number of
                    seconds during which the motion has lasted; then, if <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    denote the vertical distance through which the body has been deflected by
                    gravity, we must have <hi rend="italic">y = v'x- '5gx</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>This curve, being of the second degree, represents a conic section; and as the
                    highest terms form a perfect square, the conic section must be a parabola.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Centre of Gravity.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 6. <hi rend="italic">Centre of Gravity of a Plate.—</hi> In studying the effect
                    of gravity upon a body which is at rest, it will be convenient to commence with
                    a simple illustrative experiment which can be easily tried. Out of a piece of
                    cardboard or tin plate a figure of <hi rend="italic">any shape,</hi> ABODE (fig.
                    3), is to be cut. A few holes, A, B, C, D, E, are to be punched quite at random
                    in this plate. In the wall is a nail, and the plate can be suspended by passing
                    the nail through any of the holes A, B, and C. From the nail is suspended, in
                    front of the plate, a cord AH, which is kept in the vertical direction by the
                    plummet attached to it at H. As the plate is not supported in any other way, it
                    hangs quite freely from the nail; and if it be displaced and then released, it
                    will, after a few oscillations, settle down again in the position which it
                    occupied at the first. In order to mark this position, it is desirable to draw a
                    line on the plate in the direction AP, indicated by the plummet line which is
                    hanging in front. If the plate be blackened, this can be neatly done by chalking
                    the plummet line and then giving it a flip against the plate.</p>
                <p>When the line has been drawn the plate maybe removed from the nail, and again
                    suspended by one of the other holes in its margin, for example B. The plate
                    again assumes a definite position, and again the line and plummet is to be hung
                    on, and a second line drawn as before. The two lines drawn on the plate
                    intersect at a point P. When the plate is hung from a third hole, C, and a third
                    plummet line is drawn, a very remarkable result is perceived. It is found that
                    the line drawn on the third occasion passes <hi rend="italic">through the
                    intersection of the two former lines,—</hi> that is to say, all the three lines
                    pass through the point P. Repeating the operation, with other holes, D, E,
                    &amp;c., it is found that all the lines drawn in the way we have described
                    possess the remarkable property of passing through one definite point of the
                    plate. It is therefore manifest that the point P possesses a very special
                    property, for it is always situated vertically beneath the point of suspension
                    when the plate is hanging at rest.</p>
                <p>If a hole be actually punched at the position of the point P, and if the plate be
                    suspended by passing this hole over the nail, we then find that <hi
                    rend="italic">the plate will remain at rest in any position whatever.</hi> This
                    peculiarity of the point P will be more readily perceived if we make a hole in
                    the plate at a point Q near to P. When the plate is suspended from Qit will only
                    be at rest in one position, t.e., when P is vertically beneath Q.</p>
                <p>It must surely be regarded as a matter worthy of careful notice that any plate of
                    any figure, regular or irregular, should contain one specific point which enjoys
                    the unique properties which the experiments show to be possessed by the point P.
                    This point has received a name; it is called the <hi rend="italic">centre of
                    gravity.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 7. <hi rend="italic">Centre of Gravity of a Rigid Body.—</hi> In the
                    illustration we have just given, we have spoken merely of a thin plate, because
                    the experiments were more easily conducted in a body of this nature than in one
                    of entirely irregular form. It must not, however, be supposed that a thin plate
                    of uniform thickness is the only kind of body which possesses a point having the
                    properties we have described. No matter what be the shape or materials of which
                    a rigid body is composed, it possesses a centre of gravity. Let ADBC (fig. 4) be
                    a body of any kind, and let it be suspended by a cord from a point A. Then when
                    the body is at rest it assumes a certain position. We may suppose that a
                    vertical hole AB is drilled through the body in the direction of the cord by
                    which the body is suspended. If we now suspend the body by another point on its
                    surface, C, the body will come to rest in the position which is represented in
                    fig. 5. It will be found that these two straight holes intersect in the interior
                    of the body at G. In fact, if we thrust a knitting needle through one of the
                    holes, and then attempt to thrust a second knitting needle through the other
                    hole, we shall find that the way is stopped in the interior of the body by the
                    first knitting needle. If the body be now suspended from any other point on its
                    surface, and if a similar hole be made through the point and in the direction of
                    the string by which the body is suspended, it will be found that this hole also
                    passes through the intersection of the two former holes. From each and every
                    point of suspension the same result is obtained, and thus we are led to the
                    conclusion that in a rigid body of any shape or materials whatever there is one
                    point which possesses the remarkable property thus stated :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">When a body suspended by a cord from a fixed point is at rest,
                    there is one special point which is always vertically beneath the point of
                    suspension, whatever may be the point of the body to which the cord is attached.
                    This point is called the centre of gravity.</hi></p>
                <p>In the case of a homogeneous body of regular shape, the centre of gravity is
                    determined from the most simple considerations of symmetry. In the case of a
                    sphere it is obvious that the centre of gravity must lie at the centre, for
                    there is no other point symmetrically related to the figure. In the case of a
                    parallelepiped the centre of gravity is also situated at the centre of volume.
                    This is found by joining the opposite corners of the figure, and thus making a
                    diagonal; joining another pair of opposite corners we have a second diagonal;
                    and the intersection of these two lines gives the centre of gravity of the
                    mass.</p>
                <p>§ 8. <hi rend="italic">Gravitation of a Rigid Body reduced to One Force.—</hi> A
                    body of any description may be considered to be composed of an innumerable
                    multitude of small particles of matter. Each of these particles is acted upon by
                    the attraction of the earth. Each particle is therefore urged towards the earth
                    by a certain force which tends towards the earth’s centre. The centre of the
                    earth being nearly 4000 miles distant, the directions of these forces may, for
                    all practical purposes, be regarded as parallel. Even if two particles were a
                    mile distant, the inclination of the directions of the two forces is under a
                    minute. We may therefore treat the forces as parallel without making any
                    appreciable error. Two parallel forces may be compounded into a single force
                    which is parallel to the two components. The forces acting on the two particles
                    of the body may therefore be replaced by a single force. This force may be
                    similarly compounded with the force acting on a third particle of the body, this
                    resultant with the force on a fourth particle, and so on until all the particles

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0079-0070"/> have been included. We thus come to the important
                    conclusion that the effect of gravity upon a body of any shape is to produce <hi
                    rend="italic">one force</hi> which acts vertically downwards. It remains to be
                    shown that <hi rend="italic">the direction of this force passes through the
                    centre of gravity of the body.</hi> Suspend a body of any shape by a cord, then
                    when the body is at rest the centre of gravity must lie vertically beneath the
                    point of suspension. If the direction of that one force which constitutes the
                    effect of gravity does not pass through the centre of gravity, then its line of
                    action cannot coincide with the direction of the cord of suspension; but it is
                    impossible that two forces should equilibrate unless their lines of action are
                    coincident, whence we are led. to the important conclusion that the effect of
                    the attraction of the earth upon a rigid body is to produce a single force which
                    passes through the centre of gravity of the body and acts vertically
                    downwards.</p>

                    Investigations of the motions of the planetshave conducted us to the conclusion
                    that each planet is attracted towards the sun by a force which varies according
                    to the inverse square of the distance. We likewise see that each of the
                    satellites appears to be attracted towards the corresponding primary planet by a
                    force which obeys the same law. We are therefore tempted to generalize these
                    results into the proposition that <hi rend="italic">any two masses in the
                    universe attract each other with a force which varies according to the inverse
                    square of the distance.</hi> Observations of the most widely different character
                    have combined to show us that this law, which was discovered by Sir Isaac
                    Newton, is true. It is called <hi rend="italic">the laιυ of
                    Gravitation.</hi></p>
                <p>We suppose that the distance between the two bodies is so exceedingly great
                    compared with their dimensions that we may practically consider each of the
                    bodies as a particle.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">m, m'</hi> be the masses of the two bodies, and let <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> be the distance. The force with which <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> attracts <hi rend="italic">m'</hi> is equal in magnitude though opposite
                    in direction to the force with which <hi rend="italic">m'</hi> attracts <hi
                    rend="italic">m.</hi> The reader may perhaps feel some difficulty at first in
                    admitting the truth of this statement. We speak so often of the effects which
                    the attraction of the sun produces on the planets that it may seem strange to
                    hear that each planet reacts on the sun with a force precisely equal and
                    opposite to the force with which the sun acts upon the planets. We can, however,
                    by the aid of a simple illustration, show that such is really the case. Suppose
                    the sun and the earth to be placed <hi rend="italic">at rest</hi> in space, and
                    abandoned to the influence of their mutual gravitation. It is evident that the
                    two bodies would begin moving towards each other, and would after a certain time
                    come into collision. If, however, the earth and the sun had been separated by a
                    rigid rod, it would then be impossible for the two bodies to move closer to each
                    other, so we must consider whether any other motion could be produced by their
                    mutual attraction. As the two bodies were initially at rest, it is clear that
                    there will be no tendency of the rod to move out of the line in which it was
                    originally placed, and consequently if the rod begin to move at all it must move
                    in that line, and carry with it the earth at one end, ami the sun at the other.
                    As, however, the earth and the sun would remain separated at a constant
                    distance, the statical energy due to their separation would remain constant, and
                    therefore if they began to move we should have the kinetic energy of their
                    motion created out of nothing, which is now well known to be impossible. It
                    therefore follows that, under the circumstances we have assumed, the rod would
                    remain for ever at rest. But what are the forces which act upon the rod? At one
                    end of the rod the earth presses upon it with a force which is equal to the
                    attraction of the sun upon the earth. At the other end the sun presses upon the
                    rod with a force which is equal to the attraction of the earth upon the sun. But
                    since the rod remains at rest, these two forces must be equal and opposite, and
                    hence the force with which the sun attracts the earth must be equal and opposite
                    to the force with which the earth attracts the sun.</p>
                <p>If we express the gravitation of two masses in the form <hi rend="italic"
                    >fm,m')÷r</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> then
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">m'</hi> must enter symmetrically
                    into the expression, for if the two masses were interchanged the gravitation
                    must not be altered.</p>
                <p>We should here also advert to a circumstance connected with gravitation which is
                    of the very highest importance. Suppose we take two definite masses (for
                    simplicity, two pounds) separated at a definite distance (for simplicity, one
                    foot), then the gravitation of these two masses to each other is a certain <hi
                    rend="italic">definite</hi> force (which we shall subsequently calculate). What
                    we want here to lay special stress upon is that, so far as we know at present,
                    this force appears to be the same whatever be the <hi rend="italic"
                    >material</hi> of which the two masses are composed. Thus two pounds of iron at
                    a distance of one foot attract each other with the same force as a pound of iron
                    would attract a pound of lead at the same distance. The significance, or perhaps
                    it should be said the vast importance, of this statement is apt to be lost sight
                    of from a somewhat peculiar cause. It must never be forgotten that, when it is
                    asserted that two masses are equal to each other, what is really meant is that,
                    if equal forces were to act upon each of the masses for the same time, the
                    masses would receive the same velocity. As this test of the equality of masses
                    is not practically convenient, the weighing scales have come into use for the
                    purpose; and though it appears to be true that when two masses have equal
                    “weights,” as tested by the scales, then the masses are themselves equal, yet
                    this is so far from being an obvious or necessary truth that it really is the
                    most remarkable phenomenon connected with gravitation. The expression for the
                    gravitation of two attracting masses must therefore depend solely upon their
                    masses, upon their distance, and upon some specific constant which is
                    characteristic of the intensity of gravitation.</p>
                <p>Experiment shows that the gravitation of a body towards the earth is directly
                    proportional to its mass, and hence we see that the expression „</p>
                <p>y(rn,τn)÷r <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> must be proportional to <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> and as <hi rend="italic">f {m, m')</hi> must be unaltered
                    by the interchange of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">m',</hi> it
                    appears finally that the gravitation of the two masses is <hi rend="italic"
                    >emm÷r</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> whence
                    c is a numerical constant which is equal to the gravitation of two units of mass
                    placed at the unit of distance. To form a definite conception of the intensity
                    of this force, we take some specific instances. It can be shown that two masses
                    A and B, each containing 415,000 tons of matter, and situated at a distance of
                    one statute mile apart, will attract each other with a force of one pound. If
                    the masses of A and B remain the same, and if the distance between them be
                    increased to two miles, then the intensity of the force with which the two
                    masses gravitate together is reduced to one quarter of a pound. If either of the
                    masses were doubled, the distance being unaltered, then the force would be
                    doubled. If both the masses were doubled, then the force would be
                    quadrupled.</p>
                <p>§ 10. <hi rend="italic">Motion of a Planet round the Sun.—</hi> The effect of
                    gravitation when the bodies are in actual motion must next receive our
                    attention. It may so happen that in consequence of the attraction of gravitation
                    one of the bodies will actually describe a circle around the other, so that,
                    notwithstanding the effect of the attraction, the distance between the two
                    bodies remains constant. We shall first explain, by elementary considerations,
                    how it is possible for a planet to continue to revolve in a circular or nearly
                    circular orbit about the sun in its centre; and then we shall proceed to the
                    more exact consideration of the form of the orbit, and the laws according to
                    which that orbit is described.</p>
                <p>Let S represent the sun (fig. 6), and let T be the initial position of the
                    planet. If the planet be simply released, it will immediately begin to fall
                    along the line TS into the sun. If, on the other hand, the planet were initially
                    projected along the line TZ perpendicular to TS, the attraction of the sun at S
                    will deflect the planet from the line TZ which it would otherwise have followed,
                    and compel the planet to move in a curved line. The particular form of curve
                    which the planet will describe depends upon the initial velocity. With a small
                    initial velocity the deflecting power of the sun will have a more speedy effect
                    than is possible when the initial velocity is considerable. The rapidly curving
                    path TX will therefore correspond to a small initial velocity, while the flatter
                    curve TV may be the orbit when the initial velocity is considerable. As the
                    movement proceeds, the velocity of the planet will generally alter. If the
                    planet were moving along the curve TY, it is at every instant after leaving T
                    going farther away from the sun. It is manifest that the planet is thus going
                    against the sun’s attraction, and therefore its velocity must be diminishing. On
                    the other hand, when the planet is moving along the curve TX, it is constantly
                    getting nearer the sun, and the effect of the sun’s attraction is to increase
                    the velocity. It is therefore plain that for a path somewhere between TX and TY
                    the velocity of the planet must be unaltered by the sun’s attraction. With
                    centre S and radius ST describe a circle, and take a point P on that circle
                    exceedingly near to T. With a certain initial velocity it is possible to project
                    the planet so that it shall describe the arc TP. The attraction of the sun
                    always acts along the radius, and hence in describing the arc TP the planet has
                    at every instant been moving perpendicularly to the sun’s attraction. It is
                    manifest that under such circumstances the sun’s attraction cannot have altered
                    the velocity, for it would be impossible to give a reason for the velocity
                    having been accelerated which could not be rebutted by an equally valid reason
                    for the velocity having been retarded. We thus see that the planet reaches P
                    with an unchanged velocity, and at that point the direction of the motion is
                    perpendicular to the radius. It is therefore clear that after passing P the
                    planet will again describe a small portion of the circle, which will again be
                    followed by another, and so on, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the planet will
                    continue to move in a circular orbit. We have therefore shown that, if a planet
                    were originally projected with a certain specific velocity <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n80/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0080-0071"/> in a direction at right angles to the radius
                    connecting the planet and the sun, then the planet would continue for ever to
                    describe a circle around the sun.</p>
                <p>§ 11. <hi rend="italic">On the Elliptic Motion of the Planets.—</hi> The laws of
                    the motions of the planets were discovered by Kepler by means of calculations
                    founded upon observations. They may be thus stated:—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Each planet moves in an ellipse in one focus of which the
                    sun is situated.</hi><hi rend="italic">2. The radius vector drawn from the sun
                    to the planet sweeps over equal areas in equal times.</hi></p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The squares of the periodic times of the motions of the
                    planets round the sun are in the same ratio as the cubes of their mean
                    distances.</hi></p>
                <p>These three laws form the foundations of that branch of astronomy which is called
                    Physical Astronomy, and they are generally known as <hi rend="italic">Kepler's
                    Laws.</hi></p>
                <p>The sun and the planets are all very nearly spherical, and for the present,
                    whenever we speak of the motions of the sun or the planets, we are to understand
                    the motions of the centres of the corresponding spheres. Indeed the diameters of
                    these spheres are so small in comparison with the distances at which they are
                    separated from each other, that we may <hi rend="italic">generally</hi> regard
                    them as mere physical points. Thus though the diameter of the sun is ten times
                    greater than the diameter of the greatest planet, Jupiter, yet the sun’s
                    diameter is only the forty-second part of its distance from the nearest planet,
                    Mercury, and it is less than the three-thousandth part of its distance from the
                    outermost planet, Neptune.</p>
                <p>The orbits of the planets are so little eccentric that at a first glance the
                    majority of them appear to be circular. Among the larger planets the orbits of
                    Mercury and of Mars have the greatest eccentricity, being about ⅜ and ⅛
                    respectively. Next to these comes the orbit of Saturn, which has an eccentricity
                    of ⅛ Next in order come Jupiter, Uranus, the Earth, Neptune, and Venus, with
                    eccentricities of ⅛ ⅛ <hi rend="italic">ττs&gt;</hi> ττκ&gt; τ⅛κ respectively.
                    The orbits of some of the minor planets are, however, much more eccentric.</p>
                <p>§ 12. <hi rend="italic">The Hodograph. —</hi> In discussing the actual motion of
                    a planet around the sun, it is very convenient to introduce the elegant
                    conception of the hodograph. The use of this curve is originally due to</p>
                <p>Bradley, but for its practical development we are principally indebted to Sir W.
                    R. Hamilton. Let AB (fig. 7) be a portion of the path of a particle P acted upon
                    by any forces. From any point 0 draw radii vectores OR <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, OR <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, OR <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, OR <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> (fig. 8), parallel to the tangents to the curve AB
                    drawn at the points, P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, P <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, P <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, and
                    equal to the velocities at those points. Then the curve R <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> R <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> R <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> R <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> Is the hodograph of the orbit of P. To each position P
                    of the particle in the path there is a corresponding point R in the hodograph;
                    and simultaneously with the motion of P in its orbit we have the motion of R in
                    the hodograph.</p>
                <p>The utility of the hodograph depends upon the theorem that <hi rend="italic">the
                    force which acts upon the particle is at any time equal and parallel to the
                    velocity of the corresponding point in the hodograph.</hi> This theorem is thus
                    proved. Let P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,
                    and therefore R <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and R <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,
                    be very close together. The velocity imparted to the particle in passing from P
                    <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> to P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> in the small time
                    <hi rend="italic">δt</hi> must, when compounded with the velocity OR <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, produce the velocity OR <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.
                    This increment of velocity must therefore be equal and parallel to R <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> R <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. If therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> denote the velocity of R, we have <hi rend="italic"
                    >vδt</hi> for the velocity acquired in the time δi. The force acting on P must
                    therefore, by the second law of motion, be equal to <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and
                    parallel to the line R <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> R <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>, which ultimately coincides with the tangent. The theorem is therefore
                    proved.</p>
                <p>Kepler’s second law states that in the movement of a planet around the sun the
                    radius vector from the sun to the planet describes equal areas in equal times.
                    It can be shown that when this is the case the force which acts upon the planet
                    must necessarily be directed towards the sun. Let the planet be supposed to move
                    from P to P ’ (fig. 9) in the time <hi rend="italic">t</hi> with the velocity
                    <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Then, since equal areas are described in equal times,
                    we must have the area OPP' equal to <hi rend="italic">hδt,</hi> where A is a
                    constant which represents the area described in the unit of time. Let fall OT
                    perpendicular upon the tangent at P, then vOT = 2A. We therefore infer that the
                    velocity of a planet is inversely proportional to the perpendicular .et fall
                    from the centre of the sun upon the tangent to the orbit. Produce OT to Q, so
                    that OT × OQ is constant; the radius vector OQ will therefore be proportional to
                    the velocity; and as OQ is perpendicular to the tangent at P, it follows that
                    the locus of Q must be simply the hodograph turned round through 90°. Draw two
                    consecutive tangents to the orbit, and let Q <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and Q
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> be the corresponding points (fig. 10). Then since
                    OT <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> × OQ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = OT <hi
                    rend="subscript"> a</hi> × OQ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, the quadrilateral T
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Q <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Q <hi
                    rend="subscript"> a</hi> T <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> is inscribable in a
                    circle, and therefore the angles OQ,Q <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> and OT <hi
                    rend="subscript"> a</hi> T <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are equal; whence it is
                    easily seen that Q <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Q <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi>
                    is perpendicular to OP. It follows from the principle of the hodograph that the
                    force on P must be directed along OP.</p>
                <p>Let F (fig. 11) be the focus of the ellipse in which, according to Kepler’s first
                    law, the planet is moving, then, from a well-known property of the ellipse, the
                    foot of the perpendicular FT let fall from F on the tangent drawn to the ellipse
                    at the point P lies on the circle of which the diameter is the axis major of the
                    ellipse. The line FT cuts the circle again at Q, and as FT × FQ is constant, the
                    radius vector FQ must be constantly proportional to the velocity, and therefore
                    the hodograph will be the circle TAQ turned round through 90 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> υ</hi>. We have already shown that the tangent to the
                    hodograph is parallel to the force. The line CQ must therefore be parallel to
                    FP. If <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> be the angle PFC, then, in consequence of the
                    law of equal description of areas in equal times, FP <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> d0 ÷ <hi rend="italic">dt</hi> must be constant, and therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">dθ÷dt</hi> must vary inversely as FP <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>; but the velocity of Q will be proportional to <hi rend="italic">dθ ÷
                    dt</hi>; hence the velocity of Q, and therefore the force, will be inversely
                    proportional to FP <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>. In this way it is shown that
                    the planets are attracted by the sun. with a force which varies inversely as the
                    square of the distance.</p>

                <p>§13. <hi rend="italic">The Problem of Three Bodies. —</hi> We have pointed out
                    that the motion of a planet is determined by the mutual attraction which exists
                    between the planet and the sun. It follows, however, as a necessary consequence
                    from the law of universal gravitation, that each planet is attracted not only by
                    the sun but by every other planet, and indeed, so far as we know, by every other
                    body in the universe. The effect of the attraction of the sun preponderates so
                    enormously over the other attractions that the obedience of the planets to
                    Kepler’s laws, which would be perfect were the sources of disturbance absent, is
                    still so nearly perfect that the departure therefrom can only be perceived
                    either by very accurate or by very long-continued observations. The refinements
                    of modern observations have, however, brought to light a very large number of
                    <hi rend="italic">perturbations,</hi> as they are called, in the motions of the
                    planets and their satellites, which are due to the interference of other bodies.
                    The explanation of these different perturbations by the law of universal
                    gravitation has proved in the great majority of cases triumphantly
                    successful.</p>
                <p>In any problem where perturbations are involved, we have at least three bodies,
                    viz., the principal body S, a body P which circulates around S, and a disturbing
                    body P'. If we had only the two bodies S and P to consider, then P would
                    describe around S a conic section, of which S was the focus, and the radius
                    vector SP would sweep over equal areas in equal times. By the introduction of
                    the third body P', which attracts both the former bodies S and P, the motion is
                    deranged, the orbit which P describes is no longer a conic section, and its
                    radius vector has ceased to describe equal areas in equal times. The <hi
                    rend="italic">general</hi> case of this problem, as we have here described it,
                    is one of excessive complexity. It is, however, a fortunate circumstance that,
                    up to the present time, astronomers have had but little occasion to attack the
                    problem in its <hi rend="italic">general</hi> form. <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> In the solar system we have a great number cf different problems of
                    perturbations to discuss, but there is one feature common to all these problems.
                    This feature is that <hi rend="italic">the perturbing force is very small in
                    comparison with the primary force, by which the motion of the disturbed body is
                    controlled.</hi> In consequence of this peculiarity, the problems of
                    perturbations in the solar system become greatly simplified. The circumstances
                    of the orbits of the planets and their satellites are also happily such as to
                    furnish additional facilities in the solution of the problems of perturbations.
                    The eccentricities of the orbits are small, and in nearly every case the
                    inclinations are small also. The problems of perturbations in the solar system
                    are consequently adapted for the methods of successive approximation; but we
                    should perhaps warn the reader that, even with the assistance so fortunately
                    rendered by the circumstances of the case, the problems are still among the most
                    difficult to which analysis has ever been applied.</p>
                <p>Let S, P, P' (fig. 12) denote the three bodies of which the masses are M, <hi
                    rend="italic">m, m'.</hi> Let the distances SP, SP', PP' be denoted by r, r <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> respectively; then if e
                    denotes, as before, the gravitation between two units of mass separated by the
                    unit of distance, we have on S the forces and along SP and SP' respectively; on
                    P the forces and <hi rend="italic subscript"> f</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">lHL</hi> along PS and PP' respectively; on

                    l</hi> along P'S and P'P respectively.</p>
                <p>In the problem of the perturbation of a planet which is moving around the sun,
                    the <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> motion of the planet in space is not what we
                    are concerned with; what we do require is the <hi rend="italic">relative motion
                    of the planet with respect to the sun.</hi></p>
                <p>Suppose that we apply <hi rend="italic">to each unit of mass</hi> of the three
                    bodies, forces equal to ernr* <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> parallel to PS and
                    <hi rend="italic">ιm'r</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> f</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">~</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> parallel to P'S, then
                    it is clear that, from the second law of motion, each unit of mass of the system
                    will receive in a small time, so far as these forces are concerned, equal and
                    parallel velocities, and therefore the <hi rend="italic">relative motions
                    of</hi> the three bodies will not be altered by the introduction of these
                    forces.</p>
                <p>But these forces will, so far as the body S is concerned, amount to eMrn÷r' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> and ⅛'÷r' <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> in the
                    directions PS and P'S respectively, and will therefore neutralize the
                    attractions of P and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> upon S. It follows that, so far as
                    the relative motions only are concerned, we may consider the body S as fixed,
                    while the body P is acted upon by the forces effi(M + ffl)÷r <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> on PS <hi rend="italic">emm</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"

                    i</hi> parallel to P'S, with of course similar expressions for the forces on
                    P'.</p>
                <p>The problem of perturbation is therefore reduced to the determination of the
                    motion of P in obedience to these forces, while S regarded as fixed.</p>
                <p>It is plain that, in order to find the motion of P, we should know the motion of
                    P ’, which is itself disturbed by P; but as the effect of the perturbation is
                    small, we may, without appreciable error, use the place of P', derived on the
                    supposition that the motion of P' is undisturbed, for the purpose of calculating
                    disturbances caused by P' in the motion of P. We shall therefore suppose that
                    the orbit of P' is an ellipse which is described around the focus S in
                    consequence of an attractive force em'(M + 7n')÷r' <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> directed towards S.</p>
                <p>In computing the disturbed motion of P we transform the three given forces into
                    three equivalent forces, which will be more convenient for our purpose. We take
                    first a force T directed along the radius vector; secondly, a force V
                    perpendicular to the radius vector, and lying in the plane of the orbit; and,
                    thirdly, a force W, which is normal to the plane of the orbit. T is to be
                    regarded as positive when it endeavours to increase the distance between P and
                    S; V is to be regarded as positive when it tends to move P to the same side of
                    the line PS as that in which the direction of its motion tends to carry it; and
                    W is to be regarded as positive when it tends to raise P to the <hi
                    rend="italic">north</hi> of the plane of its orbit.</p>
                <p>From P' (fig. 13) let fall a perpendicular P'Q upon the plane of the undisturbed
                    orbit cf P, and let fall from Q a perpendicular QR upon the line SP. The force
                    along PP' can be resolved into a component parallel to QP' and another parallel
                    to QP; and the latter can again be decomposed into components parallel to RQ and
                    RP. Hence we have, as the equivalents to the force on PP', the following three
                    forces which form parts of T, V, W respectively :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> +</hi> i≡PR <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>-≡J⅛Rj <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">√-≡'qP'.</hi></p>
                <p>In a similar manner we find for the components of the force parallel to SP, the
                    following three forces which form parts of T, V, W respectively:—</p>
                <p>- √ <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> SR; +ψ3-QRi "-^^ <hi rend="superscript"> qγ</hi>

                    ruggedness, but the observations which would be required are certainly wanting,
                    and probably unattainable.</p>

                <p>It will be noticed that the first term of the expression for T consists of the
                    force which corresponds to the purely elliptic motion. The two remaining terms
                    in T, as well as the whole of V and W, depend upon the disturbing force, as is
                    evident from the circumstance that they contain <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi> as a factor, and would vanish if <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> ’ were equal to zero. As <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> is
                    small, we may neglect its squares and higher powers, so that cos δ'=l and sin
                    δ'=⅛'.</p>
                <p>When these substitutions are made, we see that the expressions for T and V are
                    both independent of <hi rend="italic">b'</hi>; and consequently we may, so far
                    as these forces are concerned, consider the motions of the disturbing and the
                    disturbed body to take place in the same plane.</p>
                <p>The expression for W contains, however, the first power of the latitude of the
                    disturbing body. This is of course connected with the circumstance that it is
                    only in consequence of the disturbing force W that the disturbed body is induced
                    to leave the plane of its undisturbed motion at all.</p>
                <p>§14. <hi rend="italic">Calculation of Disturbed Motion.—</hi> Observation has
                    shown that, notwithstanding the perturbations, the orbit of each planet differs
                    but little from a circle, of which the sun is the centre. It is further shown by
                    observation that, though the rate at which a planet moves in its orbit is not
                    quite constant, it is still very nearly so. We may make a similar statement with
                    reference to the motion of the moon around the earth. The orbit of the moon is

                    in its orbit is nearly constant. These features of the motions of the planets
                    and the moon enable us to replace the more exact formulae by approximate
                    expressions which are much more convenient, while still sufficiently
                    correct.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">p, θ</hi> be the polar co-ordinates of a celestial body
                    which moves nearly uniformly in a nearly circular orbit. The form of the orbit
                    may be expressed by an equation of the type</p>
                <p>∕(p,θ) = O∙</p>
                <p>It will, however, be more convenient to employ two equations, by means of which
                    the coordinates are each expressed directly in terms of the time. We thus write
                    two equations of the form</p>

                <p>To justify our employment of these equations it would really be sufficient for us
                    to state that, as a matter of fact, the motions of all the heavenly bodies which
                    are at present under consideration are capable of being expressed in the forms
                    we have written. It may, however, facilitate the reader in admitting the
                    legitimacy of this assumption, if we point out how exceedingly plausible are the
                    <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> arguments which can be adduced in its
                    favour.</p>
                <p>The orbits of the celestial bodies are approximately circular, and consequently
                    <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> must remain approximately constant. The value of <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> is, in fact, incessantly fluctuating between certain narrow
                    limits which it does not transcend. Thus <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is what is
                    called a <hi rend="italic">periodic function of the time.</hi> It is necessary
                    that the mode in which the time <hi rend="italic">t</hi> enters into the
                    expression for <hi rend="italic">p</hi> must fulfil the condition of confining
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> within narrow limits, <hi rend="italic">notwithstanding
                    the indefinitely great increase of which</hi> t <hi rend="italic">is
                    susceptible.</hi> It is obvious that this condition is fulfilled in the form we
                    have assumed for <hi rend="italic">ρ.</hi> Under all circumstances <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> =</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">p</hi> is necessarily restricted to narrow limits.</p>
                <p>By similar reasoning we can justify the equation for <hi rend="italic">θ,</hi>
                    for we can show that the angular velocity of the celestial body to which it
                    refers must be approximately uniform.</p>

                <p>In this case the orbit described by the body is a circle of which the radius is
                    <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> The angle made by the radius vector to the particle
                    with a fixed axis is proportional to the time. It follows that the velocity with

                    unit of time is equal to <hi rend="italic">ω,</hi> it follows that the angular
                    velocity of the particle is equal to <hi rend="italic">ω</hi>; since the radius

                    perpendicular to the radius vector is constantly equal to zero. Hence the total
                    force which acts upon the particle is always directed along the radius vector,
                    and is equal to <hi rend="italic">- maω</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">

                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">p</hi> denote the periodic time of the motion of the
                    particle in its orbit. Then we must find the angular velocity by dividing the

                <p>It is clear in the first place that the orbit is not a circle, for as λ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> depends upon <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> it will follow
                    that cos λ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> may vary between the limits +1 and -1,
                    so that the radius vector <hi rend="italic">r</hi> may also vary between the
                    extreme values <hi rend="italic">a + a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">a-a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">.</hi> As <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    1</hi> is extremely small, it appears that the orbit is still nearly circular
                    with a radius <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> but that the particle may sometimes be
                    found at a distance <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    1</hi><hi rend="italic">on</hi> the inside or outside of the circle.</p>
                <p>We shall similarly find that the angular velocity with which the radius vector
                    sweeps round is not quite uniform. The average angular velocity is no doubt <hi
                    rend="italic">ω,</hi> but the actual position of the radius vector differs by
                    the quantity <hi rend="italic">∙η</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> sin λ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> from what it would have been had its motion been
                    uniform. As <hi rend="italic">η</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> sin λ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> must vary between the limits + η <hi

                    subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> it follows that the radius vector can

                    which it would have occupied had it continued to move uniformly.</p>
                <p>The orbit is completely defined by the two equations—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">θ=ωt + a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> sin (ω <hi

                <p>If from these two equations the time <hi rend="italic">t</hi> could be
                    eliminated, the result would be the equation in polar coordinates of the path
                    which the particle described. Owing, however, to the fact that the quantity <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> occurs separately, and also under the form of a sine and
                    cosine, this elimination would be transcendental.</p>
                <p>If, however, we take advantage of the smallness of ∕ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    all practical purposes.</p>
                <p>As <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> is nearly equal to <hi rend="italic">ωt,</hi> we may
                    assume for <hi rend="italic">t</hi> as the first approximation the value <hi
                    rend="italic">θ÷ω.</hi> If we consider the squares or higher powers of α <hi

                    substituted for <hi rend="italic">t</hi> under the sine and cosine, and we have
                    <hi rend="italic">r=a + η</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> cos (- <hi

                <p>This equation in general denotes a curve undulating about the circumference of
                    the circle of which the radius is <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></p>
                <p>We must now briefly consider the case where the motion of the particle is not
                    confined to a plane. Suppose a third axis OC be drawn through the point 0
                    perpendicular to the plane which contains the undisturbed orbit. Let <hi

                    We shall suppose that the motion of the particle is such that the coordinate <hi

                <p>§ 17. <hi rend="italic">The Motion of the Moon.—</hi> One of the most important
                    problems to which we may apply the expressions to which we have been conducted
                    is to an examination of the disturbances which the moon experiences in its
                    motion round the earth. The moon would describe a purely elliptic motion around
                    the earth in one of the foci were it not that the presence of the sun disturbs
                    the motion and produces certain irregularities. Notwithstanding the vast mass of
                    the sun, these disturbing causes still only slightly derange the moon’s motion
                    from what it would be were these disturbing causes absent. The reason of this is
                    that the sun is about 400 times as far from the earth as the moon, and
                    consequently the difference of the effects of the sun upon the earth and the
                    moon is comparatively small.</p>
                <p>In applying the formulae to the case of the moon we denote by</p>
                <p>S, P, P' the earth, the moon, and the sun respectively;</p>
                <p>M, wι, <hi rend="italic">m'</hi> signify the masses of the earth, moon, and sun;
                    <hi rend="italic">r, r</hi> ’ are the distances of the moon and the sun from the
                    earth; <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> is the distance from the moon to the sun; <hi
                    rend="italic">l, l'</hi> are the longitudes of the moon and the sun measured in
                    the moon’s orbit.</p>
                <p>T, V, W are the forces acting upon the moon, whereof T is along the radius
                    vector, V is perpendicular to the radius vector, and W is perpendicular to the
                    plane of the moon’s orbit.</p>
                <p>Since r÷r <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> is very nearly equal to l÷400, we may
                    regard this fraction as so small that its squares and higher powers are

                    of the eccentricity of the orbit of the moon and of that of the earth. As we

                <p>The results at which we have arrived may be thus summarily stated, using,

                    subscript"> 1</hi> than that which is formed by this method :—</p>
                <p>If we suppose the orbit of the moon to coincide with the plane of the ecliptic,
                    and if we neglect the ellipticity of the orbit of the earth around the sun and
                    that of the moon around the earth; if <hi rend="italic">n'</hi> denotes the mean
                    motion of the earth around the sun, and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> the mean motion
                    of the moon around the earth; and, finally, if <hi rend="italic">n</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> be connected by the equation ii <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> α <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> = 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9972
                    ∈(M+m)</p>
                <p>then we have for the motion of the moon the equations <hi rend="italic"
                    >r=a(l</hi>-0 ’ 007204 cos <hi rend="italic">(2nt-2n't)^, l=nt +</hi> 39'30" sin
                    <hi rend="italic">(2nt - 2n</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">t).</hi></p>
                <p>We thus see that the motion of the moon, on the hypothesis which we have assumed,
                    is different from a uniform circular motion. The distance from the moon to the
                    earth is sometimes l-139th part greater or less than its mean value. And the
                    longitude of the moon is sometimes 39' 30" in advance of or behind what it would
                    be on the supposition that the moon was moving uniformly.</p>
                <p>When the distance is the greatest, we have cos <hi rend="italic">(2nt - 2n't)
                    =</hi>-1; <hi rend="superscript"> whencβ</hi> 2rf-2Λ-.or3x <hi rend="subscript">
                    i</hi> and it follows that the distance of the moon from the earth is greatest
                    at quadratures. When the distance is least, then cos <hi rend="italic">(2nt
                    -2rit)≈</hi> +1, whence <hi rend="italic">2nt- 2n't=Q</hi> or 2π; consequently
                    the moon is nearest to the earth at syzygy. It thus appears that the orbit of
                    the moon as modified by the disturbing influence of the variation resembles an
                    oval of which the earth is the centre, and of which the minor axis is constantly
                    in the line of syzygies.</p>
                <p>The mean longitude of the moon and the true longitude coincide when sin <hi
                    rend="italic">{2nt- 2n't) = 0.</hi></p>
                <p>This condition is fulfilled both at syzygy and quadrature; consequently the mean
                    place of the moon and its true place coincide when the moon is either in syzygy
                    or in quadrature. The true place of the moon is at its greatest distance in
                    advance of the mean place when sin (2πi- 2n'i) = l.</p>
                <p>This condition is fulfilled at the middle points of the first and third
                    quadrants, while at the middle points of the second and fourth quadrants sin <hi
                    rend="italic">(2nt ~ 2n</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">t) =</hi>-1; and therefore the
                    moon is behind its mean place in the second and fourth quadrants.</p>
                <p>After new moon, the distance between the moon and the earth gradually increases,
                    and the apparent velocity of the moon also increases until, when the moon is
                    three or four days old, it has advanced 39' beyond its mean place; the velocity
                    then begins to diminish, though the distance goes on increasing, until at first
                    quarter the distance has attained a maximum. After first quarter the distance
                    diminishes, and the moon falls behind its mean place, the maximum distance of
                    39' behind the mean place being reached about 11 days after new moon. At full
                    moon the distance has become a minimum, and the’ mean place and true place
                    coincide. At 18 days the true place has again gained 39' on the mean place, but
                    the distance increases, and at third quarter the distance is again a maximum,
                    and the true and the mean place coincide. After passing third quarter the
                    distance diminishes, and the true place falls behind the mean place, the
                    difference attaining a maximum on the 26th day, after which the true place gains
                    on the mean place, with which it coincides at new moon, when also the distance
                    is again a minimum.</p>
                <p>Since the amount of this irregularity in longitude is so considerable, being in
                    fact larger than the diameter of the moon itself, it is very appreciable even in
                    comparatively coarse observations. It was discovered by observation by Tycho
                    Brahe, by whom it was named the <hi rend="italic">variation.</hi></p>
                <p>It would lead us too far to endeavour to trace out any of the other
                    irregularities by which the motion of the moon is deranged. We have taken the
                    variation merely as an illustration of one of the numerous corrections which the
                    law of gravitation has explained. The accordance which subsists between the
                    values of these corrections as computed by theory and as determined by
                    observation affords the most conclusive evidence of the truth of the law of
                    universal gravitation. (R. S. B.)</p>
