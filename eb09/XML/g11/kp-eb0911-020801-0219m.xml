                    embarrassed by the Revolution, threw Gros, in 1791, upon his own resources. He
                    now devoted himself wholly to his profession, and competed in 1792 for the <hi
                    rend="italic">grand prix,</hi> but unsuccessfully. About this time he was,
                    however, on the recommendation of the École des Beaux Arts, employed on the
                    execution of portraits of the members of the Convention, and when— disturbed by
                    the development of the Revolution—Gros in 1793 left France for Italy, he
                    supported himself at Genoa by the same means, producing a great quantity of
                    miniatures and <hi rend="italic">fixes.</hi> He visited Florence, but returning
                    to Genoa made the acquaintance of Josephine, and followed her to Milan, where he
                    was well received by her husband. On November 15, 1796, Gros was present with
                    the army near Arcola when Bonaparte planted the tricolor on the bridge. Gros
                    seized on this incident, and showed by his treatment of it that he had found his
                    vocation. Bonaparte at once gave him the post of “inspecteur aux revues,” which
                    enabled him to follow the army, and in 1797 nominated him on the commission
                    charged to select the spoils which should enrich the Louvre. In 1799, having
                    escaped from the besieged city of Genoa, Gros made his way to Paris, and in the
                    beginning of 1801 took up his quarters in the Capucins. His “esquisse” (Musée de
                    Nantes) of the Battle of Nazareth gained the prize offered in 1802 by the
                    consuls, but was not carried out, owing it is said to the jealousy of Junot felt
                    by Napoleon; but he indemnified Gros by commissioning him to paint his own visit
                    to the pest-house of Jaffa. Les Pestiférés de Jaffa (Louvre) was followed by the
                    Battle of Aboukir 1806 (Versailles), and the Battle of Eylau, 1808 (Louvre).
                    These three subjects—the popular leader facing the pestilence unmoved,
                    challenging the splendid instant of victory, heart-sick with the bitter cost of
                    a hard-won field—gave to Gros his chief titles to fame. As long as the military
                    element remained bound up with French national life, Gros received from it a
                    fresh and energetic inspiration which carried him to the very heart of the
                    events which he depicted; but as the army and its general separated from the
                    people, Gros, called on to illustrate episodes representative only of the
                    fulfilment of personal ambition, ceased to find the nourishment necessary to his
                    genius, and the defect of his artistic position became evident. Trained in the
                    sect of the Classicists, he was shackled by their rules, even when—by his
                    naturalistic treatment of types, and appeal to picturesque effect in colour and
                    tone— he seemed to run counter to them. In 1810 his Madrid and Napoleon at the
                    Pyramids (Versailles) show that his star had deserted him. His Francis I. and
                    Charles V., 1812 (Louvre), had considerable success; but the decoration of the
                    dome of St Geneviève (begun in 1811 and completed in 1824) is the only work of
                    Gros’s later years which <pb break="no"

                    skill. The Departure of Louis XVII1. (Versailles), the Embarkation of Madame
                    d’Angoulême (Bordeaux), the plafond of the Egyptian room in the Louvre, and
                    finally his Hercules and Diomedes, exhibited in 1835, testify only that Groè’s
                    efforts —in accordance with the frequent councils of his old master David—to
                    stem the rising tide of Romanticism served but to damage his once brilliant
                    reputation. Exasperated by criticism and the consciousness of failure, Gros
                    sought refuge in the grosser pleasures of life, but suddenly his vital forces
                    failed him, and on the 25th June 1835 he was found drowned on the shores of the
                    Seine near Sèvres. From a paper which he had placed in his hat it became known
                    that “las de la vie, et trahi par les dernières facultés qui la lui rendaient
                    supportable, il avait résolu de s’en défaire.” The number of Gros’s pupils was
                    very great, and was considerably augmented when, in 1815, David quitting Paris
                    made over his own classes to him. Gros was decorated and named baron of the
                    empire by Napoleon, after the Salon of 1808, at which he had exhibited the
                    Battle of Eylau. Under the Restoration he became a member of the Institute,
                    professor at the École des Beaux Arts, and was named chevalier of the order of
                    St Michel.</p>
