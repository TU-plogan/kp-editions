                    chemical works, and a brewery. On account of its picturesque views, its fine
                    air, and its public park and other attractions, it is one of the favourite
                    resorts of Londoners.</p>
                <p>Fronting the river stands the splendid range of buildings in the Grecian style of
                    architecture, formerly known as Greenwich Hospital, but now the Royal Naval
                    College. It occupies the site of an ancient royal palace called Greenwich house,
                    which was a favourite royal residence as early as 1300, but was granted by Henry
                    V. to Thomas Beaufort, duke of Exeter, from whom it passed to Humphrey, duke of
                    Gloucester; and it did not revert to the crown till his death in 1433. It was
                    the birthplace of Henry VIII., Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth. The building was
                    enlarged by Edward IV., by Henry VIII., who made it his chief residence and
                    named it <hi rend="italic">Placentia,</hi> by James I.*, and by Charles I., who
                    erected the “Queen’s House” for Henrietta Maria. Along with other royal palaces
                    it was at the Revolution appropriated by the Protector, but it reverted to the
                    crown on the restoration of Charles II., by whom it was pulled down, and the
                    west wing of the present hospital was erected as part of an extensive design
                    which was not further carried out. In its unfinished state it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n185/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0185-0174"/> was assigned by the patent of William and Mary to
                    certain of the great officers of state, as commissioners for its conversion into
                    a hospital for seamen. As it now stands, the building consists of four blocks.
                    Behind a terrace 860 feet in length, stretching along the river side, are the
                    buildings erected in the time of Charles II. by Webb from Inigo Jones’s designs,
                    and in that of Queen Anne from designs by Sir Christopher Wren; and behind these
                    buildings are on the west those of King William and on the east those of Queen
                    Mary, both from Wren’s designs. In the King William range is the painted hall.
                    Its walls and ceiling were painted by Sir Thomas Thornhill with various
                    emblematic devices, and it is hung with portraits of the most distinguished
                    admirals, and paintings of the chief naval battles of England. In the centre of
                    the principal quadrangle of the hospital there is a statue of George II. by
                    Rysbrack, sculptured out of a single block of marble taken from the French by
                    Admiral Sir George Rooke. The oldest part of the building was in some measure
                    rebuilt in 1811, and the present chapel was erected to replace one destroyed by
                    fire in 1779. The endowments of the hospital were increased at various periods
                    from bequests and forfeited estates. Formerly 3000 retired seamen were boarded
                    within it, and 5000 or 6000 others, called out-pensioners, received stipends at
                    various rates out of its funds; but in 1865 an Act was passed empowering the
                    Admiralty to grant liberal pensions in lieu of food and lodging to such of the
                    inmates as were willing to quit the hospital, and in 1869 another Act was passed
                    making their leaving on these conditions compulsory. It has since been devoted
                    to the accommodation of the students of the Royal Naval College, for which
                    purpose it was formally opened in 1873. Behind the College is the Royal Hospital
                    School, where 1000 boys, sons of petty officers and seamen, are boarded.</p>
                <p>Another of the attractions of Greeuwich is the park, 190 acres in extent, in
                    which is situated the Royal Observatory. It was enclosed by Humphrey, duke of
                    Gloucester, in 1433, and laid out by Charles II. It still contains a fine avenue
                    of Spanish chestnuts planted in his time; and the hill rising towards the south
                    commands a fine prospect over London, the Thames, and the plains of Essex. The
                    Royal Observatory was built in 1675, for the advancement of navigation and
                    nautical astronomy. From it the exact time is conveyed at one o’clock every day
                    by electric current to London and' all the other chief towns of the kingdom; and
                    English geographers reckon longitude from its meridian. Adjoining Greenwich Park
                    is Blackheath, an open common much frequented by excursionists, and also used
                    for golf and cricket.</p>
                <p>Greenwich possesses a considerable number of almshouses and other charitable
                    foundations, among which may be mentioned Quean Elizabeth’s College; Trinity
                    Hospital, founded by Henry Howard, earl of Northampton, in 1613; the Jubilee
                    Almshouses, founded by subscription of the inhabitants in 1809 in commemoration
                    of the fiftieth anniversary of George III.; the Green Coat School, the Grey Coat
                    School, and the Orphan Girl’s School. The parish church is dedicated to St
                    Alphege, archbishop of Canterbury; who suffered martyrdom at Greenwich.</p>
                <p>Greenwich is first noticed in the reign of Ethelred, when it was from 1011 to
                    1014 the station of the Danish fleet. It has been the place of debarkation of
                    many illustrious personages, as well as in 1806; after the battle of Trafalgar,
                    of the remains of Lord Nelson, which lay in state in the painted hall of the
                    hospital previous to their removal for interment in St Paul's Cathedral. In 1577
                    it returned two burgesses to parliament, but it was not again represented till
                    the same privilege was conferred on it by the Reform Act of 1832. The population
                    of the parish in 1871 was 40,412. The population of the parliamentary
                    borough—whose limits were extended in 1868, and include the parishes of Charlton
                    next Woolwich, Plumstead, and St Nicholas and St Paul, Deptford, and part of
                    Woolwich—is 169,361, and the area 8581 acres, of which 657 are in Surrey.</p>
