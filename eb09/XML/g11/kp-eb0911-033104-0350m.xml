                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0351-0332"/> S. by the Muttra district of the North-Western
                    Provinces, on the E. by the river Jumna, and on the N.E. by Delhi, the district
                    of Gurgâon comprises the southernmost corner of the Punjab province, and
                    stretches away from the level plain towards the hills of Râjputânâ. Two low
                    rocky ranges enter its borders from the south and run northward in a bare and
                    unshaded mass toward the plain country. East of the western ridge the valley is
                    wide and open, and essentially extends to the banks of the Jumna. To the west
                    lies the subdivision of Rewâri, consisting of a sandy plain dotted with isolated
                    hills. Numerous torrents carry off the drainage from the upland ranges, and the
                    most important among them empty themselves at last into the Najafgarh y∕ri∕.
                    This swampy lake lies to the east of the civil station of Gurgâon, and stretches
                    long arms into the neighbouring districts of Delhi and Rohtak. Salt is
                    manufactured from lime in wells at several villages. The mineral products are
                    iron ore, copper ore, plumbago, and ochre. Wolves, leopards, deer, jackals,
                    hares, and foxes are found in the district. In 1803 Gurgâon district passed into
                    the hands of the British after Lord Lake’s conquests, and under their influence
                    improvements made steady and rapid progress. On the outbreak of the mutiny at
                    Delhi in May 1857, the nawâb of Farrukhnagar, the principal feudatory of the
                    district, rose in rebellion. The Meos and many Rajput families followed his
                    example. A faithful native officer preserved the public buildings and records at
                    Rewâri from destruction; but with this exception, British authority became
                    extinguished for a time throughout all Gurgâon. After the fall of the rebel
                    capital, a force marched into the district and either captured or dispersed the
                    leaders of rebellion. The territory of the nawâb was confiscated on account of
                    his participation in the mutiny. Civil administration was resumed under orders
                    from the Punjab Government, to which province the district was formally annexed
                    on the final pacification of the country.</p>
                <p>The census of 1868 was taken over an area of 2015 square miles, and it disclosed
                    a population of 696,646 persons—males, 370,251; females, 326,395. The Hindus
                    number 480,307; Mahometans, 216,147; Sikhs, 130; and “others,” 62. In 1875-76
                    there were four municipal towns, with populations as follows :—Rewâri, 25,237;
                    Ferozepore (Firozpur), 10,580; Palwal, 13,542; Farrukhnagar, 10,611. Gurgâon,
                    the administrative headquarters, had in 1868 a population of 3539. Out of a
                    total area of 1,267,335 acres, as many as 967,440 were returned in 1875-76 as
                    under cultivation. The principal products are wheat, barley, <hi rend="italic"
                    >joAr,</hi><hi rend="italic">bâfra,</hi> gram, oil-seeds, pulses, cotton, and
                    tobacco. Owing to the deficiency of artificial irrigation, Gurgâon must always
                    be exposed to drought. Seven periods of dearth have occurred since the
                    disastrous year of 1783. In 1833 and 1837 many villages, according to report,
                    lost their whole population through death and emigration. The traffic of Gurgâon
                    district centres entirely upon the town of Rewâri, which ranks as one of the
                    chief trading emporiums in the Punjab. Its merchants transact a large part of
                    the commerce between the states of Râjputânâ and the northern provinces of
                    British India. Salt from the Sambhar Lake, together with iron, forms the
                    principal import; sugar and English piece-goods form the chief items of the
                    return trade. In 1871-72 the imports of Rewâri were valued at £208,892, and the
                    exports at £99,028. The means of communication are not of the highest order. One
                    good metalled road traverses the district, from Delhi to Muttra, but the lines
                    of greatest mercantile importance are unmetalled. The Râjputânâ State Railway
                    now passes through the district, with stations at Gurgâon, Jhârsa, Jataoli,
                    Kalipur, and Rewâri. The total revenue in 1875-76 was £111,885. In the same year
                    13 civil and revenue judges had jurisdiction, and the police force numbered 605
                    men, supplemented by a body of village watchmen. The number of schools was 66,
                    with a joint roll of 3560 pupils. The summer heat of Gurgâon reaches a great
                    intensity; no record of temperature, however, exists. The average annual
                    rainfall for the eight years ending 1873-4 was 23‘52 inches. The district
                    contained 4 charitable dispensaries, affording relief (1875) to 18,034
                    persons.</p>
