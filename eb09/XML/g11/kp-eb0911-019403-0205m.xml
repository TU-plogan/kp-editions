                    him famous. He had commenced writing early, and had produced on the stage at St
                    Petersburg in 1816 a comedy in verse, translated from the Freuch, called <hi
                    rend="italic">The Young Spouses,</hi> which was followed by some other pieces of
                    the same kind. But neither these, nor the essays and verses which he wrote for
                    periodicals, would have been long remembered, but for the immense success gained
                    by his comedy in verse, <hi rend="italic">Gore ot uma,</hi> or “Misfortune from
                    Intelligence.” A satire upon Russian society, or, as a high official styled it,
                    “A pasquinade on Moscow,” its plot is slight, its merits consisting in its
                    accurate representation of certain social and official types,—such as Famousoff,
                    the lover of old abuses, the hater of reforms; his secretary, Molchanin, servile
                    fawner upon all in office; the aristocratic young liberal and Anglomaniac,
                    Repetiloff; contrasted with whom is the hero of the piece, Tchatsky, the
                    ironical satirist, just returned from the west of Europe, who exposes and
                    ridicules the weaknesses of the rest, his words echoing that outcry of the young
                    generation of 1820 which reached its climax in the military insurrection of
                    1825, and was then sternly silenced by Nicholas. Griboyedoff spent the summer of
                    1823 in Russia, completed his play, and took it to St Petersburg. There it was
                    rejected by the censorship. Many copies were made and privately circulated, but
                    Griboyedoff never saw it published. The first edition was printed in 1833, four
                    years after his death. Only once did he see it on the stage, when it was acted
                    by the officers of the garrison at Erivan. Soured by disappointment he returned
                    to Georgia, made himself useful by his linguistic knowledge to his relative
                    Count Paskievitch-Erivansky during a campaign against Persia, and was sent to St
                    Petersburg with the treaty of 1828. Brilliantly received there, he thought of
                    devoting himself to literature, and commenced a romantic drama, <hi
                    rend="italic">A Georgian Night.</hi> But he was suddenly sent to Persia as
                    minister-plenipotentiary. Soon after his arrival at Teheran a tumult arose,
                    caused by the anger of the populace against some Georgian and Armenian
                    captives,—Russian subjects,—who had taken refuge in the Russian embassy. It was
                    stormed, Griboyedoff was killed (February 11, 1829), and his body was for three
                    days so ill-treated by the mob that it was at last recognized only by an old
                    scar on the hand, due to a wound received in a duel. It was taken to Tiflis, and
                    buried in the monastery of St David. There a monument was erected to his memory
                    by his widow, to whom he had been but a few months married. But his memory is
                    best preserved by his play <hi rend="italic">Gore ot uma,</hi> which has since
                    his death been repeatedly published and performed, and will always be quoted as
                    one of the masterpieces of Russian literature. An English translation by N.
                    Benardaky appeared in London in 1857.</p>
