                    been made as to the etymology of the name, which is rather obscure,—the least
                    probable being that it is derived from <hi rend="italic">granada,</hi> “a
                    pomegranate,” in allusion to the abundance of pomegranate trees in its
                    neighbourhood. The Moors called it Karnattah or Karnattàh-al-Yahoud, and
                    possibly the name is composed of the Arabic words <hi rend="italic">kurn,</hi>
                    “a hill,” and <hi rend="italic">nattah</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>
                    “stranger” —the “city” or “hill of strangers.” Granada is built <pb break="no"

                    on the slopes of two adjacent hills, at an elevation of about 2300 feet above
                    the sea. The more ancient quarters of the town still retain much of the Moorish
                    style, but the modern part is somewhat commonplace. It contains several squares,
                    of which the most remarkable is the Bibarrambla, where tournaments were formerly
                    held. There is also a beautiful shady walk, called the Alameda, which is one of
                    the most frequented promenades. The old city comprises the faubourgs of
                    Antequeruela, Alcazaba, Alhambra, and Albaicin, the last being named after the
                    settlers who came from Baeza, after the capture of that city by St Ferdinand.
                    For a detailed account of the Alhambra the reader is referred to the special
                    article, vol. i. p. 570. The Antequeruela and Albaicin are mostly inhabited by
                    the working classes. In the cemetery of the latter there are still a few ruins
                    of an ancient mosque. The town proper contains a great number of churches and
                    other public edifices. The cathedral, a somewhat heavy and irregular building,
                    was begun in 1529 by Diego de Siloe, and finished in 1639. It is profusely
                    ornamented with jasper and coloured marble and surmounted by a dome; and it
                    contains several valuable paintings by Alonso Cano, portraits of Ferdinand and
                    Isabella by Rincon, and marble statues of several kings and queens of Spain. In
                    one of its numerous chapels (the Chapel Royal) are buried their “Catholic
                    Majesties,” and Philip and Juana. The church of Nuestra Seil ora de las
                    Angustias has a splendid high altar and fine towers. That of St José is an
                    elegant modern building. Other remarkable edifices are the monastery of St
                    Gerônimo, founded by Gonzalo de Cordova, who is buried there; the Carthusian
                    convent (Cartuja) adorned with paintings by Murillo, Morales, and Cano; the
                    university, founded in 1531 by Charles V.; and the library. Granada is the
                    birthplace of many eminent writers and artists, both Mahometan and Christian;
                    among the latter may be mentioned Fray Luis de Granada (1505); Hurtado de
                    Mendoza (1505), the historian of the war of Granada; Alonso Cano (1601), the
                    great painter; and Moya (1610), who was both painter and sculptor. The climate
                    of the town is pleasant and healthy, especially during the spring and summer
                    months. Its manufactures are unimportant, the chief being coarse woollen stuffs,
                    hats, paper, saltpetre, and gunpowder. Silk-weaving was once extensively carried
                    on, and large quantities of silk were exported to Italy, France, Germany, and
                    even America; but the production now is very limited. The education of the lower
                    classes is much neglected, the city having only a few insignificant schools. In
                    the year 1878 the population amounted to about 75,000.</p>
                <p>The history of Granada does not go back far, if at all, into the Roman perio I
                    (for it is not to be confounded with the ancient Illiberis); and even under the
                    Moors it held a place of very subordinate importance until the period of the
                    conquests of St Ferdinand, when it became the exclusive seat of Islam in Spain,
                    and rose to almost unparalleled splendour, under Mohammed-Eb∏- AIahmar, the
                    builder of the Alhambra. It is said in its best days to have had 400,000
                    inhabitants, 70,000 houses, and 60,000 warriors, but this is probably an
                    exaggeration. In the 15th century it was the last stronghold of the Moors
                    against the Christian forces under Ferdinand and Isabella, and after a long
                    siege it was surrendered by Boabdil on 2d January 1492. From that time Granada’s
                    wealth and magnificence rapidly decreased till 1610, when the Moors were
                    expelled from Spain.</p>
