                    learning, where he prolonged his stay until he had entered his thirtieth year,
                    he enjoyed the society and friendship of Basil, who afterwards became the famous
                    bishop of Caesarea; the prince Julian, destined soon afterwards to play so
                    prominent a part in the world’s history, was also a fellow-student. Shortly
                    after his return to his father’s house at Nazianzus (about the year 360) Gregory
                    received baptism, and renewed his dedication to the service of religion; he
                    still continued, however, for some time, and indeed more or less throughout his
                    whole life, in a state of hesitation as to the form which that service ought to
                    take. Strongly inclined by nature and education to a contemplative life spent
                    among books and in the society of congenial friends, he was yet continually
                    urged by outward circumstances.</p>

                <p>and doubtless also by some inward call, to active pastoral labour. The spirit of
                    refined intellectual monasticism, which clung to him through life and never
                    ceased to struggle for the ascendency, was about that time strongly encouraged
                    by his intercourse with Basil, who was then revelling in the exalted pleasures
                    of his retirement in Pontus; the preparation of the φιλοκαλία, a sort of
                    chrestomathy compiled by the two friends from the writings of Origen, belongs to
                    this period. But the events which were at that time stirring the political and
                    ecclesiastical life of Cappadocia, and indeed of the whole Roman world, made a
                    career of learned leisure difficult if not impossible to a man of Gregory’s
                    position and temperament. The emperor Constantius, having by a course of artful
                    intrigue and intimidation succeeded in thrusting a semi-Arian formula upon the
                    Western bishops assembled at Ariminum in Italy, had next attempted to follow the
                    same course with the Eastern episcopate. The aged bishop of Nazianzus having
                    yielded to the imperial threats, a great storm arose among the monks of the
                    diocese, which was only quelled by the influence of the younger Gregory, who
                    shortly afterwards (about 361) was ordained to the priesthood. After a vain
                    attempt to evade his new duties and responsibilities by flight, he appears to
                    have continued to act as a presbyter in his father’s diocese without
                    interruption for some considerable time; and it is probable that his two <hi
                    rend="italic">Invectives</hi> against Julian are to be assigned to this period.
                    Subsequently (about 372), under a pressure w hich he somewhat resented, he
                    allowed himself to be nominated by Basil as biehop of Sasima, a miserable little
                    village some 32 miles from Tyana; but he seems hardly, if at all, to have
                    assumed the duties of this diocese, for after another interval of “flight” we
                    find him once more (about 372-3) at Nazianzus, assisting his aged father, on
                    whose death (374) he retired to Seleucia in Isauria for a period of some years.
                    Mean while a more important field for his activities was opening up. Towards
                    378-9 the small and depressed remnant of the orthodox party in Constantinople
                    sent him an urgent summons to undertake the task of resuscitating the catholic
                    cause, so long persecuted and borne down by the Arians of the capital. With the
                    accession of Theodosius to the imperial throne, the prospect of success to the
                    Nicene doctrine had dawned, if only it could find some courageous and devoted
                    champion. The fame of Gregory as a learned and eloquent disciple of Origen, and
                    still more of Athanasius, pointed him out as such a defender; nor could he
                    resist the appeal made to him, although he took the step sorely against his
                    will. Once arrived in Constantinople, he laboured so zealously and well that the
                    orthodox party speedily gathered strength; and the small apartment in which they
                    had been accustomed to meet was soon exchanged for a vast and celebrated church
                    which received the significant name of Anastasia, the Church of the
                    Resurrection. Among the hearers of Gregory were to be found, not only churchmen
                    like Jerome and Evagrius, but also heretics and heathens; and it says much for
                    the sound wisdom and practical tact of the preacher that from the outset he set
                    himself less to build up and defend a doctrinal position than to urge his flock
                    to the cultivation of the loving Christian spirit which cherishes higher aims
                    than mere heresy hunting or endless disputation. Doctrinal, nevertheless, he
                    was, as is abundantly shown by the famous five discourses on the Trinity, which
                    earned for him the distinctive appellation of θεολόγο? (0eoλoγiα being here used
                    in the stricter sense to designate the doctrine of Christ’s divinity, as
                    distinguished from οικονομία, which denotes the doctrine of His incarnation). He
                    continued to labour in the Eastern capital till the arrival of Theodosius, and
                    the visible triumph of the orthodox cause; the metropolitan see was then
                    conferred upon him, and after the assembling of the second oecumenical council
                    in 381 he received consecration from Meletius. In consequence, however, of a
                    spirit of discord and envy which had manifested itself in connexion with this
                    promotion, he soon afterwards, in an oration, not without some bitterness of
                    tone, resigned his dignity, and withdrew into comparative retirement. The rest
                    of his days were spent partly at Nazianzus, where he appears still to have mixed
                    himself in ecclesiastical affairs, and partly on his patrimonial estate at
                    Arianzus, where he devoted himself to his favourite literary pursuits, and
                    especially to poetical composition, until his death, which occurred in 389 or
                    390. His festival is celebrated in the Eastern Church on January 25th and 30th,
                    in the Western on 9th May (duplex).</p>
                <p>His extant works consist of poems, epistles, and orations. The poems, which
                    include epigrams, elegies, and an autobiographical sketch, have been frequently
                    printed, the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> being the Aldine (1504).
                    Other editions are those of Tollius (1696) and Muratori (1709); a volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">Carmina Selecta</hi> also has been edited by Dronke (1840). The
                    tragedy entitled <hi rend="italic">χριστbs τraσχων</hi> usually included is
                    certainly not genuine. Of Gregory’s poetry there is not much to be said. His
                    best energies were not devoted to it; it was adopted in his later years as a
                    recreation rather than as a serious pursuit; thus it is occasionally delicate,
                    graphic, beautiful, as could not fail to be the case with a writer of his
                    culture and power, but it is not sustained. Of the hymns none have passed into
                    ecclesiastical use. The letters are entitled to a higher place in literature.
                    They are always easy and natural; and there is nothing forced in the manner in
                    which their acute, witty, and profound sayings are introduced. As an orator he
                    is held to have surpassed all his contemporaries “in the purity of his words,
                    the nobleness of his expressions, the ornaments of his discourse, the variety of
                    his figures, the justness of his comparisons, the beauty of his reasonings, and
                    the sublimity of his thoughts.” Thus, though possessed neither of Basil’s gift
                    of government nor of Gregory of Nyssa’s power of speculative thought, he
                    worthily takes a place in that triumvirate of Cappadocians whom the Catholic
                    Church gratefully recognizes as having been, during the critical struggles in
                    the latter half of the 4th century, the best defenders of its faith. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Opera Omnia</hi> were first published by Hervagius (Basel, 1550);
                    the subsequent editions have been those of Billius (Paris, 1609, 1611; aucta ex
                    interpretatione Morelli, 1630), of the Benedictines (begun in 1778, but
                    interrupted by the French Revolution and not completed until 1840, Caillau being
                    the final editor), and of Migne.</p>
                <p>Scattered notices of the life of Gregory Nazianzen are to be found in the writ
                    ings of Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, and Rufinus, as well as in his own letters
                    and poems. The data derived from these sources do not always harmonize with the
                    account of Suidas. The earlier modern authorities, such as Tillemont <hi

                    >(Bib.</hi><hi rend="italic">Unir.,</hi> t xviii.) have been made use of by
                    Gibbon in his brief but able sketch of this father. Among recent monographs may
