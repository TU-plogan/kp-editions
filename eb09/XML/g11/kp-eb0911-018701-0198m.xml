                    the college of St Denis, where his father, a poor musician, occasionally acted
                    as violinist. Leclerc and Renekin were his early masters. But of greater
                    importance was the practical tuition he received by attending the performance of
                    an Italian opera company. Here he heard the operas of Galuppi, Pergolesi, and
                    other masters; and the desire of completing his own studies in Italy was the
                    immediate result. To find the necessary <pb break="no"

                    dedicated to the canons of the Liége cathedral, who in return sent him to the
                    Collège de Liége at Rome, founded by a citizen of Liège for the benefit of his
                    townsmen studying in Rome. Here Grétry resided for five years, studiously
                    employed in completing his musical education under Casali. His proficiency in
                    harmony and counterpoint was, however, according to his own confession, at all
                    times very moderate. Neither was any deep scholarship required for the style of
                    composition to which he soon exclusively devoted himself. His first great
                    success was achieved by an Italian intermezzo or operetta, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">vendemiatrici,</hi> composed for the Aliberti theatre
                    in Rome, and received with universal applause. It is said that the study of the
                    score of one of Monsigny’s operas, lent to him by a secretary of the French
                    embassy in Rome, decided Grétry to devote himself to French comic opera. On
                    New-Year’s Day 1767 he accordingly left Rome, and after a short stay at Geneva
                    (where he made the acquaintance of Voltaire, and produced another operetta) went
                    to Paris. There for two years he had to contend with the difficulties incident
                    to poverty and obscurity. He was, however, not without friends, and by the
                    intercession of one of these, Count Creutz, the Swedish ambassador, Grétry
                    obtained a libretto from the celebrated Marmontel, which he set to music in less
                    than six weeks, and which, on its performance in August 1768, met with
                    unparalleled success. The name of the opera was <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Huron.</hi> Two others, <hi rend="italic">Lucile</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Tableau</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Parlant,</hi> soon followed, and thenceforth Grétry’s position as the leading
                    composer of comic opera was safely established. Of the fifty operas which embody
                    his musical activity only two or three have survived, and perhaps as many more
                    are worth remembering. His masterpieces are <hi rend="italic">Zemire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Azor</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Richard</hi><hi rend="italic">Coeur</hi><hi rend="italic">de Lion,—</hi> the
                    first produced in 1771, the second in 1784. The latter in an indirect way became
                    connected with a great historic event. In it occurs the celebrated romance, <hi
                    rend="italic">0 Richard,</hi><hi rend="italic">ô</hi><hi rend="italic">mon roi,
                    Vumνsrs f</hi><hi rend="italic">abandonne,</hi> which was sung at the
                    banquet—“fatal as that of Thyestes,” remarks Carlyle—given by the bodyguard to
                    the officers of the Versailles garrison on October 3, 1789. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> not long afterwards became the reply of the
                    people to the expression of loyalty borrowed from Grétry’s opera. The composer
                    himself was not uninfluenced by the great events he witnessed, and the titles of
                    some of his operas, such as <hi rend="italic">La Rosière Républicaine</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">La Fete de la Raison</hi> sufficiently indicate the epoch to
                    which they belong; but they are mere <hi rend="italic">pièces de
                    circonstance,</hi> and the republican enthusiasm displayed is not genuine.
                    Little more successful was Grétry in his dealings with classical subjects, and
                    none of his operas belonging to that class are worth remembering. His genuine
                    power lies in the delineation of character, and in the expression of tender and
                    typically French sentiment. For the first-named purpose the careful and truly
                    admirable fidelity with which his music is wedded to the words is invaluable. In
                    this respect Grétry’s works are indeed representative of French operatic music
                    at its best. The structure of his concerted pieces on the other hand is
                    frequently flimsy, and his instrumentation so feeble that the orchestral parts
                    of some of his works had to be rewritten by other composers, in order to make
                    them acceptable to modern audiences. Of his deficiencies of harmonization Grétry
                    himself was well aware, and his confessions in this respect are strangely at
                    variance with the self-sufficient tone which pervades his literary effusions on
                    musical and even on political and social topics. During the Revolution Grétry
                    lost much of his property, but the successive Governments of France vied in
                    favouring the composer, regardless of political differences. From the old court
                    he received distinctions and rewards of all kinds; the republic made him an
                    inspector of the Conservatoire; Napoleon granted him the cross of the legion of
                    honour and a pension. Grétry died September 24, 1813, at the Hermitage in
                    Montmorency, formerly the house of Rousseau. Fifteen years later his heart was
                    transferred to his birthplace, permission having been obtained after a tedious
                    lawsuit. In 1842 Grétry’s colossal statue in bronze was inaugurated at
                    Liege.</p>
