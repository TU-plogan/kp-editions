                    embittered by his father’s opposition, who wished him to become a minister of
                    the Established Church. His own views, however, prevailed, and he worked for two
                    years in the laboratory of Dr Hope of Edinburgh before returning to Glasgow,
                    where he taught mathematics, and subsequently chemistry, until the year 1829,
                    when he was appointed lecturer in the Mechanics’ Institute. In 1830 he succeeded
                    Dr Ure as professor of chemistry in the Andersonian Institution, and, on the
                    death of Dr Edward Turner, he was transferred to the chair of chemistry in
                    University College, London. He presided over the chemical section of the British
                    Association at the Birmingham meeting in 1839, and in 1841 was chosen as the
                    first president of the Chemical Society of London. He resigned his professorship
                    on being appointed to succeed Sir John Herschel as Master of the Mint, a post he
                    held until his death in September 1869. This appointment was doubtless offered
                    to him by Government in recognition of his scientific services, but the onerous
                    duties of the important office severely tried his energies; and it is
                    unfortunate that, in quitting a purely scientific career, he should have been
                    subjected to the cares of official life for which he was by temperament
                    singularly unfit. The researches, however, which he conducted between 1861 and
                    1869 were as brilliant as any of those in which he engaged. Graham was elected a
                    fellow of the Royal Society in 1837, a corresponding member of the Institute of
                    France in 1847, and doctor of civil law in 1855. The presidency of the Royal
                    Society was offered him towards the close of his life, but his failing health
                    caused him to shrink from accepting the honour.</p>
                <p>The persistency with which he traced and developed the laws of atomic motion was
                    remarkable. It is interesting therefore to remember that his future work must
                    have been indicated in no small measure by the researches of the illustrious
                    Black, who, at the beginning of the century, rejected the definitions of
                    chemistry proposed by Stahl, Boerhaave, and Fourcroy, and lectured “on the
                    effects produced by heat and mixture in all bodies or mixtures of bodies natural
                    or artificial.” Graham communicated papers to the Philosophical Society of
                    Glasgow before the work of that society was recorded in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions,</hi> but his first published paper, “On the Absorption of Gases
                    <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> by Liquids,” appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annals of Philosophy</hi> for 1826, and is of special iuterest, as in it he
                    speaks of the liquefaction of gases in much the same terms as those employed in
                    the last paper he wrote. The subject with which his name will always be most
                    prominently associated is the molecular mobility of gases. Priestley observed in
                    1799 that hydrogen escaped from a fissured glass jar in exchange for external
                    air which “had nothing inflammable in it,” and Dalton proved in 1806 that gases
                    confined in glass phials, connected by glass tubes, intermix even against the
                    action of gravity. Graham in his first paper on this subject (1829) thus
                    summarizes the knowledge experiment had afforded as to the laws which regulate
                    the movement of gases. “Fruitful as the miscibility of gases has been in
                    interesting speculations, the experimental information we possess on the subject
                    amount? to little more than the well-established fact that gases of a different
                    nature, when brought into contact, do not arrange themselves according to their
                    density, but they spontaneously diffuse <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n42/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0042-0033"/> through each other so as to remain in an intimate
                    state of mixture for any length of time.” For the fissured jar of Priestley and
                    Döbereiner he substituted a glass tube closed by a plug of plaster of Paris, and
                    with this simple appliance he developed his now well-known law “that the
                    diffusion rate of gases is inversely as the square root of their density.”</p>
                <p>With regard to the special importance of Graham’s law to the chemist and
                    physicist, it may be sufficient to point out that a great number of chemical as
                    well as physical facts are co-ordinated by the assumption that all substances in
                    the state of gas have the same molecular volume or contain the same number of
                    molecules in a given space (Avogadro’s law); and, in the second place, it has
                    become evident that the phenomena of heat are simply the manifestations of
                    molecular motion. According to this view the absolute temperature of a gas is
                    proportional to the <hi rend="italic">vis viva</hi> of its molecules; and since
                    all molecules at a given temperature have the same <hi rend="italic">vis
                    viva,</hi> it follows that the molecules must move with velocities which are
                    inversely proportional to the square roots of the molecular weights. Moreover,
                    since the molecular volumes are equal, and the molecular weights are therefore
                    proportional to the densities of the aeriform bodies in which the molecules are
                    active units, it also follows that the average velocities of the molecules in
                    any two gases are inversely proportional to the square roots of their respective
                    densities. Thus the simple numerical relations first observed in the phenomena
                    of diffusion are the direct result of molecular motion, and it is now seen that
                    Graham’s empirical law is included under the fundamental law of motion.</p>
                <p>Graham also studied the passage of gases by transpiration through fine tubes, and
                    by effusion through a minute hole in a platinum disc, and was enabled to show
                    that gas may enter a vacuum in three different ways: (1) by the molecular
                    movement of diffusion, in virtue of which a gas penetrates through the pores of
                    a disc of compressed graphite; (2) by effusion through an orifice of sensible
                    dimensions in a platinum disc (the relative times of the effusion of gases in
                    mass being similar to those of the molecular diffusion, although a gas is
                    usually carried by the former kind of impulse with a velocity many thousand
                    times as great as is demonstrable by the litter); and (3) by the peculiar rate
                    of passage due to transpiration through fine tubes, in which the ratios appear
                    to be in direct relation with no other known property of the same gases,—thus
                    hydrogen has exactly double the transpiration rate of nitrogen, the relation of
                    those gases as to density being as 1: 14,</p>
                <p>He subsequently examined the passage of gases through septa or partitions of
                    india-rubber, and plates of noncrystalline metals such as palladium, and proved
                    that gases pass through these septa neither by diffusion, effusion, nor
                    transpiration, but in virtue of a selective absorption which the septa appear to
                    exert on the gases in contact with them. By this means he was enabled partially
                    to separate oxygen from air, and to calculate the density of metallic-hydrogen
                    from the remarkable expansion which attends the absorption of hydrogen by
                    palladium, The experiments led him to believe that palladium with its occluded
                    hydrogen was an alloy, a view that has been greatly strengthened by the recent
                    experiments of MM. Cailletet and Pictet.</p>
                <p>His early work on the movements of gases led him to examine the spontaneous
                    movements of liquids, and as a result of the experiments he divided bodies into
                    two classes,—crystalloids, such as common salt, and colloids, of which
                    gum-arabic is a type,—the former having high and the latter low diffusibüity. He
                    also proved, by a series of beautiful experiments, that the process of liquid
                    diffusion actually causes partial decomposition of certain chemical compounds,
                    the sulphate of potash, for instance, being separated ιrom tne sulphate ot
                    alumina in alum by the higher diffusibility of the former salt.</p>
                <p>He also extended his work on the transpiration of gases to liquids, adopting the
                    method of manipulation devised by Poiseuille. He found that dilution with water
                    does not effect proportionate alteration in the transpiration velocities of
                    different liquids, and a certain determinable degree of dilution retards the
                    transpiration velocity. Thus in the case of alcohol the greatest retardation is
                    with six equivalents of water, nitric acid with three, and acetone with as much
                    as twelve equivalents.</p>
                <p>It is only possible here to indicate the prominent features of Graham’s more
                    purely chemical labours. In 1833 he showed that the various compounds of
                    phosphoric acid and water constitute distinct salts, in each of which the
                    hydrogen may be displaced by other metals. He was the first, therefore, to
                    establish the existence of polybasic compounds, in each of which one or more
                    equivalents of hydrogen are replaceable by certain metals, and he further showed
                    that by heating biphosphate of soda a metaphosphate is formed, and from this he
                    obtained a corresponding hydrated acid. In 1824 he demonstrated that the
                    spontaneous inflammability of one variety of phosphuretted hydrogen is due to
                    its admixture with a very small proportion of an oxide of nitrogen, probably
                    nitrous acid. In 1835 he published the results of an examination of the
                    properties of water as a constituent of salts. Not the least interesting part of
                    this inquiry was the discovery of certain definite salts with alcohol analogous
                    to hydrates, to which the name of alcoholates was given. A brief paper entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Speculative Ideas on the Constitution of Matter</hi> deserves
                    notice as possessing special interest in connexion with work done since Graham’s
                    death. In it he expressed the view that the various kinds of matter now
                    recognized as different elementary substances may possess one and the same
                    ultimate or atomic molecule in different conditions of movement.</p>
                <p>Graham’s work, viewed as a whole, is remarkable alike for its originality and for
                    the singular simplicity of the methods employed in obtaining most important
                    results.</p>
