                    dramatist and miscellaneous writer, was born at Norwich about the year 1560. As
                    an eastern counties man (to one of whose plays, <hi rend="italic">Friar
                    Bacon,</hi> the Norfolk and Suffolk borderland owes a lasting poetic
                    commemoration) he naturally received his education at Cambridge, where he took
                    his B.A. from St John’s College in 1578, proceeding M. A. in 1583 from Clare
                    Hall, where it is possible that he had expectations of a fellowship. In 1588 he
                    was incorporated at Oxford, so that on some of his title-pages he styles himself
                    “utriusque Academiae in Artibus Magister,” and Nash humorously refers to him as
                    “utriusque Academiae Robertus Greene.” Between the years 1578 and 1583 he had
                    travelled abroad, according to his own account very extensively, visiting
                    France, Germany, Poland, and Denmark, and learning at first hand to “hate the
                    pride of Italie” and to know the taste of that poet’s fruit, “Spanish
                    mirabolanes.” Whether on his return he took holy orders, the evidence on the
                    subject is insufficient to determine; according to the title-page of a pamphlet
                    published by him in 1585 he was then a “student in phisicke.” Already, however,
                    after taking his M.A. degree, he had according to his own account begun his
                    London life, and engaged in pursuits more congenial to his tastes. He became “an
                    author of playes and a penner of love-pamphlets, so that I soone grew famous in
                    that qualitie, that who for that trade growne so ordinary about London as Robin
                    Greene ?” He rapidly sank into the worst debaucheries of the town, though not
                    without being inspired by a passing impulse towards a better life, and derided
                    in consequence by his associates as a “Puritane and Presizian.” His marriage,
                    which soon after this took place, failed to steady him; if Francesco, in
                    Greene’s pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Never too late,</hi> is intended for the
                    author himself, it had been a runaway match; but the fiction and the
                    autobiographical sketch in the <hi rend="italic">Repentance</hi> agree in their
                    account of the unfaithfulness which followed on the part of the husband. He
                    lived with his wife for a while; “but forasmuch as she would perswade me from my
                    wilfull wicked-nes<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0175-0164"/>, after I had a child by her, I cast her off,
                    having spent up the marriage-money which I obtained by her. Then left I her at
                    six or seven, who went into Lincolnshire, and I to London,” where his reputation
                    as a playwright and writer of pamphlets “of love and vaine fantasyes” continued
                    to increase, and where his life was a feverish alternation of labour and
                    debauchery. He tells us how in the end he was friendless “except it were in a
                    fewe alehouses,” where he was respected on account of the score he had run up.
                    When the end came he was a dependant on the charity of the poor and the pitying
                    love of the unfortunate. Henri Murger has drawn no picture more sickening and
                    more pitiful than the story of Greene’s death, as told by his Puritan adversary,
                    Gabriel Harvey—a veracious though not an unprejudiced narrator. (Greene had
                    stung his vanity by an allusion to his paternal origin in the prose-tract of <hi
                    rend="italic">A Quip for an Upstart Courtier.)</hi> After a banquet where the
                    chief guest had been the dramatist Nash,—an old associate and perhaps a college
                    friend of Greene’s, any great intimacy with whom, however, he seems to have been
                    anxious to disclaim,—Greene had fallen sick “of a surfeit of pickle herringe and
                    Rennish wine.” At the house of a poor shoemaker near Dowgate, deserted by all
                    except his compassionate hosts and two women,—one of them the mother of his
                    illegitimate son, Fortunatus Greene,—he died, September 2, 1592. Shortly before
                    his death, he wrote under a bond for ten pounds which he had given to the good
                    shoemaker, the following words addressed to his long-forsaken wife :—“Doll, I
                    charge thee, by the loue of our youth and by my soûles rest, that thou wilte see
                    this man paide; for if hee and his wife had not succoured me, I had died in the
                    streetes.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert Greene.”</hi></p>
                <p>Shortly after Greene’s death the dramatist Henry Chettle published a pamphlet
                    from the hand of the unhappy man, entitled <hi rend="italic">Greene’s
                    Groat’s-ιvorth of Wit bought with a Million of Repentance.</hi> This ill-starred
                    production may almost be said to have done more to excite the resentment of
                    posterity against Greene’s name than all the errors for which he so unctuously
                    professed his (doubtless sincere) repentance. For in it he chose to point the
                    fact of his own conversion by exhorting three of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >quondam</hi> acquaintance to go and do likewise. Of these three Marlowe was
                    one—to whom and to whose creation of “that Atheist Tamber-laine” (perhaps to
                    both author and hero under the name of the latter) he had repeatedly alluded or
                    referred in previous pamphlets. The second was Peele, the third probably Nash.
                    But the passage addressed to Peele contained a transparent allusion to a fourth
                    dramatist, who was an actor likewise, and of whom Greene accordingly thought
                    himself entitled to speak with insolent arrogance as of “an vpstart crow
                    beautified with our feathers, that with his <hi rend="italic">Tygres heart
                    IVrapt in a player's hyde</hi> supposes hee is as well able to bombast out a
                    blanke-verse as the best of you; and being an absolute Iohannes-fac-totum, is in
                    his owne conceyt the onely shake-scene in a countrey.” The phrase italicized
                    parodies a passage occurring in <hi rend="italic">The True Tragedie of Richard,
                    Duke of Yorke,</hi> &amp;c., and retained in Part III. of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Henry</hi><hi rend="italic">VI.</hi> If Greene (as many eminent critics have
                    thought) had a hand in <hi rend="italic">The True</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tragédie,</hi> he must here have intended a charge of plagiarism against
                    Shakespeare. But it seems more probable that, while (as Mr R. Simpson suggested)
                    the upstart crow beautified with the feathers of the three dramatists is a
                    sneering description of the actor who declaimed their verse, the <hi
                    rend="italic">animus</hi> of the whole attack (as Dr Ingleby explains it) is
                    revealed in its concluding phrases. This “shake-scene,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> this <hi rend="italic">actor,</hi> had ventured to intrude upon the
                    domain of the regular staff of play-wrights—their monopoly was in danger!</p>
                <p>Altogether not less than thirty-five prose-tracts are ascribed to Greene’s
                    prolific pen.. To these, which are by no means all of a personal or even
                    controversial character, he owed in his lifetime a great part of his celebrity.
                    Nearly all of them are interspersed with verses; in their themes they range from
                    the “misticall” wonders of the heavens to the familiar but “pernitious sleights”
                    of the sharpers of London. But the most widely attractive of his prose
                    publications were no doubt those to which he more especially refers under the
                    designation of “love-pamphlets,” and which, as he tells us, brought upon him the
                    outcry of Puritan censors. In these popular productions he appears very
                    distinctly as a follower of the fashionable euphuistic style, indeed two of them
                    are by their titles announced as a kind of sequel to the mother romance. But
                    though Greene’s style shows the same balanced oscillation to and fro, and his
                    diction the same elaborate ornateness, as those of Lyly, he contrives to
                    interest by the matter as well as to attract attention by the manner of his
                    narratives. It is known that on his <hi rend="italic">Pandosto, the Triumph of
                    Time</hi> (1p88) Shakespeare founded his <hi rend="italic">A Winter’s
                    Tale·,</hi> in fact, the novel contains the entire plot of the comedy, though
                    some of the subordinate characters in the latter (including the immortal
                    Autolycus) were added by Shakespeare.</p>
                <p>In Greene’s <hi rend="italic">Never too late,</hi> announced in its author’s
                    unctuous variety of the euphuistic manner as a “Powder of Experience: sent to
                    all youthfull gentlemen” for their benefit, the hero of the Palmer’s story is in
                    all probability intended for Greene himself; and this episodical narrative has a
                    vivacity and truthfulness of manner which savour of an 18th century novel rather
                    than of an Elizabethan tale concerning the days of “Palmerin, King of Great
                    Britaine.” The experiences of the Roberto of <hi rend="italic">Greene’s
                    Groat’s-worth of Wit</hi> are even more palpably the experiences of the author
                    himself, though they are possibly overdrawn—for a born rhetorician exaggerates
                    everything, even his own sins. Much that might be enlarged upon in Greene’s
                    manner as a writer of prose fiction shows how already in the Elizabethan age
                    there was a possibility of the English novel anticipating what proved the slow
                    course of its actual development.</p>
                <p>For us, however, Greene’s name lives chiefly if not solely as that of a
                    dramatist. Only four plays remain to us of which he was indisputably the sole
                    author. The earliest of these seems to be <hi rend="italic">The History of
                    Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic">Fumoso,</hi><hi rend="italic">one of the Twelve
                    Peeres of France—</hi> which has (on unsatisfactory evidence) been dated as
                    before 1586, and is known to have been acted on February 21, 1592. It is a free
                    dramatic adaptation of Ariosto (who in one passage is textually quoted), and
                    contains a large variety of characters and a superabundance of action. Fairly
                    lucid in arrangement and fluent in style, it lacks in the treatment of its main
                    situation—the madness of Orlando—the tragic power to which in truth its author
                    was a stranger. Greene’s <hi rend="italic">Orlando</hi> has been described as “a
                    stepping stone to <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hamletf</hi>
                    but its priority to Kyd’s <hi rend="italic">Spanish Tragedy</hi> (to which the
                    author of this observation likewise refers) is not proved. Very few dramatists
                    between Sophocles and Shakespeare have succeeded in subordinating the grotesque
                    effect of madness to the tragic; and Greene (the close of whose play is tameness
                    itself) is not among the number.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Comical History of Alphonsus, King of Arragon,</hi>
                    Henslowe’s <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi> contains no trace. But it can hardly
                    have been first acted long after the production of Marlowe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tamburlaine,</hi> which had been brought on the stage at least three years
                    before. For this play—which is oddly enough called “comical,” though it contains
                    not a single comic character, and is surely unintentionally humorous in the
                    effect of some of its passages—was manifestly written in emulation of Marlowe’s
                    tragedy. While Greene cannot have thought himself capable of surpassing Marlowe
                    as a <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n176/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0176-0165"/> tragic poet, he very probably, wished to outdo
                    him in “business,” and to equal him in the rant which, since there has been an
                    English theatre, has been sure to bring down at least part of the house. <hi
                    rend="italic">Alphonsus</hi> is accordingly not less sensational than <hi
                    rend="italic">Tamburlaine,</hi> and supplied its share of quotations to ancient
                    Pistol. It is a <hi rend="italic">history</hi> proper,—a dramatized chronicle or
                    narrative of warlike events,—and a very effective one of its kind. Its fame
                    could never equal that of Marlowe’s tragedy; but its composition showed that
                    Greene could seek to rival the most popular drama of the day, without falling
                    very far short of his model.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Honourable History of Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</hi>
                    (not known to have been acted before February 1592, but very possibly written by
                    1588) Greene once more attempted to emulate Marlowe; but on this occasion, while
                    'producing something very different from the play with which he placed his own
                    in competition, he succeeded in producing a masterpiece of his own. Marlowe’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Doctor Faustus,</hi> which there is every reason to believe
                    suggested the composition of Greene’s comedy, is a work which, even in the form
                    in which it has come down to us, reveals the mighty tragic genius of its author;
                    and it was fortunate for Greene’s fame that he resolved on an altogether
                    distinct •treatment of a cognate theme. Interweaving with the popular tale of
                    Friar Bacon and his wondrous doings a charming idyl (so far as we know, of his
                    own invention), the story of Prince Edward (L) ’ s love for the Fair Maid of
                    Fressingfield, he produced a comedy brimful of amusing action and genial fun,
                    and at the same time containing a dramatic love-story of unsurpassed freshness
                    and brightness. <hi rend="italic">Filar Bacon</hi> remains a dramatic picture of
                    English life with which <hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives</hi> alone can vie;
                    and not even the ultra-classicism in the similes of its diction can destroy the
                    naturalness which constitutes its perennial charm.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">The Scottish</hi><hi rend="italic">Historie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi><hi rend="italic">James</hi><hi rend="italic">IV.</hi> (not
                    printed till 1598, acted by 1592) Greene seems to have reached the climax of his
                    dramatic powers. The “historical” character of this play is pure pretence, so
                    that one wonders how a Tudor dramatist could have dared to invent a fictitious
                    name and unreal experiences (of a painful kind) for King Henry VII.’s daughter.
                    Its theme is the illicit passion of King James for the chaste lady Ida, to
                    obtain whose hand he endeavours, at the suggestion of a villain called Ateukin,
                    to make away with his own wife. She escapes in doublet and hose, attended by her
                    faithful dwarf; but on her father’s -making war upon her husband to avenge her
                    wrongs, she effects a reconciliation between them. Not only is this
                    well-constructed story effectively worked out, but the characters are vigorously
                    drawn, and in Ateukin there is a touch of Iago. The fooling by Slipper, the
                    clown of the piece, is -unexceptionable; and lest even so the play should hang
                    heavy on the audience, its action is carried off by a “pleasant comedie ”— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a prelude and some dances between the acts— “presented
                    by Oboram, King of Fayeries” —the Oberon of <hi rend="italic">A Midsummer
                    Night’s Dream</hi> (probably later in date than Greene’s play).</p>
                <p>It is hard to have to abandon the belief that <hi rend="italic">George-a-Greene
                    the Pinner of Wakefield</hi> (printed 1599), a delightful picture of English
                    life fully worthy of the author of <hi rend="italic">Friar Bungay,</hi> has been
                    rightly attributed to him. Of the comedy of <hi rend="italic">Fair Em,</hi>
                    which resembles <hi rend="italic">Friar Bacon</hi> in more than one point, it is
                    most improbable that Greene was the author The disputed question as to his
                    supposed share in the plays on which the Second and Third Parts of <hi
                    rend="italic">Henry VI.</hi> are founded has been already referred to. He was
                    certainly joint author with Thomas Lodge of the curious drama called <hi
                    rend="italic">A Looking</hi><hi rend="italic">G</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lasse</hi><hi rend="italic">for London and England</hi> (printed 1594)—a
                    dramatic apologue conveying to the living generation of Englishmen the warning
                    of Nineveh’s corruption and prophesied doom. The lesson was frequently repeated
                    in the streets of London by the “Ninevitical motions” of flιe puppets; but there
                    are both fire and wealth of language in Greene and Lodge’s oratory. The comic
                    element is not absent; being supplied in abundance by Adam, the clown of the
                    piece, who belongs to the family of Slipper and of Friar Bacon’s servant,
                    Miles.</p>
                <p>Greene’s dramatic genius has nothing in it of the intensity of Marlowe’s tragic
                    muse; nor perhaps are there any passages in his poetry equalling certain of
                    Peele’s when at his best. On the other hand, of none of Shakespeare’s
                    predecessors or contemporaries can it be said, as of Greene, that his dramatic
                    poetry is occasionally animated with the breezy freshness which no artifice can
                    simulate, but which nothing but obtuseness can mistake. He can construct neatly
                    and with facility, though of course belonging to a period of our dramatic
                    literature when the art of construction was still in its infancy. He has created
                    no character of commanding power—unless Ateukin be excepted; but his personages
                    are living men and women, and marked out from one another with a vigorous but
                    far from rude hand. His comic humour is undeniable, and he unites a spirit of
                    true farcical fun with a capacity for light and graceful dialogue. His diction
                    is overloaded with classical ornament; but even this he frequently employs with
                    pleasing aptness. His versification is easy and fluent; and its cadence is at
                    times singularly sweet. He creates his best effects, like a true artist, by the
                    simplest means; and he is indisputably one of the most gifted and one of the
                    most pleasing among our early dramatic authors.</p>
                <p>The best account of Greene and his writings (including a list of all his prose
                    tracts) is that by the late Mr Dyce, prefixed to his edition of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Dramatic and Poetical Works of Robert Greene,</hi> 1 vol.,
                    1861; the 2 vol. edition was published in 1831. It contains copious extracts
                    from <hi rend="italic">Pandosto,</hi> and from other prose-wri tings by Greene.
                    <hi rend="italic">Greene's Groat s-worth of Wit</hi> is printed in part i. of Dr
                    Ingleby s <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare Allusion-Books {New Shakespeare
                    Society’s Publications,</hi> 1874). Dr Ingleby’s general introduction, and a
                    supplement by the late Mr Richard Simpson, as well as the observations in Mr
                    Simpson’s <hi rend="italic">School of Shakespeare,</hi> will be of great value
                    to readers of Greene. W. Bernhardi’s <hi rend="italic">Robert Greene's</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Leben und Schriften</hi> (Leipsic, 1874) is an essay full of
                    useful research; and Prof. J. Μ. Brown of Christchurch, New Zealand, has
                    contributed a spirited, but at the same time judicious, criticism of Greene to
                    the <hi rend="italic">New Zealand Magazine</hi> for April 1877. A Russian
                    monograph on him by N. I. Storozhenko (Moscow, 1878) is described as perhaps the
                    fullest hitherto published. <hi rend="italic">Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</hi>
                    has been edited, together with Marlowe’s <hi rend="italic">Doctor Faustus,</hi>
                    for the Oxford Clarendon Press (1878). (A. W. W.)</p>
