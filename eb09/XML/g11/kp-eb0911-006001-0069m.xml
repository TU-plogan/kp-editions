                    classificatory views. They are especially remarkable for their saltatory powers,
                    due to the great development of the hind legs, which are much longer than the
                    others and have stout and powerful thighs, and also for their stridulation,
                    which is not always an attribute with them of the male only. The distinctions
                    between the two families may be briefly stated as follows the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Locustidae</hi> have very long thread-like antennae, and four-jointed tarsi;
                    the <hi rend="italic">Acrydiidae</hi> have short stout antennae, and
                    three-jointed tarsi. As the term “grasshopper” is almost synonymous with <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Locust,</hi> the subject will be more extensively treated under
                    the latter heading (7. v.). Under both “grasshopper” and “locust” are included
                    members of both families above-noticed, but the majority belong to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Acrydiidae</hi> in both cases. In Britain the term is chiefly
                    applicable to the large green grasshopper <hi rend="italic">{Locusta
                    viridissima)</hi> common in most parts of the south of England, and to smaller
                    and more obscure species of the genera <hi rend="italic">Stenobotkrus,
                    Gomphocerus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tettix,</hi> the latter remarkable for
                    the great extension of the pronotum, which often reaches beyond the extremity of
                    the body. All are vegetable feeders, and, as in all orthopterous insects, have
                    an incomplete metamorphosis, so that their destructive powers are continuous
                    from the moment of emergence from the egg till death. The notorious migratory
                    locust <hi rend="italic">{Pachytylus migratorrus)</hi> may be considered only an
                    exaggerated grasshopper, and the too-famous Rocky Mountain locust <hi
                    rend="italic">{Caloptenus</hi><hi rend="italic">spretus)</hi> is still more
                    entitled to the name. In Britain the species are not of sufficient size, nor of
                    sufficient numerical importance, to do any great damage, and their cheerful
                    “song” more than counteracts the slight mischief they may cause in devouring
                    grasses and other plants. The colours of many of them assimilate greatly to
                    those of their habitats; the green of the <hi rend="italic">Locusta
                    viridissima</hi> is wonderfully similar to that of the herbage amongst which it
                    lives, and those species that frequent more arid spots are protected in the same
                    manner. Yet many species have brilliantly coloured under-wings (though scarcely
                    so in English forms), and during flight are almost as conspicuous as
                    butterflies; but when settled it is nearly impossible to detect them, even
                    although the spot where they dropped may have been carefully marked; and they
                    rise again almost under the feet of the observer. Those that belong to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Acrydiidae</hi> mostly lay their eggs in more or less cylindrical
                    masses, surrounded by a glutinous secretion, in the ground. Some of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Locustidae</hi> also lay their eggs in the ground, but others
                    deposit them in fissures in trees and low plants, in which the female is aided
                    by a long flattened ovipositor, or process at the extremity of the abdomen,
                    whereas in the <hi rend="italic">Acrydiidae</hi> there is only an apparatus of
                    valves. The stridulation or “song” is mainly produced by friction of the hind
                    legs against portions of the wings or wingcovers; but variation exists in the
                    exact method. To a practised ear it is perhaps possible to distinguish the
                    “song” of even closely allied species, and some are said to produce a sound
                    differing by day and night. The British species are not numerous; tut in some
                    parts of the world (and even in Europe) their numbers are very great, both in
                    species and individuals.</p>
