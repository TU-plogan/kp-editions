                    dropping of a morbid material from the blood within the joints. The disease was
                    known and described by the ancient Greek physicians under various terms, which,
                    however, appear to have been applied by them alike to rheumatism and gout. The
                    general term <hi rend="italic">arthritis (fρθροv,</hi> a joint) was employed
                    when many joints were the seat of inflammation; while in those instances where
                    the disease was limited to one part the terms used bore reference to such
                    locality; hence <hi rend="italic">podagra</hi><hi rend="italic">(ποδάγρα,</hi>
                    from <hi rend="italic">ποvς,</hi> the foot, and <hi rend="italic">άγρα,</hi> a
                    seizure), <hi rend="italic">chiragra</hi><hi rend="italic">(χelp,</hi> the
                    hand), <hi rend="italic">gonαgra (γ6w,</hi> the knee), &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Hippocrates in his <hi rend="italic">Aphorisms</hi> speaks of gout as occurring
                    most commonly in spring and autumn, and mentions the fact that women are less
                    liable to it than men. He also gives directions as to treatment. Celsus gives a
                    similar account of the disease. Galen regarded gout as an unnatural accumulation
                    of humours in a part, and the chalk-stones as the concretions of these, and he
                    attributed the disease to over-indulgence and luxury. Gout is alluded to in the
                    works of Ovid and Pliny, and Seneca in his 95th epistle mentions the prevalence
                    of gout among the Roman ladies of his day as one of the results of their
                    high-living and debauchery. Lucian in his <hi rend="italic">Tragopodagra</hi>
                    gives an amusing account of the remedies employed for the cure of gout.</p>
                <p>In all times this disease has engaged a large share of the attention of
                    physicians, from its wide prevalence, and from the amount of suffering which it
                    entails. Sydenham, the famous English physician of the 17th century, wrote an
                    important treatise on the subject, and his description of the gouty paroxysm,
                    all the more vivid from his having himself been afflicted with the disease for
                    thirty-four years, is still quoted by writers as the most graphic and exhaustive
                    account of the symptomatology of gout. Subsequently Cullen, recognizing gout as
                    capable of manifesting itself in various ways, divided the disease into <hi
                    rend="italic">regular gout,</hi> which affects the joints only, and <hi
                    rend="italic">irregular gout,</hi> where the gouty disposition exhibits itself
                    in other forms; and the latter variety he subdivided into <hi rend="italic"
                    >atonic gout,</hi> where the most prominent symptoms are throughout referable to
                    the stomach and alimentary canal; <hi rend="italic">retrocedent gout,</hi> where
                    the inflammatory attack suddenly disappears from an affected joint and serious
                    disturbance takes place in some internal organ, generally the stomach or heart;
                    and <hi rend="italic">misplaced gout,</hi> where from the first the disease does
                    not appear externally, but reveals itself by an inflammatory attack of some
                    internal part. Dr Garrod, one of the most eminent living authorities <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n15/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0015-0006"/> ou gout, adopts a division somewhat similar to
                    though simpler than that of Cullen, namely, <hi rend="italic">regular gout,</hi>
                    which affects the joints alone, and is either acute or chronic, and <hi
                    rend="italic">irregular gout,</hi> affecting non-articular tissues, or
                    disturbing the functions of various organs.</p>
                <p>It is often stated that the attack of gout comes on without any previous warning;
                    but, while this is true in ιrfany instances, the reverse is probably as
                    frequently the case, and the premonitory symptoms, especially in those who have
                    previously suffered from the disease, may be sufficiently precise to indicate
                    the impending seizure. Among the more common of these may be mentioned marked
                    disorders of the digestive organs, with a feeble and capricious appetite,
                    flatulence and pain after eating, and uneasiness in the right side in the region
                    of the liver. A remarkable tendency to gnashing of the teeth is sometimes
                    observed. This symptom was first noticed by Dr Graves, who connected it with
                    irritation in the urinary organs, which also is present as one of the
                    premonitory indications of the gouty attack. Various forms of nervous
                    disturbance also present themselves in the form of general discomfort, extreme
                    irritability of temper, and various perverted sensations, such as that of
                    numbness and coldness in the limbs. These symptoms may persist for many days and
                    then undergo amelioration immediately before the impending paroxysm. On the
                    night of the attack the patient retires to rest apparently well, but about two
                    or three o’clock in the morning is awoke with a painful feeling in the foot,
                    most commonly in the ball of the great toe, but it may be in the instep or heel,
                    or in the thumb. With the pain there often occurs a distinct shivering followed
                    by feverishness. The pain soon becomes of the most agonizing character: in the
                    words of Sydenham, “now it is a violent stretching and tearing of the ligaments,
                    now it is a gnawing pain, and now a pressure and tightening; so exquisite and
                    lively meanwhile is the part affected that it cannot bear the weight of the
                    bedclothes, nor the jar of a person walking in the room.”</p>
                <p>When the affected part is examined it is found to be swollen and of a deep red
                    hue. The superjacent skin is tense and glistening, and the surrounding veins are
                    more or less distended. After a few hours there is a remission of the pain,
                    slight perspiration takes place, and the patient may fall asleep. The pain may
                    continue moderate during the day but returns as night advances, and the patient
                    goes through a similar experience of suffering to that of the previous night,
                    followed with a like abatement towards morning. These nocturnal exacerbations
                    occur with greater or less severity during the continuance of the attack, which
                    generally lasts for a week or ten days. As the symptoms decline the swelling and
                    tenderness of the affected joint abate, but the skin over it pits on pressure
                    for a time, and with this there is often associated slight desquamation of the
                    cuticle. During the attacks there is much constitutional disturbance. The
                    patient is restless and extremely irritable, and suffers from cramp in the limbs
                    and from dyspepsia, thirst, and constipation. The urine is scanty and
                    high-coloured, with a copious deposit, consisting chiefly of urates. During the
                    continuance of the symptoms the inflammation may leave the one foot and affect
                    the other, or both may suffer at the same time. After the attack is over the
                    patient feels quite well and fancies himself better than he had been for a long
                    time before; hence the once popular notion that a fit of the gout was capable of
                    removing all other ailments. Any such idea, however, is sadly belied in the
                    experience of most sufferers from this disease. It is rare that the first is the
                    only attack of gout, and another is apt to occur within a year, although by care
                    and treatment it may be warded off. The disease, however, undoubtedly tends to
                    take a firmer hold on the constitution and to return. In the earlier recurrences
                    the same joints as were formerly the seat of the gouty inflammation suffer
                    again, but in course of time others become implicated, until in advanced cases
                    scarcely any articulation escapes, and the disease thus becomes chronic. It is
                    to be noticed that when gout assumes this form the frequently recurring attacks
                    are usually attended with less pain than the earlier ones, but their disastrous
                    effects are evidenced alike by the disturbance of various important organs,
                    especially the stomach, liver, kidneys, and heart, and by the remarkable changes
                    which take place in the joints from the formation of the so-called chalk-stones
                    or tophi These deposits, which are highly characteristic of gout, appear at
                    first to take place in the form of a semifluid material, consisting for the most
                    part of urate of soda, which gradually becomes more dense, and ultimately quite
                    hard. When any quantity of this is deposited in the structures of a joint the
                    effect is to produce stiffening, and, as deposits appear to take place to a
                    greater or less amount in connexion with every attack, permanent thickening and
                    deformity of the parts is apt to be the consequence. The extent of this depends
                    of course on the amount of the deposits, which, however, would seem to be in no
                    necessary relation to the severity of the attack, being in some cases even of
                    chronic gout so slight as to be barely appreciable externally, but on the other
                    hand occasionally causing great enlargement of the joints, and fixing them in a
                    flexed or extended position which renders them entirely useless. Dr Garrod
                    describes the appearance of a hand in an extreme case of this kind, and likens
                    its shape to a bundle of French carrots with their heads forward, the nails
                    corresponding to the stalks. Any of the joints may be thus affected, but most
                    commonly those of the hands and feet. The deposits take place in other
                    structures besides those of joints, such as along the course of tendons,
                    underneath the skin and periosteum, in the sclerotic coat of the eye, and
                    especially on the cartilages of the external ear. When largely deposited in
                    joints an abscess sometimes forms, the skin gives way, and the concretion is
                    exposed. Sir Thomas Watson quotes a case of this kind where the patient when
                    playing at cards was accustomed to chalk the score of the game upon the table
                    with his gouty knuckles.</p>
                <p>The recognition of what is termed irregular gout is less easy than that form
                    above described, where the disease gives abundant external evidence of its
                    presence; but that other parts than joints suffer from gouty attacks is beyond
                    question. The diagnosis may often be made in cases where in an attack of
                    ordinary gout the disease suddenly leaves the affected joints and some new
                    series of symptoms arises. It has been often observed when cold has been applied
                    to an inflamed joint that the pain and inflammation in the part ceased, but that
                    some sudden and alarming seizure referable to the stomach, brain, heart, or
                    lungs supervened. Such attacks, which correspond to what is termed by Cullen
                    retrocedent gout, often terminate favourably, more especially if the disease
                    again returns to the joints. Further, the gouty nature of some long-continued
                    internal or cutaneous disorder may be rendered apparent by its disappearance on
                    the outbreak of the paroxysm in the joints. Gout, when of long standing, is
                    often found associated with degenerative changes in the heart and large
                    arteries, the liver, and especially the kidneys, which are apt to assume the
                    contracted granular condition already alluded to as one of the forms of Bright’s
                    disease (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bright’s Disease).</hi> A variety of urinary
                    calculus—the uric acid—formed by concretions of this substance in the kidneys is
                    a not unfrequent occurrence in connexion with gout; hence the well-known
                    association of this disease and gravel.</p>
                <p>As regards the pathology of gout, all inquiry agrees in connecting it closely
                    with an altered state of the blood, more particularly with the presence in that
                    fluid in excessive amount of uric acid, and its subsequent deposition in the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n16/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0016-0007"/> joints in the form of urate of soda. Uric acid is
                    formed in the system in the processes of nutrition, and is excreted by the
                    kidneys, the amount passing off by the urine being estimated at about 8 grains
                    daily. In the healthy <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> human subject the blood
                    contains the merest trace of this acid, but in gout it may be detected in
                    abundance in the blood-serum both prior to and during the acute attack, while in
                    chronic gout it becomes a constant constituent of the blood and of other fluids
                    of the body, both natural and morbid. According to Dr Garrod it is not merely
                    the presence of the uric acid in the blood but its deposition in the inflamed
                    part that gives rise to the attack of gout, the inflammation being the effect
                    and not the cause of the deposit. The gouty paroxysm thus induced appears to rid
                    the system to a certain extent of the accumulated uric acid, although such
                    relief is generally of but temporary duration.</p>
                <p>Whether the accumulation of urates in the blood be due, as some affirm, to their
                    excessive formation in the system as the result of functional derangement of the
                    liver, or, as others hold, depends simply on the defective excreting power of
                    the kidneys of the daily amount, is disputed, although it has been often
                    observed during an attack of gout that the amount of uric acid excreted was
                    markedly deficient. The likelihood is that both these conditions concur, and
                    that while the kidneys retain their functional integrity even an excessive
                    amount of uric acid in the system may be got rid·of, but that these organs,
                    becoming themselves affected by the deposition of urates in their tubular
                    structure, lose to a large extent their excreting power, and thus the blood is
                    overcharged with the product which the kidneys can no longer entirely remove.
                    Another view of the pathology of gout recently advanced regards the disease as
                    resulting from special degenerative changes in the fibrous textures of the body,
                    one of the effects of which is the deposition of urates in the affected parts
                    whence they pass into the blood. This theory has not, however, as yet been
                    extensively supported, and the weight of opinion remains on the whole in favour
                    of the views of Dr Garrod. It must nevertheless be admitted that many points in
                    the pathology of this disease still remain unexplained, for, as remarked by
                    Trousseau, “the production in excess of uric acid and urates is a pathological
                    phenomenon inherent like all others in the disease; and like all the others it
                    is dominated by a specific cauβe, which we know only by its effects, and which
                    we term the gouty diathesis.” This subject of diathesis (habit, or organic
                    predisposition of individuals), which is universally admitted as an essential
                    element in the pathology of gout, naturally suggests the question as to whether,
                    besides being inherited, such a peculiarity may also be acquired, and this leads
                    to a consideration of the causes which are recognized as influential in
                    favouring the occurrence of this disease.</p>
                <p>It is beyond dispute that gout is in a marked degree hereditary, fully more than
                    half the number of cases being, according to Sir C. Scudamore and Dr Garrod, of
                    this character. But it is no less certain that there are habits and modes of
                    life the observance of which may induce the disease even where no hereditary
                    tendencies can be traced, and the avoidance of which may on the other hand go
                    far towards weakening or neutralizing the influence of inherited liability. Gout
                    is said to affect the sedentary more readily than the active, but this cannot be
                    taken as a very constant rule. If, however, inadequate exercise be combined with
                    a luxurious manner of living, with habitual over-indulgence in animal food and
                    rich dishes, and especially in alcoholic beverages, then undoubtedly the chief
                    factors in the production of the disease are present.</p>
                <p>Much has been written upon the relative influence of various forms of alcoholic
                    drinks in promoting the development of gout. It is generally stated that
                    fermented are more injurious than distilled liquors, and that, in particular,
                    the stronger wines, such as port, sherry, and madeira, are much more potent in
                    their gout-producing action than the lighter class of wines, such as hock,
                    moselle, &lt;fcc., while malt liquors are fully as hurtful as strong wines. If
                    this alleged difference in their tendency to induce gout be correct, it cannot
                    be said that any satisfactory explanation of it has been furnished; but indeed
                    the point has not been clearly proved, and it may be fairly questioned whether,
                    other things being equal, an individual in abandoning the use of wines and
                    substituting that of spirits would improve his position in relation to this
                    disease. It seems quite as probable that over-indulgence in any form of alcohol,
                    when associated with the other conditions already adverted to, will have very
                    much the same effect in developing gout. Even those who affirm the mischievous
                    effects of fermented liquors in this way are obliged to admit that they are
                    injurious in proportion to the amount of alcohol they contain. The comparative
                    absence of gout in countries where spirituous liquors are chiefly used, such as
                    Scotland, is cited as showing their relatively slight effect in encouraging that
                    disease; but it is to be noticed that in such countries there is on the whole a
                    less marked tendency to excess in the other pleasures of the table, which in no
                    degree less than alcohol are chargeable with inducing the gouty habit. Gout is
                    not a common disease among the poor and labouring classes, and when it does
                    occur may often be connected even in them with errors in living. It is not very
                    rare to meet gout in butlers, coachmen, &amp;c., who are apt to live luxuriously
                    while leading comparatively easy lives.</p>
                <p>Gout, it must ever be borne in mind, may also affect persons who observe the
                    strictest temperance in living, and whose only excesses are in the direction of
                    over-work, either physical or intellectual. Many of the great names in history
                    in all times have had their existence embittered by this malady, and have died
                    from its effects. The influence of hereditary tendency may often be traced in
                    such instances, and is doubtless called into activity by the depressing
                    consequences of over-work. It may, notwithstanding, be affirmed as generally
                    true that those who lead regular lives and are moderate in the use of animal
                    food and alcoholic drinks, or still better abstain from the latter altogether,
                    are little likely to be the victims of gout even where an undoubted inherited
                    tendency exists.</p>
                <p>Gout is more common in mature age than in the earlier years of life, the greatest
                    number of cases in one decennial period being between the ages of thirty and
                    forty, next between twenty and thirty, and thirdly between forty and fifty. It
                    may occasionally affect very young persons, but such cases are generally in a
                    marked degree hereditary. After middle life gout rarely appears for the first
                    time. Women are much less the subjects of gout than men, apparently from their
                    less exposure to the influences (excepting of course that of heredity) which
                    tend to develop the disease, and doubtless also from the differing circumstances
                    of their physical constitution. It most frequently appears in females after the
                    cessation of the menses. Persons exposed to the influence of lead poisoning,
                    such as plumbers, painters, &amp;c., are apt to suffer from gout; and it would
                    seem that impregnation of the system with this metal markedly interferes with
                    the uric-acid-excreting function of the kidneys.</p>
                <p>Attacks of gout are readily excited in those predisposed to the disease. Exposure
                    to cold, disorders of digestion, fatigue, and irritation or injuries of
                    particular joints will often precipitate the gouty paroxysm.</p>
                <p>With respect to the treatment of gout the greatest variety of opinion has
                    prevailed and practice been pursued, from the numerous quaint nostrums detailed
                    by Lucian to the “expectant” or do-nothing system recommended by Sydenham<pb

                    modern physicians, who regard the disease as beyond the reach of remedies. But
                    that gout, although, as has been shown, a malady of a most severe and
                    intractable character, may nevertheless be successfully dealt with by
                    appropriate medicinal and hygienic measures is a belief largely entertained, and
                    one which happily guides the practice of the physician, The general plan of
                    treatment can be here only briefly indicated. During the acute attack the
                    affected part should be kept at perfect rest, and have applied to it warm opiate
                    fomentations or poultices, or, what answers fully better, be enveloped in cotton
                    wool covered in with oil silk. The diet of the patient should be light, without
                    animal food or stimulants. The administration of some simple laxative will be of
                    service, as well as the free use of alkaline diuretics, such as the bicarbonate
                    or acetate of potash. The medicinal agent most to be relied on in the treatment
                    of gout is colchicum, which manifestly exercises a powerful action on the
                    disease. This drug <hi rend="italic">(Colchicum autumnale),</hi> which is
                    believed to correspond to the hermodactyl of the ancients, was introduced as a
                    remedy for gout about a century ago, and has proved of such efficacy in
                    modifying the attacks that, as observed by Dr Garrod, “we may safely a sert that
                    colchicum possesses as specific a control over the gouty inflammation as
                    cinchona barks or their alkaloids over intermittent fever.” The mode of action
                    of colchicum in gout is by no means determined, since it would appear to have no
                    certain effect upon the uric acid excreted from the system; and the general
                    opinion seems to be that th'13 drug has a special sedative effect on the gouty
                    inflammation. It is usually administered in the form of the wine in doses of
                    10-30 drops every four or six hours, or in pill as the acetous extract (gr.
                    ∣-gr. i.). The effect of colchicum in subduing the pain of gout is generally so
                    prompt and marked that it is unnecessary to have recourse to opiates; but its
                    action requires to be carefully watched by the physician from its well-known
                    nauseating and depressing consequences, which, should they appear, render the
                    suspension of the drug necessary. Otherwise the remedy may be continued in
                    gradually diminishing doses for some days after the disappearance of the gouty
                    inflammation. The statements often made that colchicum tends to encourage the
                    speedy return of the disease do not seem to be well founded. Should gout give
                    evidence of its presence in an irregular form by attacking internal organs,
                    besides the medicinal treatment above mentioned, the use of frictions and
                    mustard applications to the joints is indicated with the view of exciting its
                    appearance there.</p>
                <p>when gout has become chronic, colchicum, although of less service than in acute
                    gout, is yet valuable, particularly when the inflammatory attacks recur. More
                    benefit·, however, appears to be derived from iodide of potassium, guaiacum, and
                    more especially from the alkalis potash and lithia. This latter drug is strongly
                    recommended by Dr Garrod from its solvent action upon the urates. It is usually
                    administered in the form of the carbonate (gr. v., freely diluted).</p>
                <p>The treatment and regimen to be employed in the intervals of the gouty attackβ
                    are of the highest importance. These bear reference for the most part to the
                    habits and mode of life of the patient. Restriction must be laid upon the amount
                    and quality of the food, and equally, or still more, upon the alcoholic
                    stimulants. “The instances,” says Sir Thomas Watson, “are not few of men of good
                    sense, and masters of themselves, who, being warned by one visitation of the
                    gout, have thenceforward resolutely abstained from rich living and from wine and
                    strong drinks of all kinds, and who have been rewarded for their prudence and
                    self-denial by complete immunity from any return of the disease, or upon whom,
                    at any rate, its future assaults have been few and feeble.” The same eminent
                    authority adds— “I am sure it is worth any <hi rend="italic">young</hi> man’s
                    while, who has had the gout, to become a teetotaller.” By those more advanced in
                    life who, from long continued habit, are unable entirely to relinquish the use
                    of stimulants, the strictest possible temperance must be observed. Regular but
                    moderate exercise in the form of walking or riding, in the case of those who
                    lead sedentary lives, is of great advantage, and all over-work, either physical
                    or mental, should be avoided. Unfortunately the complete carrying out of such
                    directions, even by those who feel their importance, is too often rendered
                    difficult or impossible by circumstances of occupation and otherwise, and at
                    most only an approximation can be made. The effect upon the gouty constitution
                    of certain mineral waters and baths is well known. The particular place must in
                    each case be determined by the physician, and special caution must be observed
                    in recommending this plan of treatment in persons whose gout is complicated by
                    organic disease of any kind. (j. o. A.)</p>
