                    >Correspondance littéraire,</hi> was, though a naturalized Frenchman, both of
                    German descent and a native of Germany, having been born of poor parents at
                    Ratisbon, 26th December 1723. He studied at the university of Leipsic, where he
                    had as professor the celebrated Ernesti, to whom he was doubtless in no small
                    degree indebted for his critical appreciation of classical literature. On
                    completing his studies he made his literary début by a tragedy which was
                    received with ridicule by the audience and by the critics, including Lessing,
                    and which is now forgotten even in Germany. In all probability it was this
                    disappointment which led him to think of seeking his fortune in Paris, whither
                    he accompanied the count of Schönberg as tutor to his sons, and where
                    afterwards, at a small salary, he was for some time reader to the young
                    hereditary prince of Saxe-Gotha. In 1749 he made the acquaintanceship of J. J.
                    Rousseau, which, through a mutual sympathy in regard to musical matters, soon
                    ripened into intimate friendship. Through Rousseau he was introduced to the
                    Encyclopedists, and about the same time he became secretary to Count Friesen,
                    nephew of Marshal Saxe, which gained him admission to the most brilliant society
                    of Paris. Endowed with more than average intellectual abilities, thoroughly
                    versed in all current topics of interest in literature, science, and art, gifted
                    with remarkable insight into character, possessing engaging manners and great
                    social tact, and actuated in all his conduct by a keen regard to his own
                    interest, he won almost immediately general appreciation and respect. He rapidly
                    obtained a thorough knowledge of the French language, and acquired so perfectly
                    the tone and sentiments of the society in which he moved that all marks of his
                    foreign origin and training seemed completely effaced. A witty pamphlet entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">petit</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Prophète</hi><hi rend="italic">de Boehmischbroda,</hi> written by him on the
                    respective merits of the Italian and French operas, a subject which at that time
                    greatly exercised the society of Paris and on which he sided with the Italian
                    section, at once firmly established his literary reputation. It is possible that
                    the origin of the pamphlet is partly to be accounted for by his admiration of
                    Mdlle. Fel, the <hi rend="italic">prima donna</hi> of the Italian company. This
                    admiration quickly developed into a passion so vehement that he was seized with
                    a kind of catalepsy which continued for several days, but from which he suddenly
                    awoke completely recovered both in body and mind. In 1753 Grimm was engaged by
                    the Abbé Raynal to aid him in conducting his literary correspondence with German
                    sovereigns; and this opened up to him that sphere for his ambition which perhaps
                    -was most in accordance with his peculiar tastes, and in which his abilities
                    best fitted him to excel. Although from the beginning he had the principal share
                    in the work, it was probably conducted until 1759 in the name of the Abbé
                    Raynal. With the aid of friends during his temporary absences from France, he
                    carried it on until 1790, and it latterly extended to six sovereigns, including
                    the empress of Russia, the king of Sweden, and the king of Poland. It was
                    probably in 1754 that Grimm was introduced by Rousseau to Madame <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0209-0198"/> d’Épinay, his relations with whom led to an
                    irreconcilable rupture between him and Rousseau. The exact amount of Grimm’s
                    blameworthiness it is impossible to determine, and the whole matter would be of
                    little consequence but for the fact that Rousseau allowed his resentment to gain
                    such a complete possession of his mind as to induce him to give in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Confessions</hi> a wholly mendacious portrait of Grimm’s
                    character, by which his reputation was for a considerable time injuriously
                    affected. After the death of Count Friesen Grimm obtained the patronage of the
                    duke of Orleans, through whom he was appointed secretary to Marshal d’Estrées
                    during the campaign of Westphalia in 1756-57. Subsequently he was named minister
                    of Saxe-Gotha at the court of France, but he was deprived of that office on
                    account of having criticized rather caustically certain French ministers in a
                    despatch that was intercepted by Louis XV. His introduction to Catherine II. of
                    Russia took place in 1773, when he accompanied the suite of the landgrave of
                    Hesse-Darmstadt to St Petersburg on occasion of the marriage of a daughter of
                    that prince to the only son of Catherine. After the Revolution Grimm retired to
                    Gotha, and in 1792 he emigrated to Russia, where he enjoyed high favour at the
                    court of Catherine, and had assigned him the nominal and agreeable duty of
                    entertaining her for so many hours a day by his conversation. This state of
                    things came, however, to an end in 1795, when, notwithstanding his supplications
                    to be retained at court if only as one of her majesty’s dogs, he was appointed
                    minister of Russia at Hamburg. He died at Gotha, 19th December 1807.</p>
                <p>The correspondence of Grimm forms perhaps the most valuable of existing records
                    of any important literary period. It embraces nearly the whole period from 1750
                    to 1790, and although parts of it during his absence from France were written by
                    Diderot, Madame d’Épinay, and others, the work as a whole may be regarded as
                    substantially his. At first he contented himself with enumerating in the
                    simplest manner the chief current views in literature and art, and indicating
                    only very slightly the contents of the principal new books, but gradually his
                    criticisms became more extended and trenchant, and he touched on nearly every
                    subject—political, literary, artistic, social, and religious—which interested
                    the Parisian society of the time —his narrative, which moves lightly and easily
                    from one theme to another, being frequently seasoned by piquant anecdotes or
                    witty reflexions. Not only, however, did he aim to give a truthful and just
                    account of the subjects on which he wrote; his purpose extended considerably
                    beyond that of affording a few hours’ amusement to his royal patrons, and his
                    descriptions and criticisms were fitted to satisfy more than a superficial
                    Curiosity. His notices of contemporaries are somewhat severe, and he exhibits in
                    all the nakedness of truth the foibles and selfishness of the society in which
                    he moved; but he appears to have been unbiassed in his literary judgments, and
                    such is their justness and penetration that time has only served to confirm
                    them. In style and manner of expression he is thoroughly Trench. He is generally
                    somewhat cold in his appreciation, but his literary taste is delicate and
                    subtle; and it is the opinion of Sainte-Beuve that the quality of his thought in
                    his be3t moments will compare not unfavourably even with that of Voltaire. His
                    religious and philosophical opinions were entirely negative, and his references
                    to Christianity generally assume the form of either a sneer or a witticism,</p>
