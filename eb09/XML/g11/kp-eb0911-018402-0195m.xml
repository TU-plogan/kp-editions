                    30 leagues S. W. of Barbados, and about 60 miles from the nearest point of South
                    America. Its length from north to south is about 24 miles, and its greatest
                    breadth is 12 miles. The area is 133 square miles.</p>
                <p>Grenada is rendered highly picturesque by ridges of hills covered with trees and
                    brushwood, and by an irregular but continuous range of mountains which traverses
                    the island from north to south, in some parts rising to 3000 feet above the
                    level of the sea. Lesser ridges branch off, forming rich and picturesque
                    valleys. The mountains and some parts of the lowlands consist of red and gray
                    sandstone, greywacke, hornblende, and argillaceous schist. The strata are much
                    diversified and irregular. Sulphur and fuller’s earth are found. Porphyry,
                    limestone, and basaltic rocks occur at certain places. Rivers are numerous, but
                    not large. In the centre of the island, 1740 feet above the level of the sea, is
                    the Grand Étang, a circular lake 2 miles in circumference and 14 feet deep,
                    feeding numerous small rivers. Lake Antoine is another remarkable natural
                    feature. There are several hot chalybeate and sulphurous springs. Along the
                    coast are numerous excellent bays and harbours. The waters abound with fish;
                    game and birds of various species are found. Hurricanes are comparatively
                    unfrequent, but earthquake shocks are sometimes experienced. The average
                    temperature is 82° Fahr., but the higher parts are cooler. Considerable rain
                    falls. The soil is extraordinarily fertile; but cotton, indigo, and tobacco are
                    not now cultivated. Fruits and some kinds of European vegetables grow
                    luxuriantly. Sugar cultivation is not extending, but cocoa is now making rapid
                    strides. The island is divided into six parishes. Formerly it had a house of
                    assembly, but is now a crown colony under the general government of the Windward
                    Islands. It has a lieutenant-governor and a council consisting of officials and
                    members nominated by the crown.</p>
                <p>The capital, St George’s (population about 5000), is built upon a peninsula
                    projecting into a spacious bay on the west side of the island, near the southern
                    extremity. The houses are of brick or stone, and stand on high ground which
                    rises from the bay. The town is divided by a ridge running into the sea, forming
                    on one side the careenage, a large basin of water, where ships lie landlocked,
                    close to wharves and stores. A saluting battery, Fort George, overlooks the
                    entrance. On the left, the land rises to the fortifications of Hospital Hill;
                    and a long ridge connects this fort with Richmond Heights, which form the
                    background of the scene and are also fortified. The ridge which connects Fort
                    George with Hospital Hill separates the careenage from the larger portion of the
                    town, which contains an extensive market-place, and looks upon the bay. Besides
                    the careenage, there is a spacious sheet of water called the lagoon, separated
                    from the former by a reef passable only by boats.</p>
                <p>Between Grenada and St Vincent there are several small islands called Grenadines,
                    some being included in the government of Grenada. Of these Carriacou is the most
                    important. It is about 19 miles in circumference, and contains 3071 inhabitants.
                    Ground provisions, live stock, and some cocoa are cultivated.</p>
                <p>The exports in 1877 were—cocoa, 1244 tons; whale oil, 6720 galls.; rum, 53,609
                    galls.; sugar, 2792 tons. The cocoa exports in 1878 were 1900 tons, an amount
                    considerably exceeded in 1879. The total value of imports amounted in 1877 to
                    £127,204,—including £60,201 from the United Kingdom, and £46,724 from the
                    British West Indies. The value of exports to the United Kingdom was £122,821,
                    and to other countries, £23,085;—total, £145,906. The revenue was £29,084, of
                    which customs produced £13,460, and the expenditure was £29,581. Population
                    (1877), 41,355. About 400 Coolie immigrants were introduced in 1877.
                    Considerable immigration takes place from Barbados. The legislature grants £1200
                    annually for education, distributed among 30 schools,—16 Anglican, 5 Wesleyan, 9
                    Roman Catholic,—with 2908 scholars.</p>
                <p>Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1∙498. The Spaniards, however, did not form
                    a settlement there. The island is one of the “Caribbees” granted to the earl of
                    Carlisle in 1627; but it was inhabited only by warlike Caribs until 1650-51,
                    when Du Parquet, governor of Martinique, organized two expeditions to it. The
                    Frenchmen were at first well received by the natives, but great cruelty was
                    exercised in the extirpation of the latter. The island made little progress
                    until after 1700. In 1714 the French West India Company acquired their property
                    in Grenada; commercial intercourse sprang up with Martinique; and when the
                    company was dissolved the island became vested in the crown of France. In 1753
                    it contained 1262 whites, 11,991 slaves, and 83 sugar plantations. In 1762
                    Grenada capitulated to the British forces, and it was formally ceded in the
                    treaty of peace of 1763. It was, however, retaken by the French in 1779, and not
                    finally restored to Great Britain in 1783 till the general peace.</p>
