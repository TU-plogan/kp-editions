                    of the kind that we hear of, and of which the present gyroscope is merely a
                    modification, is that of Bohnenberger, which was constructed as early as 1810,
                    and is described in Gilbert’s <hi rend="italic">Annalen</hi> for 1818 (lx. p.
                    60). It consisted of a heavy spheroid which could rotate inside a circular ring
                    round its shorter axis,—the axis running on pivots situated at opposite ends of
                    the ring’s diameter. This ring, with its contained spheroid, was similarly made
                    movable inside a second ring, and round an axis at right angles to the axis of
                    the spheroid. In the same way this second ring, with its contents, could rotate
                    inside a third ring, and round an axis at right angles to each of the others.
                    From this it will be seen that the spheroid had all degrees of free
                    rotation,—one point only within it being fixed, namely, the intersection of the
                    three axes.</p>
                <p>Under the title of precession instruments, various pieces of apparatus, involving
                    the gyroscope principle, have been in use for a number of years for illustrating
                    the precession of the equinoxes, and the parallelism of the earth’s axis as it
                    revolves round the sun. An instrument of this kind was given by Arago to
                    Professor Playfair, which must have been in existence since 1816—17. Mention is
                    made of a similar instrument as being brought from Italy to Mr Babbage in 1827.
                    At the close of that year a notice of an instrument akin to the gyroscope made
                    by Mr Henry Atkinson was read before the Astronomical Society. In 1836, in a
                    paper read before the Royal Scottish Society of Arts, Mr Edward Sang, C.E.,
                    Edinburgh, suggested an experiment with an instrument exactly similar to the
                    gyroscope, by which the rotation of the earth on its axis could <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n371/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0371-0352"/> be directly proved. He says: “While using
                    Troughton s top an idea occurred to me that a similar principle might be applied
                    to the exhibition of the rotation of the earth. Conceive a large flat wheel,
                    poised on several axes all passing exactly through its centre of gravity, and
                    whose axis of motion is coincident with its principal axis of permanent
                    rotation, to be put in very rapid motion. The direction of its axis would then
                    remain unchanged. But the directions of all surrounding objects varying, on
                    account of the motion of the earth, it would result that the axis of the
                    revolving wheel would appear to move slowly.” This suggested experiment was
                    actually carried out in 1852 by</p>
                <p>M. Leon Foucault, although, in all probability, without any knowledge on his part
                    of Mr Sang’s suggestion. Already, in 1851, Foucault, in his famous experiment
                    with the pendulum at the Pantheon in Paris, had shown how the constancy of the
                    plane of a pendulum’s vibration could be used to show the rotation of the earth,
                    and now, in 1852, he applied the property of the “constancy of the plane of
                    rotation” of a gyroscope for the same purpose. The name gyroscope was given to
                    the instrument by Foucault at this time, and in order to perform the experiment
                    successfully the instrument had to be constructed with the utmost exactness. The
                    experiment was repeated at the Liverpool meeting of the British Association, and
                    by causing a considerable sensation in the scientific world at the time was the
                    means of bringing the gyroscope into public notoriety. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poggendorff</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic">Annalen</hi> for 1853
                    there is a description of a gyroscope made some time before by Fessel, and about
                    the same time we hear of various modifications of the instrument introduced by
                    Profs. Baden Powell, Wheatstone, and others. Quite recently, in 1878, there has
                    appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Scientific American</hi> an account of a new
                    form of gyroscope made by Mr G. M. Hopkins. In this instrument the heavy
                    fly-wheel is driven by an electric current after the manner of an
                    electromagnetic engine, and so its rotation can be kept up for any length of
                    time.</p>
                <p>The construction of the gyroscope will be readily understood from fig. 1, which
                    is engraved from a photograph of a large instrument made by Mr Sang.</p>
                <p>It consists of a fly-wheel, with a heavy rim accurately turned and balanced,
                    which can rotate round an axis GC forming a diameter of the ring K. This ring
                    also can rotate about the axis A F which is at right angles to GC, and is a
                    diameter of the ring L. Similarly this ring L can rotate about the vertical axis
                    BH, which is perpendicular both to GC and AF, and forms a diameter of the ring
                    M, which is screwed to the heavy sole-plate</p>
                <p>N. In order to suit certain experiments the ring M, by means of a clamp
                    arrangement seen at X, can be turned round to make the axis BH inclined at any
                    angle with the vertical. With this instrument the following among many
                    interesting experiments may be made.</p>
                <p>1. Either by a large fly-wheel and band, or by running out a long cord coiled
                    several times round the V-grooved wheel on the end of the axis, let a very rapid
                    rotation be given to the fly-wheel round the axis OC, and in the positive
                    direction (that is, counterclock-wise as seen from C). Such a rotation can
                    readily be given so rapid as to last a long time. While so revolving let a
                    weight be placed at G so as to cause a rotation round OA, also in the positive
                    direction, and it will then be observed that a slow rotation of the whole mass
                    takes place about the vertical axis OB, but in the negative direction. If the
                    weight be put at C, the wheel rotating as before, the rotation round OB will be
                    in the positive direction. Reversing the rotation of the wheel will in both
                    cases produce a reversal of the rotation round OB.</p>
                <p>2. The fly-wheel still rotating in the positive direction, lit a positive
                    rotation be given to the ring L round OB, and immediately the axis of the wheel
                    OC will tilt up, rotating in the positive direction round OA till it reach the
                    vertical position, where it will remain, and then it will be observed that the
                    fly-wheel is rotating in the positive direction round OB. Should the axis OC, in
                    consequence of inertia, be carried a little past the vertical, and the direction
                    of rotation round OB be then suddenly reversed, the axis OC will continue to
                    revolve in the positive direction round OA, till it reaches the vertical
                    pointing downwards, when it will again be stationary, and the wheel will now be
                    rotating in the negative direction round OB. By gently oscillating the ring L at
                    the instant the axis of the fly-wheel is passing the vertical, a continuous
                    rapid rotation round OA can be given to the ring K carrying the rotating
                    fly-wheel with it.</p>
                <p>3. Let the fly-wheel be now made stationary, and, while in this position, let
                    simultaneous rotations in the positive direction be given round both OA and OB;
                    the fly-wheel will then be observed to begin to move in the negative direction
                    round OC.</p>
                <p>The explanation of all these experiments follows readily from the theory of the
                    composition of rotations round different axes. Let the angular velocities about
                    OA, OB, OC, be ≡r, <hi rend="italic">p, σ</hi> respectively. If simultaneous
                    angular velocities <hi rend="italic">σ</hi> and w be given about OC and OA in
                    the positive direction, these can be compounded into an angular velocity about a
                    new axis 01, which divides the angle AOC into two parts such that <hi
                    rend="italic">zr</hi> sin COI sin COI</p>
                <p>7=sΕA0i = ^C0i = <hi rend="superscript"> tan</hi> COI = tan <hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi> (suppose).</p>
                <p>01 is, therefore, the position of the instantaneous axis, and as OC will always
                    tend to coincide with it, OC will move round the axis OB in the negative
                    direction. It will be noticed also that, <hi rend="italic">-α</hi> remaining the
                    same, tan 0 will be less as <hi rend="italic">σ</hi> is greater. This shows that
                    the rotation round OB, or the motion in azimuth, will be slower as the speed of
                    the fly-wheel is greater. This accords with experiment. In precisely the same
                    way by considering simultaneous angular velocities about OC and OB and OA and
                    OB, can experiments 2 and 3 be explained.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most common form of gyroscope is that which has been largely sold
                    under the name of the gyroscope top. It is a modification of the gyroscope
                    introduced by Fessel. In it the ring containing the rotating wheel is either
                    supported on a vertical pivot at the end of the axis, or simply held suspended
                    by a string attached to the same point, as represented in fig. 2. In this case,
                    when the wheel is rapidly rotated, and its axis initially inclined at an angle
                    with the vertical, a slow motion round the vertical axis is observed to take
                    place. This rotation is accompanied by a feeble nutation of the axis, which is
                    unobservable by the eye so long as the wheel rotates rapidly. The rotation in
                    azimuth would continue uniform if the velocity of the wheel remained constant,
                    but it grad ually increases in speed, the nutation at the same time becoming
                    more apparent as the velocity dies away, till the gyroscope finally settles with
                    the axis of the wheel in the direction of the <pb break="no"

                    analytical investigation of this particular case may serve to give some idea of
                    how problems on the gyroscope generally may be attacked. For clearness in the
                    woodcut (fig. 3) we suppose the ring containing the wheel removed.</p>

                <p>An important case of motion, and one also very interesting both mathematically
                    and physically, is got by including a gyroscope in a pendulum bob and supporting
                    the rod from a universal flexure joint. This constitutes the gyroscopic
                    pendulum. The joint is usually got by attaching a short length of fine steel
                    wire rigidly to the end of the rod, and suspending the whole by mean3 of the
                    other end of this wire firmly clamped into a fixed support. When the gyroscope
                    is rapidly rotated, and the pendulum drawn a little aside from the vertical and
                    then let go, its lower end is observe 1 to describe a beautiful curve consisting
                    of a series of equal closed loops, all equally near each other and radiating
                    from a centre point. This curve, which is a species of hypotrochoid, is figured
                    in Thomson and Tait’s <hi rend="italic">Natural Philosophy,</hi> where also the
                    whole theory of the gyroscopic pendulum will be found.</p>
                <p>As has been already mentioned, a remarkable apparent effect is produced by the
                    earth’s diurnal rotation upon a rapidly rotating gyroscope. This arises from
                    what Foucault called the “fixity of the plane of rotation,” and what Thomson and
                    Tait have recently called “gyrostatic domination. In virtue of this principle,
                    the axis of the rotating fly-wheel tends always to preserve a fixed direction in
                    space, and, in consequence, will appear to move in a direction opposite to that
                    in which the earth’s rotation is at each instant actually carrying it.</p>
                <p>If we suppose the gyroscope represented at fig. 1 to have all degrees of free
                    rotation round the point 0, and to be in every way exactly balanced about that
                    point, and also to have all its pivots nearly void of friction, then, at
                    whatever part of the earth’s surface it may be placed, the fly-wheel while
                    rotating rapidly will be observed to move gradually and finally take up such a
                    position that its axis OC is parallel to the earth’s axis, and also that its
                    direction of rotation round OC is the same as that of the earth round its axis.
                    Should the ring K be fixed so that the axis GC can only move in a horizontal
                    plane, then the ring L will move in azimuth till it has placed GC in the
                    direction north and south and such that the direction of rotation of the
                    fly-wheel coincides with that of the earth. Further, should the ring L be fixed
                    in the plane of the meridian, so that GC can only move in altitude, then GC will
                    be observed to tilt up till it is parallel to the earth’s axis, the direction of
                    rotation of the wheel being, as before, the same as that of the earth. These
                    effects may be explained as follows :—</p>
                <p>Let A be the latitude of the place, and ω the angular velocity of the earth on
                    its axis; also, at starting, let the ring K be in the horizontal plane, and let
                    OC make an angle α, in azimuth, with a horizontal line ON drawn from O
                    northwards; further, let the rotation of the wheel round OC be positive. Now <hi
                    rend="italic">ω</hi> can be resolved into three angular velocities at right
                    angles to each other, viz. :— <hi rend="italic">ω</hi> sin λ round the vertical
                    line, <hi rend="italic">w</hi> cos λ cos <hi rend="italic">a</hi> round a line
                    parallel to OC, and ω cos λ sin « round a line parallel to ON.</p>
                <p>Of these <hi rend="italic">ω</hi> sin λ gives the velocity in azimuth, <hi
                    rend="italic">ω</hi> cos λ cos α can only affect the velocity of the wheel,
                    while <hi rend="italic">ω</hi> cos λ sine gives the velocity of OC in altitude.
                    These being the actual component velocities communicated to the gyroscope by the
                    earth, the apparent velocities will be equal and opposite to them.</p>
                <p>The apparatus actually employed by Foucault to demonstrate the rotation of the
                    earth differed somewhat from that represented in fig. 1. In it the corresponding
                    ring to L was suspended from a fixed stand by a thread without torsion, and
                    rested at its lowest point by a pivot in an agate cup. Also the ring
                    corresponding to K, which carried the fly-wheel, rested on knife edges within L,
                    and could be removed at pleasure, in order that the rotation might be given to
                    the fly-wheel. Great care was also taken to have every part thoroughly well
                    balanced. It is stated that the experiment was several times successfully
                    performed, and Foucault by means of his apparatus was thus able, without
                    astronomical observation, to find out the latitude of the place, the east and
                    west points, and the rate of the earth’s motion. The same experiment has lately,
                    it is said, been successfully performed by Mr G. M. Hopkins. His flywheel, being
                    driven by electricity, has the advantage of rotating at a uniform rate for any
                    length of time. By attaching a small mirror to the frame which carries the
                    revolving wheel, and using a spot of light reflected from it as an index, he has
                    been able to make manifest the earth’s rotation in a very short time.</p>
                <p>An ingenious practical application of the gyroscope principle was suggested and
                    carried into effect about the year 1856 by Professor Piazzi Smyth. His aim was
                    to devise a telescope-stand which would always remain level on board ship,
                    notwithstanding the pitching and rolling, aud so facilitate the taking of
                    astronomical observations at sea. For this purpose the stand was supported on
                    gimbals, and underneath it were placed on fine pivots several heavy fly-wheels
                    which could be put in rapid rotation, some on vertical and some on horizontal
                    axes. The complete apparatus, involving many ingenious details as to driving the
                    fly-wheels, &lt;kc., was tested by Professor Smyth on board the yacht “Titania”
                    during a voyage to Teneriffe, and found to work with perfect satisfaction. A
                    full account of the method will be found in <hi rend="italic">Trans.

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gyrostat.</hi> —This is a modification of the gyroscope,
                    devised by Sir William Thomson, which has been used by him as well as by
                    Professor Tait for a number of years to illustrate the dynamics of rotating
                    rigid bodies. It consists essentially of a fly-wheel, with a massive rim, fixed
                    on the middle of an axis which can rotate on fine steel pivots inside a rigid
                    case. The rigid case exactly resembles a similarly-shaped, but hollow, fly-wheel
                    and axis closely surrounding the other but still leaving it freedom to move.

                    several times round the axis for the purpose of setting the fly-wheel in motion.
                    There is also attached to the rigid case, in the plane passing through the
                    centre of gravity of the wheel at right angles to its axis, a thin flange of
                    metal, which is called the bearing edge. The circumference of this flange is not
                    a circle but a curvilinear polygon of sixteen or more equal sides. The object of
                    making it so is to prevent the instrument from rolling like a wheel on the
                    bearing edge when the flywheel is rotating rapidly. A draw ing of the gyrostat,
                    with a portion of the case removed to show the inside, is given in fig. 4. A
                    represents the bearing edge upon which the whole balances. To suit certain
                    experiments, a sharp conical steel point can be fixed on to the end B by means
                    of a bayonet joint.</p>
                <p>The gyrostat is a most instructive instrument, and with it many interesting
                    experiments can be performed. We can only mention a few taken from Thomson and
                    Tait’s <hi rend="italic">Natural Philosophy,</hi> vol. i. Part I., where the
                    mathematics of the whole subject will be found fully given.</p>
                <p>1. Let the gyrostat be placed on a flat sheet of glass with its bearing edge in a
                    vertical plane as represented in the figure. Neglecting translations, it has in
                    that position clearly two freedoms, one in azimuth and the other inclinational.
                    Of these, the first is neutral and the second unstable when the fly-wheel is
                    still; but when it rotates rapidly the second will become stable, the first
                    remaining neutral as before. When the fly-wheel is spinning rapidly, the
                    persistence with which the gyrostat keeps the erect position is very remarkable.
                    A blow from the fist on the side of the case is met by a strong resistance, the
                    instrument being thrown into a state of violent tremor, which subsides, however,
                    after a few seconds. If, while the fly-wheel is still rapidly spinning, a weight
                    be hung on at B, the whole apparatus will, like the gyroscope, immediately begin
                    to move round a vertical axis.</p>
                <p>2. Let the gyrostat be supported on knife-edge gimbals at its lower end, and with
                    the axis vertical. In this position it has two freedoms each unstable, without
                    rotation of the fly-wheel, but with it both stable. A similar result is obtained
                    by supporting the gyrostat on a universal flexure joint, constituting an
                    inverted gyroscopic pendulum.</p>
                <p>3. Let the gyrostat be supported on two equally long stilts tangential to the
                    bearing edge. In this position the two freedoms, one azimuthal the other
                    inclinational, are both unstable without, but both stable with, rapid rotation
                    of the fly-wheel.</p>
                <p>4. Let the gyrostat be attached to a bar of wood by thrusting the bearing edge
                    through a narrow slot in the middle of the bar, and then let it be suspended by
                    strings attached to the ends of the bar, the bar being horizontal. By this we
                    have the means of slinging the gyrostat bifilarly in four different ways, two
                    with the strings parallel and two with them crossed, the gyrostat being
                    alternately above and below the wooden bar. Each of these ways has four
                    freedoms, which can be reduced to three by a third string in each case. A little
                    consideration will show in each case the stable and unstable modes without and
                    with rotation of the fly-wheel.</p>
                <p>It only remains to mention a very interesting and intricate gyrostatic problem
                    which has been lately suggested by Sir William Thomson. He supposes a string of
                    gyrostats to be formed with their axes all in the same straight line, and each
                    attached to the other by a small universal flexure joint of thin steel wire. If
                    this string be disturbed after the fly-wheels have all been put into rapid
                    rotation, a remarkable cork-screw motion passes along the wire. For particulars
                    we must refer to a paper announced by Sir William Thomson in the <hi
