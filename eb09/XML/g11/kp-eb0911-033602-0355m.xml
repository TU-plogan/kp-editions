                <p><label type="entry">GUTENBERG, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, was born
                    about 1410 at Mainz of noble parents, his father being Frielo zum Gänsfleisch,
                    and his mother, whose name he adopted, Else zu Gudenberg. In 1420 the citizens
                    of Mainz drove the patricians out of the city, and as Gutenberg’s name appears
                    about ten years later at Strasburg the family probably took refuge there. When
                    the expelled families were recalled to Mainz, Gutenberg did not avail himself of
                    the privilege. We next hear of him at Strasburg, where in 1434 he seized and
                    imprisoned the town clerk of Mainz for a debt due by the corporation of that
                    city, releasing him, however, at the urgent representations of the mayor and
                    counsellors of Strasburg. In 1437 Gutenberg was sued before the ecclesiastical
                    court by Emmeline zu Iserne-Thüre for breach of promise of marriage, the case
                    being settled by his making her his wife. The active mind of Gutenberg had
                    adopted several plans for making money before he invented the art of printing
                    with movable types, which is his great claim upon the gratitude of mankind.
                    Before 1425 he engaged in some experiments requiring money, when Andrew
                    Dritzehn, a fellow-citizen, became security for him; and the same year a
                    partnership between them was arranged to carry out Gutenberg’s new plan for
                    polishing stones. Next came an improvement in the manufacture of
                    looking-glasses, for which money was lent by other two friends. For these a
                    lucrative sale was expected at the approaching pilgrimage to Aix-la-Chapelle,
                    which, however, was unfortunately postponed. In 1438 was arranged a partnership
                    between Gutenberg, Andrew Dritzehn, Andrew Heilmann, and Anton Heilmann, and
                    that this concerned the new art of printing appears from the long law
                    proceedings which soon after followed. The action was brought by the brothers of
                    Dritzehn, who was dead, to force Gutenberg to reveal the secrets of the
                    partnership. The decision was in favour of Gutenberg. In January 1441 Gutenberg
                    obtained 80 livres by mortgaging some house property, and again in 1442 he
                    borrowed money of Martin Brether for carrying on his experiments. For four years
                    after this nothing is known of Gutenberg except that his wife paid taxes in his
                    name. He now returned to his native city, Mainz, where he borrowed 100 guilders
                    of his kinsman Arnold Gelthus, and established himself in the house Zum Jungen,
                    which was part of the family possessions. At this time Gutenberg must have been
                    able to show some solid and convincing results of his new invention, for he
                    obtained substantial aid from a shrewd goldsmith, John Fust or Faust, who
                    advanced 800 guilders to promote the work, taking as security a mortgage on all
                    the printing materials to be purchased. Gutenberg at once set to work upon a
                    large folio Latin Bible, the printing of which was ended before August 1455.
                    During the progress of this great undertaking several forms of indulgence and
                    other small things were printed, the earliest with a date being the Indulgence
                    of 1454 in the library at Althorp. But the new art was certainly not a success
                    commercially, and again Fust had to come forward with another 800 guilders to
                    prevent a collapse. In November 1455 Fust determined to dissolve his connexion
                    with Gutenberg, and demanded payment of his advances. Gutenberg not being able
                    to refund so large a sum, Fust took legal proceedings against him, and he was
                    eventually compelled to yield up the whole of the printing materials, which at
                    once were removed by Fust to his own house at Mainz. Here with the assistance of
                    Peter Schöffer he continued to print until the sack of the city in 1462 by
                    Adolphus II. Gutenberg, now in the evening of life, had to make a fresh start in
                    the world, and fortunately in Dr Humery of Mainz found a friend who assisted him
                    with capital. Embarrassment, however, still pursued him, and the press made slow
                    progress. It is uncertain whether the new press of Gutenberg was in Mainz or at
                    the neighbouring town of Eltvill. On January 17, 1465, Gutenberg accepted the
                    post, at the court of Archbishop Adolphus, of salaried courtier. He received
                    annually a suit of livery together with a fixed allowance of corn and wine.
                    Meantime the printing materials were lent to the brothers Bechtermunze, who
                    printed some inconsiderable works, and upon the death of Gutenberg were claimed
                    and taken by Dr Humery. On February 2, 1468, died Gutenberg, poor, childless,
                    and almost friendless, after laying the foundations of an art which was soon to
                    dominate the world. Arnold Gelthus erected a monument to his memory near his
                    grave, and forty years afterwards Ivo Wittig set up a memorial tablet at the
                    legal college in Mainz.</p>

                    engraved plates being all fictitious. The latest authority upon his life and
