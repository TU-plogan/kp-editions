                <p><label type="entry">GUNPOWDER</label></p>
                <p>UPON the great importance of the invention of gunpowder it is needless to dwell.
                    Not only has it revolutionized the art of war, and given the forces of
                    civilization a vast advantage over mere numbers and savage valour, but we may
                    even urge, paradoxical though it appears, that the very improvements by which
                    modern science has rendered military machines more deadly tend to make war far
                    more expensive, and therefore to prevent its being so frequently or so rashly
                    undertaken as of old. Besides such indirect services to civilization, gunpowder
                    has been and is of great use in the arts of peace, although of late years to a
                    certain extent superseded by more potent explosive agents.</p>
                <p>Such being the case, it is not a little remarkable that the discovery of
                    gunpowder should be veiled in uncertainty, although this very obscurity seems
                    proof of its great antiquity. It is, however, certain that it was <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> invented, as has been often stated, by the German monk
                    Bertholdus Schwartz, about 1320, although Wilkinson, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Engines of JΓar,</hi> considers Schwartz may have suggested the use of a
                    mortar, since the form as also the name of this piece of ordnance may well have
                    been due to some accident in the laboratory. Roger Bacon, who was born in 1214,
                    refers, <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 1267, to an explosive mixture of the nature
                    of gunpowder as known before his time, as being employed for purposes of
                    diversion, and as producing a noise like thunder, and flashes like lightning; he
                    even suggests its application to military purposes, and indulges in the
                    supposition that some such composition might have been employed by Gideon to
                    destroy the Midianites (Judges vii.). He elsewhere writes —“Ex hoc ludicro
                    puerili quod fit in multis mundi partibus, scilicet,ut instrumento facto ad
                    quantitatem pollicis humani, ex hoc violentia salis, qui salpetrae vocatur, tam
                    horribilis sonus nascitur in ruptura tam modicae pergamenae, quod fortis tonitru
                    rugitum et coruscationem maximam sui luminis jubar excedit” (see preface to
                    Jebb’s edition of Bacon’s <hi rend="italic">Opus Magus').</hi> In the above
                    passage saltpetre is alone referred to as the violently explosive substance, but
                    Bacon was well aware of the fact that saltpetre of itself will not <hi
                    rend="italic">explode,</hi> for in his previously written treatise, <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Secretis Operibus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Artis</hi><hi rend="italic">et Naturae et de Nullitate Magioe,</hi> he says
                    “that from saltpetre <hi rend="italic">and other ingredients</hi> we are able to
                    make a fire that shall burn at any distance we please.” In chap. xi. of the same
                    work these other ingredients are veiled in the disguise of an anagram: “Sed
                    tamen salis petrae <hi rend="italic">lura</hi><hi rend="italic">nope cum
                    ubre</hi> et sulphuris, et sic facies tonitrum et coruscationem, si scias
                    artificium;” the unmeaning words in italics have been translated as <hi
                    rend="italic">carbonum</hi><hi rend="italic">pulvere.</hi> Robins, in his work
                    on gunnery (1742), and Dutens <hi rend="italic">(Enquiry into the Origin of
                    Discoveries attributed to the Moderns)</hi> suggest that Bacon may have derived
                    his knowledge from the MS. of Marcus Graecus, preserved in the National Library
                    in Paris, entitled “Incipit <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ignium</hi> a Marco Graeco prescriptus, cujus virtus et efficacia est ad
                    comburendum hostes, tam in mari quam in terra.” Marcus Graecus, who lived about
                    the end of the 8th century, was therefore not ignorant of the military uses to
                    which the composition might be put; among other modes of launching fire upon an
                    enemy he gives one to the following effect :— one pound of live sulphur, two of
                    charcoal of willow, and six of saltpetre, reduced to a fine powder in a marble
                    mortar and mixed together; a certain quantity is to be put into a long, narrow,
                    and well compacted cover, and then discharged into the air. This is evidently
                    the description of a rocket. It has also been suggested that Bacon may have
                    learnt the secret in Spain, in which country he is known to have travelled, and
                    whose Moorish masters were then far in advance of the rest of Europe in science
                    and literature. Albertus Magnus, in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mirabilibus</hi><hi rend="italic">Mundi,</hi> repeats almost word
                    for word several receipts in the work of Marcus Graecus; also, an epistle by
                    Ferrarius, a Spanish monk, and a contemporary of Bacon, which is preserved in
                    the Bodleian Library at Oxford, gives receipts for Greek fire, rockets, and
                    “thunder.” There is a treatise on gunpowder in the library of the Escorial,
                    written about 1250, which appears to describe both rockets and shells; the
                    Arabians are, from this and other authorities, supposed to have enclosed
                    combustible or explosive compositions in hollow globes of iron, which were
                    discharged upon the foe either by hand, like the modern grenade, or from the
                    warlike machines then in use; it has also been stated that towards the close of
                    the 13th century they projected small balls from tubes carried in the hand, or
                    attached to the end of a lance, and only used at close quarters, being in fact
                    hand-guns. Rockets were employed during the reign of the Greek emperor Leo,
                    about 880, and indeed seem to have been known in India from time immemorial,
                    some of them having been made of great size.</p>
                <p>The gloom of the dark ages precludes further attempt to trace back the history of
                    gunpowder with any certainty, but Mr Dutens, in the work before quoted, adduces
                    many passages from classical authors in support of his view that a composition
                    of the nature of gunpowder was not unknown to the ancients, as, for example, the
                    story of Salmoneus, king of Elis, who, according to Virgil <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Aeneid,</hi> vi. 585), for his audacity in attempting to imitate thunder and
                    lightning, was slain by Jupiter; Mr Dutens considers he may have fallen a victim
                    to his own experiments. Eustathius, a commentator on Homer, speaks of him as
                    being so skilled in mechanics that he constructed machines to imitate thunder
                    (Eustathius ad <hi rend="italic">Odyss.,</hi> λ 234, p. 1682, 1. 1; see also
                    Hyginus, <hi rend="italic">Fαbul.,</hi> 61, 650; Valerius Flaccus, lib. i. 662).
                    It is also narrated of Caligula by Di·on Cassius <hi rend="italic">(Hist.
                    Eοm.,</hi> “Caligula,” p. 662) that he had machines which imitated thunder and
                    lightning, and emitted stones. See also Johannes Antiochinus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronica apud Peiresciaηa Valesii,</hi> Paris, 1604, p. 804.</p>

                <p>According to Themistius <hi rend="italic">(0rat.,</hi> xxvii. p. 337) the
                    Brahmins had similar machines. Philostratus, in his life of Apollonius Tyanaeus
                    (lib. ii. cap. 14), written about 200 A.D., relates of a people of India,
                    dwelling between the Hyphasis and the Ganges, whose country Alexander never
                    entered: “Their cities he could never have taken, though he had led a thousand
                    as brave as Achilles, or three thousand such as Ajax, to the assault; for they
                    come not out to the field to fight those who attack them, but these holy men,
                    beloved by the gods, overthrow their enemies with tempests and thunderbolts shot
                    from their walls.”</p>
                <p>From the mention by Vitruvius, and in Plutarch’s life of Marcellus, that one of
                    his machines threw large stones with great noise, it has been thought that
                    Archimedes used some explosive composition in the defence of Syracuse.</p>
                <p>The most ancient reference of all is in the Gcntoo code of laws (Halhed’s
                    translation), supposed by some authorities to be coeval with Moses. It runs
                    thus: “The magistrate shall not make war with any deceitful machine, or with
                    poisoned weapons, or with cannon and guns, or any kind of firearms.” The
                    translator remarks that this passage may “serve to renew the suspicion, long
                    since deemed absurd, that Alexander the Great did absolutely meet with some
                    weapons of that kind in India, as a passage from Quintus Curtius seems to
                    ascertain.” The word translated firearms is literally a weapon of fire, and one
                    species of it has been described as a dart or arrow tipped with fire and
                    discharged from a bamboo, so that the reference may not be to any <hi
                    rend="italic">propelling</hi> agent, but merely to some combustible or
                    incendiary composition, of the nature of the so-called Greek fire.</p>
                <p>It is almost certain that those authors who assert that the Arabians used
                    gunpowder at the siege of Mecca, 690 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.t&gt;,,</hi> having
                    derived their knowledge of it from India or China, confound gunpowder with this
                    Greek fire, which seems to have been the generic name given to several different
                    combustible mixtures, although Arabian writers speak of them as Chinese fires.
                    Greek fire was introduced into Constantinople from the East about the year 673;
                    it was discharged upon the enemy by means of various engines of war, or in
                    smaller quantities attached to arrows or darts. The Saracens used it against the
                    Crusaders. Maimbourg, in his <hi rend="italic">History of the Crusades,</hi>
                    describes its effects; and Joinville, who was an eye-witness, says “it was
                    thrown from a petrary, and came forward as large as a barrel of verjuice, with a
                    tail of fire as big as a great sword, making a noise like thunder, and seeming
                    like a dragon flying in the air; the light it gave out from the great quantity
                    of fire rendered the camp as bright as day, and such was the terror it
                    occasioned among the commanders in the army of St Louis that Gautier de Cariel,
                    an experienced and valiant knight, advised that, as often as it was thrown, they
                    should prostrate themselves upon their elbows and knees, and beseech the Lord to
                    deliver them from that danger against which he alone could protect them.”
                    However, its actual destructive effect seems to have been very inadequate to the
                    terror it occasioned. From the account of Geoffrey de Vinesauf, sand and earth,
                    but especially vinegar, appear to have been considered the best extinguishers;
                    water would not put it out. One description of this wildfire was composed of
                    resin, sulphur, naphtha, and probably saltpetre. Bacon states that religious
                    scruples hindered European nations from adopting Greek fire; but if so, they
                    seem to have been gradually overcome, for its use is mentioned by various
                    writers, Anna Comnena, Père Daniel, and Froissart among them. Similar scruples
                    no doubt considerably retarded the introduction of gunpowder; and the fear that
                    its adoption would prove fatal to all knightly gallantry also caused it to be
                    regarded with aversion. Firdousi, the famous Persian poet, describes in his
                    writings what were doubtless the effects of rockets and wildfire discharged upon
                    the enemy, but he ascribes the whole to magic.</p>
                <p>The researches of all authorities seem to point to the Far East as the birthplace
                    of an explosive mixture of the nature of gunpowder; it was used there from time
                    immemorial, although doubtless its application as a propelling agent is of far
                    later date. In all probability, the germ of the science of explosives lay in the
                    accidental discovery of the peculiar properties of the nitre so plentifully
                    found mixed with the soil upon the vast plains of India and China. By means of
                    the charred embers of wood-fires, used for cooking, the two most active
                    ingredients of gunpowder might easily be brought into contact, and, under the
                    action of heat, more or less deflagration would ensue; in fact, the accidental
                    dropping of some of the crude saltpetre into the coals would show its remarkable
                    power of supporting and accelerating combustion. The combination of saltpetre
                    and charcoal in a more or less powerful mixture can therefore be easily
                    conceived, the sulphur being an after addition, and not necessary to cause
                    explosion. Our present gunpowder is only the improvement and perfection of such
                    a mixture. Saltpetre was early known as “Chinese snow,” and some have supposed
                    the use of gunpowder in cannon to have been known in China very soon after, if
                    not before, the Christian era. But this seems to be an error, for Colonel
                    Anderson, C.B., in his book on gunpowder (London, 1862), quotes a conversation
                    held by John Bell of Antermony, who visited Peking in 1721, with the emperor’s
                    general of artillery, to the effect that from their records it had been used in
                    fireworks, die., for about 2000 years, but that its application to the
                    propulsion of shot was a late introduction. Some of their compositions had such
                    names as “devouring fire,” “earth thunder,” Ac. The <hi rend="italic">Institutes
                    of Timur,</hi> written about the middle of the 14 th century, contain no mention
                    of cannon or gunpowder, although full particulars are given of the equipment of
                    his troops; it is, however, related that when Timur engaged the army of Mahmud
                    under the walls of Delhi, men scattered wildfire and flung rockets in every
                    direction. In this connexion it may be noted that, while the use of rockets was
                    of very old date in India, the names given to pieces of artillery under the rule
                    of Baber and the Mogul conquerors of Hindustan almost invariably point to a
                    European, or at least to a Turkish origin. It is also well authenticated that
                    Akbar and Aurungzebe had Englishmen and other Europeans in their service to
                    teach the art of gunnery. The analysis of the gunpowder made by the Chinese in
                    the present day shows a composition almost identical with that employed in
                    Europe, which has only been arrived at after centuries of experience, so that,
                    in all probability, they have corrected their earlier formula from Western
                    sources.</p>
                <p>Whatever obscurity may hang over the early history of gunpowder, it seems most
                    probable that its employment as a propelling agent originated among the Moors or
                    Saracens,—whose civilization for several centuries contrasted forcibly with the
                    intellectual darkness of Christendom,—and from them spread eastward, as well as
                    northward into Europe. Condé <hi rend="italic">(Hist.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dom.</hi><hi rend="italic">Arabs in Spain')</hi> states that Ismail Ben Feraz,
                    king of Grenada, who in 1325 besieged Baza, had among his machines “some that
                    cast globes of fire with resounding thunders and lightnings resembling those of
                    the resistless tempest; all these missiles caused fearful injuries to the walls
                    and towers of the city.” The first reliable contemporary document relative to
                    the use of gunpowder in Europe, a document still in existence, bears date 11th
                    February 1326; it gives authority to the priors, the gonfalonier, and council of
                    twelve of Florence to appoint persons to superintend the manufacture of cannons

                    commune, camps, and territory of the republic.</p>
                <p>If the testimony of John Barbour, archdeacon of Aberdeen, who wrote in 1375, is
                    to be believed, cannon, which he calls “crakys of war,” were employed during the
                    invasion of Scotland by Edward III. in 1327; but they are not mentioned in the
                    accounts of the expenses of this war preserved in the record office. An

                    stated to be of 12 Edward III., 1338, contains several references to small
                    cannon as among the stores of the tower, aud also mentions “un petit barrell de
                    gonpouder le quart’plein.” If authentic, this is certainly the first distinct
                    mention of gunpowder in Great Britain we now possess, but doubts have since been
                    thrown upon the date of this MS. It, however, seems certain, from a contemporary
                    document in the National Library in Paris, that, in this same year 1338, there
                    existed in the marine arsenal at Rouen, an iron weapon, called “pot de fer,” for
                    propelling bolts, together with some saltpetre and sulphur to make powder for
                    the same; at this period the ingredients were usually kept separate, and mixed
                    when required. From the year 1345, 19 Edward III., we have, preserved in the
                    Record Office, reliable accounts of the purchase of ingredients needed for the
                    fabrication of gunpowder, and of the shipping of cannon for France. In 1346
                    Edward III. ordered all the saltpetre and sulphur that could be found to be
                    bought up for him, but the quantities obtained were very small. Whether it be
                    true or not that cannon were used by the English at Crécy in that year belongs
                    rather to the question of the employment of artillery in the field; it has been
                    maintained that such was the case by Napoleon III. <hi rend="italic">(Études sur

                    rend="italic">utriιιsque</hi><hi rend="italic">fortunae,</hi> speaks of “brazen

                    having become as common as any other kind of weapon.</p>
                <p>In the year 1377, being the first of Richard II., Thomas Norbury was ordered to
                    buy, amongst other munitions, sulphur, saltpetre, and charcoal to be sent to the
                    castle of Brest. In 1414 Henry V. ordered that no gunpowder should be taken out
                    of the kingdom without special licence; in the same year this monarch also
                    ordered twenty pipes of powder made of willow charcoal, and various other
                    articles for the use of the guns.</p>
                <p>It was not, however, until the reign of Elizabeth that the manufacture of
                    gunpowder can be said to have been established in England. The greater portion
                    required had been previously imported from abroad, and the trade had been an
                    open one; but the threatening attitude of Spain compelled the Government to
                    provide more efficient means of defence, and patents were issued by the crown
                    for the manufacture of gunpowder, constituting it a monopoly. Early in this
                    reign also, saltpetre began to be artificially produced in England, but the
                    quantity so obtained formed a very small proportion of the supply needed, the
                    remainder being brought from various parts of the Continent, and from Barbary.
                    Again, in 1623, nominally in order to prevent the sale of weak or defective
                    powder, a proclamation was issued by James I., prohibiting its manufacture, as
                    well as that of saltpetre, except under the king’s commission, and directing
                    that all gunpowder should be proved and marked by the sworn proof-master. A
                    little later, in 1626, the East India Company had commenced the importation of
                    saltpetre, and had also erected powder works in Surrey. Their renewed charter in
                    1693 contained a clause providing that 500 tons of saltpetre were to be
                    furnished to the ordnance annually, and from this time forward we hear of no
                    difficulty, at least in England, of obtaining the chief ingredient of gunpowder,
                    although on the Continent great attention has been paid to its artificial
                    production; this was especially the case in France during the reign of Napoleon
                    I., when the supremacy of Great Britain at sea for many years prevented the
                    importation of saltpetre by her enemies.</p>
                <p>About the year 1590, George Evelyn, grandfather of the celebrated John Evelyn of
                    Wooton, received the royal licence to set up powder mills at Long Ditton and
                    Godstone; the Evelyns are said to have brought the art from Holland. The works
                    at Faversham, afterwards for so many years the Government gunpowder factory,
                    date from Elizabeth’s reign, but were then of secondary importance to those at
                    Godstone. There seems reason, however, to suppose that powder mills existed at
                    Waltham Abbey so far back as 1561, for in that year we find John Thomworth of
                    Waltham in treaty, on behalf of Queen Elizabeth, for the purchase of saltpetre,
                    sulphur, and staves for barrels. Fuller also refers <hi rend="italic">(English
                    Worthies,</hi> i. 338) to the powder mills at Waltham Abbey, of which place lie
                    was appointed vicar in 1641. In 1787 they were sold to the crown by John Walton,
                    and reorganized under the superintendence of the famous Sir William Congreve.
                    The old royal factory at Faversham was given up after the peace of 1815, being
                    first let and afterwards sold to the well-known firm of Messrs John Hall &amp;
                    Son; a third Government factory at Ballincollig was disposed of a few years
                    later. The Waltham Abbey works have been greatly enlarged of recent years, and
                    no expense has been spared to render them, by the introduction of new and
                    improved machinery, the most complete as well as the safest in the world. It is
                    impossible to describe in detail the various improvements which have been made
                    in the manu facture of gunpowder, but the most important will be briefly stated
                    when describing the successive processes to which the ingredients are
                    subjected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Ingredients and their Action.</hi></p>
                <p>The objects to be attained in the production of an explosive agent for artillery
                    and small arms are— <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> the maximum of propelling force;
                    (δ) the minimum of <hi rend="italic">initial</hi> pressure in the bore of gun;
                    (c) uniformity of action; <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> freedom from fouling,
                    especially in small-arm powders; <hi rend="italic">(e)</hi> durability, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> power to bear transport and keep well in store. Of all
                    explosive substances at present known, gunpowder alone can be said to fulfil the
                    first three conditions. Its advantages may be summed up as follows :—(a) the
                    rate of combustion of gunpowder is gradual compared with that of most other
                    explosives; and, both by adjusting the proportions of the ingredients and
                    varying the mechanical processes of manufacture, its explosiveness can be
                    modified so as to suit every description of weapon; (δ) the ingredients are
                    easily procured, and are comparatively cheap; (c) with proper precautions, it is
                    comparatively safe in manufacture, in store, and in transport; it also keeps
                    well in a moderately dry atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The earliest gunpowder used in cannon in Europe consisted of equal parts of
                    saltpetre, charcoal, and sulphur, ground up and mixed together as required, and
                    must have proved a mixture far inferior in strength to that given in the MS. of
                    Marcus Graecus. To account for the use of such a very weak composition long
                    after better proportions had been ascertained, it must be remembered that the
                    earliest cannon were composed of iron staves roughly hooped together'; and tubes
                    of thin iron, or even of wood or leather, with rope coiled round them, were
                    sometimes used. Indeed the effective application of gunpowder as a propelling
                    agent involves a whole series of inventions, and it was doubtless chiefly owing
                    to the backward state of mechanical science during the Middle Ages that such
                    weak powders were employed. The slow growth of artillery science in Europe <pb

                    very recent years, are facts which support this presumption. Even about 1410 the
                    proportions were still but 3 saltpetre, 2 sulphur, and 2 charcoal. The relative
                    amount of saltpetre was gradually increased, and Tartaglia <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Quesiti</hi><hi rend="italic">e Inventioni diversi,</hi> Venice, 1546)
                    mentions twenty-three various compositions as having been used at different
                    times; the gunpowders of his days were—</p>

                <p>It is remarkable that Robins states the above proportions to have been very
                    nearly those of his own day (1742), for there is a great deficiency of saltpetre
                    in the cannon powder, and a considerable excess in that for muskets, compared
                    with the relative quantities now employed in England. For a long period of time
                    it was the custom for the fine grain or musket powder to contain a larger
                    proportion of saltpetre than that for cannon; and, again, the amount of nitre
                    was relatively reduced as the piece of ordnance became heavier, doubtless with
                    the view of obtaining a slower burning powder for large charges. However, we
                    find that by the latter part of the last century, what was called “common war
                    powder” was almost universally composed of 6 saltpetre, 1 charcoal, and 1
                    sulphur, and these are the proportions still in use by many Continental nations
                    (D’Antoni <hi rend="italic">On Gunpowder,</hi> translated by Capt. Thompson,
                    R.A., London, 1787).</p>
                <p>So far back as the 16th century, Baptista Porta is said to have arrived at the
                    proportions now used in France, which, however, were certainly not adopted until
                    a comparatively recent period. Exhaustive experiments have also been carried out
                    in that country by Beaurné, the Committee of Public Safety, Chaptai, and Proust,
                    who fixed upon percentages of saltpetre varying from 76 to 80, of charcoal from
                    13 to 16, and sulphur from 5 to 9. These may seem to give rather a wide margin,
                    but this will surprise no one who is acquainted with the great differences in
                    results given by comparatively slight variations in the conditions of
                    experiment, with powder of the sam·e composition. In the British Government
                    service but one scale of proportions has been employed for many years, and the
                    very extensive trials of the “Committee on explosives” have shown that there is
                    no good reason to depart from that scale; for they have conclusively
                    demonstrated that the variations in the mechanical and physical properties of
                    gunpowder, produced by the processes of manufacture, exert even more influence
                    upon its action than a comparatively considerable difference in composition;
                    this does not, however, apply to the small charges used in firearms. It will be
                    seen, moreover, that one of the three ingredients—charcoal—can be so varied in
                    <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> as very materially to affect the results.</p>

                <p>The proportions of the ingredients in English commercial gunpowders vary
                    considerably according to the market for which they are intended. * The best
                    sporting powders have about the same composition as those made by Government.
                    Wherever cheapness is the chief object in view, the quantity of nitre is
                    diminished, and the other two components relatively increased. Some of the
                    powder for the African trade, commonly called “nigger powder,” does not contain
                    much more than 50 per cent, of saltpetre, while other kinds are nearly as bad.
                    Blasting powder contains a low proportion of saltpetre, from 60 to 62 per cent.;
                    but, although this reduction may originally have been made in order to
                    manufacture a cheaper article, yet it is also the most effective for the object
                    desired in many cases, which is to remove large masses of earth or soft rock,
                    and this can best be done by using a comparatively weak or slow-burning powder.
                    The element of time is here of great importance; a very quick-burning or violent
                    explosive would not displace such large masses of a soft material, although the
                    local effect would be more destructive (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Blasting</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Explosives).</hi></p>
                <p>Before proceeding further, it will be as well briefly to consider the properties
                    of the three ingredients of which gunpowder is composed, and the part played by
                    each.</p>
                <p>Saltpetre, or nitrate of potash (KNO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>), occurs as a
                    natural production on or near the surface of the earth in several warm climates,
                    especially the plains of India and China. When it arrives in England, it has
                    only been partially separated from the earthy and foreign saline matters with
                    which it was combined when found, and is quite unfit for the manufacture of
                    gunpowder; the salts of sodium especially, from their property of absorbing
                    moisture, are most injurious. In this state the saltpetre is known as “grough”
                    nitre, the impurities commonly present being the chlorides of potassium and
                    sodium, and the sulphates of potash, soda, and lime, together with sand and
                    organic matter; they do not usually exceed 5 tt&gt; per cwt., the exact
                    proportion of impurities in any sample being termed the “refraction” of the
                    saltpetre, and allowed for in the price. The nitrate of soda, called “cubical
                    nitre” or Chili saltpetre, which is found abundantly in South America, although
                    chemically adapted to supply the place of potassium nitrate, cannot be employed
                    in the manufacture of gunpowder, owing to its very deliquescent properties. This
                    salt is, however, largely converted into saltpetre by the action of chloride of
                    potassium. In France and Germany, also, nitre is produced artificially (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Saltpetre).</hi></p>
                <p>Saltpetre, which is a compound of 54 parts of nitric acid and 46 of potash, acts
                    as a magazine of oxygen in a solid form, one volume of saltpetre containing as
                    much oxygen as about 3000 volumes of atmospheric air. This oxygen, with which it
                    readily parts when raised to a certain temperature, combines violently with the
                    carbon to form carbonic acid and a proportion of carbonic oxide; these with free
                    nitrogen constitute the chief gaseous products of combustion. The potassium is
                    found combined in the solid residue.</p>
                <p>Wood charcoal is the charred woody fibre or residue which remains after the
                    liquid and more volatile parts have been driven off by destructive distillation.
                    The object of charring wood is the removal of moisture, and, which is of great
                    importance, the expulsion of those matters which become volatile before they are
                    burned, and which would absorb a large amount of heat. It may be charred in the
                    ordinary way in pits; but the usual mode of preparing charcoal for gunpowder is
                    by heating it in large iron cylinders or retorts, as hereafter described. By
                    this latter method, the operation is performed with more uniformity and economy,
                    and the charcoal kept more free from particles of grit orearthy matter. Charcoal
                    is best fitted for the manufacture of gunpowder when prepared from light spoDgy
                    wood, containing a very small proportion of mineral substances; it should be
                    sound, and of not much more than ten <pb break="no"

                    exercises the greatest influence upon the rate of combustion, so that both the
                    description of wood used and the mode of burning are of the utmost
                    importance.</p>
                <p>By a series of experiments first made by Proust, and since repeated by English
                    chemists, it has been found that 12 grains of various charcoals, mixed with 60
                    grains of saltpetre, give the following average volumes of gas :—</p>

                <p>The production of the strongest powder does not depend alone upon the evolution
                    of the largest volume of gas, but the above table is of interest since the three
                    descriptions of wood which head the list have long been considered by universal
                    consent as the best adapted for the manufacture of charcoal for gunpowder.
                    Dogwood (so-called, but in reality it is alder-buckthorn, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phamnus Prangula,</hi> the French <hi rend="italic">bourdaine)</hi> is an
                    underwood of slow growth, usually obtained from Sussex, Belgium, or Prussia; it
                    is cut about an inch in diameter, and packed in bundles 6 feet long. This wood
                    is now used, both in England and on the Continent, for all military small-arm
                    powders, as well as the best descriptions of sporting gunpowder. It has been
                    found, moreover, that cannon powders made from dogwood charcoal are, other
                    things being equal, much more violent in action than those manufactured with
                    willow or alder charcoal. Accidents with powder made from dogwood charcoal have
                    usually proved more destructive than those made with any other description.
                    Alder and willow charcoal is used for making gunpowders for field and heavy
                    ordnance, as well as for the commoner kinds of commercial powders; these woods
                    are obtained from various parts of England, and should measure about 4 inches in
                    diameter. The willow used is the <hi rend="italic">Salix alba,</hi> one of the
                    softest and lightest of English woods, white in colour, and of very rapid
                    growth; the pith is circular, and tolerably large. Alder is considerably harder
                    and denser in texture, and of slower growth; its colour is reddish-yellow, and
                    the small pith triangular or bayonetshaped in section. Dogwood has a very large
                    pith in proportion to its size, circular, and of a red colour, which is
                    preserved even after the wood is converted into charcoal.</p>
                <p>The temperature at which the wood is charred exercises the most powerful
                    influence upon the inflammability of the charcoal, and consequently upon the
                    “explosiveness,” or rate of combustion, of the gunpowder made from it. The
                    higher the temperature the larger the proportion of hydrogen and oxygen
                    expelled, and the nearer the approach of the charcoal to pure carbon; at the
                    same time, it becomes more dense and incombustible, and the gunpowder made from
                    it is comparatively slow in action, and gives a low initial velocity Charcoal
                    prepared at a low temperature is softer and more inflammable, and contains more
                    volatile constituents; it makes a quicker burning powder, giving a higher
                    velocity to the projectile, but also producing more strain or pressure upon the
                    metal of the gun. The chief defect, however, of this “slack-burnt” charcoal, or
                    <hi rend="italic">charbon roux,</hi> as it is called from its reddish-brown
                    colour, is its property of absorbing moisture more readily than denser charcoal;
                    the powder manufactured from it is consequently more hygroscopic, and therefore
                    more liable to deteriorate in strength from the effects of damp than that made
                    with a more highly burnt charcoal. To show the great difference in
                    inflammability caused by burning at low and high temperatures respectively, it
                    may be stated that charcoal prepared at 500° Fahr, readily ignites at about
                    640°, while, if burnt at 1800° Fahr., nearly double the heat previously
                    mentioned is required to inflame it. The following table exhibits concisely the
                    practical effects of different modes of preparing charcoal for gunpowder, the
                    same kind of wood being used in each case; it shows (a) the analysis of the
                    charcoals, and (6) the comparative initial velocities and pressures given by
                    powders made in a precisely similar manner from those charcoals.</p>

                <p>For the manufacture of gunpowder, only the crystalline electro-negative variety
                    of sulphur soluble in bisulphide of carbon (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Chemistry,</hi> vol. v. p. 498) is used. Sublimed sulphur, commonly called
                    “flowers of sulphur,” which consists of minute granules of insoluble sulphur
                    enclosing the soluble variety,is considered unfit for gunpowder; the reason
                    assigned has usually been that, from the mode of manufacture, it is impregnated
                    with sulphurous and sulphuric acids, but Professor Bloxam points out that in all
                    probability it is the fact of the sublimed sulphur consisting of the
                    electro-positive insoluble variety, which exerts an injurious influence upon the
                    gunpowder made from it. Sulphur performs the part of a second “combustible” in
                    gunpowder; but there is no doubt that its chief value as an ingredient thereof
                    arises from its great inflammability, owing to its tendency to combine with
                    oxygen at a moderate temperature; it inflames at about 560° Fahr., thus
                    facilitating the ignition of the powder. Its oxidation by saltpetre appears also
                    to produce a higher temperature than is obtained with charcoal, thus
                    accelerating combustion, and increasing by expansion the volume of gas
                    generated. An excess of sulphur would, however, be injurious by increasing the
                    solid residue, in which the sulphur is found combined in various forms after the
                    explosion. Some authorities have considered that, from its non-absorbent
                    properties, sulphur renders gunpowder less hygroscopic, and more compact and
                    durable.</p>
                <p>Powders made from exactly the same materials, mixed in the same proportions, yet
                    differ greatly in “explosiveness,” which has been defined as the rate at which
                    the powder burns or is converted into gas. This quality will depend chiefly upon
                    the following properties :—(a) extent of incorporation; <hi rend="italic"
                    >(b)</hi> the density of the powder; (c) its hardness; (J) size of the grains or
                    pieces; (e) shape of the grains; (∕) amount of glaze. Although not altogether
                    synonymous with strength, we may consider “explosiveness” as the quality upon
                    which the value of gunpowder for any particular purpose chiefly depends.</p>
                <p>Next to the selection of the precise description of charcoal to be used, no point
                    in the manufacture of gunpowder requires such care and attention as the thorough
                    intermixture of the ingredients,—the object being in fact to form out of the
                    three components a new substance as nearly homogeneous as possible. It is
                    usually considered that there is a limit of time beyond which no advantage is
                    gained by continuing the “milling” or incorporating process; but it is certain
                    that nothing that can be done to the powder afterwards will add to its strength,
                    although we may modify its explosiveness, and that the very best powders,
                    especially for small-arms, are milled the longest time. This question will be
                    further treated under the head of manufacture.</p>

                <p>No physical property affects the explosiveness of gunpowder as much as its
                    density. By density we mean the quantity of matter actually present in a certain
                    bulk of the powder. Thus, if different quantities of meal powder, containing the
                    same proportion of moisture, be compressed into equal bulks, say, for example,
                    into cylinders of equal size, that which contains the most meal will be the
                    densest. Hardness has not necessarily a relation to density, for a substance may
                    be hard, and yet possess little density. Increase of density can only be given
                    by compressing the meal into a smaller bulk, while increase of hardness can be
                    arrived at by pressing the meal in a moister condition.</p>
                <p>Other things being equal,' increasing the density decreases the initial velocity,
                    and, <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> a less dense powder gives a higher
                    velocity, but also a greater strain to the metal of the gun. This is due to the
                    less dense powder burning more rapidly than that with a dense close texture. If
                    two grains, or pieces of powder, of equal size and similar shape but very
                    unequal density, be burnt upon a glass plate, the less dense one will be
                    entirely consumed before the denser one has finished burning.</p>
                <p>Freedom from fouling is a very important property in small-arm powders. From the
                    experience gained in selecting a powder for the Martini-Henry rifle, it was
                    found that, with the same description of charcoal, the slower the action of the
                    charge the less fouling took place; this modification of action was easily
                    obtained by raising the density, at, however, a corresponding sacrifice of
                    velocity in the bullet. The reason assigned was that the quicker-burning powder
                    caused a rush of gas past the lubricating wad before the latter had time to act
                    properly. A dense hard powder which will take a high polish or glaze will
                    evidently keep better, and bear transport better, than a more porous and
                    therefore more friable grain, which would easily form dust. It will thus be seen
                    that many considerations enter into this question of density.</p>
                <p>The size of grain is one of the most important points to be considered as
                    modifying the explosiveness of powder. Although a charge of powder appears to
                    explode instantaneously, yet both ignition and combustion are comparatively
                    gradual; the flame is communicated from one grain to another, and each burns in
                    concentric layers until it is consumed, so that the combustion of the grains is
                    not <hi rend="italic">simultaneous.</hi> Meal-powder burns more slowly in air
                    than when the powder is granulated, in consequence of the minuteness of the
                    interstices; dust, especially in fine-grain powder, retards ignition by filling
                    up the interstices. To go to the other extreme, as showing the advantage gained
                    by granulating the press-cake, we may quote an experiment made some years ago. A
                    small piece weighing 1Ό6 oz. waβ placed in a mortar, and a light ball placed
                    upon it; when it was fired, the ball was not thrown out. An equal quantity
                    broken into 15 pieces, projected the ball 3 ’ 3 yards; broken into 50 pieces,
                    the ball ranged 10*77 yards; when the same weight of ordinary grained powder was
                    used, the range was 56 ’ 86 yards. It is most unsafe to attempt to apply to the
                    action of gunpowder, when fired under enormous pressure, and especially when
                    employed in large charges, the conclusions arrived at from its combustion in
                    air. We may, however, assert that the weight of charge, the density, and all
                    other conditions being equal, a charge made up of large grains or pieces of
                    gunpowder will burn more slowly, and exert a lesser <hi rend="italic"
                    >initial</hi> strain upon the gun than one composed of small grains, owing to
                    the total surface of combustion being diminished by increasing the size of the
                    pieces; this has been abundantly verified by the results of experiments with
                    heavy rifled ordnance. On the other hand, the larger grains afford larger
                    interstices between them for the passage of the flame, thus facilitating the
                    ignition of large charges. Hence, a gunpowder may possess a low rate of
                    combustion and yet a high rate of ignition, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> For each guu, or charge of gunpowder, there is doubtless a size of
                    grain which would produce a maximum velocity with a minimum initial strain, but
                    as each kind of cannon powder has to be employed in more than one piece of
                    ordnance, it is necessary to select that size which will best suit all of
                    them.</p>
                <p>The same quantity of powder meal made into two grains of equal density, but
                    different shapes, will take different times to burn; the larger the surface
                    exposed the quicker will be the combustion of the grain. A sphere being the
                    smallest form in which a given quantity of matter can be placed, it follows that
                    a certain amount of meal powder compressed into a spherical form will take
                    longer to burn than the same quantity made into the shape of a flat scale,
                    exposing a large surface. The rounded form of grain is the most favourable for
                    the transmission of the flame, the interstices being larger and more regular
                    than in the case of elongated or flat grains fitting into one another. Hence we
                    may conclude that, to secure <hi rend="italic">uniformity,</hi> it is better to
                    have the constituent grains as nearly as possible of the same shape, and the
                    nearer this shape approaches a sphere the better.</p>
                <p>The glazing process is one of considerable importance, both with reference to the
                    explosiveness,and also the keeping qualities of the gunpowder. As regards the
                    former point, it undoubtedly modifies the violence of the combustion, and this
                    it probably does by slightly retarding the ignition, a powder with a rough
                    porous surface affording a better hold to the flame than one possessing a highly
                    polished exterior. With the large “cubical” powder, used for heavy rifled
                    ordnance, there is little or no appearance of what is commonly understood as <hi
                    rend="italic">glaze,</hi> or polish, from this process, but the corners and
                    edges of the cubes are rubbed off, and the shape approximates more nearly to
                    that of a sphere than is the case with the much lighter fine-grain powder; there
                    seems to be also a certain hardening of the surface of the grains or pieces,
                    partly the effects of friction, but probably due in part to the <hi
                    rend="italic">sweating</hi> the powder undergoes, a considerable amount of heat
                    being generated in the glazing barrels. It is evident that, by taking away the
                    sharp angles which would otherwise easily be converted into dust, and also by
                    giving the grains a harder exterior, this process renders gunpowder the better
                    able to bear transport, and to resist the deteriorating effect of a damp
                    atmosphere. The addition of a thin coating of the purest graphite to cannon
                    powders, although originally intended merely to modify the explosiveness, also
                    renders the surface of the grains less absorbent. Military small-arm powders are
                    never dressed with graphite; good fine-grain gunpowder will take a high finish
                    without it, but, by its aid, a very inferior article can be polished up to a
                    silvery brightness.</p>
                <p>Moisture in gunpowder reduces the explosiveness by using up a portion of the heat
                    generated by the combustion, to get rid of the water; therefore the property of
                    withstanding the absorption of moisture is a very important one for gunpowder to
                    possess. All powder will take up from a normally dry atmosphere a certain amount
                    of moisture, which will depend to some extent upon its density, but to a much
                    greater degree upon the description of charcoal from which it is made.
                    Slack-burnt or red charcoal is greatly more hygroscopic than black charcoal, or
                    that burnt at a high temperature; and the absorbent properties of gunpowder made
                    from the former are but little reduced by raising the density. Large cannon
                    powder contains a greater percentage of water than the fine grain, and the
                    actual amount present in any given sample will be affected by the prevailing
                    state of the atmosphere, especially if kept in wooden barrels. To show the
                    considerable effect upon the initial velocity of projectile, and pressure in

                <p>Keeping gunpowder in a very damp atmosphere will tend to separate the ingredients
                    by dissolving a portion of the saltpetre, which crystallizes upon the surface of
                    the grains or pieces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fired Gunpowder.</hi></p>
                <p>In the explosion of gunpowder, the products of combustion are very materially
                    affected by the conditions under which it is fired,—whether burnt in the open
                    air, exploded Under very great pressure in a tightly closed vessel, or the
                    products allowed to expand in the bore of a gun. It may, however, be stated
                    generally that the oxygen of the saltpetre converts nearly all the carbon of the
                    charcoal into caτbonic acid (CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), a portion of
                    which combines with the potash of the nitre to form carbonate of potash (K <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O.CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), the remainder
                    existing in the state of gas. The sulphur is for the most part converted into
                    sulphuric acid (SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>), and forms sulphate of potash,
                    a large proportion of which, probably by secondary reactions, becomes
                    hyposulphite and sulphide. The nitrogen of the saltpetre is almost entirely
                    evolved in the free state, and the carbon not having been wholly burnt into
                    carbonic acid, there is always a proportion of carbonic oxide (CO) present.</p>
                <p>The decomposition is so complicated, and varies so considerably under different
                    conditions of experiment, that it is impossible to represent the transformation

                <p>There is a very large proportion of residue, which, on cooling, assumes the <hi
                    rend="italic">solid</hi> form. The experiments of Noble and Abel prove that it
                    is <hi rend="italic">liquid</hi> very shortly after the explosion; indeed, it is
                    probable that at the moment of maximum temperature, the ultimately solid
                    products are more or less in a state of vapour, being deposited in a very finely
                    divided state as the temperature falls.</p>
                <p>When a charge of gunpowder is exploded in the chamber of a gun, a large quantity
                    of gaseous matter is evolved in a highly condensed state;—its tension, or
                    expansive power, Ï3, moreover, greatly increased by the heat generated during
                    the transformation. The pressure being equal in all directions, the work done
                    upon the projectile is due to the expansion of the permanent gases in the bore
                    of the gun, which force is also considerably sustained—or the reduction of
                    temperature due to the expansion in great measure compensated for—by the heat
                    stored up in the ultimately solid residue. Any calculation which does not take
                    this latter point into consideration will give far too low an estimate of the
                    actual force of fired gunpowder (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Explosives).</hi></p>
                <p>With our present state of knowledge, it may be stated in round numbers that the
                    gases evolved by gunpowder, <hi rend="italic">if it entirely fills the close
                    vessel</hi> in which it is exploded, will occupy at a temperature of 0° C. and
                    760 mm. barometric pressure, about 280 times the volume of the original powder,
                    and will give a pressure of about 6000 atmospheres, or 40 tons per square
                    inch.</p>
                <p>In view of the very different results which have been arrived at by various
                    eminent authorities who have experimented upon fired gunpowder, the following
                    brief account of their researches may be useful :—</p>
                <p>Bobins, the father of scientific gunnery, in 1743 read before the Royal Society a
                    paper describing experiments which showed that gunpowder, when fired, generated
                    permanent gases, which, at the ordinary temperature and atmospheric pressure,
                    occupied a volume 244 times greater than that of the unexploded powder. He
                    further considered that the heat evolved was such that the tension of the
                    permanent gases would be increased fourfold, and hence deduced the maximum
                    pressure to be about 1000 atmospheres. In 1778 Dr Hutton communicated in the
                    same manner an account of his celebrated researches on the combustion of powder;
                    he deduced the maximum pressure to be about twice that given by Robins, or a
                    little over 2000 atmospheres, differing from the latter chiefly as to the
                    temperature, for he considered that the volume of gases generated would occupy,
                    under ordinary conditions, 250 times that of the powder. He also deduced
                    formulae for giving the pressure of the gas and velocity of the projectile at
                    any point of the bore, but no allowance is made for the loss of heat in
                    proportion to the work done, that fundamental principle of thermodynamics being
                    then unknown; the error thus occasioned is, however, in part compensated for by
                    the heat stored up in the non-gaseous products. In 1797 Count Rumford sent to
                    the Royal Society his experimental determinations of the pressures given by
                    fired gunpowder, which are remarkable as being the first attempt to do this by
                    direct observation. The closed vessel he used was, however, very small, being
                    able to hold but 28 grains when filled, and he only succeeded in measuring the
                    results up to a charge of 18 grains. His plan of operation was to ascertain by
                    repeated trial the least weight which would just confine the products of
                    explosion, and thence to calculate the pressure; this he deduced from two series
                    of experiments, which, however, gave some very anomalous results, to be as high
                    as 100,000 atmospheres for gunpowder exploded in its own space. In 1823
                    Gay-Lussac, the celebrated French chemist, estimated the volume of the permanent
                    gases evolved at 450 times that of the powder fired, but General Piobert assigns
                    very probable reasons for supposing the quantity of gas determined to have been
                    doubled in error. Gay-Lussac found the percentage composition of the gaseous
                    products to be 52 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 carbonic acid, 5 of carbonic
                    oxide, and 42 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4 nitrogen. In 1857 Bunsen and
                    Schiskoff published <hi rend="italic">(Pοggendοrff</hi><hi rend="italic

                    cii. p. 325) the results of their very important experiments; their
                    determinations were—(1) that the permanent gases represented only about 32 per
                    cent, of the weight of the charge, and occupied at the standard temperature and
                    pressure about 193 times the volume of the original powder; (2) that the heat
                    generated by exploding gunpowder in a close chamber is about 3340° C.; and (3)
                    that hence the pressure would be about 4374 atmospheres, or 29 tons per square
                    inch. Major Rodman (Boston, 1861) published the results of extensive experiments
                    carried on for the United States Government, in order to ascertain the pressures
                    given by different powders in the bores of heavy guns. He employed a pressure
                    gauge, which bears his name, and consists mainly of a piston to which is
                    attached a knife edge acting upon a piece of soft copper, contained in a small
                    cylinder at right angles to, and communicating with, the bore of the gun; this
                    apparatus he also used to ascertain the pressure given by powder exploded in a
                    closed vessel. The chief value of his experiments consists in their having
                    established the fact that the size of the grain should be proportionate to the
                    length and diameter of the bore of the gun. Von Karolyi <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pοggendοrjfs</hi><hi rend="italic">Annalen,</hi> April 1863) carried out
                    experiments from which he estimated that, for small-arm powder, the gases
                    evolved occupied about 226 times the original volume, while cannon powder
                    produced about 200 volumes. Captain Andrew Noble, F.R.S., of Elswick, and
                    Professor Abel, C.B., F.R.S., chemist to the British War Department, carried out
                    a most extensive series of experiments on “Fired Gunpowder” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{PhU. Trans. Royal Soc.,</hi> 1875), probably the most complete ever made, and
                    undertaken collaterally with the Government “Committee on Explosives;” their
                    mean results may be summed up as follows .</p>
                <p>(A.) <hi rend="italic">When Fired in a Confined Space.—</hi> The products of
                    combustion are about 57 per cent, by weight of <hi rend="italic">ultimately</hi>
                    solid matter, and 43 per cent, of permanent gases. (2) The latter occupy at 0°
                    C. and 760 mm. barometric pressure about 280 times the volume of the original
                    powder. (3) The tension of the products σf combustion, when the powder entirely
                    fills the space in which it is fired, is about 6400 atmospheres, or 42 tons per
                    square inch. (4) The temperature of explosion is about 2200° C. (5) The chief
                    gaseous products are carbonic acid, nitrogen, and carbonic oxide, with a little
                    sulphydric acid and hydrogen. (6) The solid residue is mainly composed of
                    potassium carbonate, sulphate, iiyposulphate, and sulphide.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n342/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0342-0323"/>
                <p>(B.) <hi rend="italic">When Fired in the Bore of a Gun.—</hi> (1) The products of
                    combustion, at all events so far as regards the proportions of solid and gaseous
                    matters, are the same as in the case of powder fired in a close vessel. (2) The
                    work on the projectile is effected by the elastic force due to the permanent
                    gases. (3) The reduction of temperature due to the expansion of the permanent
                    gases is in a great measure compensated by the heat stored up in the liquid
                    (afterwards solid) residue. (4) An expression is obtained showing the law
                    connecting the tension of the products of combustion with the volume they
                    occupy. (5) Equations are also deduced for the work that gunpowder is capable of
                    peforming in expanding in a vessel impervious to heat, and for the temperature
                    during expansion. Thence the experimenters give a table showing the total work
                    gunpowder is capable of performing in the bore of a gun, in terms of the density
                    of the products of combustion, or the number of volumes of expansion. (6) The
                    total theoretic work of gunpowder when indefinitely expanded (for example, in a
                    gun of infinite length) is about 486 foot-tons per pound of powder.</p>
                <p>They further ascertained that—(a) the fine-grain powders furnish decidedly
                    smaller portions of gaseous products than large grain or cannon gunpowders; (δ)
                    the variations in the composition of the products of explosion, in a close
                    vessel, furnished by one and the same powder under different conditions as
                    regards pressure, and by two powders of similar composition under the same
                    conditions of pressure, are so considerable that no chemical expression can be
                    given for the metamorphosis of a gunpowder of normal composition; and (c) the
                    proportions of the several constituents of the solid residue are quite as much
                    effected by slight accidental conditions of explosion of one and the same powder
                    in different experiments as by decided differences in the composition, as well
                    as in the size of grain of different powders. It may, however, be remarked here
                    that, while the pressures given in the bore of a gun are very seriously affected
                    by the size of the grains or pieces of the powder, it was clearly demonstrated
                    by these experiments that the <hi rend="italic">force exerted by fired
                    gunpowder</hi> is not affected by the apparent accidental variations in the
                    nature of the secondary chemical changes resulting from the explosions; this
                    fact renders the exact composition of the products of combustion of less
                    practical importance.</p>

                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> As before stated, Piobert gives reasons for
                    halving these figures.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Saint Robert determined experimentally the amount of work lost by the heat
                    communicated to the gun to be about 250 gramme-units per gramme of powder <hi
                    rend="italic">in the case of a rifled musket.</hi> From the experiments of Noble
                    and Abel this loss becomes reduced to as little as 25 gramme-units per gramme of
                    powder in a 10-inch gun. They have also calculated the energy in foot-tons from
                    the initial velocity obtained, and hence deduced the percentage of the possible
                    theoretic work which is actually realized for every rifled gun in the British
                    service. This percentage, which they term the “factor of effect,” is found to be
                    greatest, viz., 93 per cent., in the case of the 38-ton gun, and least, 50 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5 per cent., in the 7-pounder mountain gun, weighing
                    150 lb.</p>
                <p>To determine the pressures, Noble, and Abel employed two methods :—(1) <hi
                    rend="italic">directly,</hi> by means of “crusher gauges,” inserted at various
                    points of the bore; this is an improvement on the Rodman piston-gauge, the
                    pressure being estimated by the amount of compression given to a small cylinder
                    of pure soft copper; (2) <hi rend="italic">indirectly,</hi> by means of the
                    chronoscope invented by Captain A. Noble, which measures the velocity of the
                    projectile at given points in the bore, whence the pressure can be calculated
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gunnery).</hi> These pressures will vary greatly,
                    other conditions being the same, according to the “explosiveness ’ of the
                    powder; the great object is to obtain a powder suited to the particular arm with
                    which it is to be used.</p>
                <p>Many foreign physicists are of opinion that the phenomenon of <hi rend="italic"

                    carbonic oxide (CO) and oxygen. However, Noble and Abel show that, if such be
                    supposed to occur, the loss of heat absorbed by the decomposition would more

                <p>The three ingredients of gunpowder may be purchased in the market in a prepared
                    or refined state, and this is done to a greater or less extent by many powder
                    makers. However, the royal gunpowder factory, as well as some of the great
                    private firms, prepare *κ PvZ <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> ιθ∙ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> mater</hi> ials required from the commencement, with the
                    double object of insuring uniformity in the qualities of the powders made, and
                    of avoiding, so far as practicable, the introduction of the least particle of
                    grit or other foreign matters, which might cause serious accidents.</p>
                <p>The rationale of the refining process is based upon the fact that saltpetre is
                    far more soluble in hot than in cold water, while the chief saline impurities
                    found in grough nitre are almost equally soluble in either. Water at 212° Fahr,
                    holds about <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> times as much nitrate of potash in
                    solution as water at 70° Fahr.; if, therefore, a saturated solution of saltpetre
                    be made at a temperature of 212° Fahr., and the chlorides of sodium and
                    potassium are contained in the liquor, as the solution cools to 70° Fahr.,
                    six-sevenths of the nitre will be deposited in the form of crystals, which can
                    easily be removed, whereas the foreign salts will still remain in solution. The
                    following is a brief account of the improved mode of refining saltpetre,
                    introduced some years back at Waltham Abbey, and now adopted at the chief
                    private factories in England. The refining coppers are capable of holding about
                    500 gallons each, and are fitted with false iron bottoms, which are perforated
                    with holes to allow sand and other mechanical impurities to fall through. Being
                    each charged with 280 gallons of water,—usually the “washings” of saltpetre
                    previously refined,—and 40 cwt. of grough nitre, a fire is lighted beneath. In
                    about two hours the greater part of the saltpetre is dissolved, and the solution
                    begins to boil; the thick scum formed on the surface is carefully taken off, and
                    cold water from time to time thrown in to induce it to rise, the boiling being
                    continued until there is no more scum; the coppers are then filled up with cold
                    water, and the solution again made to boil briskly for a few minutes, after
                    which the fires are allowed to go down. In about two hours more the solution
                    will have fallen to the proper temperature, 220° Fahr, <hi rend="subscript">
                    l</hi> (sp. gr. 1 ’ 53), for pumping out; it is then filtered through dowlas
                    bags suspended on a frame, and conducted by troughs to the “coolers” or
                    crystallizing cisterns at about 180° Fahr. These latter are large shallow pans
                    of copper, in which the liquid is kept agitated either by long-handled wooden
                    hoes, or by machinery; as it cools, fine crystals fall to the bottom, and are
                    from time to time thrown upon inclined draining frames by means of perforated
                    copper shovels. When the temperature falls below 70° Fahr., the agitation is
                    ceased, and any large crystals which may afterwards form are left in the mother
                    liquor. After being thus allowed to get rid of some of the liquor, the
                    crystallized saltpetre, having almost the appearance of snow, and technically
                    called “flour,” is raked into the “washing-cistern;” it is there subjected to
                    three separate washings with pure water, distilled being preferable, which is
                    allowed to drain off through a plug hole at the bottom of the cistern. These ‘ ‘
                    washings” are carefully conducted to an underground tank, and kept either for
                    using in the refining coppers, or boiled down in “evaporating pots” holding
                    about 300 gallons, until the liquid is sufficiently concentrated for the
                    saltpetre to crystallize, when it is run into small copper pans, and set aside
                    to cool; this course is also pursued with the mother liquor from the large
                    cooling cisterns, and the resulting crystals treated as grough nitre, for these
                    large crystals always enclose liquid containing impurities. After draining for a
                    night the refined saltpetre is removed to store bins, and is ready for use
                    without any further pulverization; the amount of moisture remaining in it, from
                    3 to 5 per cent., is then carefully ascertained, and allowed for in the mixing
                    house. Neither the solid residue from the pots and coppers nor the mother liquor
                    from crystallizing pans is thrown away, but by repeated boilings and
                    evaporations every ascertainable portion of saltpetre is extracted, and the
                    residue sold; it chiefly consists of chlorides of sodium and potassium, with
                    some sulphates. The jute bags in which the saltpetre is imported are also boiled
                    down.</p>
                <p>The large percentage of saltpetre contained in damaged powder makes it worth
                    while to extract the nitre by boiling in large coppers, filtering and
                    crystallizing in small pans as before; the residuum is again boiled, and then
                    thrown away. The sweepings from the powder houses, in various stages of
                    manufacture, are “extracted” in the same manner.</p>
                <p>Refined saltpetre for making gunpowder is tested as follows :— (1) with blue and
                    red litmus paper, for acids or alkalies; (2) for the presence of chlorides, with
                    solution of nitrate of silver; (3) for sulphates, with chloride of barium,
                    forming the insoluble sulphate of baryta.</p>
                <p>By the old method of refining the solution was left to crystallize in coolers,
                    and the drained crystals fused or melted in iron pots at a heat of about 500°
                    Fahr.; the molten saltpetre was then poured into moulds, broken up when cold,
                    and ground under edge runners.</p>
                <p>The wood for charcoal is cut in spring, so that the bark may strip off easily,
                    and is stacked for about three years to season it, but a considerably shorter
                    time will suffice. Being cut in lengths of 3 feet, the wood is packed in iron
                    cylindrical cases termed “slips,” which are then inserted in the “cylinders” or
                    retorts, the latter being built into the wall in sets of three with a furnace
                    underneath, arranged so as to allow of the complete regulation of the heat; the
                    flames surround the retorts as nearly as possible. An opening is left in the
                    rear end or lid of the slip, corresponding with a similar <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n343/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0343-0324"/> opening in the retort, through which, by means of
                    pipes, the inflammable gases resulting from the charring of the wood are
                    conducted into the furnace and there burnt; this saves a considerable amount of
                    fuel. There are also pipes which receive and carry off the tar and pyroligneous
                    acid produced. In the powder works of Messrs Hall &amp; Son of Faversham, the
                    retorts are disposed three on each side of the furnace, and the connecting pipes
                    and dampers are so arranged that the gases from either set, or from any single
                    cylinder, can be utilized for the charring of the wood contained in any of the
                    others; by this means it is claimed that little fuel is required beyond the
                    quantity needed to warm the furnace and partially char the first set of
                    retorts.</p>
                <p>That the wood is sufficiently charred is shown by the blue colour of the gas
                    flame, which indicates the formation of carbonic oxide; the door of the retort
                    is then opened, and the slip is withdrawn by means of tackling, and placed in a
                    large iron cooler having a close-fitting lid, where it is left a few hours till
                    cool enough to be turned out and put into store. The charcoal is carefully
                    picked over by hand, to ensure its being of uniform quality, and is kept from
                    ten days to a fortnight before being ground, to obviate the danger of
                    spontaneous combustion, to which it is liable if ground too soon after burning;
                    this arises from the heat generated by the very rapid absorption and
                    condensation of oxygen from the air by the finely powdered charcoal.</p>
                <p>Properly-made charcoal for gunpowder should be jet black in colour, and its
                    fracture should show a clear velvet-like surface; it should be light and
                    sonorous when dropped on a hard substance, and so soft as not to scratch
                    polished copper. Slack-burnt charcoal, or that prepared at a very low
                    temperarure, is at once known by its reddish-brown colour, especially when
                    ground, and this peculiarity can be recognized in the powder made from it, when
                    reduced to a fine state of division. Charcoal burnt at a very high temperature
                    is known by its hardness, metallic ring, and greater density.</p>
                <p>In France, charcoal is prepared by injecting superheated steam into the retorts
                    for a certain period.</p>
                <p>The charcoal mill in shape resembles an enlarged coffee mill; a cone works within
                    a cylinder, both being provided with diagonal teeth and ribs, wide apart at top,
                    but gradually approaching one another below. The pulverized charcoal is thence
                    conducted by a simple mechanical arrangement direct into a cylindrical frame or
                    “reel,” about 8 feet by 3 feet, set at a slope and covered with copper wire
                    cloth of about 32 meshes to the inch; all that is fine enough to pass through
                    the reel-covering falls into a bin which encases the reel, and the coarser
                    particles pass on to a tub at the further end, in order that they may be ground
                    over again, The ground charcoal store should always stànd by itself, in case of
                    spontaneous combustion taking place.</p>
                <p>The sulphur from Sicily known as “Licara firsts” is employed for the best
                    gunpowder; it undergoes a rough purification before importation, leaving from 3
                    to 4 per cent, of earthy impurities. Formerly these were removed by simply
                    melting the “grough” sulphur in an iron pot, and then ladling it into large
                    wooden moulds or tubs, saturated with water to keep the sulphur out of the
                    cracks; when cool enough, these tubs were unhooped, and the top and bottom of
                    each mould of sulphur cut off. In the present day, however, the sulphur is
                    refined by distillation in a simple apparatus. A large iron “melting pot,” or
                    retort, is set in brickwork, about 3 feet above the floor, with a furnace
                    underneath; this retort has a heavy movable lid, which is luted into the pot
                    with clay, and in the lid is also an opening, closed by an iron conical plug.
                    From the melting pot lead two pipes at right angles to one another, one to a
                    large circular “dome,” or subliming chamber, and a smaller pipe to an iron
                    “receiving pot” placed on a lower level than the retort; the latter pipe has an
                    iron casing or “jacket” round it, through which cold water is allowed to
                    circulate. The communication of these pipes with the retort can be shut off or
                    opened as occasion may require by means of valves worked from without.</p>
                <p>A charge of about 5⅛ cwt. of grough sulphur in small pieces being placed in the
                    retort and the furnace lighted, the pipe leading to the dome is left open, as
                    well as the plug-hole in the lid, but that leading to the receiving pot is
                    closed; after about two hours, a pale yellow vapour rises, when the plug in the
                    lid is put in and the vapour allowed to pass into the dome, where it “sublimes”
                    or condenses on the sides and floor in the form of a fine powder, known as
                    “flowers of sulphur.” In about three hours from the commencement, the vapour
                    becomes of a deep iodine colour, when the pipe leading into the dome is closed,
                    and that into the receiving pot opened, at the same time cold water from a tank
                    overhead being allowed to circulate through the jacket; the vapour is then
                    condensed in the pipe, and runs into the receiving pot below in the form of a
                    clear orange-coloured fluid. When the jacket commences to get cold, the
                    receiving pipe is closed, and the communication with the dome is reopened, so
                    that the rest of the vapour may pass into it, the furnace doors being at the
                    same time thrown back; the impurities remain at the bottom of the melting pot,
                    and are thrown away. The flowers of sulphur thus obtained, being unfit for the
                    manufacture of gunpowder, are placed in the melting pot as grough sulphur. A
                    leaden pipe passes from the lid of the^ receiving pot into a small wooden
                    chamber lined with lead, in which any vapour still remaining uncondensed may be
                    deposited, as in the dome. The distilled sulphur is allowed to cool down to
                    about 220° Fahr., when it is ladled into wooden moulds, as above described, and
                    set aside to cool. The tests for refined sulphur are the following :—(1) bum a
                    small quantity on porcelain, when the amount of residuum should not exceed 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 25 per cent; (2) boil a little with water, and test
                    with blue litmus paper, which it should only very feebly redden.</p>
                <p>The sulphur from the moulds, being broken into pieces, is ground under a pair of
                    iron edge runners, similar to those of the incorporating mills, but of less
                    size; after this, it is passed through a reel similar to that used for sifting
                    the charcoal, but covered with even finer copper wire-cloth, having 44 meshes to
                    the inch.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Manufacture of Gunpowder.</hi></p>
                <p>The following list will give a general idea of the chief processes of
                    manufacture, properly so-called, through which gunpowder passes, although it
                    will be understood that more or less variation takes place in some of the very
                    different descriptions of powder now made :—(1) mixing the ingredients; (2)
                    incorporation, or “milling;” (3) breaking down the mill-cake; (4) pressing; (5)
                    granulating, or cutting the press-cake; (6) dusting; (7) glazing; (8) second
                    dusting; (9) stoving, or drying; (10) finishing.</p>
                <p>The following is the most approved method of mixing. The ingredients are
                    carefully weighed out in the proper proportions for a 50 ft» mill-charge, with
                    an extra amount of saltpetre according to the moisture found to be contained in
                    it; they are then placed in the mixing machine, which consists of a cylindrical
                    gun-metal or copper drum, with an axle passing through its centre, upon which
                    are disposed several rows of gun-metal fork-shaped arms, called “flyers,” the
                    machinery being so arranged that the flyers and drum revolve in opposite
                    directions, and at different rates of speed. After being mixed in this machine
                    for about five minutes, the composition is passed through a hand-sieve over a
                    hopper, falls into a bag placed below, and is tied up ready for the
                    incorporating mill; it is now called a “green” charge.</p>
                <p>The incorporating mill (see figs. 2 and 3) consists of a circular iron or stone
                    bed, about 7 feet in diameter, firmly <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0344-0325"/> fixed in the floor of the building, whereon a
                    pair of iron or. stone cylindrical edge-runners revolve; formerly, both were
                    made of a dark grey limestone which took a high polish, but the newer mills have
                    cast-iron beds and runners, the edges of the latter being now usually
                    surface-chilled. The average diameter of the runners is 6 feet, and their width
                    about 15 inches; they have a common axle, which rests in gun-metal bouches in a
                    solid cross-head attached to a vertical shaft; this shaft passes through a
                    bearing in the centre of the bed, and is in gear with the driving machinery,
                    which is placed above the runners in the old water mills, and beneath the bed in
                    cast-iron tanks in the new steam mills. Each run ner weighs about 4 tons, and
                    the speed averages 8 revolutions per minute.</p>
                <p>The bed has a sloping rim on the outside, called the “curb,” and on the inside an
                    edge formed by the “cheese,” or bearing, through which the vertical shaft
                    passes. The runners are not equidistant from the centre of the bed, one working
                    the part of the charge near the centre, and the other the outer portion, but
                    their paths overlap. Two “ploughs” of wood, shod with leather, are attached to
                    the cross-head by arms and brackets; one working next the vertical shaft, and
                    the other close to the curb, the ploughs throw the composition under the runners
                    as it works away from the latter.</p>
                <p>The charge, when spread evenly on the bed by means of a wooden rake, contains
                    about 2 pints of water (the moisture of the saltpetre) and a further quantity of
                    from 2 to 6 pints is added from time to time, according to the state of the
                    atmosphere, for the threefold purpose of preventing powder dust from flying
                    about, facilitating the incorporation, and reducing the effect of an explosion;
                    if too wet, the runners would lick up the composition from the bed. During the
                    time of working, the millman enters the mill occasionally, takes a wooden
                    “shover,” and pushes the outside of the charge into the middle of the path of
                    the runners, so that every portion may be equally incorporated.</p>
                <p>The action of the runners is a combination of rolling and twisting, and has, on a
                    large scale, somewhat the effect of a pestle and mortar, crushing, rubbing, and
                    mixing the ingredients, so as to effect an intimate union.</p>
                <p>The time of milling depends upon the nature of the powder. For good fine-grain
                    powders it varies from four to eight hours, but the very best sporting gunpowder
                    is said to be as long as twelve hours under the runners; blasting and cannon
                    powders are incorporated from two to four hours, the period being rather longer
                    where the lighter stone runners are used. It is of the greatest importance that
                    the mills should be carefully attended to by experienced men, as the whole
                    goodness and uniformity of the powder depends upon this process, and no after
                    treatment can remedy defective incorporation.</p>
                <p>When the composition, which has now become “millcake,” is ready for removal from
                    the bed, it should be homogeneous in appearance, without any visible specks of
                    sulphur or saltpetre, and of a dark greyish or brownish colour, according to the
                    charcoal used. The mill-cake is carefully tested to ascertain whether it
                    contains the proper amount of moisture; this should be from 2 to 3 per cent, for
                    fine-grain powders, and 3 to 5 per cent, for the larger descriptions. Sometimes
                    a small portion is roughly granulated, and “flashed” on plates of glass or
                    porcelain; a good powder should flash off, leaving nothing but some smoke marks,
                    but, if badly incorporated, the plate will be coated with specks or beads of
                    solid residue.</p>
                <p>In former days the ingredients were incorporated in “stamp-mills,” which were
                    simply large mortars and pestles, the latter merely raised up by some cam
                    arrangement and allowed to drop by their own weight, the charge being about 12
                    lb, and the weight of the stamp 50 ft or thereabout. The stamp or <hi
                    rend="italic">pilon</hi> mills are still used in France and Germany, as well as
                    the <hi rend="italic">moulins-à-tonneaux,</hi> in which the composition is put,
                    with about an equal weight of brass or lignum vitae balls, into large barrels,
                    which are made to revolve for a certain time on their axes; this method of
                    incorporation is sometimes employed in conjunction with edge runners.</p>
                <p>There is more danger of an explosion during the milling than in any other process
                    of manufacture; but, owing to the limitation by law of the weight of charge
                    permitted to be under the runners at one time to 50 ft, as well as to the great
                    precautions taken, there is seldom any fatal result. The millmen only enter the
                    mill occasionally to “liquor” the charge or give it a shove over, and at Waltham
                    Abbey they wear incombustible clothing with a cap fitting over the ears, and
                    gauntlets of the same material. The roof, and front and rear sides of the mills
                    are usually constructed of very light boards, or even of canvas on a wood frame,
                    while the partitions between each pair of runners are of solid masonry. The
                    force of the explosion of a mill charge materially depends upon the length of
                    time the incorporation has been in progress.</p>
                <p>Directly over the bed of each mill is a flat lever-board or “shutter” (see fig.
                    1) in gear with a tank of water, so arranged that, when the shutter is raised on
                    its pivot by an explosion, the water is upset into the bed; a horizontal shaft
                    connects all the shutters in a group of mills, so that the explosion of one mill
                    at once drowns all the remaining charges. The set of tanks can also be pulled
                    over by hand.</p>
                <p>The process of breaking down, although a subsidiary one, is strictly necessary in
                    order to reduce the mill-cake to a fine meal, so that it may be conveniently
                    loaded into the press box, and receive as uniform a pressure as possible. The
                    breaking-down machine (see fig. 4) consists mainly of two pairs of gun-metal
                    rollers, set in a strong frame of the same material; one roller of each pair
                    works in sliding bearings connected with a weighted lever, so that any hard
                    substance may pass through without dangerous friction. An endless canvas band,
                    having strips of leather sewn across it, conveys the pieces of mill-cake from a
                    hopper, capable of holding 500 ft to the top of the machine, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n345/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0345-0326"/> where it falls between the first pair of rollers;
                    after passing through the second pair, which are directly below, the meal is
                    received in wooden boxes, placed upon a carriage, and is ready for the
                    press.</p>
                <p>The press-box is usually of oak, with a strong gun-metal frame, and so
                    constructed that three of the sides can turn back on hinges, or be screwed
                    firmly together. Being laid sideways, the top temporarily closed by a board, and
                    the uppermost <hi rend="italic">side</hi> alone open, a number of copper plates
                    are placed vertically in the box, and kept apart (at a distance depending upon
                    the description of gunpowder required) by two racks, which are afterwards
                    removed; the box is then loaded with some 800 E&gt; of meal, which is rammed
                    evenly down between the plates with wooden laths, anl the racks withdrawn, so
                    that the plates are only separated by the meal between them. The <hi
                    rend="italic">present</hi> upper side of the box being firmly screwed down, the
                    box is turned over, and placed on the table of the hydraulic ram, under the
                    fixed press-block, the plates being now horizontal (see fig. 5). The pumps which
                    work the press (in a separate house) are then set in motion, and the press-block
                    allowed to enter the box a certain distance, when the edge of the latter
                    releases a spring catch and rings a bell as a signal to stop the pumps; the
                    powder is kept under pressure a few minutes, after which the ram is lowered, and
                    the box removed and unloaded. For all granulated powders the press-cake is
                    broken up into pieces and put into tubs, but for the cubical cannon powdere the
                    slabs are pressed to the exact thickness required, and are carefully kept
                    whole.</p>
                <p>The above mode of regulating the pressure is found to give more reliable results
                    than trusting to the indicator gauge of the hydraulic press, for the reason that
                    the elasticity, or resistance to pressure, of the meal varies with the amount of
                    moisture present in it, and the state of the atmosphere. To get uniform density,
                    equal quantities of meal, containing equal amounts of moisture, must be pressed
                    at the same rate into the same space. In practice, however, the moisture in the
                    meal will slightly vary, whatever care be taken with the mill-cake, owing to the
                    hygrometric state of the air causing a difference by the time it comes to the
                    press. It is therefore necessary to alter the exact distance the pres3-block is
                    allowed to enter the box, not only with the nature of the powder, but with the
                    season of the year, and even according to the prevailing state of the
                    weather.</p>
                <p>On the Continent, the operation of pressing is sometimes altogether omitted, and
                    the requisite density given merely by the weight of the runner3 revolving very
                    slowly, the charges being worked with a considerable amount of moisture in them,
                    and the less dense edges of the cake rejected; by this plan it is, however,
                    almost impossible to ensure <hi rend="italic">uniformity</hi> in the powder
                    produced. The meal is also sometimes pressed by passing it, on an endless band,
                    between large rollers revolving at a slow speed, the less dense edges of the
                    cake being cut off by fixed knives.</p>
                <p>For some centuries, gunpowder remained in the form of dust or “meal,” being, in
                    fact, simply the ingredients ground up together. Granulating or “corning” the
                    powder was a great step in advance, but it is doubtful whether this operation
                    was intended to increase its strength, or merely to rendeι it more convenient
                    for charging small-arms, for which alone corned powder was used for many years,
                    whilst meal powder was still employed for heavy guns; the latter was called
                    “serpentine” powder in the time of Edward VI., probably in allusion to the name
                    of one of the pieces of ordnance then in use. However, during the reign of
                    Elizabeth, the experience of the great additional strength imparted by the
                    corning process, for the reasons already explained, led to the universal
                    introduction of corned powder, except for priming,—both in cannon and
                    smallarms,—for which purpose meal powder remained in use as late as the reign of
                    Charles I.</p>
                <p>The old method of granulating was to place the presscake in sieves, provided with
                    two bottoms of thick parchment prepared from bullock’s hides, and perforated
                    with holes, those in the lower bottom being much the smaller; a large number of
                    these sieves were attached to a wooden frame, hung by ropes from the ceiling,
                    which received a violent shaking motion by means of a crank underneath. Into
                    each sieve was put a disk of lignum vitae, to break up the cake, and force it
                    through the larger apertures; the grain produced was retained between the
                    bottoms of the sieves, the dust passing through the fine holes in the lower
                    ones, and falling on the floor of the house. The grain was afterwards separated
                    into sizes by being passed through wire sieves. These machines were clumsy and
                    dangerous; and the accidents which happened with them have caused them to be
                    generally supplanted by better apparatus, although some of the old frames are
                    still in use.</p>
                <p>The granulating machines used in the royal factories in England and in India, as
                    well as in the best private works, are constructed upon a principle introduced
                    by Sir William Congreve, but since improved upon. Three or four pairs of
                    gun-metal rollers with pyramidal-shaped teeth, are fixed obliquely one above the
                    other in a strong framework (see fig. 6); the sizes of the teeth vary according
                    to the kind of grain required, but decrease from the top pair, and for
                    fine-grain powders, the lowest pair would be smooth; one roller of each pair
                    works in a sliding bearing, having a counterweight attached to prevent undue
                    friction. Each pair of rollers is connected with that next below, by a short
                    rectangular screen of copper wire, while, underneath all the rollers, are
                    placed, at the same slope, two or more long wirescreens fixed in a frame having
                    a wooden bottom; both the frame and the short connecting screens are hung to the
                    machine by strips of lance wood, and, when at work, a quick vibratory motion is
                    given to all the screens by means of a polygonal wheel upon the main frame
                    working against a loose smooth wheel attached to the screen-frame. A large
                    hopper, which rises by the action of the machine, feeds the press-cake upon an
                    endless canvas band, as in the breakingdown machine, and carries it to the top
                    pair of rollers, whence it falls upon the first short screen; all that is fine
                    enough to pass through is sifted out by the shaking action of the long screens
                    below, and travels down upon whichever screen lias meshes fine enough to retain
                    it; the pieces too large to pass through the short top screen are carried to the
                    next pair of rollers, and so on. At the lower end of the long screens are placed
                    boxes to receive the different sizes of grain; the “chucks,” or pieces too large
                    for any grain, are again passed through the machine, while the dust which falls
                    upon the wooden bottom, and is received in the innermost box, goes to the mills
                    to be worked up for forty minutes as a dust charge. Formerly at Waltham Abbey
                    both musket (F.G.) and cannon powder (L.G.) were granu-lateci<pb break="no"

                    charcoal being now used for small-arm powders, one description only is usually
                    made, so that but two long screens are required to define the higher and lower
                    limits as to size of grain; for example, all that will pass through a 12-mesh
                    and be retained upon a 20-mesh screen would be “rifle-fine·grain” (R.F.G.)
                    powder, suited as to size for the Snider and Martini rifles. Modifications of
                    this machine are used by private makers, the grain being usually separated into
                    various sizes by hand-sieves.</p>
                <p>Pebble or cubical powders for heavy ordnance are granulated, or “cut,” in special
                    machines which divide the presscake first into strips, and then again
                    cross-ways, into cubes of f inch and 1∣ inch length of edge respectively. This
                    is effected by two pairs of gun-metal or phosphor-bronze rollers, which have
                    straight cutting edges arranged at suitable intervals <hi rend="italic"
                    >along</hi> their surfaces, the slabs of press-cake being fed vertically between
                    the first pair of rollers. The resulting strips are carried along upon a board,
                    by means of a skeleton band, which receives each strip of cake between two laths
                    of wood; they then drop from the board upon an endless canvas band a little
                    below, travelling in a direction at right angles to their previous motion, and
                    are conveyed <hi rend="italic">endways</hi> to the second pair of rollers. To
                    prevent the strips of cake from fouling one another, the board upon which they
                    first fall has a reciprocating motion given to it by means of an endless chain,
                    one link of which is studded to a bracket underneath the board; consequently, as
                    the board travels backwards, the strips are deposited at intervals, <hi
                    rend="italic">in echellon,</hi> upon the canvas band. The diagram (fig. 7) shows
                    a portion of the machine. The cubes, &lt;fcc., fall into a small reel fixed at a
                    slope beneath the machine, which allows the dust and fragments to pass between
                    its wires while the properly sized pebbles or cubes are delivered into boxes.
                    The large 1∣-inch powder has, however, afterwards to be picked over by hand.</p>
                <p>All grain from the granulating machine is called “foulgrain,” and has t"&gt; be
                    deprived of its dust in reels, consisting of a cylindrical frame-work about 8
                    feet long by some 2 feet in diameter, covered with a dusting cloth or canvas of
                    from 18 to 56 meshes to the linear inch, according to the size of grain. These
                    reels? re either “horizontal” or “slope,” according to the position in which
                    they are fixed and the object in view. Slope-reels are open at both ends, fixed
                    at an angle of about 4°, and are used for fine-grain powders as they come from
                    the machine, when they contain more dust than the larger grain, especially if
                    made from dogwood charcoal; the powder is poured in at the higher end, and
                    received in barrels at the other end. The larger grained powders are dusted for
                    about half an hour in a horizontal reel, with closed ends, the charge being from
                    250 to 300 lb; one end of the reel is made to lower for the purpose σf
                    unloading. Both kinds of reel are enclosed in cases to receive the dust, which,
                    as before, is sent back to the incorporating mills for 40 minutes or so.</p>
                <p>The theory of glazing gunpowder has already been discussed. All descriptions are
                    glazed, for varying periods, in glazing barrels or “churns” (fig. 8), which are
                    usually about</p>
                <p>5 feet long by 2 to 3 feet in diameter, and revolve some 34 times in a minute;
                    however, barrels of much greater diameter and less length are occasionally
                    employed, revolving at a slower rate. The charge for each barrel is ordinarily
                    400 B⅛, and the fine-grain powders are mixed with a proportion<pb break="no"

                    appearance of the grain, especially in that made from dogwood; the dull brownish
                    hue is replaced after a few hours by a fine black colour with more or less
                    polish. Some powders are glazed from 10 to 12 hours, a considerable amount of
                    heat being generated by the friction. Fine-grain powders are again passed
                    through the slope reel after glazing.</p>
                <p>All kinds of gunpowder are dried in the same manner. The “stove,” or drying room,
                    is fitted with open framework shelves or racks, the heat being produced by steam
                    pipes underneath. The powder is spread upon either copper trays or wooden frames
                    with canvas bottoms, each capable of holding about 12 lb, which are then placed
                    upon the racks. Not more that 50 cwt. may be dried at one time. The length of
                    time required for stoving depends upon the nature of the powder, and the
                    proportion of moisture it contains; it varies from about twelve hours for
                    fine-grain up to three or four days for the very large cannon powders; the heat
                    ranges from 1∙20° to 145° Fahr., the temperature being gradually raised or
                    lowered. It is most important that a stove should be well ventilated, so that a
                    constant current of hot dry air may be supplied, and the air charged with vapour
                    carried off; if this be not done effectually, the moisture would be recondensed
                    upon the powder a3 the temperature was lowered.</p>
                <p>The drying process produces a small portion of dust which it is necessary to
                    remove; but the finishing process has, especially upon the fine-grain powder, a
                    much more considerable effect than the mere removal of dust. It is usually
                    finished by being run from two to three hours in a horizontal reel (see fig. 9),
                    the charge being 300 K&gt;, and acquires a very glossy appearance, if the
                    quality be good, even without the addition of graphite, which is very commonly
                    added to sporting gunpowder. Large cannon powder, such as “pebble” and
                    “cubical,” is finished in large skeleton wooden reels, shaped like barrels, and
                    enclosed in cases; after being run for about three quarters of an hour, a small
                    portion of the purest graphite (2 oz. to 400 ft&gt; of powder) is introduced in
                    muslin bags, and the powder is run for a short time longer. This skeleton reel
                    will hold a whole “glazing,” as the contents of four glazing barrels is termed,
                    being about 16 barrels of 100 lb each, and advantage is taken of this finishing
                    process to mix together a number of glazings, so as to get a batch of 50 or 100
                    barrels giving uniform results at proof. These batches are afterwards “blended”
                    together in four-way hoppers, with others of opposite character, should they not
                    in all respects be up to specification, and any quantity of gunpowder so
                    finished or blended as to give identical results at proof is termed a <hi

                <p>Upon the introduction of very heavy ordnance, firing large charges, it was found
                    that the ordinary (L.G. or R.L.G.) cannon powder was too <hi rend="italic"
                    >sudden</hi> in its action, owing to the whole charge being consumed before the
                    projectile had sensibly moved from its seat in the bore, thus causing a most
                    violent strain to the metal of the gun. To obviate this defect, the grains or
                    pieces were made much larger, so as to diminish the total surface of combustion,
                    and, consequently, the volume of gas evolved at the first instant of explosion;
                    the powder was also given a considerably higher density, which retarded its
                    combustion. These changes resulted in the adoption of the pebble and cubical
                    powders, already mentioned, in England, and in America, of “Mammoth” powder,
                    consisting of large, irregular-shaped grains <hi rend="italic">(fc,</hi> fig.
                    10) from 0" ’ 6 to 0" ’ 9 in size; an improvement has since been made in this
                    powder by pressing it in uniform-sized pieces, of the shape shown in <hi

                    prismatic <hi rend="italic">(f f),</hi> and cubical (7t)—are figured half the

                <p>The improvements above described materially lessen the <hi rend="italic"
                    >initial</hi> strain, at the expense of requiring a longer gun to burn the
                    powder completely, but it still remains true that, even with a charge composed
                    of large, dense pieces, the evolution of gas is greatest at the commencement of
                    combustion, and decreases as the grains burn away, although <pb break="no"

                    shot travels along the bore. This is exactly the opposite of what should
                    theoretically take place, and causes the maximum pressure to be exerted before
                    the inertia of the projectile has been overcome. So far back as 1860, these
                    considerations led General Rodman, the eminent American artillerist, to employ,
                    in the experiments with his 15-inch and 20-inch cast-iron guns, what he termed a
                    “perforated cake cartridge,” composed of discs of compressed powder from 1 to 2
                    inches thick, and of a diameter to fit the bore, pierced with holes running
                    parallel to the axis of the gun. In his <hi rend="italic">Properties of Metal
                    for Cannon, and Qualities of Cannon-Powder</hi> (Boston, 1861), Rodman
                    demonstrated mathematically that such an arrangement of the charge would relieve
                    the initial strain by exposing a minimum surface at thebeginning of the
                    combustion, while a greater volume of gas would be evolved from the increasing
                    surfaces of the cylindrical hollows as the space behind the projectile became
                    larger; this would tend to distribute the pressure more uniformly along the
                    bore. The results of experiment perfectly bore out his theory, but he found it
                    more convenient for several reasons to build up the charge in layers of
                    hexagonal “prisms” of comparatively small size, fitting closely to one another,
                    instead of having the cakes or discs as large as the bore.</p>
                <p>The civil war in America most probably interfered with the further development of
                    General Rodman’s powder, but the idea was taken up by a Russian military mission
                    in the United States, and resulted in the manufacture on a large scale by Russia
                    of what is now known as “prismatic powder.” It has since been adopted in Germany
                    for use in all heavy rifled ordnance; for the very largest guns, such as Krupp’s
                    70-ton gun, this powder has been recently made with one central hole, having a
                    higher density (1 ’ 78) than the original seven-hole prisms, which were about
                    D68; the external dimensions are the same, 1 inch high by 1 *36 in diameter. The
                    prisms are so arranged in the cartridge that the hollows are continuous
                    throughout.</p>
                <p>Prismatic powder represents a distinct class, the peculiarity of which is that
                    each grain or piece is pressed separately in a metal mould. In the British
                    service, powder for heavy rifled guns, in the shape of small cylindrical
                    pellets, with a hollow half-way through, was made some twelve years since, but
                    has been superseded by the pebble or cubical powder cut up from press-cake. To
                    make this class of gunpowder, whether prismatic or cylindrical, we need—(1) a
                    mould in which to place the meal or granulated powder; usually a number of
                    moulds are contained in one plate; (2) a punch to fit each mould accurately with
                    which to compress the powder, and needles to form the perforations; (3) an
                    appliance for pressing the finished pellets or prisms out of the moulds; or this
                    may be done by the punches themselves, if the moulds are closed by a removable
                    upper plate.</p>
                <p>The requisite pressure may be given either by hydraulic machinery, as at Waltham
                    Abbey, or by means of a cam or eccentric on a shaft driven by steam or water
                    power, as in the Russian and German prismatic machines. By the former plan a
                    large number of pieces may be pressed slowly at one operation, but by the latter
                    only about six prisms can be formed at a time; the machine, however, works very
                    quickly, and has a small hopper for the meal or grain, and a self-feeding
                    apparatus, the mould plate sliding backwards and forwards, so as to be
                    alternately underneath the hopper and punches. Self-feeding machines of this
                    nature are found to get clogged when used with powder-meal, and this was
                    doubtless the chief reason why granulated powder was first used; the size of
                    grain is about that shown in fig. 10, <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> It is probable
                    that a more uniform density could be given to the prisms by hydraulic pressure
                    than by the cam arrangement; the latter is said to exert a maximum pressure of
                    2000 ft&gt; on the square inch. The prismatic powder only needs careful drying
                    at a moderate heat to finish it.</p>
                <p>It has been found that all powders thus made possess less explosiveness than
                    those granulated or cut up from press-cake; the smooth surfaces of the pieces
                    apparently afford little hold for the flame, and thus they ignite slowly; by
                    some this is considered a defect, but by others an advantage. For this reason,
                    as well as those already detailed, prismatic powder strains the metal of the gun
                    less, in proportion to the velocity obtained, than pebble or cubical, but, to
                    give the projectile an equal velocity, the charge of prismatic must be
                    considerably larger. The cost would probably be also greater, weight for
                    weight..</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Proof of Gunpowder.</hi></p>
                <p>The tests to which powder is subjected are as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">For proper Colour, amount of Glaze, sufficiently hard and
                    crisp Texture,and Freedom from Dust. —</hi> These points can be judged by the
                    hand and eye alone, and require a certain amount of experience in the examiner.
                    The cleanness of the powder is tested by pouring a quantity from a bowl held 2
                    or 3 feet above the barrel; if there be any dust it will be thus easily
                    detected. If it is injured by damp there will be little or no dust, but the
                    grain will be “rotten,” and may be broken between the fingers; minute crystals
                    of saltpetre may be also detected on the surface in a good light.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">For proper Incorporation.—</hi> By “flashing,” that is,
                    burning a small quantity on a glass, porcelain, or copper plate. The powder is
                    put in a small copper cylinder, which is then inverted on the flashing plate;
                    this provides for the particles being arranged in nearly the same way each test,
                    which is very important. If the powder be very large, it must be broken up and
                    sifted to a certain size through a small hand-sieve. Properly made gunpowder
                    should “flash,” or puff off, when touched by a hot-iron, with few “lights” or
                    sparks, leaving only some smoke marks on the plate. A badly incorporated powder
                    will give out a quantity of sparks, and leave specks of uncombined saltpetre and
                    sulphur, forming a dirty residue. Powder made from very slack-burnt charcoal, or
                    which has been injured by damp, will always flash badly.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">For Shape, Size, and Proportion of the Grains.—</hi> Shape
                    can be judged by the eye only, and the size of large powders can be measured, or
                    the number of pieces to 1 lb counted; granulated powder may readily be sifted
                    upon the two sieves which determine its higher and lower limits of size. The
                    proportion of different sized grains is ascertained by using three or more
                    sieves. For example, the Government small-arm powder is sifted with 12-mesh, 16-
                    mesh, and 20-mesh sieves; all must pass the first, not less than three quarters
                    be retained upon the second, and only one-sixteenth part is allowed to pass the
                    last-named sieve.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Density.—</hi> Formerly this was ascertained by “cubing,” or
                    finding the exact weight of a carefully constructed box of known contents, when
                    filled with powder in a particular manner. But as this plan gave only an
                    approximate result, a mercurial densimeter has been substituted, by means of
                    which the density can be ascertained to three places of decimals. Briefly, the
                    machine determines with great accuracy the weight of a globe when it is (a)
                    filled with mercury alone under a certain pressure, and (6) filled with a known
                    weight (say 100 grammes) of powder and mercury under precisely similar
                    conditions; then, if S be the specific gravity of mercury at the time of
                    experiment, W the weight of globe filled with mercury alone, and w the weight
                    when filled with powder and mercury,</p>

                    Moisture.-—</hi> The amount of water contained in gunpowder is found by drying a

                    lost, when allowed to cool out of contact with the air before weighing, the
                    percentage of moisture can be calculated. The hygroscopic test consists in
                    exposing a dried sample in a box, kept at a uniform temperature, to an
                    atmosphere artificially saturated with moisture, and ascertaining the increase

                    will depend upon the purpose for which the powder is intended. For sporting
                    powders, it will consist in the “pattem” given by the shot upon a target at a
                    given distance, or, if fired with a bullet, upon the “figure of merit,” or mean
                    radial deviation of a certain number of rounds; also upon the penetration it
                    effects through boards. For military purposes the powder is now always fired
                    from the rifle or piece of ordnance with which it is to be used, and the initial
                    or “muzzle” velocity ascertained by the Le Boulengé electric chronograph (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Gunnery),</hi> which measures the exact time the bullet or
                    other projectile takes to traverse a known distance between two wire screens. By
                    means of the “crusher gauges” al·.eady referred to, the exact pressure per
                    square inch upon certain points in the interior of the bore can be found; the
                    maximum pressure can be considerably modified by increasing the cubic air-space
                    given to the charge in the powder chamber. The figure of merit is also taken for
                    small-arm powder.</p>
                <p>All gunpowder made by or for the British Government is subjected to very strict
                    limits of specification upon all the above-named points.</p>
