                <p><label type="entry">GREEK FIRE</label> is properly the name applied to the
                    inflammable and destructive compounds used in warfare in the Middle Ages, and
                    particularly by the Byzantine Greeks at the sieges of Constantinople. It was the
                    precursor of gunpowder, and of such modern compositions as dynamite and
                    nitroglycerin, and was frequently accessory to gunpowder for many years after
                    its invention. But combustible mineral substances were employed in war much
                    earlier than the Middle Ages. Greek fire has borne the names wildfire, maritime
                    fire, wet fire, fire-rain; called by the French <hi rend="italic">feu</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">grégeois,</hi> by the Germans <hi rend="italic"

                    fire” of the Chinese, the <hi rend="italic">oleum incendiarum</hi> of the
                    Romans, and the 7∏)p υγρόν, liquid fire, of the Greeks. Procopius designates it
                    “Medea’s oil.” Cinnamus (12th century) describes it as <hi rend="italic"
                        >πvρ</hi> Μηδικόν, Median fire, the black clays of Media and Persia
                    supplying the principal constituent. Used chiefly at sieges and in naval
                    engagements, it was poured from cauldrons and ladles on the besiegers and their
                    engines, or vomited through long copper tubes from the mouths of hideous figures
                    set in the prows of ships. Sometimes flax was twisted and saturated with the
                    liquid, then fired, and projected on arrows, lances, and javelins. At sea it was
                    often flung in pots and phials. The heavy ballista and other military engines
                    were pressed into the service in early times for scattering this destructive
                    compound in large quantities, often in barrels. Owing to the viscid nature of
                    Greek fire it adhered to whatever it touched. It is described as producing a
                    thick smoke, a loud explosion, and a fierce flame, and as being quickened by the
                    element of water. Sea-water is specially mentioned as intensifying its
                    inflammability; and whenever it fell among ignitible materials terrible havoc
                    was occasioned. The sight and sound of the engine discharging the torrent of
                    fire carried dismay into many a warrior’s breast. The devastating consequences
                    pictured by early writers are probably overdrawn, but there can be no doubt that
                    they were formidable. Liquid fire has been used in warfare from very remote
                    times, as may be seen in the Assyrian bas-reliefs in the British Museum. Greek
                    fire, properly so called, is said to have been employed for the first time
                    against the Saracens in the siege of Constantinople, 673-679, the inventor being
                    a Syrian named Callinicus. The art of compounding Greek fire was concealed at
                    Constantinople with the most jealous care; indeed it was to Greek fire, while
                    the secret of its manufacture was kept, t∙hat the city owed in great measure its
                    safety. In 1755 two Frenchmen, Gaubert and Dupré, are reported to have
                    rediscovered the art so carefully concealed by the Byzantine Greeks; but they
                    were prohibited from making it known. Various projects for the use of this or
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n171/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0911-0171-0160"/> similar preparations have been advocated in
                    recent times. The ingredients and relative proportions of the composition are
                    not exactly known, the secret having been very successfully preserved. The
                    Syrian historian Michael applies the name naphtha to the “newly invented” Greek
                    fire; and this probably was the destructive agent of the Assyrians, Persians,
                    and other Eastern nations, springs of naphtha abounding in their territories.
                    According to the author of <hi rend="italic">H Esprit des Croissades,</hi> Greek
                    fire was compounded of the gum of the pine and other resinous trees reduced to
                    powder, with the addition of brimstone, naphtha, and other bitumens. Fanciful
                    substances were included, such as the water of a particular fountain in the
                    East, duck’s grease, &amp;c. Friar Bacon mentions two of the ingredients,
                    saltpetre and sulphur, but conceals the rest. Giambattista Porta states that
                    Greek fire is made by boiling together willow charcoal, salt, ardent aqua vitae,
                    sulphur, pitch, frankincense, threads of soft Ethiopian wool, and camphor. In a
                    Spanish MS. of the 13th century in the Bodleian library a different receipt is
                    given; and others will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi

                    said it appears that naphtha—otherwise petroleum, rock oil, or Rangoon tar—and
                    sulphur, and sometimes nitre, were the principal constituents; and the use of
                    these, or two of them, in varying quantities, with the charcoal mentioned by
                    Porta, no doubt gave birth to gunpowder. An invention by Niepce comprised benzol
                    and potassium, in the proportion of 600 to 1, placed in a glass vessel; and
                    Disney’s is believed to have included a solation of phosphorus in sulphide of
                    carbon or chloride of sulphur. But of all the spontaneously combustible liquids,

                    advance of the old Greek fire as a destroyer of life. A combustible used at the
                    siege of Charleston, U.S., in 1863 consisted of (1) saltpetre, sulphur, and
                    lampblack, pressed into small tubes, and (2) coal tar naphtha, placed in shells
                    or pumped through hose. The be3t military authorities appear now to agree that
                    Greek fire is unsuitable for purposes of war, and comparatively little use has
                    been made of it in recent times.</p>
