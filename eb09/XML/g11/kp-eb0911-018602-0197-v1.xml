                    (1519-1579), a London merchant, the founder of the Royal Exchange and of Gresham
                    College, London, was born in 1519. Descended from an old Norfolk family, he was
                    the only son of Sir Richard Gresham, a leading London merchant, who for some
                    time held the office of lord mayor and for his services as agent of Henry VIII.
                    in negotiating loans with foreign merchants received the honour of knighthood.
                    Though his father intended him to follow his own profession, he nevertheless
                    sent him for some time to Caius College, Cambridge, but there is no information
                    as to the duration of his residence. It is uncertain also whether it was before
                    or after this that he was apprenticed to his uncle Sir John Gresham, who was
                    also a merchant, but we have his own testimony that he served an apprenticeship
                    of eight years. In 1543 at the age of twenty-four he was admitted a member of
                    the Mercers’ Company, and in the same year he went to the Low Countries, where,
                    either on his own account or on that of his father or uncle, he both carried on
                    business as a merchant and acted in various matters as an agent for Henry VIII.
                    In 1544 he married the widow of William Read, a London merchant, but he still
                    continued to reside principally in the Low Countries, having his headquarters at
                    Antwerp. When in 1551 the mismanagement of Sir William Dansell, “king’s
                    merchant” in the Low Countries, had brought the English Government into great
                    financial embarrassment, Gresham was called in to give his advice, and chosen to
                    carry out his own proposals. Their leading feature was the adoption of various
                    methods—highly ingenious, but quite arbitrary and unfair—for raising the value
                    of the pound sterling on the “bourse” of Antwerp, and it was so successful that
                    in a few years nearly all King Edward’s debts were discharged. The advice of
                    Gresham was likewise sought by the Government in all their money difficulties,
                    and he was also frequently employed in various diplomatic missions. He had no
                    stated salary, but in reward of his services received from Edward various grants
                    of lands, the annual value of which at that time was ultimately about £400 a
                    year. On the accession of Mary the council resolved on his recall, but before
                    the letter was sent they changed their opinion; and as he professed his zealous
                    desire to serve the queen, and manifested great adroitness both in
                        negotiating<pb break="no"

                    foreign goods, not only were his services retained throughout her reign, but
                    besides his salary of twenty shillings <hi rend="italic">per diem</hi> he
                    received grants of church lands to the yearly value of £200. Under Queen
                    Elizabeth, besides continuing to act as financial agent of the crown, he was for
                    some time ambassador at the court of the duchess of Parma. In 1559 he received
                    the honour of knighthood. By the outbreak of the war in the Low Countries he was
                    compelled to leav <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> e Antwerp on the 19th March
                    1567; but, though he spent the remainder of his life in London, he continued his
                    business as merchant and financial agent of the Government in much the same way
                    as formerly. Elizabeth also found him useful in a great variety of other ways,
                    among which was that of acting as jailer to Lady Mary Grey, who, as a punishment
                    for marrying Thomas Keys the sergeant porter, remained a prisoner in his house
                    from June 1569 to the end of 1572. In 1565 Gresham made a proposal to the court
                    of aidermen of London to build at his own expense a bourse or exchange, on
                    condition that they purchased for this purpose a piece of suitable ground. In
                    this proposal he seems to have had an eye to his own interest as well as to the
                    general good of the merchants, for by a yearly rental of £700 obtained for the
                    shops in the upper part of the building he received a sufficient return for his
                    trouble and expense. Gresham died suddenly, apparently of apoplexy, 21st
                    November 1579. His only son predeceased him, and his illegitimate daughter Anne
                    he married to Sir Nicolas Bacon, brother of the great Lord Bacon. With the
                    exception of a number of small sums bequeathed to the support of various
                    charities, the bulk of his property, consisting of estates in various parts of
                    England of the annual value of more than £2300, was bequeathed to his widow and
                    her heirs with the stipulation that after her decease his residence in
                    Bishopsgate Street, as well as the rents arising from the Royal Exchange, should
                    be vested in the hands of the corporation of London and the Mercers’ Company,
                    for the purpose of instituting a college in which seven professors should read
                    lectures—one each day of the week—on astronomy, geometry, physic, law, divinity,
                    rhetoric, and music. The lectures were begun in 1597, and were delivered in the
                    original building until 1768, when, on the ground that the trustees were losers
                    by the gift, it was made over to the crown for a yearly rent of £500, and
                    converted into an excise office. From that time a room in the Royal Exchange was
                    used for the lectures until in 1843 the present building was erected at a cost
                    of £7000. It contains a large library, professors’ rooms, and a theatre capable
                    of holding 500 persons.</p>

                <p>. GRESSET, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jean Baptiste</hi> (1709-1777). The literary
                    history of Gresset might be dismissed with the simple statement that he wrote
                        <hi rend="italic">Vert Vert.</hi> By that one poem he is remembered. His
                    life is, however, interesting from another fact, that he, who almost alone among
                    French poets wrote nothing of which a moralist need be ashamed, spent the last
                    twenty-five years of his life in regretting the frivolity which enabled him to
                    produce the most charming of poems. He was born at Amiens, and brought up by the
                    Jesuits of that place. As a boy he displayed such great promise that, according
                    to the usual custom of the society, the fathers resolved to receive him among
                    themselves. He was accepted as a novice at the age of sixteen, and sent to
                    pursue his studies at the Collége Louis le Grand in Paris. After completing his
                    course he was appointed, being then under twenty years of age, to a post as
                    professor or assistant master in a college at Rouen. He was, it must be
                    remembered, a son of the society of Jesus; as such he had been drilled and
                    disciplined to perfect obedience; in every point except that of orders he was an
                    ecclesiastic. Probably it was not the intention of the society that he should
                    become a priest. They reckoned upon his continuing a lay brother, and helping
                    the cause by his position as a teacher. From such a mind so trained, so taught
                    to regard everything from the priestly point of view, devoted to the most severe
                    studies, occupied in the grave and responsible work of teaching, what literary
                    fruit was to be expected Î Perhaps a treatise on a Greek particle, an essay on
                    Latin style, a grammatical thesis, anything but that which really appeared,—the
                    graceful, pleasant poem by which he will ever be remembered. He published <hi
                        rend="italic">Vert Vert</hi> at Rouen, being then twenty-four years of age.
                    It is a story, in itself exceedingly humorous, showing how a parrot, the delight
                    of a convent, whose talk was all of prayers and pious ejaculations, was conveyed
                    to another convent as a visitor to please the nuns. On the way he falls among
                    bad companions, forgets his convent language, and shocks the sisters on arrival
                    by pro fane swearing. He is sent back in disgrace, punished by solitude and
                    plain bread, presently repents, reforms, and is killed by kindness. The story,
                    however, is nothing. The treatment of the subject, the atmosphere which
                    surrounds it, the delicacy in which the little prattling w ays of the nuns,
                    their jealousies, their tiny trifles, are presented, takes the reader entirely
                    by surprise. The poem stands absolutely unrivalled, even among French <hi
                        rend="italic">contes en vers.</hi></p>
                <p>Gresset found himself famous. He left Rouen, went up to Paris, where he found
                    refuge in the same garret which had sheltered him when a boy at the Collége
                    Louis le Grand, and there wrote his second poem, <hi rend="italic">Ma
                        Chartreuse.</hi> Then trouble came upon him; complaints were made to the
                    fathers of the alleged licentiousness of verses which were as innocent as any
                    school-girl’s novel, the real cause of complaint being the ridicule which <hi
                        rend="italic">Vert Vert</hi> seemed to throw upon the whole race of nuns. An
                    example, it was urged, must be made; Gresset was expelled the order. Men of
                    robust mind would have been glad to get rid of such a yoke. Gresset, who had
                    never been taught to stand alone, went forth weeping. He became a man of
                    letters; he wrote many other poems, none of which made any mark. He never in
                    fact attained the same level as <hi rend="italic">Vert Vert.</hi> He wrote two
                    or three comedies. One, called <hi rend="italic">Le Méchant,</hi> still keeps
                    the stage, though it is difficult to assign it much merit. He was admitted to
                    the Academy. And then, still young, he retired to Amiens, where he fell into the
                    hands of the priests, and became their abject slave. His brief relapse from the
                    discipline of the church became the subject of the deepest remorse. He repented
                    of his poems, and even went so far as to address to the bishop an abjuration of
                    his title of dramatist, and to implore pardon of the Virgin for having written
                    plays. The history of French literature presents many examples of poets in old
                    age repenting the sins of their youth; the example of Gresset is unique as
                    beginning, while in full manhood, a senile repentance for having even in so
                    pleasant and innocent a way brought into ridicule the institutions of the
                    church.</p>
