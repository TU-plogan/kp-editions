                    from that king was traced through a line of females. His second daughter Mary,
                    after being left a widow by Louis XII. of France, married Charles Brandon, duke
                    of Suffolk, who was a favourite with her brother King Henry VIII. Of this
                    marriage came two daughters, the elder of whom, Lady Frances Brandon, was
                    married to Henry Grey, marquis of Dorset; and their issue, again, consisted of
                    daughters only. Lady Jane, the subject of this article, was the eldest of three
                    whom the marquis had by Lady Frances. Thus it will appear that even if the crown
                    of England had ever fallen into the female line of descent from Henry VII., she
                    could not have put in a rightful claim unless the issue of his elder daughter,
                    Margaret, had become extinct. But Margaret had married James IV. of Scotland;
                    and, though her descendant, James VI., was ultimately called to the English
                    throne, Henry VIII. had placed her family after that of his second sister in the
                    succession; so that, failing the lawful issue of Henry himself, Lady Jane would,
                    according to this arrangement, have succeeded. It was to these circumstances
                    that she owed her exceptional position in history, and became the victim of an
                    ambition which was not her own.</p>
                <p>She was born at her father’s seat named Broadgate in Leicestershire, about the
                    year 1537. Her parents, though severe disciplinarians, bestowed more than
                    ordinary care upon her education, and she herself was so teachable, and
                    delighted so much in study, that she became the marvel of the age for her
                    acquirements. She not only excelled in needlework and in music, both vocal and
                    instrumental, but while still very young she had thoroughly mastered Latin,
                    Greek, French, and Italian. She was able to speak and write both Greek and Latin
                    with an accuracy that satisfied even such critics as Ascham and her tutor Dr
                    Aylmer, afterwards bishop of London. She had also acquired some knowledge of at
                    least three Oriental tongues, Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabic. In Ascham’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Schoolmaster</hi> is given a touching account of the devotion with
                    which she pursued her studies and the harshness she experienced from her
                    parents. The love of learning was her solace; in reading Demosthenes and Plato
                    she found a refuge from domestic unhappiness. After the fashion of those days
                    she was, when about ten years old, placed for a time in the household of Thomas,
                    Lord Seymour, who induced her parents to let her stay with him by promising to
                    marry her to his nephew King Edward VI. Lord Seymour, however, was attainted of
                    high treason and beheaded in 1549, and his brother, the duke of Somerset, made
                    some overtures to the marquis of Dorset to marry her to his son the earl of
                    Hertford. These projects, however, came to nothing. The duke of Somerset in his
                    turn fell a victim to the ambition of Dudley duke of Northumberland, and was
                    beheaded three years after his brother. Meanwhile, the dukedom of Suffolk having
                    become extinct by the deaths of Charles Brandon and his two sons, the title was
                    conferred upon the marquis of Dorset, Lady Jane’s father. Northumberland, who
                    was now all-powerful, fearing a great reverse of fortune in case of the king’s
                    death, whose health soon began visibly to decline, endeavoured to strengthen
                    himself by marriages between his family and those of other powerful noblemen,
                    especially of the new-made duke of Suffolk. His three eldest sons being already
                    married, the fourth, who was named Lord Guildford Dudley, was accordingly wedded
                    to Lady Jane Grey about the end of May 1553. The match received the full
                    approval of the king, who furnished the wedding apparel of the parties by royal
                    warrant. But Edward’s state of health warned Northumberland that he must lose no
                    time in putting the rest of his project into execution. He persuaded the king
                    that if the crown should descend to his sister Mary, the work of the Reformation
                    would be undone and the liberties of the kingdom would be in danger. Besides,
                    both Mary and her sister Elizabeth had been declared illegitimate by separate
                    Acts of Parliament, and the objections to Mary Queen of Scots did not require to
                    be pointed out. Edward was easily persuaded to break through his father’s will
                    and make a new settlement of the crown by deed. The document was witnessed by
                    the signatures of all the council and of all but one of the judges; but those of
                    the latter body were not obtained without difficulty by threats and
                    intimidation.</p>
                <p>Edward VI. died on the 6th July 1553, and it was announced to Lady <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> Jane that she was queen. She was then but sixteen years
                    of age. The news came upon her as a most unwelcome surprise, and for some time
                    she resisted all persuasions to accept the fatal dignity; but at length she
                    yielded to the entreaties of her father, her father-in-law, and her husband. The
                    better to mature their plans the cabal had kept the king’s death secret for some
                    days, but they proclaimed Queen Jane in the city on the 10th. The people
                    received the announcement with manifest coldness, and a vintner’s boy was even
                    so bold as to raise a cry for Queen Mary, for which he next day had his ears
                    nailed to the pillory and afterwards cut off. Mary, however, had received early
                    intimation of her brother’s death, and, retiring from Hunsdon into Norfolk,
                    gathered round her the nobility and commons of those parts. Northumberland was
                    despatched thither with an army to oppose her; but after reaching Newmarket he
                    complained that the council had not sent him forces in sufficient numbers, and
                    his followers began to desert. News also came that the earl of Oxford had
                    declared for Queen Mary; and as most of the council themselves were only seeking
                    an opportunity to wash their hands of rebellion, they procured a meeting at
                    Baynard’s Castle, revoked their former acts as done under coercion, and caused
                    the lord mayor to proclaim Queen Mary, which he did amid the shouts of the
                    citizens. The duke of Suffolk was obliged to tell his daughter that she must lay
                    aside her royal dignity and become a private person once more. She replied that
                    she relinquished most willingly a crown that she had only accepted out of
                    obedience to him and her mother; and her ten days’ reign was over.</p>
                <p>The leading actors in the conspiracy were now called to answer for their deeds.
                    Northumberland was brought up to London a prisoner, tried and sent to the block,
                    along with some of his partisans. The duke of Suffolk and Lady Jane were also
                    committed to the Tower; but the former, by the influence of his duchess,
                    procured a pardon. Lady Jane and her husband Lord Guildford Dudley were also
                    tried, and received sentence of death for treason. This, however, was not
                    immediately carried out; on the contrary the queen seems to have wished to spare
                    their lives, and mitigated the rigour of their confinement. Unfortunately, owing
                    to the general dislike of the queen’s marriage with Philip of Spain, Sir Thomas
                    Wyatt soon after raised a rebellion in which the duke of Suffolk and his
                    brothers took part, and on its suppression the queen was persuaded that it was
                    unsafe to spare the lives of Lady Jane and her husband any longer. On hearing
                    that they were to die, Lady Jane declined a parting interview with her husband
                    lest it should increase their pain, and prepared to meet her fate with Christian
                    fortitude. She and her husband were executed on the same day, February 12, 1554,
                    her husband on Tower Hill, and herself within the Tower an hour afterwards,
                    amidst universal sympathy and compassion.</p>
