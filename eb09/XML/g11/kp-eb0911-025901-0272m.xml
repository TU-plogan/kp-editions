                <p><label type="entry">GUILD</label>. The spirit of association has in all ages
                    induced men to join together for the pleasures of mutual enjoyment or for the
                    attainment of some common purpose for which the support of numbers was
                    necessary. The idea has taken shape in various ways, influenced by the
                    temperament of race, the policy of Governments, the social condition of classes,
                    or the need for a special object. Independently of the organization of peoples,
                    of their constitution into towns, provinces, and states as units in a system,
                    whether of self-government or of imposed government,—independently too of those
                    great associations or brotherhoods, the church, the orders of knighthood, the
                    greater and lesser monastic orders, and secret societies,—there is a third kind
                    of association upon a basis distinct from these. The public welfare of a
                    community within certain territorial limits is the great object of Governments,
                    local or imperial; the pursuit of some great moral, religious, or equitable
                    thought, touching the hearts of men in general without regard to nation, was the
                    animating principle of the chivalric and religious orders; but when men began to
                    form themselves into <hi rend="italic">guilds,</hi> the benefit of each one in
                    his individual and social capacity was concerned, naturally confined within the
                    bounds of neighbourhood. A guild was a voluntary association of those living
                    near together who joined for a com mon purpose, paying contributions,
                    worshipping together, feasting together periodically, helping one another in
                    sickness and poverty, and frequently united for the pursuit of a special
                    object.</p>
                <p>The true history of these institutions has been till recently unnoticed; their
                    value and importance, especially in connexion with the life of towns and
                    villages, having been but imperfectly investigated or understood. Guilds have,
                    however, been numerous, and their influence most important, in Europe from an
                    early period; they attained their highest prosperity and development in the
                    Teutonic countries, and especially in England during the Middle Ages, and they
                    have been widely spread among the Romance nations.</p>
                <p>The meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">guild</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >gild</hi> is closely connected with the origin of the institution. <hi
                    rend="italic">Gild</hi> or <hi rend="italic">geld</hi> was Old English for a set
                    payment or contribution, from <hi rend="italic">∑eldan</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >zyldan,</hi> to pay (whence also the present <hi rend="italic">yield);</hi> the
                    primary meaning was payment, and the company of those who paid became known by
                    this chief title to membership. There are also <hi rend="italic">gilde,</hi>
                    Danish and Low German, in the sense of a contributory company of this kind; <hi
                    rend="italic">gjalda</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gildi,</hi> Icelandic, a
                    payment, and <hi rend="italic">gildi,</hi> also a banquet. The word therefore,
                    thus derived, is better spelt (as most old authorities have it) without the <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi>; a colour is, however, given for the ordinary modern form
                    <hi rend="italic">guild,</hi> by deriving it (as Wedgwood, <hi rend="italic"
                    >English Etymology)</hi> from the Welsh or Breton <hi rend="italic">gouil,</hi>
                    a feast or holiday, <hi rend="italic">gwylad,</hi> keeping a festival.</p>
                <p>The essential principle of the guild is the banding together for mutual help,
                    mutual enjoyment, and mutual encouragement in good endeavour. The spirit which
                    directed itself to the inner business and life of each society and its members
                    iβ the true mark, in some degree, of all bodies, ancient or modern, that can
                    claim the character of guilds. The peace-guild of the North in the 10th
                    century-had this character in common -with the great trading guild of the 13th
                    and 14th centuries, or the little social or religious guild of an English
                    country village of a century later.</p>
                <p>Some German scholars find the origin of the first guilds in the banquets and
                    sacrificial assemblies of the heathen German tribes. Wilda, Dr L. Brentano, and
                    others, connecting these with what is known of the importance of family
                    relations among the Teutonic nations, find in the family union the germ from
                    which the guild was developed, and show that when Christianity was brought from
                    the south of Europe “the spirit of association received a mighty impulse, and
                    the gilds spread themselves rapidly under the influence of Christian doctrine”
                    (Brentano). It is maintained by others that the guilds have sprung from the <hi
                    rend="italic">collegia,</hi> in those countries where the Romans bore sway.</p>
                <p>The Romans exercised the right of association from early times; it is attributed
                    to Numa that he encouraged the formation of craft guilds, of which Plutarch
                    enumerates nine; there also existed early religious societies among them.
                    Exercised voluntarily under the rejΛιblic, this right became crippled under the
                    empire, and the <hi rend="italic">collegia</hi> were obliged to seek
                    authorization from the state for the narrower objects to which the imperial
                    decrees attempted to limit them. These societies were numerous, not only at
                    Rome, but throughout the empire, especially in the East, in Italy, and in Gaul;
                    a large number were trade corporations, devoted to the interest of their crafts;
                    others were united for goodfellowship, religion, and many especially to provide
                    for burial. In the provinces, besides merchants and others, the highest persons
                    were glad at times to belong to them; those in Rome under the empire appear to
                    have consisted principally of workmen, freedmen, slaves, and persons of the
                    humbler classes. All appear to have had the same general features; they chose
                    their own masters and officers, made rules for self-government, paid
                    contributions to a common fund, met and feasted together at stated periods, —the
                    freedom of social intercourse being particularly appreciated<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n273/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0273-0260"/> among the poorer companies. They formed rules for
                    good behaviour at table, and admitted women as members; they “affirmed their
                    existence by a common worship,” choosing a patron god. From these and other
                    resemblances Mr H. C. Coote contends that there is an identity between the Roman
                    <hi rend="italic">collegia</hi> and the guilds of Saxon growth; and M. Raynouard
                    was an advocate of a similar descent in France and Italy. But though analogous
                    in m⅛ny respects, as far as is known they lacked the essential element of the
                    guild, that of mutual help in sickness and poverty; the soldiers’ colleges,
                    formed in spite of the law which forbade them, approach the nearest to this
                    character, in providing their members with travelling expenses and retiring
                    pensions. The evidence against the connexion between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >collegium</hi> and the guild is regarded by the ablest German writers who have
                    investigated the subject as conclusive, but this interesting historical question
                    has not yet been fully worked out.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For a valuable sketch of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Collegia,</hi> including trade-guilds and burial-guilds, see “Les sociétés
                    ouvrières à Rome,” by Gaston Boissier, <hi rend="italic">Bx·vue dee Deux

                <p>The Greeks also, in the 2d and 3d centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>, had
                    their associations of the same kind, called <hi rend="italic">Eranoi</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Thiasoi,</hi> which were numerous at Rhodes, in the islands of the
                    Archipelago, at the Piraeus, and in other important places. These societies
                    partook more nearly of the character of the mediaeval guilds than did the Roman;
                    the members paid contributions to a general fund, aided one another in
                    necessity, provided for funerals, met in assembly to deliberate on their
                    affairs, and celebrated feasts and religious sacrifices in common. Strict rules
                    against disorderly conduct were to be enforced by fine; he who did not pay his
                    yearly quota to the society was excluded, unless he could show good cause of
                    poverty or sickness. Women could be members, and were admitted to the meetings.
                    Some of these societies concerned themselves with religion, others with politics
                    or commerce; in the cause of liberal as opposed to official religion, they
                    appear to have done good service.</p>
                <p>It is perhaps of little use attempting to ascribe to any one country or race the
                    special initiative of these institutions, any more than it would be to say that
                    the custom of men to congregate in towns originated with this or that nation.
                    Human nature is the same everywhere, and two motives induce men to join together
                    :—weakness, seeking the power of numbers for resisting oppression, or for mutual
                    assistance; and the affinity which those pursuing the same occupation and
                    possessing the same interests have for each other. These motives are sufficient
                    to account for the existence of the <hi rend="italic">Erαnoi</hi> in Greece,
                    contemporary with the <hi rend="italic">Collegia</hi> of the Romans; they are
                    sufficient to explain why, although the <hi rend="italic">collegia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">opificum,</hi> or artisans’ guilds, are found as late as the code
                    of Justinian, and that 50 ör 60 years later, in the 6th century, we have record
                    of a soap-makers’ craft in Naples (Letter of Pope Gregory the Great, lib. x.
                    epist. 26; Migne’s <hi rend="italic">Pat. Curs.,</hi> vol. lxxvii.), the guilds
                    in the towns of Italy should begin a new life in the 10th century (Hegel); they
                    can explain why in England we find from the 7th to the 10th century other guilds
                    actively in existence, while in Norway they were instituted in the 11th century.
                    These societies “may thus have one history in China, another in India, another
                    in Greece or Rome, another in the Europe of the Middle Ages; the like needs will
                    require the like kinds of help, and develop institutions which, amid whatever
                    diversities of outward garb, will substantially fulfil the same ends” (J. M.
                    Ludlow).</p>
                <p>In the Middle Ages guilds are recognized as belonging to three or four classes.
                    In the north of Europe the <hi rend="italic">frith</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >peace-guild</hi> was an important form, widely spread in early times. These
                    were associations for defence, based upon mutual obligations, “sworn communities
                    for the protection of right and the preservation of liberty;” we see traces of
                    them in England from the laws of Ina (7th century) down to the “Dooms” of London
                    in Athelstan’s time (10th century). These statutes of the old London peaceguild
                    are thus shortly described by Prof. Stubbs</p>
                <p>“A monthly meeting is directed, at which there is to he bytt-fylling and a
                    refection, the remains of which are to be bestowed ⅛ alms: on the death of a
                    member each brother gives a loaf, and sings or pays for the singing of fifty
                    psalms Each member pays fourpence for common purposes, towards a sort of
                    insurance fund from which the guild makes good the losses of members, and a
                    contribution of a shilling towards the pursuit of the thief. The members are
                    arranged in bodies of ten, one of whom is the headman; these again are classed
                    in tens under a common leader, who with the other head-men acts as treasurer and
                    adviser of the hundred members.”</p>
                <p>The early English recognized the responsibility of the guild for the actions of
                    its members and their mutual liability, —the fundamental principle of English
                    institutions for keeping the peace; besides this, the rules still exist of Saxon
                    guilds at Abbotsbury, Woodbury, Cambridge, and Exeter, and show by the many
                    points in common with the social guilds of later English growth whence these
                    derived their descent. Abroad, the frith guilds in the 11th and 12th centuries
                    extended over the Continent; one of the most remarkable was founded at Roeskild,
                    under king Canute, for the suppression of the piracy of the vikings. Others, as
                    in Schleswig, Artois, Flensburg, &amp;c., joined for hindering violence and
                    maintaining peace, by all means that law and custom allowed, even against kings.
                    These guilds became of such importance that in many places their law grew to be
                    that of the <hi rend="italic">commune</hi> or town (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Borough).</hi> In France the great development of town governments at this
                    period was frequently but the acknowledgment of an already existing defensive
                    guild, or of the important merchant or craft guilds. At Montpellier and Paris,
                    in the beginning of the 13th century, the trade guilds took part in the watch
                    and ward of the city, and thus were a recognized part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >commune.</hi> The same was the case in London in early times.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The custom of “setting out
                    the watch,” or the “marching watch,” in London, Bristol, Worcester, &amp;c., on
                    midsummer eve, originated in the part taken in the defence of the city by the
                    trade guilds or companies of those places; it was a kind of “military muster”
                    (Herbert).</p></note> Even as late as the 15th century a guild was founded at
                    Ghent, composed of the culverineers, arquebusiers, and gunners, in order to
                    teach the burgesses the use of firearms, so as to be able to defend the town or
                    suppress troubles. It became the chief guild of the city, had public
                    festivities, admitted women as “consoeurs,” and possessed many of the featuresof
                    bothpeaceand socialguilds.</p>
                <p>In the Frankish empire guilds were numerous for defence, for conviviality, and
                    for religious and social duties, among the serfs and the clergy as well as
                    others; but under Charlemagne and his successors they suffered great oppression,
                    and were persecuted by both ecclesiastical and secular authorities. In later
                    times the clergy formed special societies called <hi rend="italic">Guilds
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">Kalenders,</hi> so named from their meeting day having
                    originally been on the kalends of each month (Brentano); these were to be found
                    in many towns on the Continent, sometimes we read of the major and minor guilds
                    for the higher and lower clergy. The only company that is known to have partaken
                    of this character in England was the ancient Guild of the Kalenders at Bristol,
                    which kept the records of that town and other places, and in its later years
                    supported a school for Jews.</p>
                <p>A class of guilds widely spread in the Middle Ages, especially in England, were
                    those which have been distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">Social</hi>
                    (Toulmin Smith) or <hi rend="italic">Religious</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n274/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0274-0261"/> (Brentano). These were the small and numerous
                    societies that sprung up all over the country in every village, in small or
                    large towns, at different times as the peed arose, or for good neighbourhood’s
                    sake. Their objects included “not only devotions and orisons, but also every
                    exercise of Christian charity, and therefore, above all things, mutual
                    assistance of the gild-brothers in every exigency, especially in old age, in
                    sickness, in cases of impoverishment,—if not brought on by their own folly,—and
                    of wrongful imprisonment, in losses by fire, water, or shipwreck, aid by loans,
                    provision of work, and lastly, the burial of the dead. It included further the
                    assistance of the poor and sick, and the visitation and comfort of prisoners not
                    belonging to the gild” (Brentano). These societies were composed of men and
                    women of all ranks, and when, as in some instances, they grew into wealth and
                    popularity, kings and princes did not disdain to become guild-brethren. Henry
                    IV. and Henry VI. were members of the guild of the Trinity at Coventry; Henry
                    VIII. and his queen were members of the guild of St Barbara, of St Katherine’s
                    church next the Tower, London. Another prince belonged to the famous guild of St
                    George at Norwich. One guild, however, who said they were “of the rank of common
                    and middling folks,” would not admit even a mayor or a bailiff.</p>
                <p>Each member took an oath, and paid an admission fee and yearly contribution; they
                    held regular business meetings or “morn-speech,” and had an annual “guild-day.”
                    Every guild had its livery, which the members were expected to wear at funerals,
                    feasts, &amp;c.; and they had strict rules for good life and behaviour. The
                    little parochial guilds met in a room or in member^’ houses; if the guild was
                    rich enough it had a hall or “guild-house;” legacies and gifts were made to
                    them, and they lent out of their stock to poor members, or devoted it to some
                    public or charitable object. Schools and churches were founded or helped by
                    these private guilds, as some of the colleges at Cambridge, schools at Coventry,
                    Worcester, Brayles, Sleaford, Ludlow, Bristol, and elsewhere; forty guilds of
                    Bodmin (of which only five were craft guilds) joined in the repair of the church
                    there. Bridges and town-walls were repaired, both in England and in France—in
                    which latter country M. Giry finds some relics of these social guilds. The
                    performing of miracle and other plays, setting out of pageants, and providing of
                    minstrels were undertaken by many of the social as well as by the craft guilds,
                    and in many towns formed an important adjunct to the municipal proceedings, as
                    at Coventry, York, Durham, Norwich, &amp;c.; the Lord Mayor’s show of London
                    owes its origin to this custom.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Probably the numerous societies in France and Flanders of

                    Custιtmαrwm).</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>These local social guilds were very numerous in England and in the Teutonic
                    countries; it is believed that they were so in France, but little is known of
                    them elsewhere. There were 50 such guilds in the county of Cambridge, 909 in
                    Norfolk, 42 in Bodmin, 80 in Cologne, 70 at Lübeck, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>At the time of the Reformation these guilds were abolished in Protestant
                    countries, under pretence of their being superstitious foundations; in Denmark
                    and North Germany their property was devoted to public service, but in England
                    it was handed over to the king and his courtiers, their guild-halls became
                    poor-houses, their pageants were laid aside. A very few of these societies
                    escaped; St George’s guild at Norwich continued to live on many years.</p>
                <p>Wickliffe, in the 14th century, had complained of the abuses among the guilds,
                    including those of trades. In 1389 returns were made into Chancery of the social
                    and other guilds in England; these, though imperfect, give a valuable body of
                    details, and draw the distinction between the two great classes of social and
                    trade guilds. The trade guilds have in all countries attracted more attention
                    than the rest, on account of their wealth and importance; they are of two
                    orders, <hi rend="italic">guilds-merchant</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >craft-guilds.</hi> The guildmerchant arose in this way; the same men who in the
                    growth of towns became citizens by reason of possessing town-land, frequently
                    were also traders; the uncertain state of society in early times naturally
                    caused them to unite for protection of their trade interests in a <hi
                    rend="italic">gilda</hi><hi rend="italic">mercatoria,</hi> which made internal
                    laws akin to those of other guilds; the success of these private interests
                    enlarged their importance; and when the towns and boroughs obtained confirmation
                    of their municipal life by charter, they took care to have it included that the
                    men of the place should also have their guild merchant.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There are numerous examples of this among the
                    borough records of England and Scotland.</p></note> Thus these guilds obtained
                    the recognition of the state; in their origin they had been as other guilds,
                    partaking especially of the character of peace-guilds, but now “the citizens and
                    the guild became identical, and what was guild-law” often became the law of the
                    town. In great cities, such as London and Florence, we do not hear of merchant
                    guilds (Norton); there the separate occupations or crafts early asserted their
                    associating power and independence, and the craft-guilds gradually took a place
                    in the organization of the town government. Many craft-guilds, the heads of
                    which were concerned in the government of the commune, are found in Italy
                    between the 9th and the 12th centuries (Perrens, <hi rend="italic">Hist, de
                    Florence).</hi> But in England and the north of Europe the guilds-merchant
                    during this period, having grown rich and tyrannical, excluded the landless men
                    of the handicrafts; these then uniting among themselves, there arose everywhere
                    by the side of the guilds-merchant the craft-guilds, which gained the upper hand
                    on the Continent in the struggle for liberty in the 13th and 14th centuries. In
                    England these companies usually existed side by side with the old town or
                    merchant guild; until at length their increasing importance caused the decay of
                    the old guilds, and the adoption of these crafts as part of the constitution of
                    the towns (13th to 15th century). The separation of the richer and perhaps the
                    older from the poorer of the companies occurred, and thus arose the paramount
                    influence of a few,—as the twelve great Companies of London, the √in⅛ <hi
                    rend="italic">Majori</hi> of Florence, and others.</p>
                <p>The constitution of the trade-guilds was formed on the model of other guilds;
                    they appointed a master or aiderman and other officers, made ordinances,
                    including provisions for religious observance, mutual help, and burial; the town
                    ordinances yet remaining of many places, as of Berwick, Southampton, and
                    Worcester, show traces of the trade laws of the old guilds-merchant. As their
                    principal objects, “the craft-gildmen provided for the maintenance of the
                    customs of their craft, framed further ordinances for its regulation, (including
                    care against fraudulent workmanship), saw these ordinances properly executed,
                    and punished the gild-brothers who infringed them.” “Though the craftgilds, as
                    voluntary associations, did not need confirmation by the authorities at their
                    birth, yet this confirmation became afterwards of the greatest importance, when
                    these gilds wanted to be recognized as special and independent associations,
                    which were thenceforth to regulate the trade instead of the authorities of the
                    town” (Brentano). Hence obtained the practice of procuring a charter in
                    confirmation and recognition of their laws, in return for which certain taxes
                    were paid to the king or other authority. It is therefore erroneous to state, as
                    is sometimes done, that these companies owe their origin to royal charter, or
                    that they required a licence.</p>

                    York, Exeter, Norwich, Bristol, Coventry, &amp;c., teemed with their life and
                    pageantry. But the Reformation shook these as it destroyed others; the exactions
                    they suffered, and the altered conditions of social economy and labour have
                    contributed to their decay; “all that remains of the ancient gilds in the livery
                    companies of to-day is the common eating and drinking.” In the centre 3 of
                    industry of Italy, France, Germany, even in Constantinople, they once formed the
                    strength of commerce, but, abused or decayed, in France they were abolished on
                    4th August 1789; in Germany their last remnants died in 1869.<note
