                    (1725-1805), in the full tide of the 18th century, when professional distinction
                    appeared to be reserved exclusively for those who devoted themselves to the
                    production of historical or allegorical subjects, achieved an immense reputation
                    as a painter of scenes of domestic life. He was born at Tournus in 1725, and is
                    generally said to have formed his own talent; this is, however, true only in the
                    most limited sense, for at an early age his inclinations, though thwarted by his
                    father, were encouraged by a Lyonnese artist named Grandon or Grondom who
                    enjoyed during his lifetime considerable reputation as a portrait-painter.
                    Grandon not only persuaded the father of Greuze to give way to his son’s wishes,
                    and permit the lad to accompany him as his pupil to Lyons, but when at a later
                    date he himself left Lyons for Paris—where his son-in-law Grétry the celebrated
                    composer enjoyed the height of favour—Grandon carried young Greuze with him.
                    Settled in Paris, Greuze worked from the living model in the school of the Royal
                    Academy, but did not attract the attention of his teachers; and when he produced
                    his first picture, Le Père de Famille expliquant la Bible à ses Enfants,
                    considerable doubt was felt and shown as to his share in its production. By
                    other and more remarkable works of the same class Greuze soon established his
                    claims beyond contest, and won for himself the notice and support of the
                    well-known connoisseur La Live de Jully, the brother-in-law of Madame d’ Épinay.
                    In 1755 Greuze exhibited his Aveugle Trompé, upon which, presented by Pigalle
                    the sculptor, he was immediately <hi rend="italic">agree</hi> by the Academy.
                    Towards the close of the same year he left France for Italy, in company with the
                    Abbé Louis Gougenot, who had deserted from the magistrature,—although he had
                    obtained the post of “conseillier au Châtelet,”—in order to take the “petit
                    collet.” Gougenot had some acquaintance with the arts, and was highly valued by
                    the Academicians,—who, during his journey with Greuze elected him an honorary
                    member of their body—on account of his studies in mythology and allegory; his
                    acquirements in these respects are said to have been largely utilized by them,
                    but to Greuze they were of doubtful advantage, and he lost rather than gained by
                    this visit to Italy in Gougenot’s company. He had undertaken it probably in
                    order to silence those who taxed him with ignorance of “great models of style,”
                    but the Italian subjects which formed the entirety of his contributions to the
                    Salon of 1757 showed that he had been put on a false track, and he speedily
                    returned to the source of his first inspiration. In 1759, 1761 (L’Accordée de
                    Village, —Louvre), and 1763 Greuze exhibited with ever increasing success; in
                    1765 he reached the zenith of his powers and reputation. In that year he was
                    represented with no less than thirteen works, amongst which maybe cited La Jeune
                    Fille qui pleure son Oiseau mort, La Bonne Mère, Le Mauvais Fils puni (Louvre),
                    and La Malédiction Paternelle (Louvre). The Academy took occasion to press
                    Greuze for his diploma picture, the execution of which had been long delayed,
                    and forbade him to exhibit on their walls until he had complied with their
                    regulations. “J’ai vu la lettre,” says Diderot, “qui est un modèle d’honnêteté
                    et d’estime; j’ai vu la réponse de Greuze qui est un modèle de vanité et
                    d’impertinence: il fallait appuyer cela d’un chef-d’oeuvre, et c’est ce que
                    Greuze n’a pas fait.” Greuze wished to be received as an historical painter, and
                    produced a work which he intended to vindicate his right to despise his
                    qualifications as a <hi rend="italic">peintre</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                        genre.</hi> This unfortunate canvas,—</p>

                <p>Sevère et Caracalla (Louvre),—was exhibited in 1769 side by side with Greuze’s
                    portrait of Jeaurat (Louvre), and his admirable Petite Fille au Chien Noir. The
                    Academicians received their new member with all due honours, but at the close of
                    the ceremonies the Director addressed Greuze in these words—“Monsieur,
                    l’Académie vous a reçu, mais c’est comme peintre de genre; elle a eu égard à vos
                    anciennes productions, qui sont excellentes, et elle a fermé les yeux sur
                    celle-ci, qui n’est digne ni d’elle ni de vous.” Greuze, greatly incensed,
                    quarrelled with his <hi rend="italic">confrères,</hi> and ceased to exhibit
                    until, in 1804, the Revolution had thrown open the doors of the Academy to all
                    the world. In the following year, on 4th March 1805, he died in the Louvre in
                    great poverty. He had been in receipt of considerable wealth, which he had
                    dissipated by extravagance and bad management, so that during his closing years
                    he was forced even to solicit commissions which his enfeebled powers no longer
                    enabled him to carry out with success. The brilliant reputation which Greuze
                    acquired seems to have been due, not to his acquirements as a painter,—for his
                    practice is evidently that current in his own day,—but to the character of the
                    subjects which he treated. That return to nature which inspired Rousseau’s
                    attacks upon an artificial civilization demanded expression in art. Diderot in
                        <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Fils</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Naturel et le Père de Famille</hi> tried to turn the vein of domestic drama
                    to account on the stage; that which he tried and failed to do, Greuze, in
                    painting, achieved with extraordinary success, although his works, like the
                    plays of Diderot, were affected by that very artificiality against which they
                    protested. The touch of melodramatic exaggeration, however, which runs through
                    them finds an apology in the firm and brilliant play of line, in the freshness
                    and vigour of the flesh tints, in the enticing softness of expression (often
                    obtained by almost an abuse of <hi rend="italic">méplats),</hi> by the alluring
                    air of health and youth, by the sensuous attractions, in short, with which
                    Greuze invests his lessons of bourgeois morality. As Diderot said of La Bonne
                    Mère, “ça prêche la population ;” and a certain piquancy of contrast is the
                    result which never fails to obtain admirers. La Jeune Fille à ΓAgneau fetched,
                    indeed, at the Pourtalis sale in 1865 no less than 1,000,200 francs. One of
                    Greuze’s pupils, Madame Le Doux, imitated with success the manner of her master;
                    his daughter and granddaughter, Madame de Valory, also inherited some traditions
                    of his talent. Madame de Valory published in 1813 a Comédie-vaudeville, <hi

                    which she prefixed a notice of her grandfather’s life and works, and the <hi

                    particulars, the story at full length of Greuze’s quarrel with the Academy. Four
                    of the most distinguished engravers of that date, Massard père, Flipart,
                    Gaillard, and Levasseur, were specially entrusted by Greuze with the
                    reproduction of his subjects, but there are also excellent prints by other
                    engravers, notably by Cars and Le Bas. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. f. s.
