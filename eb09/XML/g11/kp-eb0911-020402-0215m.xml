                    from E.N.E. to W.S.W., and 45 in breadth, and has an area of 2963 square miles.
                    On the N.E. and E. it abuts against the little principality of Liechtenstein,
                    and the Austrian provinces of Tyrol and Vorarlberg, on the S. on the Italian
                    provinces of Vai Tellina and Como, and on the W. and N. on the Swiss cantons of
                    Ticino, Uri, Glarus, and St Gall.</p>
                <p>The whole canton is mountainous, and, with the exception of the Rhine valley
                    below Reichenau and the Italian valleys, which still form part of it, has a
                    severe alpine climate and vegetation. One-tenth of the surface is covered by
                    glaciers. The five principal glacier groups are those of the Tödi, N.; the
                    Medelser Gebirge and the Rheinwald or Adula Gebirge, containing the chief source
                    of the Rhine, S.W.; the Bernina group, the largest and loftiest, S.E.; and the
                    Silvretta Gebirge, E. The principal valleys are the Vorder and Hinter
                    Rlieinthäler, with their side-valleys the Valserthal, Averserthal,
                    Oberhalbstein, and Prätigau, forming together the upper basin of the Rhine.
                    Besides these, the canton includes the long narrow trough of the upper Inn, and
                    the Italian valleys of Misocco, Bregaglia, and Poschiavo, whose streams join the
                    Ticino or the Adda. The high average elevation of the country, with the absence
                    of any large lake, renders the scenery more severe than that of central
                    Switzerland, and the mountain summits less imposing. The most fertile valleys
                    are the Prätigau and Rheinthal below Ilanz. The lower chains arc rent by many
                    great gorges. The Via Mala, the Rofla, and the Schyn are the best known, but
                    those of the Züge, the Averserthal, Medelserthal, and Valserthal are almost
                    equal to them in grandeur. In the Rheinthal below Chur the vine flourishes and
                    good wine is produced, and the Cisalpine territory bears the usual products of
                    the southern slope of the Alps, maize and chestnuts. At Poschiavo tobacco is
                    cultivated to some extent. The inner valleys are the highest of Central Europe,
                    containing several villages at an elevation of about 6000 feet (St Moritz,
                    Engadine, 6080; Bivio, Oberhalbstein, 5827; Cresta, in the Averserthal, 6394;
                    snow lies there for six or seven months in the year, and corn will not ripen.
                    The hay-harvest is the great agricultural event of the year, and is so large
                    that great numbers of Italian labourers are annually employed in it. The forests
                    and pasturages are the chief source of wealth. The lower Alpβ maintain a fine
                    breed of cows; the upper are let to Bergamasque shepherds, who drive yearly
                    immense flocks of sheep from North Italy for the summer pasturage. There are
                    many mineral spring3 in the country; the most frequented are at Alveneu,
                    Fideris, Le Prese, and San Bernardino, besides those in the Engadine (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Engadine).</hi></p>
                <p>The Grisons is sparely peopled. The population in 1870 amounted to 91,782,—
                    39,843 Protestants and 51,877 <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0216-0205"/> Catholics. 36,000 speak German and 12,000
                    Italian. The remainder use the Romansch or the Ladin dialect, probably corrupt
                    descendants of the old “lingua rustica” of the Roman empire. The former is dying
                    out in some districts on the Tyrolese frontier, and German is now everywhere
                    taught in the schools. A large portion of the population find occupation and
                    profit in the summer in attending to the wants of the numerous visitors
                    attracted by the scenery or the mineral waters. There is a considerable
                    transport trade with Italy, particularly in Vai Tellina wines. Many of the young
                    men seek their fortunes abroad as confectioners and coffee-house keepers.</p>
                <p>Since Roman times the passes of the Grisons have been among the most frequented
                    routes across the Alps. The Julier and Bernina, the Septimer, Splügen, and
                    Lukmanier, were the most used in the Middle Ages. In 1818-23 the great road of
                    the San Bernardino was made, and it was soon rivalled by the Splügen. The
                    internal communicatione of the canton have been greatly developed in the last
                    twenty years. The following are the principal carriage roads:—(1) the Ober Alp,
                    Vorderrheinthal to Uri; (2) the Valserberg, Ilanz to Hinterrhein; (3) the Schyn,
                    Julier, Albula, and Fluela Passes, connecting the Rhine valley and Davos
                    district with the Engadine; (4) the Maloya and Bernina Passes, connecting the
                    Upper Engadine with Chiavenna and Vai Tellina respectively; (5) the Ofen Pass
                    and the road following the gorge of the Inn to Fin-stermuntz, leading into
                    Tyrol.</p>
                <p>Two districts, the Upper Engadine and Davos, have lately acquired European fame
                    as health resorts. Davos now receives every winter over 1000 consumptive
                    patients. Statistics show that diseases of the lungs are very rare in high
                    mountain districts, and local doctors observed that inhabitants who had
                    contracted them in the plain recovered speedily on their return home. Davos is
                    singularly well situated for a sanatari um for these diseases. The climate,
                    owing to its distance from the warm currents rising from the Italian plain, is,
                    though severe, singularly dry and equable in winter, and the valley is open and
                    sunny. Many good hotels offer every comfort to invalids.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History. —</hi> The Rhaeti, the original inhabitants of the
                    region now known as Graubünden, who were conquered under Augustus by the Romans,
                    are reputed to have been an Etruscan race who had emigrated thither 500 years
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The Romans established numerous roads through the
                    country, and held it in subjection until the downfall of their empire. In 496
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Theodoric the Great settled some Alemanni in
                    Rhaetia. In 807 the district was incorporated by Charles the Great in his
                    empire, and placed under a temporal count. In the middle of the 11th century, in
                    the confusion consequent on the fall of the duchy of Alemannia, the bishop of
                    Chur regained part of the temporal authority some of his predecessors had
                    already held before 807, and in the early Middle Ages he appears as the most
                    powerful among the petty rulers who disputed among themselves the right of
                    oppressing the peasantry. Towards the end of the 14th century, the bishop of
                    Chur supported the league formed by the neighbouring districts to resist the
                    encroachment of the lay nobles. This was known as the Gotteshausbund, and had
                    Chur (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Coire)</hi> as its chief town. In 1424 the
                    Oberbund, sometimes called, perhaps from the grey coats of the delegates who
                    assembled at Trons to confirm it, the Grauebund, was formed with the aid of the
                    abbot of Dissentis and a party among the nobles in the Vorder Rheinthal. In 1436
                    the districts bordering on Tyrol, which had been vassals of the counts of
                    Toggenburg (till the extinction of the line in that year), concluded, in
                    imitation of their neighbours, a league known as the Zehngerichtenbund, with
                    Davos for its centre. In 1450 the Zehngerichte formed an alliance with the
                    Gotteshausbund, in 1471 with the Grauebund; but of the so-called “perpetual
                    alliance” at Vazerol near Tiefenkasten there exists no authentic evidence in the
                    oldest chronicles. It is certain, however, that several diets were held at
                    Vazerol. Unhappily for the whole Grisons, nearly all the possessions of the
                    Toggenburg family had fallen by 1489 to the house of Austria, to which an excuse
                    was thus given for interference in the country. In 1497 the Grauebund and in
                    1498 the Gotteshausbund entered into alliance with the seven Swiss cantons. In
                    1499 the contest with Austria broke out. The memorable victory of the
                    Malserheide or Calveu, in which the imperial troops were defeated with a loss of
                    5000 men, coupled with other disasters to his arms 4n North Switzerland weakened
                    the authority of Maximilian, but the rights of Austria in the Zehngerichtenbund
                    were only extinguished by purchase in 1652. In 1512 the Grisons took advantage
                    of the war in Italy to lay hands on Vai Tellina, Bormio, Chiavenna, and Vai
                    Misocco.</p>
                <p>These acquisitions attracted, a hundred years later, the cupidity of the Spanish
                    governor of Milan. The Grisons, torn between the French and the Spanish, the
                    Reformed and Catholic parties, offered a favourable field for his intrigues. In
                    1620 the Protestants of Vai Tellina were cruelly massacred, the Spaniards gained
                    the district, and an Austrian force occupied the greater part of the Grisons.
                    The Austrians were expelled in 1635 by the French, but the Grisons did not
                    recover their full authority over their Italian possessions till 1639. They
                    finally lost them when Napoleon annexed these districts to his Cisalpine
                    republic, a measure confirmed by the congress of Vienna.</p>
                <p>The obscure quarrels of the Planta and De Salis factions, dating from the 17th
                    century, were put an 'end to by the Napoleonic wars and the appearance of great
                    armies—French, Austrian, and Russian—upon the mountains. The incursion of the
                    French was marked by the wanton destruction of the great convent of Dissentis,
                    in which perished the chronicle of Dissentis, dating from the 7th century, and
                    many of the MSS. of Placidus a Spescba, one of the first systematic explorers of
                    his native Alps. In 1803 the Grisons, by virtue of Napoleon’s act of mediation,
                    became a member of the Swiss Confederation, retaining its internal government.
                    This consists of a great council elected by universal suffrage, and meeting
                    every year. Three citizens, elected yearly, form the executive government. A
                    committee of 12 members assist them in weighty matters and in preparing bills
                    for the chamber. Large powers of self-government are left to the separate
                    communities. The constitution was last completely revised in 1853, but a further
                    reform in an extreme democratic sense is now (1879) under debate.</p>
