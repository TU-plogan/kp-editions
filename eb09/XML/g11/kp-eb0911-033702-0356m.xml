                    percha, is the name of the tree; hence the term may be translated “gum of the
                    percha tree.” The old name of Sumatra was Pulo or Pulau Percha, <hi

                    To what particular tree the name “gutta percha” properly belongs, there is no

                    of 60 to 80 feet, with a diameter of 2 to 4 feet. The leaves are obovate-oblong
                    and entire, pale green on the upper side, and covered beneath with short
                    reddish-brown shining down. The flowers are arranged in clusters of 3 or 4 in
                    the axils of the leaves. The fruit, about an inch long, is of an ovoid shape,
                    and is eaten by the Malays. In Siâk (Sumatra) a vegetable butter is prepared
                    from the seeds. The wood is soft, fibrous, spongy, of a pale colour, and marked
                    with black lines, these being reservoirs of gutta percha.<note anchored="true"

                    from the tree, is of a greyish hue, occasionally with a somewhat roseate tinge,
                    probably arising from the colour vessels of the bark becoming ruptured through
                    surcharge, and their contents mixing with the gutta. This species does not
                    furnish all the gutta percha of commerce; indeed there are other trees which
                    yield larger quantities. In all there are about thirty varieties known; but some
                    of the vernacular names in different districts may prove mere synonyms.</p>
                <p>The geographical distribution of the trees producing gutta percha is very
                    restricted. Giitzlaff defines the limits as 6° N. and S. lat. and 100° to 120°
                    E. long.; whilst Captain Lingard (who has great personal experience on the
                    subject) gives the limits as 4° N. and 3° S. lat., still further restricting the
                    finer varieties to 3° 50' N. and 1° S., with a temperature ranging between 66°
                    and 90° Fahr., and a very moist atmosphere. These limits are well within the
                    isotherm of 80° Fahr. Many of the best varieties are found only on the hill
                    slopes at a distance from the sea-coast, each variety forming a separate grove
                    of from 200 to 500 trees, with high forest trees above them. They grow best in a
                    rich light loam, with a rocky subsoil.</p>
                <p>The collection of gutta percha generally takes place directly after the rainy
                    season, as in the dry season the gutta does not flow so readily, while during
                    the rains ague and jungle fever are most prevalent, and the gutta is liable to
                    be washed away from the felled trees. The yield of a well-grown tree of the best
                    variety is from 2 to 3 lb of gutta percha, such a tree being about thirty years
                    old, 30 to 40 feet high, and 1⅜ to 3 feet in circumference. A full-grown tree
                    sometimes measures 100 to 140 feet to its first branches, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n357/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0357-0338"/> with a girth of 20 feet at a distance of 14 feet
                    from the base, and may yield 50 to 60 δ&gt; of gutta percha, which loses in six
                    months about 35 per cent, of its weight in drying.</p>
                <p>The methods of extracting the gutta percha are much the same amongst the Malays,
                    Chinese, and Dyak3, The trees are cut down just above the buttresses, or <hi
                    rend="italic">banees,</hi> as they are called; and for this purpose a staging
                    about 14 to 16 feet high is erected. The tools used in felling are either <hi
                    rend="superscript"> rt</hi> billiôngs” or “parangs.” A billiong is a kind of axe
                    used by the Malays in felling, building, &amp;c. The blade is of a chisel-like
                    form, and the tang is secured at right angles to a handle by means of a lashing
                    of “ratan” or cane. The Chinese sometimes use an axe perfectly wedge-shaped. The
                    parang looks more like a sword-bayonet, and in the hands of a Malay is a box of
                    tools in itself, as with it he can cut up his food, fell a tree, build a house,
                    or defend himself.</p>
                <p>When the tree is felled the branches are speedily lopped off, to prevent the
                    ascent of the gutta to the leaves. Narrow strips of bark, about an inch broad
                    and 6 inches apart, are then removed, but not all round the tree, as its
                    underpart in its fall becomes buried in the soft earth, much sap being thus
                    lost. Some natives beat the bark with mallets to accelerate the flow of milk or
                    gutta. The milk flows slowly (changing colour the while) and rapidly concretes,
                    and, according to its source, may vary from yellowish-white to reddish or even
                    brownish in hue. The gutta as it flows is received into hollow bamboos,
                    doubled-up leaves, spathes of palms, pieces of bark, cocoa-nut shells, or in
                    holes scraped in the ground. If the quantity obtained is small, it is prepared
                    on the spot by rubbing it together in the hands into a block, in one end of
                    which a hole is made to carry it by. In this state it is known in the market as
                    “raw gutta” or “gutta muntah.” If water gets mixed with the juice, the gutta
                    becomes stringy and is considered deteriorated, but after boiling appears quite
                    as good. Sometimes the gutta is kept in a raw state for a month or two, and then
                    undergoes the next step in the preparation, that is, boiling. The boiling is
                    generally conducted in a “kwali” or pan of cast or hammered iron, of about 15
                    inches in diameter and 6 inches deep. The boiling iβ either simply with water,
                    or with the addition of lime juice or cocoa-nut oil. If one pint of lime juice
                    be added to three gallons of gutta juice, the latter coagulates immediately on
                    ebullition.</p>
                <p>On arriving at the port of shipment the gutta, before exportation, generally
                    undergoes examination and classification into parcels, according to quality. As
                    received in the “godowns” or warehouses it presents great diversities in
                    condition, shape, size, and colour,—from crumbling, hardly coherent, whitish or
                    greyish “raw” or “getah muntah” fragments, to reddish or brownish blocks as hard
                    as wood. Sometimes it is made up into all manner of grotesque shapes of animals,
                    and it is nearly always largely adulterated with sago-flour, sawdust, clay,
                    stones, &amp;c. The Chinese are great adepts in assorting and classifying gutta,
                    and frequently prepare from different varieties a certain “standard sample” by
                    cutting or chopping the material into thin slices and boiling with water in
                    large shallow iron pans, keeping the contents constantly stirred with poles, and
                    adding good gutta percha and even cocoa-nut oil to give a better appearance.
                    When sufficiently boiled the gutta is pressed into large moulds, and is then
                    ready for shipment. This process of reboiling is wholly unnecessary, and in some
                    cases is done only to get rid of stuff which has no right to be called “gutta
                    percha.”</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The early history of the use of gutta percha is
                    somewhat obscure; the Malays and Chinese are said to have long known and used
                    it. One of the earliest notices of it in England occurs in a catalogue of the
                    collection of the famous Tradescants.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the <hi rend="italic">Museum Tradescaniianum; or, a

                    warmed, will work to any form.” This museum became the nucleus of the Ashmolean
                    Museum at Oxford. Tliβ word “mazer,” variously spelt, often occurs in early
                    English poetry, and is specially' mentioned in old catalogues and wills. It is
                    by no means impossible that mazer cups may have been made of gutta percha, as
                    its lightness, strength, and non-liability to fracture would recommend it; and
                    curiously enough one of the vernacular names of the tree yielding gutta percha
                    is “mazer wood tree.”</p></note> Dr Montgomerie, a surgeon in the East India
                    Company’s service, was the first to direct attention to gutta percha as likely
                    to prove of great utility in the arts aud manufactures. Having observed the
                    substance in Singapore in 1822 in the form of whips, he commenced experimenting
                    with it. In 1842, being again stationed at Singapore, he followed up the
                    subject, and his recommendation of it to the medical board of Calcutta as useful
                    for making of splints and other surgical apparatus met with high approval. He
                    also sent specimens, with relative information, to the Society of Arts of
                    London, which society warmly took up the subject, and on Montgomerie’s return to
                    England in 1844 presented him with its gold medal. Some have claimed the honour
                    of introducing gutta percha to the notice of the commercial world for Dr
                    (afterwards Sir) José D’Almeida, who sent a specimen merely as a curiosity to
                    the Royal Asiatic Society in 1843, but careful investigation clearly,, decides
                    the question of priority in favour of Montgomerie. The Society of Arte having
                    requested him to lay before them the result of his experiments, he delivered a
                    lecture in the autumn of 1844, and many patents were at once taken out, the
                    chief being those of Mr C. Hancock, Mr Nickels, Mr Keene, Messrs Barlow and
                    Forster, Mr E. W. Siemens, and others. After this the substance soon came into
                    general use.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Collins

                    laticiferous tissue of the plant, which exists in greatest abundance in the
                    middle layer of the bark. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Botany,</hi> vol. iv. p.
                    87.</p>
                <p>Gutta percha is resolvable into two resins, <hi rend="italic">αlbiη</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">fiuavil.</hi> Like caoutchouc or india rubber, it is a
                    hydrocarbon; Soubeiran gives its composition as—carbon 87'80 and hydrogen 12 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 20. In commercial gutta percha we have this
                    hydrocarbon or pure gutta, <hi rend="italic">phis</hi> a soft resin, a resultant
                    of oxidation of the hydrocarbon. Μ. Payen gives the following analysis of
                    commercial gutta percha :—</p>
                <p>Pure gutta (milk-white in colour and fusible), 75 to 82 per cent.</p>
                <p>Besins soluble in boiling alcohol :—</p>
                <p>1. Crystalbin or albin (C <hi rend="subscript"> 20</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    32</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), white, and crystallizing out of the
                    alcohol as it cools, 6 to 14 per cent.</p>
                <p>2. Fiuavil (C <hi rend="subscript"> 20</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 32</hi> O),
                    yellow, falling as an amorphous powder on the cooling of the alcohol, 6 to 14
                    per cent.</p>
                <p>It is thus apparent that the change of pure gutta into a resin-like mass takes
                    place naturally if means be not taken to stop it. Many a good parcel has been
                    thus lost to commerce, and the only remedy seems to be thorough boiling.as soon
                    after collecting as possible. It must be remembered too that, in cutting through
                    the bark to arrive at the laticiferous vessels, many other vessels and cells
                    become ruptured, containing tannic and gallic acids, &amp;c., and the presence
                    of these no doubt accelerates oxidation. In opening bottles of the milky juice a
                    turbidity and effervescence are often noticed, owing to the formation of a
                    brownish liquid, the colour being probably due to the presence of gallic acid.
                    In improperly prepared blocks of gutta also, these foreign substances induce the
                    presence of a brown fermented and putrid liquid, which decomposes the internal
                    mass. Many of these substances, being soluble in water, are removable by the
                    process of boiling.</p>
                <p>Gutta percha as met with in commerce is of a reddish or yellowish hue, but when

                    receiving the impression of the nail, is of a porous structure, and when viewed
                    under the microscope has the appearance of a series of variously hued prisms.
                    When moulded, rolled into sheets, or drawn into ropes, it. assumes a fibrous
                    character in the direction of its greatest length, in which direction
                    consequently it can be stretched without rupture. If, however, a strip of a
                    sheet be cut off across the fibre, it will be found that a redistribution of the
                    tenacity of the slip takes place; i.β., the direction of the fibrous character
                    is developed in an opposite direction. The electrical properties of gutta percha
                    were first noticed by Faraday. If a piece be subjected to friction, an electric
                    spark can be obtained. On its relative electric conductivity, see vol. viii. p.
                    53.</p>
                <p>At a temperature of 32° to 77° Fahr., gutta percha has as much tenacity as thick
                    leather, though inelastic and less flexible. In water at 110° Fahr, it becomes
                    less hard; towards 120° Fahr, it becomes doughy, though still tough; and at from
                    145° to 150° it grows soft and pliable, allowing readily of being rolled and
                    moulded. In this state it has all the elasticity of caoutchouc, but this it
                    loses as it cools, gradually becoming hard and rigid again, and retaining any
                    form impressed on it whilst in its plastic condition. It is highly inflammable,
                    and buras with a bright flame, dropping a black residue like sealing wax. The
                    specific gravity of gutta percha has been variously stated at from 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 9β285 to 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 99923. It
                    is insoluble in water, alcohol, dilute acids, and alkalies, but dissolves in
                    warm oil of turpentine, bisulphide of carbon, coal tar oil, caoutchin or oil of
                    caoutchouc, and its own oil,—for it yields by destructive distillation an oil
                    similar to that yielded by caoutchouc under the same treatment. Ether and some
                    of the essential oils render it pasty, and it is softened by hot water,
                    absorbing a small quantity of the water, which is slowly parted with in
                    cooling.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufacture and Applications.—</hi> Gutta percha, as received
                    in England, is in irregular clumps or blocks, and is frequently adulterated with
                    massive stones, sawdust, bark, sago flour, and other foreign matters; and the
                    first step in its manufacture is to cleanse it thoroughly. The blocks are first
                    sliced by means of a powerful circular wheel driven by machinery, and having
                    fixed in it two or three strong chisel-like knives, by which it is divided into
                    thin slices. These are placed in wooden troughs filled with water and heated by
                    steam. As soon as the gutta percha becomes soft, it is taken out in baskets and
                    placed in a toothed iron cylinder, called a “devilling” machine, which tears it
                    into fragments; these fall into a trough of water, and the impurities sink to
                    the bottom, leaving the purified gutta floating in the form of a spongy mass.
                    This mass is then taken out by means of perforated shovels, thoroughly washed in
                    cold water, and dried in baskets. It is then packed in jacketed iron chests
                    heated by steam, and left till it becomes soft, when it is at once removed, and
                    kneaded or masticated by means of a cast-iron cylinder, with a movable lid and
                    an internal revolving toothed iron axis,—the result being a homogeneous
                    dough-like reddish-brown mass. Sometimes various substances are introduced into
                    this machine, which is called a “masticator,” to increase the hardness or
                    density of the gutta, or to colour it,—such as orange or red lead, chrome,
                    vermilion, yellow ochre, sulphur, caoutchouc, gypsum, or resin, care being taken
                    to use such substances only as are not affected by the heat necessary in the
                    operation. The incorporation is conducted with great nicety, as at the will of
                    the operator a soft and elastic or a hard and horny substance can be produced.
                    When sufficiently masticated, the gutta is placed whilst still hot between two
                    steel cylinders, and thoroughly rolled. By means of an endless band of felt the
                    gutta is returned again to the cylinders, the distance between which is
                    gradually diminished so as to compress and completely drive out any contained
                    air from the gutta percha. There are various machines for cutting driving bands,
                    &amp;c., to a uniform width, and for rounding off the edges and finishing. Soles
                    for boots are made by cutting a long strip of the requisite width, and then
                    passing the strip under a hollow die.</p>
                <p>In making piping a machine is used consisting of a cylinder, with a die-piece
                    attached of the requisite size. By means of a piston the gutta percha, which is
                    introduced into the cylinder in a plastic condition, is drivên through the
                    die-piece, and the piston gives the inner diameter of the piping. As the piping
                    issues from the machine, it passes immediately into a trough of water, which
                    “sets” it, and prevents it from collapsing. The value of gutta percha piping is
                    very great: it does not contaminate water as lead piping does; it withstands
                    insects, damp, &amp;c., and is easily manipulated, being shortened, lengthened,
                    or repaired without trouble or expense; and its acoustic properties have led to
                    its employment largely in the manufacture of aural, stethoscopical, and other
                    instruments. Gutta percha speaking-tubes are now to be seen in nearly every
                    office. The substance too, from the fact that few acids and alkalies affect it,
                    especially if dilute, is largely employed for funnels, siphons, and other
                    chemical apparatus.</p>
                <p>In telegraphy gutta percha is of the very highest importance, being a cheap,
                    lasting, and powerful insulator, easily applied to telegraphic wires. The
                    general method of coating telegraphic wire is by charging a cylinder with
                    plastic gutta percha, and forcing it through a die-piece, the wire forming a
                    central core. As the wire is drawn through this “die” or “moulding” piece, it
                    becomes coated to the requisite thickness, and after passing through water it is
                    wound on drums ready to be coated with tarred rope, and with galvanized iron
                    wire if required for submarine cables.</p>
                <p>The readiness with which gutta percha, whilst in its plastic condition, receives
                    an impression, which it retains when cold, early led to its employment in the
                    decorative and fine arts, since it reproduces the finest lines, as in the taking
                    of moulds from electrotypes. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Electrometallurgy.</hi></p>
                <p>In the production of imitations of oak and other ornamental woods, gutta percha
                    has been largely used, since by the admixture of various substances “graining”
                    or marbling” can be very naturally represented, and a coating of a solution of
                    gutta percha gives a varnish of great brilliancy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Substitutes.—</hi> Many substances have been recommended as
                    substitutes for, or as supplementary to, gutta percha. Among these Balata gum
                    undoubtedly holds the first place. It is obtained from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mimusops Balata</hi> (Gartner), a tree found in British and French Guiana,
                    Jamaica, &amp;c. Prof. Bleekrod seems to have been the first to direct attention
                    to this substance, by bringing it before the notice of the Society of Arts in
                    1857.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    The Balata gum combines in some degree the elasticity of caoutchouc with the
                    ductility of gutta percha, freely softening and becoming plastic, and being
                    easily moulded like gutta percha. What small parcels have been sent to England
                    have met with a ready sale, and were remarkably pure and free from adulteration.
                    But unfortunately, through the difficulty of collection, the occupation being
                    dangerous and unhealthy, the supply of this excellent article has fallen off. It
                    is procured by making incisions in the bark of the tree about 7 feet from the
                    ground, a ring of clay being placed around to catch the milk as it exudes. A
                    large tree is said to yield as much as 45 lb of “dry gum.”<note anchored="true"

                    yet prove an article of commerce if properly treated; at present, although by
                    heat it becomes plastic and ductile, it is brittle and resin-like when cold. The
                    tree is found very generally distributed in Wynaad, Coorg, Travancore,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Many of the euphorbias yield milky juices which have some at least of the
                    properties of gutta percha. The chief amongst these are the cattimandoo <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">(E. Tirucalli,</hi> Linn.) of India, and some euphorbias at
                    the Cape of Good Hope. The alstonia or pala gum <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Alstonia</hi><hi rend="italic">scholaris,</hi> R. Br.) and themudargum <hi
                    rend="italic">(Calatropis gigantea,</hi> R. Br.), have also been recommended as
                    substitutes for gutta percha. But the attempts made to utilize these substances
                    have as yet been unsuccessful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Future Supplies.—</hi> A very important matter for
                    consideration is the question of the future supplies of gutta percha. It is
                    after all only a spontaneous natural product. If a Malay or Chinese wishes to
                    plant pepper, gambier, &amp;c., he burns down a portion of the forest, and whén
                    he has raised two or three crops he clears a new portion, and thus finely wooded
                    spots become denuded of trees, and covered with rank grass rendering them unfit
                    for further cultivation. Again, to obtain the gutta percha the trees are cut
                    down, and none are planted in their stead, so that in districts where they were
                    in abundance one or two only are now preserved as curiosities. It is a wonder
                    indeed that a single tree is left. A writer in the <hi rend="italic">Sarawak
                    Gazette</hi> says that from 1854 to 1875 over 90,000 piculs (of 133⅜ K» each) of
                    gutta percha was exported from Sarawak alone, and this meant the death of at
                    least 3,000,000 trees. In fact the only thing that preserves the treo at all is
                    that it is of no use to cut one down till it is 25 to 30 years old. Sooner or
                    later recourse must be had to cultivation and conservation. (J. CO. )</p>
