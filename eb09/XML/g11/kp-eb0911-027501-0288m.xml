                <p><label type="entry">GUM</label> exists in the juices of almost all plants, but is
                    produced in its purest form by various species of <hi rend="italic">Acacia,
                    e.g., Acacia Verek</hi> (Guil. and Perrottet), <hi rend="italic">A.
                    horrida,</hi><hi rend="italic">A. arabica</hi> (Wildenow), <hi rend="italic">A.
                    Seyel</hi> (Delile), and <hi rend="italic">A. stenocarpa</hi> (Höchst.). The
                    name is applied to those exudations from plants, stems, branches, or fruits
                    which are entirely soluble or soften in water, and form with it a thick
                    glutinous liquid or mucilage insoluble in alcohol of 60 per cent., and yield
                    mucic and oxalic acids when treated with nitric acid. In structure gum is quite
                    amorphous, being neither organized like starch nor crystallized like sugar.
                    According to Trecul, the acacias and the <hi rend="italic">Rosaceae</hi> yield
                    their gums most abundantly when sickly and in an abnormal state, caused by a
                    fulness of sap in the young tissues, whereby the new cells are softened and
                    finally disorganized; the cavities thus formed fill with liquid, which exudes,
                    dries, and constitutes the gum.</p>
                <p>The chief varieties have hitherto been divided as follows :—(1) gum arabic, (2)
                    gum tragacanth, (3) cherry tree gum, (4) gum of Bassora, (5) mucilage. The
                    artificial gum dextrin has been already treated of, vol. vii. p. 146.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gum Arabic</hi> may be taken as the type of the gums entirely
                    soluble in water. The principal kinds are distinguished as Turkey Picked Gum,
                    Gedda, Amrad, Gheziri, Senegal, Talca, Australian, Barbary, Cape, and East India
                    (from Bombay and Aden). Another variety, spoken of as likely, from its
                    abundance, to be soon in the market, is obtained from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prosopis</hi><hi rend="italic">dulcis,</hi> a leguminous plant, and is called
                    gum mesquite or mezquite; it comes from Western Texas and Mexico, and is
                    yellowish in colour, very brittle, and quite soluble in water (Z‰rn⅛. <hi
                    rend="italic">Jourη.</hi> (3), vol. vi. p. 942).</p>
                <p>Gum arabic occurs in pieces of varying size, and some kinds are full of minute
                    cracks. The specific gravity of Turkey picked gum (the purest variety) is l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 487, or, when dried at 100° C., 1’525. It is soluble
                    in water to an indefinite extent; boiled with dilute sulphuric acid it is
                    converted first into dextrin, and then into a fermentable variety of sugar.
                    Moderately strong nitric acid changes it into mucic, saccharic, tartaric, and
                    oxalic acids. Under the influence of yeast it does not enter into the alcoholic
                    fermentation, but Berthelot, by digesting with chalk and cheese, obtained from
                    it 12 per cent, of its weight of alcohol, along with lactate of calcium, but no
                    appreciable quantity of sugar. According to Frémy, gum arabic may be regarded as
                    a potassium and calcium salt of gummic or arabic acid, of the formula CaK <hi

                    simplest and best mode of preparing gummic acid, and states that the power of
                    gum to penetrate the colloid septum is 400 times less than that of chloride of
                    sodium, and further that by mixing the gum with substances of the crystalloid
                    class the diffusibility is lowered, and may be even reduced to nothing. The
                    mucilage must be acidulated with hydrochloric acid before dialysing, to set free
                    the gummic acid. Gummic acid reddens litmus, its reaction being about equal to
                    carbonic acid. When solutions of gum arabic and gelatin are mixed, oily drops of
                    a compound of the two are precipitated, which on standing form a nearly
                    colourless jelly, melting at 25° C., or by the heat of the hand. This substance
                    can be washed without decomposition. Gummic acid is soluble in water; when well
                    dried at 100° C., it becomes transformed into metagummic acid, which is
                    insoluble, but swells up in water like gum tragacanth.</p>
                <p>Gum arabic, when heated to 150° C. with two parts of acetic anhydride, swells up
                    to a mass which, when washed with boiling water, and then with alcohol, gives a
                    white amorphous insoluble powder called acetyl arabin C <hi rend="subscript">
                    6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> (C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi

                    s</hi>. It is saponified by alkalies, with reproduction of soluble gum. Gum
                    arabic is not precipitated from solution by alum, stannous chloride, sulphate or
                    nitrate of copper, or neutral lead acetate; with basic lead acetate it forms a
                    white jelly, with ferric chloride it yields a stiff clear gelatinoid mass, and
                    its solutions are also precipitated by borax.</p>
                <p>The finer varieties are used as an emollient and demulcent in medicine, and in
                    the manufacture of confectionery; the commoner qualities are used as an adhesive
                    paste, for giving lustre to crape, silk, &amp;c., in cloth finishing to stiffen
                    the fibres, and in calico-printing. For labels, &lt;fcc., it is usual to mix
                    sugar or glycerin with it to prevent it from cracking.</p>
                <p>Physiologically nothing is yet definitely known of gum as a food material.
                    Animals fed thereon soon die of inanition. Lehmann says it is not absorbed by
                    the system, but according to Pavy, it is to a slight extent, as shown by the
                    formation of amyloid substance in the liver of subjects fed on gum.</p>
                <p>Gum Senegal, a variety of gum arabic produced by <hi rend="italic">A. Verek,</hi>
                    occurs in pieces generally rounded, of the size of a pigeon’s egg, and of a
                    reddish or yellow colour, and specific gravity 1 ’ 436. It gives with water a
                    somewhat stronger mucilage than gum arabic, from which it is distinguished by
                    its clear interior, fewer cracks, and greater toughness. It is imported from the
                    river Gambia, and from Senegal and Bathurst, and is collected in December and
                    March yearly.</p>
                <p>Chagual gum, a new variety brought from St Iago de Chili, resembles gum Senegal.
                    About 75 per cent, is soluble in water. Its solution is not thickened by borax,
                    and is precipitated by neutral lead acetate; and dilute sulphuric acid converts
                    it into dextro-glucose.</p>
                <p>The imports of gum arabic into England during 1878 (including all the varieties)

                    port of shipment being Smyrna. Formerly only what exuded spontaneously was
                    gathered; this was often of a brownish colour; but now the flow of the gum is
                    aided by incisions cut near the root, and the product is the fine, white, flaky
                    variety so much valued in commerce. The chief flow of gum takes place during the
                    night, and hot and dry weather is the most favourable for its production.</p>
                <p>In colour gum tragacanth is of a dull white; it occurs in homy, flexible, and
                    tough, thin, twisted flakes, translucent, and with peculiar wavy lines on the
                    surface. When dried at temperatures under 100° C. it loses about 14 per cent, of
                    water, and is then easily powdered. Its specific gravity is l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 384. With water it swells by absorption, and with
                    even fifty times its weight of that liquid forms a thick mucilage. Part of it
                    only is soluble in water, and that resembles gummic acid in being precipitated
                    by alcohol and ammonium oxalate, but differs from it in giving a precipitate
                    with neutral lead acetate and none with borax. The insoluble part of the gum is
                    a calcium salt of bassorin (C <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 20</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi>), which is devoid of
                    taste and smell, forms a gelatinoid mass with water, but by con· tinued boiling
                    is rendered soluble, owing, according to Μ. Giraud, to its being changed into
                    pectin. A small quantity of starch is always naturally present in gum
                    tragacanth. The composition of gum tragacanth is generally given as arabin 53
                    per cent., bassorin and starch 33, water 11 (but Μ. Giraud considers its
                    composition to be water 20 per cent. ), mineral matter 3, a pectinous principle
                    (apparently identical with the pectose of Frémy) 60, soluble gum 10, cellulose
                    3, starch 3, mineral matter 3, with traces of nitrogenous matter. Graham <hi
                    rend="italic">{Chemical and Physical Researches,</hi> p. 589) speaks of its
                    being likely that native gums insoluble in water are the pectous form of soluble
                    gum, and Giraud’s experiments point to the correctness of that surmise.</p>
