                        Fulke</hi></label> (1794-1865), a great grandson by hie father of the fifth
                    earl of Warwick, and son of Lady Charlotte Bentinck, daughter of the duke of
                    Portland, formerly a leader of the Whig party, and first minister of the crown.
                    Greville was born 2d April 1794. Much of his childhood was spent at his
                    grandfather’s house at Bulstrode. He was one of the pages of George III., and
                    was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford; but he left the university
                    early, having been appointed private secretary to Earl Bathurst before he was
                    twenty. The interest of the duke of Portland had secured for him the
                    secretaryship of the island of Jamaica, which was a sinecure office, the duties
                    being performed* by a deputy, and the reversion of the clerkship of the council.
                    Greville entered upon the discharge of the duties of clerk of the council in
                    ordinary in 1821, and continued to perform them for nearly forty years. He
                    therefore served under three successive sovereigns,—George IV., William IV., and
                    Victoria,—and although no political or confidential functions are attached to
                    that office, it is one which brings a man into habitual intercourse with the
                    chiefs of all the parties in the state. Well-born, well-bred, handsome, and
                    accomplished, Greville led the easy life of a man of fashion, taking an
                    occasional part in the transactions of his day and much consulted in the affairs
                    of private life. But the celebrity which now attaches to his name is entirely
                    due to the posthumous publication of a portion of a Journal or Diary which it
                    was his practice to keep during the greater part of his life. These papers were
                    given by him to his friend Mr Reeve a short time before his death (which took
                    place on the 18th January 1865), with an injunction that they should be
                    published, as far as was feasible, at not too remote a period after the writer’s
                    death. The journals of the reigns of George IV. and William IV. (extending from
                    1820 to 1837) were accordingly so published in obedience to his directions about
                    ten years after that event. Few publications have been received with greater
                    interest by the public; five large editions were sold in little more than a
                    year, and the demand in America was as great as in England. These journals were
                    regarded as a faithful record of the impressions made on the mind of a competent
                    observer, at the time, by the events he witnessed and the persons with whom he
                    associated. Their characteristic is the love of truth, of justice, and of
                    sincerity. The court was irritated at the scornful disclosure of the vices and
                    follies of former sovereigns, and fashionable society was annoyed at the
                    writer’s absolute indifference to its pretensions. But Greville did not stoop to
                    collect or record private scandal. His object appears to have been to leave
                    behind him some of the materials of history, by which the men and actions of his
                    own time would be judged. He records not so much public events as the private
                    causes which led to them; and perhaps no English memoir-writer has left behind
                    him a more valuable contribution to the history of this century. Greville
                    published anonymously, in 1845, a volume on the policy of England to Ireland, in
                    which he advocated the payment of the Roman Catholic clergy; and he was also the
                    author of several pamphlets on the events of his day.</p>
