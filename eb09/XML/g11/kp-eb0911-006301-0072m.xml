                    written Gratz, Gretz, or Grez, but in 1843 it was decided, through the influence
                    mainly of Hammer-Purg- «tall, that the official form should be Graz, in
                    accordance at once with the local pronunciation and the derivation of the word,
                    which was originally, it is believed, the Slavonic for “little castle,” Gradats

                    Austrian crownland of Styria, is situated in the broad and fertile valley of the
                    Mur, and the beauty of its position has given rise to the punning French

                    crow flies, and about 139 miles by rail. Its latitude is 47° 49' N., its
                    longitude 15° 27' E., and its height above the sea 1499 feet. The main town lies
                    on the left bank of the river, at the foot of the Schlossberg or castle-hill,
                    but two of the principal suburbs, Lend and Gries, occupy an extensive area on
                    the right bank, and communication is maintained by four bridges besides the
                    railway bridge. Among the numerous churches of the city the most important is
                    the Gothic cathedral of St Aegidius, founded by the emperor Frederick III. in
                    1450-1462, on the site of a previous church mentioned as early as 1157. It has
                    been several times modified and redecorated, more particularly <pb break="no"

                    1G63. The interior, which measures 200 feet in length by 92 feet in breadth, 13
                    richly adorned with stained glass windows of modern date, costly shrines,
                    paintings, and tombs. In the immediate neighbourhood of the cathedral is the
                    mausoleum church of St Catherine’s, erected by Ferdinand II. as a burial-place
                    for himself and his family. It has an imposing façade with Corinthian columns,
                    two cupolas, and a tower. Worthy of mention also are the church of the Sacred
                    Blood, which has been the municipal church since 1585, and which possesses an
                    altar-piece by Tintoretto; the Augustinian church, commonly called
                    Stiegenkirche, appropriated to the service of the university since 1827; and the
                    church of St Anthony of Padua, connected with the lunatic asylum, and popularly
                    known as the Narren-thurmkirche. Besides the old imperial castle, formerly the
                    residence of the Styrian princes, and now the seat of the statthalterei, Gratz
                    contains the palace of the prince-bishop of Seckau, the palace of Count Attem,
                    with a fine picture-gallery, and the old palace of the archduke John, now in
                    possession of the counts of Meran. The ιandhaus, where the estates hold their
                    sittings, was erected in the 16 th century; among its curiosities are the
                    Styrian hat and the great silver cup called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Landschadenhund.</hi> The rathhaus, built by Stadler between 1802 and 1807, is
                    of interest mainly for its collection of instruments of torture. At the head of
                    the educational institutions is the university, founded in 1586 by Charles
                    Francis, and restored in 1817 after an interruption of forty-five years. The old
                    buildings dating from between 1573 and 1609 are being replaced by a fine modem
                    erection. Of greater celebrity than the university is the Joanneum, originally
                    instituted in 1811 by the archduke John Baptist as a national museum, but now
                    developed into a complex organization for the higher education, with a regular
                    professorate, a library of 50,000 volumes, archives peculiarly rich in Oriental
                    MSS., a botanical garden, and other auxiliary departments. Mohs, Schrotten, and
                    Unger are among the eminent names associated with its chairs. The Styrian
                    hospital, founded in 1788, the town hospital, the civic hospital, the military
                    hospital, the children’s hospital, and the lunatic asylum are among the
                    principal benevolent institutions. An official money-lending establishment has
                    been in existence since 1755. Of the minor institutions of various kinds which
                    prove the prosperity of the town the list would be a long one. An active trade,
                    fostered by abundant railway communication both with north and south, is
                    combined with no small manufacturing industry in the departments of iron and
                    steel wares, paper, chemicals, sugar, vinegar, liqueurs, watches, and
                    mathematical instruments. Few towns are better supplied with public pleasure
                    grounds and holiday resorts. The Schlossberg, which rises 380 feet above the
                    valley, was laid out by General Weiden shortly after the destruction of the
                    castle; and a great park of 42 acres has been made almost to encompass the inner
                    city. The Calvarienberg lies in the north-west of the town; and not far off is
                    the castle of Eggenberg. The population of Gratz, in spite of a high rate of
                    mortality which prevailed for some time, amounted in 1869 to 81,119, exclusive
                    of the garrison of 4000 men. In 1875 the total, civil and military, was
                    estimated at 90,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Gratz may possibly have been a Roman site, but
                    the first mention of it under its present name is in a document of 881 A.D.
                    Ottocar V. of Traungau chose it as his residence in 1056, and in 1163 it is
                    designated for the first time the <hi rend="italic">Lαηderf'urstliche
                    Staid.</hi> Its privileges were confirmed by King Rudolf in 1281. Surrounded
                    with walls and fosses in 1435, it was able in 1481 to defend itself against the
                    Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus, who attempted to get possession of his
                    promised bride at refuge within. In 1529 and 1532 the Turks attacked it with as
                    little success. As early as 1530 the Lutheran doctrine was preached in Gratz by
                    Seifried and Jacob von Eggenberg, and in 1540 Eggenberg founded the Paradies or
                    Lutheran school in which Kepler afterwards taught. But Charles II. burned 20,000
                    Protestant books in the square of the present lunatic asylum, and succeeded by
                    his oppressive measures in bringing the city again under the authority of Rome.
                    New fortifications were constructed in the end of the 16th century by Franz von
                    Poppendorf, and in 1644 the town afforded an asylum to the family of Ferdinand
                    III. The French were in possession of the place in 1797 and again in 1805; and
                    in 1809 Marshal Macdonald, having in terms of the peace of Vienna entered the
                    citadel which he had vainly besieged, blew it all up with the exception of the
                    bell-tower and the citizens’ or clock tower.</p>
