                <p><label type="entry">GRINDSTONE</label>. Sandstones which possess the property of
                    abrading steel and other hard substances are extensively used in arts and
                    manufactures under the name of grindstones. In its simplest form a grindstone
                    consists of a stone disc, more or less circular, mounted on a horizontal iron
                    spindle carried on the tops of two wooden posts fixed in the ground. A winch
                    handle, or occasionally a rude crank with treadle, provides the means of giving
                    a slow rotation to the stone, against the cylindrical face of which the steel or
                    other substance which is to be ground is held. Such grindstones—possessing
                    neither truth of figure nor the means of obtaining it—are unsuitable for any but
                    the roughest purposes; and although by mounting them in a frame to which a rest
                    can be attached it is possible to keep them true and tolerably efficient, they
                    are always slow in their action.</p>
                <p>Cutlers employ grindstones which are roughly mounted but which act well, being
                    driven at a much higher speed by a strap from a large wheel or pulley, and they
                    carefully preserve the truth of the cylindrical face. And in many manufacturing
                    processes the surface speed of the face is still further increased by employing
                    very large stones, and giving them the greatest number of revolutions per minute
                    that is compatible with safety,—this limit even being sometimes exceeded, when
                    the centrifugal force overcomes the rather slight cohesive strength of the
                    stones, and breaks them up into fragments which fly to great distances with
                    disastrous results. Sandstone suitable for grindstones of various degrees of
                    hardness and fineness is found in the coal districts of the north of England,
                    and also in those of the midland counties. A favourite stone for tool-grinding
                    at a low speed is quarried at Bilston in Staffordshire. The neighbourhood of
                    Sheffield also affords some useful qualities of grindstone.</p>
                <p>Artificial grindstones closely resembling the natural stones, but of perfectly
                    uniform texture, which the natural ones frequently are not, were made a few
                    years ago by Mr Ransome's ingenious process. Their manufacture has been
                    discontinued, but artificial grindstones of another kind, made with emery
                    instead of sand, are now effecting a complete revolution in the art of the
                    machinist. By means of these emery grinders, to which great variety of size and
                    form can be given so as to suit the particular purposes for which they are
                    intended, the operation of trueing up metal surfaces by hand, whether they are
                    large or small, curved or flat, can in very many kinds of work be entirely
                    dispensed with,—the results being superior in truth of figure, uniform in all
                    cases, and obtained in a mere fraction of the time which the most skilful
                    workman would require. The extensive use of these grinders in America (where the
                    importance of labour-saving machines is properly appreciated) renders it certain
                    that the system will gradually make its way also in England, and that
                    hand-filing will thus to a large extent be superseded,—files being costly
                    instruments in themselves, and many times more costly in their use, owing to the
                    skill which they demand on the part of the workman who handles them.</p>
                <p>Artificial wheels made with emery are by no means a new invention. In India and
                    China they have been used for centuries; but, being made with lac and similar
                    fusible materials, such wheels are not capable of being run at the high rate of
                    speed which is a first essential to their efficiency. Others, however, which
                    were not liable to these objections were made and patented in England more than
                    thirty years ago; and it is surprising that these have not been more generally
                    used. The chief advantage of those now made,—some of which are manufactured in
                    the United States, some on the continent of Europe, and some in England,—is that
                    they can be obtained of large size—up to about 3 feet in diameter—and that they
                    are strong enough to be driven at a very high speed without breaking. At a
                    surface speed of 5000 or 6000 feet per minute these wheels cut tempered steel
                    readily, when used either wet or dry, and by their means it can be shaped, if
                    necessary, in its hardest condition, with a facility previously unattainable. As
                    in the case of common grindstones, truth of form is most important to their
                    efficient working, and it is therefore desirable that the work under treatment
                    should be held perfectly rigid, by means of some form of sliding rest, or
                    otherwise. When so used the wear of the emery wheel, which is exceedingly slow,
                    keeps it constantly true without attention. If from any cause this truth of
                    figure be lost, or if it be desired to alter the form of the face, recourse must
                    be had to turning it up with a diamond, nothing else in nature being
                    sufficiently hard for the purpose.</p>
