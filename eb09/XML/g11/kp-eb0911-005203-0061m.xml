                <p><label type="entry">GRANVILLE, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Carteret,
                    Earl</hi></label> (1690-1763), English statesman, son of George, Lord Carteret,
                    was born 22d April 1690, and in his fifth year succeeded to his father’s title.
                    He was'educated at Westminster school and at Christ Church, Oxford, and even
                    early in life had acquired a knowledge of the classics, of philosophy, of
                    general literature, and of modern languages, which rendered him perhaps superior
                    to all his contemporaries in the extent of his intellectual accomplishments.
                    Soon after taking his seat in the House of Lords in 1711, he began to
                    distinguish himself by his eloquent advocacy of the Protestant succession, and
                    his zeal was rewarded when George I. came to the throne, by the appointment in
                    1715 of bailiff of the island of Jersey, and in 1716 of lord-lieutenant of
                    Devon; and his mother was also created countess of Granville. In 1719 he was
                    senton an embassy to Sweden; and in 1720 he was named ambassador-extraordinary
                    to the congress of Cambray. In May of the following year he was appointed
                    secretary of state under Walpole’s administration; but Walpole’s jealousy of his
                    influence with the king led to his resignation on the 3d April 1724, and on the
                    same day he was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland, an office which he held
                    till 1730, when differences with the ministry led to his resignation. After his
                    return he became the leader of the opposition, the duties of which office he
                    discharged with great versatility of resource and with frequent effectiveness,
                    but with a negligent rashness which rendered him almost as dangerous to his
                    friends as to his opponents. In 1742 he was at last successful in overthrowing
                    Sir Robert Walpole’s Government, and was immediately thereafter appointed
                    secretary of state. He now obtained a complete ascendency over the mind of
                    George II., whose German policy he carried out irrespective of the opinions of
                    his colleagues; but his imperiousness soon gained him both their enmity and the
                    hatred of the people, and enabled his opponents, for whom he cherished
                    unmitigated contempt, to effect his political annihilation. Pitt, afterwards
                    earl of Chatham, spoke of him as “an execrable, a sole minister, who had
                    renounced the British nation, and seemed to have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n62/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0062-0053"/> drunk of the potion described in poetic fiction,
                    which made men forget their country.” In 1744 he found it necessary, from the
                    resignation of his colleagues and his inability to find proper successors, to
                    tender his resignation; and, according to Horace Walpole, he “retired from St
                    James’s laughing.” Shortly before this he had, by the death of his mother,
                    become Earl Granville. His administration was popularly distinguished by the
                    epithet “drunken ”—a title which had reference to his character both as a
                    politician and as a private individual. Notwithstanding his want of political
                    success, contemporary opinion is unanimous in affirming that he was not only the
                    most brilliant debater but the ablest statesman of his time. Chatham declared
                    that he owed all that he was to his friendship and instruction, and Swift,
                    Smollett, Chesterfield, and Horace Walpole have borne equally laudatory
                    testimony to his abilities. He was besides regarded as an authority in questions
                    of scholarship by the most eminent classicists of his time, and Bentley was
                    greatly indebted to his assistance in preparing his edition of Homer. His fatal
                    defects appear to have been his careless arrogance and his deficiency in
                    definite political principle and purpose. After the resignation of the Pelham
                    ministry he was again appointed secretary of state, but almost immediately
                    resigned, holding office, according to a political squib, for only forty-eight
                    hours, three quarters, seven minutes, and eleven seconds. In 1749 he was created
                    knight of the garter and appointed president of the council; but, though he
                    retained his influence with the king, the part he thenceforth played in English
                    politics was indirect and subordinate. He died January 2, 1763.</p>
