                <p><label type="entry">GUJRÂT, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Goojrat</hi></label>, a
                    British district in the Punjab, lying between 32° 10' 30" and 33° N. lat., and
                    between 73° 20' and 74° 3Γ E. long.; area (1877), 2029 square miles; population
                    (1868), 616,347 souls. It is bounded on the N.E. by the native state of Kashmir,
                    on the N.W. by the river Jhilam, on the W. by Shahpur district, and on the S.E.
                    by the rivers Tâvi and Chenâb. The district of Gujrât comprises a narrow wedge
                    of sub-Himâlayan plain country, possessing few natural advantages. From the
                    basin of the Chenâb on the south the general level rises rapidly towards the
                    interior, which, owing to the great distance of the water beneath the surface,
                    assumes a dreary and desert aspect. A range of low hills, known as the Pabbi,
                    traverses the northern angle of Gujrât. They are composed of a friable Tertiary
                    sandstone and conglomerate, totally destitute of vegetation, and presenting to
                    the view a mere barren chaos of naked rock, deeply scored with precipitous
                    ravines. Immediately below the Pabbi stretches a high plateau, terminating
                    abruptly in a precipitous bluff some 200 feet in height. At the foot of this
                    plateau is a plain, which forms the actual valley of the Chenâb and participates
                    in the irrigation from the river bed. The district as a whole is well wooded,
                    and great attention has been paid to arboriculture.</p>
                <p>Numerous relics of antiquity stud the surface of Gujrât district. Mounds of
                    ancient construction yield numbers of early coins, and bricks are found whose
                    size and type prove them to belong to the prehistoric period of Hindu
                    architecture. A mound now occupied by the village of Moga or Mong has been
                    identified as the site of Nicaea, the city built by Alexander the Great on the
                    field of his victory over Porus. The Delhi empire established its authority in
                    this district under Bahlol Lodi (1450-1488). A century later it was visited by
                    Akbar, who founded Gujrât as the seat of government. During the decay of the
                    Mughal power, the Ghakkars of Rawal Pindi overran this portion of the Punjab and
                    established themselves in Gujrât about 1741. Meanwhile the Sikh power had been
                    asserting itself in the eastern Punjab, and in 1765 the Ghakkar chief was
                    defeated by Sardar Gùjar Sinh, chief of the Bhangi confederacy. On his death,
                    his son succeeded him, but after a few months’ warfare, in 1798, he submitted
                    himself as vassal to the mahârâjâ Ranjit Sinh. In 1846 Gujrât first came under
                    the supervision of British officials. Two years <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0911-0287-0274"/> later the district became the theatre for the
                    important engagements which decided the event of the second Sikh war. After
                    several bloody battles in which the British were unsuccessful, the Sikh power
                    was irretrievably broken at the engagement which took place at Gujrât on the 22d
                    of February 1849. The Punjab lay at the feet of the conquerors, and passed by
                    annexation under British rule.</p>
                <p>The census of 1868 disclosed a population of 616,347 persons,— 331,919 males, and
                    284,428 females,—of whom δ37,696 were Mahometans, 53,174 Hindus, and 20,653
                    Sikhs. In 1875-76 the district contained four municipal towns with a population
                    exceeding 5000—Gujrât, 17,391; Jalâlpur, 14,022; Kunjah, 5354; andDinga, 5077.
                    Wheat forms the staple product of the district, while barley, gram, rice,
                    pulses, oil-seeds, and cotton also cover considerable areas. Of the 708,863
                    acres under cultivation, 267,893 acres are provided with artificial irrigation.
                    The chief exports are grain, <hi rend="italic">ghi,</hi> wool, and other
                    agricultural produce. The imports come chiefly from Lahore, Amritsar, Jammu, and
                    Pind Dadan Khan. The Northern State Railway passes through the district from
                    south-east to northwest, and affords a new outlet for traffic. Good branch lines
                    of road connect Gujrât with all surrounding centres. The revenue in 1875-76 was
                    £64,425. In the same year there were 11 civil and revenue judges. The police
                    force (1875-76) numbered 514 men, supplemented by a body of 620 village
                    watchmen. The number of state-supported schools amounted to 47 in 1875-76,
                    having a joint roll of 3600 pupils. The cost of education is returned at £1613.
                    The district school at Gujrât ranks as one of the eight “higher class” schools
                    of the Punjab. Gujrât bears the reputation of being a healthy district;
                    small-pox, fever, and ague occasionally prevail. The death rate (1875—76) was 18
                    per thousand of the population. The district contains 6 charitable dispensaries,
                    giving relief in 1875 to 31,788 persons. The annual average rainfall during
                    eight years ending 1873-74 was 28 ’ 5 inches. The fall is regular, and the
                    district on the whole does not suffer much from drought.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gujrât,</hi> the chief town and administrative headquarters
                    of the above district, in 32° 34' 30" N. lat. and 74° 7' 15" E. long., with a
                    population of 17,391, stands upon an ancient site, formerly occupied, according
                    to tradition, by two successive cities, the second of which is supposed to have
                    been destroyed in 1303, the year of an early Mughal invasion of Delhi. Nearly
                    200 years later Sher Shâh turned his attention to the surrounding country, and
                    either he or Akbar founded the existing town. Though standing in the midst of a
                    Jât neighbourhood, the fort wa⅛ first garrisoned by Gùjars, and took the name of
                    Gujrât Akbarâbâd. The town was rendered memorable during the second Sikh war by
                    the battle which takes its name from this site, and which decided the fate of
                    the campaign, bringing the whole Punjab at once under British rule. Akbar’s
                    fort, largely improved by Gùjar Sinh, stands in the centre of the town. The
                    civil station lies to the north of the native city, and contains the
                    court-house, treasury, jail, dispensary, police-lines, staging bungalow, and
                    post-office. The trade of Gujrât is inconsiderable.</p>
