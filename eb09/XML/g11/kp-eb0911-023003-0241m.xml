                    sea-level, and reaches considerable dimensions. Its wood is of a yellow colour
                    merging into green, and has an almost pulverulent fracture; the flowers are
                    yellow and conspicuous; and the fruit is dry and 4-winged (J. Triana and J. E.

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">lignum vitae</hi> of commerce, so named on account of its

                    It is exported in large logs or blocks, generally divested of bark, and presents
                    in transverse section very slightly marked concentric rings of growth, and
                    scarcely any traces of pith; with the aid of a magnifying glass the medullary
                    rays are seen to be equidistant and very numerous. The outer wood, the sapwood
                    or alburnum, is of a pale yellow hue, and devoid of resin; the inner, the
                    heartwood or duramen, which is by far the larger proportion, is of a dark
                    greenish-brown, contains in its pores 26 per cent, of resin, and has a specific
                    gravity of 1'333, and therefore sinks in water, on which the alburnum floats.
                    Owing to the diagonal and oblique arrangement of the successive layers of its
                    fibres, the wood cannot be split; and on account of its hardness, density, and
                    durability it is much valued for the manufacture of ships’ pulleys, rulers,
                    skittle-balls, mallets, and other articles.</p>
                <p>Chips or turnings of the heartwood of <hi rend="italic">G. officinale (guaiaci
                    lignum)</hi> are employed in the preparation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >decoctum</hi><hi rend="italic">sarsae</hi><hi rend="italic">compositum</hi> of
                    British pharmacy. They may be recognized by being either yellow or
                    greenish-brown in colour, and by turning bluish-green when treated with nitric
                    acid, or when heated with corrosive sublimate, and green with solution of
                    chloride of lime. They are occasionally adulterated with boxwood shavings.
                    Lignum vitae is imported chiefly from St Domingo, the Bahamas, and Jamrica. The
                    foliage of guaiacum trees is stated by Dr Asa Gray to be employed in the West
                    Indies instead of soap to scour and whiten floors. The bark was formerly used in
                    medicine; it contains much calcium oxalate, and yields on incineration 23 per
                    cent, of ash. Guaiacum resin, the <hi rend="italic">guaiaci</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">resina</hi> of pharmacopoeias, is obtained from the wood as an
                    exudation from natural fissures or from incisions; by heating billets about 3
                    feet in length, bored to permit of the outflow of the resin; or by boiling chip3
                    and raspings in water to which salt has been added to raise the temperature of
                    ebullition. It occurs in rounded or oval tears, commonly coated with a
                    greyish-green dust, and supposed to be the produce of <hi rend="italic">G.
                    sanctum,</hi> or in large brownish or greenish-brown masses, translucent at the
                    edges; fuses at 85° C.; is brittle, and has a vitreous fracture, a specific
                    gravity of U2289 (W. Brande, <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1806, p. 89),
                    and a slightly balsamic odour, increased by pulverization and by heat; and is at
                    first tasteless when chewed, but produces subsequently a sense of heat in the
                    throat. It is readily soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, creasote, oil of
                    cloves, and solutions of caustic alkalies; and its solution gives a blue colour
                    with gluten, raw potato parings, and the roots of horse-radish, carrot, and
                    various other plants. The alcoholic tincture becomes green with sodium
                    hypochlorite, and with nitric acid turns in succession green, blue, and brown.
                    With glycerin it gives a clear solution (B. Squire, <hi rend="italic">Pharm.
                    Joum.,</hi> May 3, 1879, p. 894), and with nitrous ether a bluish-green
                    gelatinous mass. It is blued by various oxidizing agents, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> ozone, and, as Schönbein discovered, by the juice of certain
                    fungi.</p>
                <p>To test for blood or haemoglobin, the tincture, which may be prepared from 1 part
                    of the resin to 6 parts of 80 per cent, alcohol <hi rend="italic">(Med.
                    Times,</hi> 1873, i. p. 660), is employed according to the method first
                    suggested by Dr John Day, of Geelong, Australia. A drop of the tincture is added
                    to a small quantity of the liquid to be examined, and with this a few drops of
                    ozonic ether (solution of hydrogen peroxide in ether) are then shaken. The ether
                    dissolves the resin, which, acted on by the haemoglobin, becomes of a bright
                    blue colour. Misleading reactions may sometimes result from the use of white
                    bibulous paper, or from the presence of bile, when the test is applied in cases
                    of haematuria (Finlayson, <hi rend="italic">Clinical Manual,</hi> p. 391, 1878).

                <p>Guaiacum wood was first introduced into Europe by the Spaniards in 1508, and
                    Nicolaus Poll, writing in 1517 (see Luisinus, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Morbo Gallico,</hi> p. 210, Ven., 1566), states that some three
                    thousand persons in Spain had already been restored to health by it. The virtues
                    of the resin, however, were not known until a later period, and in Thomas
                    PayneΓs translation <hi rend="italic">(Of the Wood called Guaiacum,</hi>
                    &amp;c,, p. 9, ed. of 1540) of Ulrich von Hutten’s treatise <hi rend="italic"

                    bourneth a gomme, which we yet knowe not, for what pourpose it serueth.”
                    Fliickiger and Hanbury <hi rend="italic">{Ρharmacographia,</hi> p. 95) state
                    that the first edition of the <hi rend="italic">London Pharmacopoeia</hi> in
                    which they find the resin mentioned is that of 1677. The decoction of the wood
                    was administered in gout, the stone, palsy, leprosy, dropsy, epilepsy, and other
                    diseases, but principally in the “morbus gallicus,” or syphilis, for which it
                    was reckoned a certain specific, insomuch that at first *' the physitions wolde
                    not allowe it, perceyuynge that theyr profite wolde decay therby” (Paynel, <hi
                    rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 8). Minute instructions are given in old works
                    as to the mode of administering guaiacum. The patient was confined in a closed
                    and heated chamber, w⅛s placed on the lowest possible diet, and, after liberal
                    purgation, was made twice a day to drink a milk-warm decoction of the wood. The
                    use of salt was specially to be avoided. A decoction of 1 lb of guaiacum was
                    held to be sufficient for the four first days of the treatment. The earlier
                    opinions as to the efficacy of guaiacum came to be much modified in the course
                    of time, and Dr Pearson <hi rend="italic">(Observations on the Effects of
                    Various Articles of the Mak Med. in the Cure of Lues Venerea,</hi> chap, i., 2d
                    ed., 1807) says :—“I never saw one single instance in which the powers of this
                    medicine eradicated the venereal virus.” He found its beneficial effects to be
                    most marked in cases of secondary symptoms. Guaiacum resin is an ingredient in

                    those of a syphilitic character; for long-standing gouty and rheumatic
                    affections, as in the nostrum known as “Chelsea pensioner;” in some forms of
                    neuralgia; in sciatica <hi rend="italic">(Lancet,</hi> 1864, i. p. 459);
                    bronchorrhcea; tonsillitis (see <hi rend="italic">inter alia, Lancet,</hi> 1864,
                    ii. p. 735); and in sorethroat, or in incipient sore-throat of whatever kind, in
                    the form of the simple resin (Broadbent, <hi rend="italic">Lancet,</hi> 1867, i.
                    p. 393); and has been found serviceable in amenorrhoea and ovarian complaints of
                    inflammatory origin (Cleland, <hi rend="italic">Brcιithw. Retrosp.,</hi> 1873,
                    i. p. 347); and formerly (Graily Hewitt, <hi rend="italic">Dis. of Women,</hi>
                    p. 387, 3d ed., 1872) was much employed in dysmenorrhoea. Copland <hi
                    rend="italic">(Med. Dick,</hi> ii. 656) regards the decoction or tincture of
                    guaiacum as the best of diaphoretics, especially when the skin is cool as well
                    as .dry. Pearson found that if a patient exposed himself freely to the air,
                    guaiacum acted as a diuretic, instead of as a diaphoretic. Guaiacum causes, when
                    administered, dryness in the mouth, thirst,»and a feeling of warmth in the
                    stomach. According to Pearson, it increases the temperature of the skin and
                    quickens the pulse. It has, seemingly, a considerable influence in lessening
                    excessive secretion from mucous surfaces. In large doses it occasions headache,
                    pyrexia, great heat at the epigastrium, and purging and vomiting. Guaiacum resin
                    is sometimes adulterated with common resin, and has itself been used to
                    sophisticate the resin of scamnιony and of jalap.</p>
