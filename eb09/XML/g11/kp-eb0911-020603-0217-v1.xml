                <p><label type="entry">GRONINGEN</label>, a town of the Netherlands, in the province
                    of the same name, is situated on the Hunse at the influx of the Aa, 45⅛ miles in
                    an eastward direction from Harlingen. The central and more ancient part of the
                    town is still surrounded by the old ditch, and communication is maintained with
                    the outer portions by eighteen bridges. In -the centre of the old town lies a
                    group of open places, of which the greatest, the Breedemarkt, is one of the most
                    spacious in the Netherlands. Five of the principal streets bear the name of as
                    many ancient families—the Boterings, the Ebbings, the Gelkings, the Huddings,
                    and the Folkings. Among the public buildings of Groningen the town-house
                    (Radhuis) is one of the finest. It was built between 1793 and 1810 according to
                    the plans of Jacob Otten Husley, and was extended in 1873. The administrative
                    offices of the province of Groningen also occupy a fine building, which received
                    a splendid front in 1870-1871. The provincial court of justice, transformed in
                    the middle of the 18th century: the corn exchange, dating from 1825; and the
                    weigh-house, completed in 1874; the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ommelanderhuis,</hi> or house formerly devoted to the administration of the
                    surrounding district; the civil and military prison; and the arsenal, are also
                    all worthy of mention. There are twelve churches in Groningen, including two for
                    the Roman Catholics, and five for the Reformed Church of the Netherlands, as
                    well as a Jewish synagogue. St Martin’s, the Aa Church, and the New Church (all
                    Reformed) are the principal. Of these the first is a Gothic building founded in
                    1253, and the last dates from the 17th century. The university of Groningen was
                    founded in 1614, and its buildings were erected in 1847-1850. According to the
                        <hi rend="italic">Annales Academici</hi> (Leyden, 1877), the number of the
                    students in 1874 was only 173, the strongest faculty being that of the physical
                    sciences with 57. It has a library, an observatory, botanical <pb break="no"

                    hospital among its auxiliary establishments. A fine deaf and dumb institution,
                    founded by Henri Daniel Guyot, a gymnasium, a normal college, a school of
                    navigation, a school of design, and a musical school are among the secondary
                    educational establishments. A society <hi rend="italic">pro</hi><hi

                        >patris</hi> has been in existence since 1761; an academy of fine arts was
                    formed in 1830 by the incorporation of two older societies of similar character;
                    and the same year saw the formal establishment of the society for the
                    advancement of natural science, which may be traced back to the association
                    started by Van Swinderen in 1801. Groningen maintains a considerable trade, and
                    engages in a variety of industries. It manufactures salt, beer, vinegar, soap,
                    earthenware, and ropes, weaves cotton and woollen stuffs, spins flax, makes
                    brushes, furniture, mirrors, organs, and pianos, and has numerous goldsmiths and
                    silversmiths. In 1840 the town and the suburbs comprised a population of 31,782.
                    In 1870 the number of people in the commune, including 1248 on shipboard, was
                    37,894, and four years later it had increased to 39,284.</p>
                <p>Mention is made of the Villa Cruoninga in a deed of gift from Henry III. to the
                    church of Utrecht in 1040. In 1110 the town was surrounded with walls, but the
                    bishop of Utrecht caused them to be dismantled in 1112, and it was not till 1255
                    that the defences began to be restored. The compass of the town, which at this
                    time was about 13,000 feet, received considerable extension in 1469, when the
                    walls were strengthened with six massive towers, and a ditch was dug. A further
                    increase of defensive capabilities was effected in the course of the Gueldres
                    war of 1514-36, and again under William <hi rend="smallcaps">Louls</hi> of
                    Nassau between 1608 and 1624. The early history of Groningen consists mainly of
                    struggles with the bishops of Utrecht. In the course of the 13th century there
                    is evidence that the commercial activity of its population was finding outlet in
                    various directions, and in the 14th it attained to no small political influence
                    as the chief city of Friesland. Maximilian I. assigned Groningen to Albert of
                    Saxony, but the citizens preferred to accept the protection of the bishop of
                    Utrecht; and when Albert’s son George attempted in 1505 to seize the town, they
                    recognized the lordship of Edzart of East Frisia. On George’s renewal of
                    hostilities they transferred their allegiance to Duke Charles of Guelderland,
                    and his position was sanctioned in 1515 by the emperor Charles V. In the course
                    of the great wars of the 16th century the city had an eventful history, passing
                    from hand to hand, and suffering all the miseries of siege and military
                    occupation; but at length, in 1594, it was finally secured for the United
                    Netherlands by Prince Maurice of Nassau. The dissensions between the citizens
                    proper and the inhabitants of the “Ommelanden” continued, however, in spite of
                    the decree of the states in 1597, which was intended to set them at rest. In
                    1672 the town was besieged by the bishop of Münster, but it was successfully
                    defended, and in 1698 its fortifications were improved under Coehorn’s
                    direction. The French republicans planted their tree of liberty in the Great
                    Market on February 14, 1795, and they continued in authority till 16th November
                    1814. The fortifications of the city were doomed to destruction by the law of
                    18th April 1874. Among the numerous men of mark who have been natives of
                    Groningen it is enough to mention J. D. Bernoulli the mathematician, Surenhusius
                    and Schultens the Orientalists, and Hemsterhuis the philologist.</p>
