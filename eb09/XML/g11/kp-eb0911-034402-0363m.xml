                    last-mentioned town he was instructed in the art of poetry by Paul Horvath. On
                    the 28th October 1805 he entered the Benedictine order, but left it on the 30th
                    August of the following year. Having almost immediately repented this step, he
                    again assumed the monastic garb on the 10th November 1806. At the monastery of
                    Pannonhegy he applied himself to the study of Greek under Farkas T&lt;5th. In
                    1808 we find him <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Various French biographical
                    works attribute to De Morveau, in 1773, the discovery of the efficacy of acid
                    vapours in destroying contagious miasma. W. Boraston, however, had already in
                    1630 remarked—“All acetosus and sower things doe so close the powers, and
                    passages of the humours, that no venemous ayre can enter therein as by
                    experience I have often found” <hi rend="italic">(A Necessarie</hi><hi

                    Thomson had in 1666 described how, preparing for the “dissection of a pestilent
                    body,” he got in readiness “a porringer containing Sulphur to burn under the
                    Corps,” and how, suspecting the entry into his hand during the operation of
                    “slie, insinuating, venemous Atoms,” or, in modern phrase, septic germs, he
                    sought to nullify their effects by holding the hand in the gas of burning

                <p>at Györ (Raab), in the middle school of which town he was teaching during the two
                    following years. In 1811 he was again at Pannonhegy, whence in 1812 he was sent
                    to Pesth to study theology. Here he became acquainted with the works of the best
                    German and Hungarian authors, and also took part in the editorship of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nemzeti</hi> (National) <hi rend="italic">Plutarkus,</hi> and in
                    the translation of Hübner’s <hi rend="italic">Lexicon.</hi> After about four
                    years’ stay at Pesth, he obtained the degree of doctor of divinity, and returned
                    to Pannonhegy, where he devoted himself to dogmatic theology and literature. So
                    great was his activity that it is said that there was hardly an Hungarian
                    periodical to which Guzmics was not a contributor. The most important of his
                    theological works are— <hi rend="italic">A hath, aηyaszentegyhdzηak hitbeli
                    tanitdsa</hi> (The doctrinal teaching of the Holy Catholic Church), and <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic">keresztényeknek</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vallasbeli egyesiilesokrol</hi> (On Religious Unity among Christians), both
                    published at Pesth in 1822; also a Latin treatise entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theologia</hi><hi rend="italic">Christiana</hi><hi rend="italic">fundamentalis
                    et theologia dogmatica</hi> (Györ, 1828-29, 4 vols.). Of the other literary
                    labours of Guzmics the most meritorious is a translation of Theocritus in
                    hexameters published in 1824. His versions of the <hi rend="italic">Oe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dipus</hi> of Sophocles and of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iphigenia</hi> of Euripides were rewarded by the Hungarian Academy, of which in
                    1838 he was elected honorary member. From 1832 to the date of his death he was
                    editor of the <hi rend="italic">Egyhazi Tar</hi> (Ecclesiastical Treasury). In
                    1832 he was appointed abbot of the wealthy Benedictine house at Bikonybél, a
                    village in the county of Veszprém. While there he built an asylum for 150
                    children, and founded a school of harmony and singing. He died at Bakonybél on
                    the 1st September 1839.</p>
