                    four legs, wings, and a beak,—the fore part resembling an eagle, and the hinder
                    a lion. In addition, some writers describe the tail as a serpent. This animal,
                    which was supposed to watch over gold mines and hidden treasures, and to be the
                    enemy of the horse, was consecrated to the Sun; and the ancient painters
                    represented the chariot of the Sun as drawn by griffins. According to Spanheim,
                    those of Jupiter and Nemesis were similarly provided. The griffin of Scripture
                    is probably that species of the eagle called in Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ossifraga,</hi> or osprey. The griffin is related to inhabit Asiatic Scythia,
                    where the lands abound in gold and precious stones; and when strangers approach
                    to gather these the creatures leap upon them and tear them in pieces, thus
                    showing their use in chastising human avarice and greed. The one-eyed Arimaspi
                    wage constant war with them, according to Herodotus (iii. 16). The celebrated
                    Sir John de Mandeville, in his <hi rend="italic">Travels,</hi> described a
                    griffin as eight times larger than a lion. The griffin is frequently seen on
                    early seals and medals, and is still borne as a favourite device on seals and as
                    a charge in heraldry. Papworth, in his laborious <hi rend="italic">Ordinary of
                    British Armorials,</hi> ascribes this creature to several .hundred family coats,
                    as a single charge, and in connexion with other heraldic devices the griffin was
                    constantly borne in English and especially in Welsh armoury. Berry in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Heraldica</hi> declares that the combination of the
                    eagle and lion signified strength and swiftness conjoined; if this be so, the
                    reason of its almost universal adoption as an emblem by a military and chivalric
                    people is not far to seek. The seals of Baldwin de Redvers, second earl of Devon
                    (1137-1155), and his son William de Vernun, sixth earl, exhibit two most curious
                    examples of the griffin, and being anterior to the consolidation of heraldic
                    rules and a succession of heraldic devices from father to son, are yet proofs
                    that particular devices or emblems were in use with powerful lords of the 12th
                    and 13th centuries, and retained by the members of the family as carefully and
                    as conventionally as the true heraldic bearings of the following century were.
                    Guillim blazons this monster as <hi rend="italic">rampant,</hi> alleging that
                    any very fierce animal may be so blazoned as well as the lion; but Sylvester,
                    Morgan, Burke, Berry, and other writers upon heraldic subjects, use the term <hi
                    rend="italic">segreant, i.e., se greant,</hi> pluming or arranging himself by
                    lifting himself up and flapping his wings, as all birds do occasionally, instead
                    of rampant. Palliot, one of the most interesting of all writers on arms, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Vraye</hi><hi rend="italic">et Parfaite</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Science des Armoires,</hi> describes this creature as generally rampant, and
                    points out its connexion with the Minotaur, Centaurs, and Chimaera, “fronte Leo,
                    postremo Draco, medioque Chimaera.” The same writer, in reference to the
                    possibility of such productions of nature, describes a curious monster of
                    similar character, called a <hi rend="italic">hipρocervus,</hi> presented in
                    1534 by Frederick, duke of Mantua, to Francis the Great, the fore part being
                    that of a horse, the hind part that of a stag, which could be saddled and
                    bridled, but always threw his rider and trampled on him. Much might be written
                    on the subject of hybridsand fabulous monsters such as these, but the various
                    aspects of natural history and archaeology which they illustrate have never been
                    yet worked out. The griffin was also an architectural ornament among the Greeks,
                    and was copied from them, with other architectural embellishments, by the
                    Romans, A fine example of the Assyrian griffin occurs on the sculptured slabs
                    from Kouyunjik, now in the British Museum. The <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of
                    Early Drawings and Illuminations,</hi> by W. de Gray Birch and H. Jenner, gives
                    a collection of references to the finest examples of these creatures among the
                    manuscripts from the Saxon age to the close of the 15th century.</p>
