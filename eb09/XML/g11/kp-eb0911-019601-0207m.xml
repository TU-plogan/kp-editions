                    January 1791. His father, a respectable advocate, destined him for his own
                    profession; but on the conclusion of his legal studies, in 1811, Grillparzer
                    became a tutor in a noble family, and two years afterwards accepted a
                    subordinate post in the civil service. He rose slowly in his profession, but in
                    1833 was made director of the archives in the court chamber (Hofkammer). He
                    retired in 1856, receiving the title of Hofrath, a title which was replaced in
                    1861 by the higher one of Reichsrath. In 1847 he was made a member of the
                    Academy of Sciences. From early youth he displayed a strong literary impulse. He
                    devoted especial attention to the Spanish drama, and nearly all his writings
                    bear mark3 of the influence of Calderon. When he began to write, the German
                    stage was dominated by the wild plays of Werner, Miillner, and other authors of
                    the so-called “fate-tragedies.” His first play, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ahnfrau</hi> (The Ancestress), published in 1816, was penetrated
                    by their spirit. A lady, who has been slain by her husband <hi rend="subscript">
                    l</hi> for infidelity, is doomed to visit “the glimpses of the moon” till her
                    house is extinguished, and this end is reached in the tragedy amid scenes of
                    violence and horror. Some of Grillparzer’s admirers draw a sharp distinction
                    between this play and the works with which it is usually classed, and in doing
                    so they follow his own example. But its general character is exactly similar to
                    that of Werner’s dramas; it only differs from them in containing individual
                    passages of much force and beauty. It at once became extremely popular, and
                    Grillparzer was encouraged to write a second tragedy, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sappho</hi> (1819), the most artistically finished of his productions. An
                    Italian rendering of this play fell into the hands of Lord Byron, who, although
                    the translation was very bad, expressed his conviction that the author’s name
                    would be held in reverence by posterity. It is full of the aspiration of the
                    Romantic school, but its form is classic, and its chastened style presents a
                    striking contrast to the noise and fury of the <hi rend="italic">Ahnfrau.</hi>
                    The problem of the play has some resemblance to that of Goethe’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Torquato Tasso,</hi> for in both we find the struggles of a poetic
                    nature which is unable to reconcile itself to the conditions of the actual
                    world. Grillparzer’s conceptions are not so clearly defined a3 Goethe’s, nor is
                    his diction so varied and harmonious; but the play ha3 the stamp of genius, and
                    ranks as one of the best of those w0rk3 in which an attempt has been made to
                    combine the passion and sentiment of modern life with the simplicity and grace
                    of ancient masterpieces. Another and more ambitious work in the classic style
                    was <hi rend="italic">Das</hi><hi rend="italic">goldene Vlies</hi> (The Golden
                    Fleece), a trilogy published in 1822. Of its three parts the greatest is <hi
                    rend="italic">Medea,</hi> which some critics consider his highest achievement.
                    There is delicate art in the delineation of the mingled fascination and
                    repulsion which Medea and Jason feel for each other, and when at last repulsion
                    becomes the dominant force, the dramatist gives splendid utterance to the rage
                    of the disappointed wife and mother. In <hi rend="italic">Des Meeres und der
                    Liebe Wellen</hi> (Waves of the Sea and of Love), which appeared in 1840,
                    Grillparzer again formed his work on classic models; but in this instance his
                    feeling is so distinctly modern that it does not find adequate expression in his
                    carefully measured verse. The subject is the story of Hero and Leander, and it
                    has never been more happily treated than in some passages, which, however, are
                    marked rather by lyrical than dramatic qualities.</p>
                <p>In 1825 Grillparzer published <hi rend="italic">König Ottokar’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic">Glück und Ende</hi> (King Ottocar’s
                    Fortune and End). It appealed strongly to the patriotic sympathies of Vienna,
                    dealing as it I does with one of the proudest periods of Austrian
                    history,—theHime of Rudolf I., the founder of the house of Hapsburg. In a harsh
                    criticism of Grillparzer, which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                    Review</hi> in 1829, and is now included in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Miscellanies,</hi> Mr Carlyle said that Schiller’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Piccolomini</hi> differed from <hi rend="italic">Ottokar</hi> as “a living rose
                    [differs] from a mass of dead rose leaves, or even of broken Italian
                    gumflowers.” This judgment has not been confirmed by later criticism. It cannot,
                    indeed, be said that the materials of the play are welded into a compact whole,
                    but the characters are vigorously conceived, and there is a fine dramatic
                    contrast between the brilliant, restless, and unscrupulous Ottocar and the calm,
                    upright, and ultimately triumphant Rudolf. Another historical play, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ein treuer</hi><hi rend="italic">Diener seines</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Herrn</hi> (A faithful Servant of his Lord), appeared in 1830, and
                    brought down upon the author a storm of abuse from the liberals, who accused him
                    of servility. On the other hand, the play displeased the court, and its
                    representation was stopped. It hardly deserved to be made the subject of so much
                    contention, for it is one of the least powerful of Grillparzer’s later dramas. A
                    more pleasing work was the dramatic study <hi rend="italic">Der Traum, ein
                    Leben</hi> (The Dream, a Life), which is to some extent a direct imitation of
                    Calderon, and has something of his brilliance and charm. In the same year in
                    which this was issued (1840) Grillparzer published <hi rend="italic">Wehe dem
                    der lugt</hi> (Woe to him who Lies), a comedy. It was so badly received that he
                    wrote no more for the stage. Several dramatic fragments, however, composed at a
                    later time, appeared among his posthumous writings.</p>
                <p>Grillparzer was a lyrical as well as a dramatic poet. He used to say that all his
                    lyrics were written for the purpose of obtaining relief from feelings by which
                    he happened to be oppressed. The same thing was said of himself by Goethe; but
                    Goethe’s emotion in passing into verse was purified and generalized;
                    Grillparzer’s remained for the most part strictly personal, and rarely touches
                    the deepest sympathies. He is more successful in epigram, in which <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n208/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0208-0197"/> he often gives sharp expression to a keen, biting
                    humour. He wrote also several prose tales, one ot which, <hi rend="italic">Der
                    Spielmann</hi> (The Musician), is marked by delicate and graceful fancy. His
                    autobiography, which was written in 1853 and brings down the narrative of his
                    life to 1836, is a model of clear, simple, and elegant prose; and it throws much
                    interesting light both on his personal character and on the tendencies of his
                    time. Among his posthumous writings are many fragments of literary, philosophic,
                    and political criticism, all of them indicating a strong and independent spirit,
                    not invariably just, but distinct, penetrating, and suggestive. It is
                    characteristic of him that he expresses extreme dislike of Hegel’s philosophy on
                    the ground that its terms are unintelligible. On the other hand, he giveβ
                    evidence of careful and sympathetic study of Kant. Of modern literary critics
                    Gervinus was most repugnant to him, mainly because of the tendency of this
                    writer to attribute moral aims to authors who created solely for art’s sake. He
                    rather maliciously says that Gervinus had one advantage and one disadvantage in
                    writing his history of German Literature,—the advantage of common sense, the
                    disadvantage of knowing nothing of his subject.</p>
                <p>Of a quiet contemplative nature, Grillparzer shunned general society. He never
                    married. To a stranger he seemed cold and distant, but in conversation with any
                    one he liked his real disposition revealed itself; his manner became animated,
                    his eyes brightened, and a sarcastic but not ill-natured smile would play upon
                    his lips. It was one of his sayings that the art of writing poetry can neither
                    be taught nor learned, but he also held that inspiration will not visit a poet
                    who neglects to make himself master of his subject. Hence before writing a play
                    he worked hard, striving to comprehend the spirit of the age he wished to
                    represent. He was exceedingly fond of travel, and at different times visited all
                    the leading European countries. After 1840, when his solitary comedy was
                    rejected by the public, he almost passed from the memory of his contemporaries.
                    Fortunately for him, Heinrich Laube, an admirer of his genius, settled in Vienna
                    in 1849 as artistic director of the court theatre. By and by Laube reintroduced
                    on the stage some of the forgotten works, and their success was immediate and
                    profound. To hi3 own surprise, Grillparzer became the most popular author of the
                    day; he was ranked with Goethe and Schiller, and lauded as the national poet of
                    Austria. On the eightieth anniversary of his birthday all classes from the court
                    downwards united to do him honour; never, probably, did Vienna exert herself so
                    much to prove her respect for a private citizen. He died on the 21st January
                    1872, and was buried with an amount of ceremony that surpassed even the pomp
                    displayed at Klopstock’s funeral. A monument of him has recently been erected at
                    Baden, near Vienna.</p>
                <p>After his death an admirable edition of his works, in ten volumes, was issued by
                    Heinrich Laube and J. Weilen. There are several English renderings of <hi
