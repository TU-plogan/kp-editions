                    of as the Moor-fowl or Moor-game. The effect which this species is supposed to
                    have on the British legislature, and therefore on history, is well known, for it
                    is the common belief that parliament in these days always rises when the season
                    for Grouseshooting begins; but even of old time it seems to have excited on one
                    occasion a curious kind of influence, for we may read in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orkneyinga Saga</hi> (ed. Jonaeus, p. 356; ed. Anderson, p. 168) that events of

                    Caithness in the year 1157. The Red Grouse is found on moors from Monmouthshire
                    and Derbyshire northward to the Orkneys, as well as in most of the Hebrides. It
                    likewise inhabits similar situations throughout Wales and Ireland, but it does
                    not naturally occur beyond the limits of the British Islands,<note

                    continued.</p></note> and is the only species among birds peculiar to them. The
                    word “species” may in this case be used advisedly (since the Red Grouse
                    invariably “breeds true,” it admits of an easy <hi rend="italic">diagnosis,</hi>
                    and it has a definite geographical range); but scarcely any zoologist who looks
                    further into the matter can doubt of its common origin with the Willow-Grouse,
                    <hi rend="italic">Lagopus</hi><hi rend="italic">albus</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    continent of Europe and Asia, as well as North America from the Aleutian Islands
                    to Newfoundland. The Red Grouse indeed is rarely or never found away from the
                    heather on which chiefly it subsists, and with which in most men’s minds it is
                    associated; while the Willow-Grouse in many parts of the Old World seems to
                    prefer the shrubby growth of berry-bearing plants <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Vaccinium</hi> and others) that, often thickly interspersed with
                    willows and birches, clothes the higher levels or the lower mountain-slopes, and
                    it contrives to flourish in the New World where heather scarcely exists, and a
                    “heath” in its strict sense is unknown. It is true likewise that the
                    Willow-Grouse always becomes white in winter, which the Red Grouse never does;
                    but then we find that in summer there is a considerable resemblance between the
                    two species, the cock Willow-Grouse having his head, neck, and breast of nearly
                    the same rich chestnut-brown as his British representative, and, though his back
                    be lighter in colour, as is also the whole plumage of his mate, than is found in
                    the Red Grouse, in other respects than those named above tl.e two species are
                    precisely alike. No distinction can he discovered in their voice, their eggs,
                    their build, nor in their anatomical details, so far as these have been
                    investigated and compared.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>A very interesting subject for discussion would be whether <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lagopvs scoticus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">L. albus</hi> has varied most from
                    the common stock of both. We can here but briefly indicate the mere salient
                    points that might arise. Looking to the fact that the former is the only species
                    of the genus which does not assume white clothing in winter, an evolutionist
                    might at first deem the variation greatest in its case; but then it must be
                    borne in mind that the species of <hi rend="italic">Lagopus</hi> which turn
                    white differ in that respect from all other groups of the family <hi
                    rend="italic">Tetraonidae.</hi> Furthermore it must be remembered that every
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Lagopus</hi> (even <hi rend="italic">L.
                    leucurιιs,</hi> the whitest of all) has its first set of <hi rend="italic"
                    >remiges</hi> coloured brown. These are dropped when the bird is about
                    half-grown, ar.d in all the species but <hi rend="italic">L. scoticus</hi> white
                    <hi rend="italic">remiges</hi> are then produced. If therefore, as is generally
                    held, the successive phases assumed by any animal in the course of its progress
                    to maturity indicate the phases through which the species has passed, there may
                    have been a time when all the species of <hi rend="italic">Lagopus</hi> wore a
                    brown livery even when adult, and the white dress donned in winter has been
                    imposed upon the wearers by causes that can be easily suggested, for it has been
                    freely admitted by naturalists of all schools that the white plumage of the
                    birds of this group protects them from danger during the snows of a protracted
                    winter. On the other hand it is not at all inconceivable that the Bed Grouse,
                    instead of perpetuating directly the more ancient properties of an original <hi
                    rend="italic">Lagopus</hi> that underwent no great seasonal change of plumage,
                    may derive its ancestry from the widely-ranging Willow-Grouse, which in an epoch
                    comparatively recent (in the geological sense) may have stocked Britain, and
                    left descendants that, under conditions in which the assumption of a white garb
                    would be almost fatal to the preservation of the species, have reverted (though
                    doubtless with some modifications) to a comparative immutability essentially the
                    same as that of the primal <hi rend="italic">Lagopus.</hi></p></note> In
                    connexion too with this matter it should not be overlooked that the Red Grouse,
                    restricted as is its range, varies in colour not inconsiderably according to
                    locality, so that game-dealers of experience are able to pronounce at sight the
                    native district of almost any bird that comes to their hands.</p>
                <p>Other peculiarities of the Red Grouse—the excellence of its flesh, and its
                    economic importance, which is perhaps greater than that of any other wild bird
                    in the world— hardly need notice here, and there is not space to dv ell upon
                    that dire and mysterious malady to which it is frcm time to time subject,
                    primarily induced, in the opinion of many, by the overstocking of its haunts and
                    the propagation of diseased offspring by depauperized parents.<note

                    Whitehall in 1617 spelt the word “Termigant,” and in this form it appears in one
                    of the Scots Acts in 1621. Taylor the “water poet,” who (in 1630) seems to have
                    been the first Englishman to use the word, has “Termagant.” How the unnecessary
                    initial letter has crept into the name is more than the writer knows. The word
                    is admittedly from the Gaelic <hi rend="italic">Tarmachan,</hi> meaning,
                    according to some, “a dweller upon heights,” but thought by Dr T. M <hi

                    mountains. It is said to have formerly inhabited both Wales and England, but
                    there is no evidence of its appearance in Ireland. On the continent of Europe it
                    is found most numerously in Norway, but at an elevation far above the growth of
                    trees, and it occurs on the Pyrenees, and on the Alps. It also inhabits northern
                    Russia, but its eastern limit is unknown. In North America, Greenland, and
                    Iceland it is represented by a very nearly allied form— so much so indeed that
                    it is only at certain seasons that <pb break="no"

                    where attempts to introduce it have been only partially successful. It also
                    occurs in North Wales, and very generally throughout Scotland, though not in
                    Orkney, Shetland, or the Outer</p>
                <p>Hebrides, nor in Ireland. On the continent of Europe it has a very wide range,
                    and it extends into Siberia. In Georgia its place is taken by a distinct
                    species, on which a Polish naturalist <hi rend="italic">{Proc. Zooh
                    Society,</hi> 1875, p. 267) has unhappily conferred the name of <hi

                <p>We must then notice the species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Bonasa,</hi> of

                    the type. This does not inhabit the British Islands; unfortunately so, for it is
                    perhaps the most delicate game-bird that comes to table. It is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gelinotte</hi> of the French, the <hi rend="italic">Haselhuhn</hi>
                    of Germans, and <hi rend="italic">Hjeτpe</hi> of Scandinavians. Like its

                    Europe. It will be seen that the great majority of Grouse belong to the northern
