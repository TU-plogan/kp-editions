                    (1746-1829), Spanish painter, was born in 1746 at Fuendetodos, a small Aragonese
                    village near Saragossa. At an early age he commenced his artistic career under
                    the direction of José Luzan Martinez, who had studied painting at Naples under
                    Mastroleo. It is clear that the accuracy in dra,wing Luzan is said to have
                    acquired by diligent study of the best Italian masters did not much influence
                    his erratic pupil. Goya, a true son of his province, was bold, capricious,
                    headstrong, and obstinate. He took a prominent part on more than one occasion in
                    those rival religious processions at Saragossa which often ended in unseemly
                    frays; and his friends were led in consequence to despatch him in his nineteenth
                    year to Madrid, where, prior to his departure for Rome, his mode of life appears
                    to have been anything but that of a quiet orderly citizen. Being a good
                    musician, and gifted with a voice, he sallied forth nightly, serenading the
                    caged beauties of the capital, with whom he seems to have been a very general
                    favourite.</p>
                <p>Lacking the necessary royal patronage, and probably scandalizing by his mode of
                    life the sedate court officials, he did not receive—perhaps did not seek—the
                    usual honorarium accorded to those students who visited Rome for the purpose of
                    study. Finding it convenient to retire for a time from Madrid, he decided to
                    visit Rome at his own cost; and being without resources he joined a “quadrilla”
                    of bull-fighters, passing from town to town until he reached the shores of the
                    Mediterranean. We next hear of him reaching Rome, broken in health and
                    financially bankrupt. In 1772 he was awarded the second prize in a competition
                    initiated by the academy of Parma, styling himself “pupil to Bayeu, painter to
                    the king of Spain.” Compelled to quit Rome somewhat suddenly, he appears again
                    in Madrid in 1775, the husband of Bayeu’s daughter, and father of a son. About
                    this time he appears to have visited his parents at Fuendetodos, no doubt noting
                    much which later on he utilized in his genre works. On returning to Madrid he
                    commenced painting cauvasses for the tapestry factory of Santa Barbara, in which
                    the king took much interest. Between 1776 and 1780 he appears to have supplied
                    thirty examples, receiving about £1200 for them. Soon after the revolution of
                    1868, an official was appointed to take an inventory of all works of art
                    belonging to the nation, and in one of the cellars of the Madrid palace were
                    discovered forty-three of these works of Goya on rolls forgotten and neglected
                    (see <hi rend="italic">Los Tapices de Goya; por Cruzado Villaamil,</hi> Madrid,
                    1870).</p>
                <p>His originality and talent were soon recognized by Mengs, the king’s painter, and
                    royal favour naturally followed. His career now becomes intimately connected
                    with the court life of his time. He was commissioned by the king to design a
                    series of frescos for the church of St Anthony of Florida, Madrid, and he also
                    produced works for Saragossa, Valencia, and Toledo. Ecclesiastical art was not
                    his forte, and although he cannot be said to have failed in any of his work, his
                    fame was not enhanced by his religious subjects.</p>
                <p>In portraiture, without doubt, Goya excelled: his portraits are evidently
                    life-like and unexaggerated, and he disdained flattery. He worked rapidly, and
                    during his long stay at Madrid painted, amongst many others, the portraits of
                    four sovereigns of Spain—Charles III. and IV., Ferdinand VII., and “King
                    Joseph.” The duke of Wellington also sat to him; but on his making some remark
                    which raised the artist’s choler, Goya seized a plaster cast and hurled it at
                    the head of the duke. There are extant two pencil sketches of Wellington, one in
                    the British Museum, the other in a private collection. One of his best portraits
                    is that of the lovely Andalusian duchess of Alva. He now became the spoiled
                    child of fortune, and acquired, at any rate externally, much of the polish of
                    court manners. He still worked industriously upon his own lines, and, while
                    there is a stiffness almost ungainly in the pose of some of his portraits, the
                    stern individuality is always preserved.</p>
                <p>Including the designs for tapestry, Goya’s genre works are numerous and varied,
                    both in style and feeling, from his Watteau-like Al Fresco Breakfast, Romeria de
                    San Isidro, to the Curate feeding the Devil’s Lamp, the Meson del Gallo, and the
                    painfully realistic massacre of the Dos de Mayo (1808). Goy⅛ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s versatility is proverbial; in his hands the pencil,
                    brush, and graver are equally powerful. Some of his crayon sketches of scenes in
                    the bull ring are full of force and character, slight but full of meaning. He
                    was in his thirty-second year when he commenced his etchings from Velasquez,
                    whose influence may, however, be traced in his work at an earlier date. A
                    careful examination<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n32/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0032-0023"/> of some of the drawings made for these etchings
                    indicates a steadiness of purpose not usually discovered in Goya’s craft as
                    draughtsman. He is much more widely known by his etchings than his oils; the
                    latter necessarily must be sought in public and private collections principally
                    in Spain, while the former are known and prized in every capital of Europe. The
                    etched collections by which Goya is best known include Los Caprichos, which have
                    a satirical meaning known only to the few; they are bold, weird, and full of
                    force. Los Proverbios are also supposed to have some hidden intention. Los
                    Desastres de la Guerra may fairly claim to depict Spain during the French
                    invasion. In the bull fight series, Goya is evidently at home; he was a skilled
                    master of the barbarous art, and no doubt every sketch is true to nature, and
                    from life.</p>
                <p>Goya retired from Madrid, desiring probably during his latter years to escape the
                    trying climate of that capital. He died at Bordeaux in his eighty-third year,
                    and a monument has been erected there over his remains. Whether his influence
                    produced the art of Fortuny and the modern Spanish school may be matter for
                    discussion; but, from the deaths of Velasquez and Murillo to the advent of
                    Fortuny, Goya’s name is the only important one found in the history of Spanish
                    art. Paul Lefort and Yriarte may be consulted for fuller details of his life and
                    works.</p>
