                    St Maurice and Mary Magdalen at Halle on the Saale; and he acquitted himself of
                    this duty with such cleverness that the prelate in after years caused the
                    picture to be rescued from the Reformers and brought back to Aschaffenburg. From
                    one of the churches of that city it was taken to the Pinakothek of Munich in
                    1836. It represents St Maurice and Mary Magdalen between four saints, and
                    displays a style so markedly characteristic, and so like that of Lucas Cranach,
                    that Waagen was induced to call Grünewald Cranach’s master. He also traced the
                    same hand and technical execution in the great altarpieces of Annaberg and
                    Heilbronn, and in various panels exhibited in the museums of Mainz, Darmstadt,
                    Aschaffenburg, Vienna, and Berlin. A later race of critics, declining to accept
                    the statements of Waagen and Passavant, affirm that there is no documentary
                    evidence to connect Grünewald with the pictures of Halle and Annaberg, and they
                    quote Sandrart and Bernhard Jobin of Strasburg to show that Grünewald is the
                    painter of pictures of a different class. They prove that he finished before
                    1516 the large altarpiece of Issenheim, at present in the museum of Colmar, and
                    starting from these premises they connect the artist with Altdorfer and Dürer to
                    the exclusion of Cranach. That a native of the Palatinate should have been asked
                    to execute pictures for a church in Saxony can scarcely be accounted strange,
                    since we observe that Hans Baldung was entrusted with a commission of this kind.
                    But that a painter of Aschaffenburg should display the style of Cranach is
                    strange and indeed incredible, unless vouched for by first class evidence. In
                    this case documents are altogether wanting, whilst on the other hand it is
                    beyond the possibility of doubt, even according to Waagen, that the altarpiece
                    of Issenheim is the creation of a man whose teaching was altogether different
                    from that of the painter of the pictures of Halle and Annaberg. At this stage
                    the controversy now stands; and it is needless to do more than observe that the
                    altarpiece of Issenheim is a fine and powerful work, completed as local records
                    show before 1516 by a Swabian, whose distinguishing mark is that he followed the
                    traditions of Martin Schongauer, and came under the influence of Altdorfer and
                    Durer. As a work of art the altarpiece is important, being a poliptych of eleven
                    panels, a carved central shrine covered with a double set of wings, and two side
                    pieces containing the Temptation of St Anthony, the hermits Anthony and Paul in
                    converse, the Virgin adored by Angels, the Resurrection, the Annunciation, the
                    Crucifixion, St Sebastian, St Anthony, and the Marys <pb break="no"

                    of these compositions is also the painter of a series of monochromes described
                    by Sandrart in the Dominican convent, and now in part in the Saalhof at
                    Frankfort, and a Resurrection in the museum of Basel, registered in Amerbach’s
                    inventory as the work of Grünewald.</p>
