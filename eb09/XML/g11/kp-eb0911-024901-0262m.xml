                    rend="smallcaps">Guayana</hi></label>, an extensive territory in the
                    north-eastern part of South America, comprehending in its widest acceptation all
                    the extent of country lying between the rivers Amazon and Orinoco from 3° 30' S.
                    to 8° 40' N. lat, and from 50° 22' to 68° 10' W. long. It is bounded on the N.
                    by the Orinoco and the Atlantic, E. by the Atlantic, S. by the rivers Negro and
                    Amazon, and W. by the Orinoco and the Cassiquiare. Its greatest length from east
                    to west is about 1200 miles, its greatest breadth, from the mouth of the Orinoco
                    to the confluence of the Rio Negro with the Amazon, about 800 miles; and the
                    estimated area is 690,000 square miles. This vast territory is divided into
                    Brazilian (formerly Portuguese) Guiana, Venezuelan (formerly Spanish) Guiana,
                    and Colonial Guiana. The first two divisions, comprising about five-sixths of
                    the entire region, are claimed by or included in Brazil and λ <hi

                    the mouth of the Orinoco towards that of the Amazon lie the territories of
                    British, Dutch, and French Guiana, which are in that order noticed below.</p>
                <p>Columbus in 1498 decided that the Orinoco must flow through some vast continent.
                    Vincent Yanez Pinzon, a Spanish navigator, is believed to have first sailed up
                    the Amazon from the coast. Vasco Nunez landed on the coast of Guiana in 1504,
                    but the discovery is also claimed for Diego de Ordas, one of the captains of
                    Cortez in the conquest of Mexico in 1531. Sir Walter Raleigh ascended the
                    Orinoco in 1595 in search of the El Dorado. The first settlement is stated to be
                    that of some Dutch people in 1580 near the river Pomeroon. This possession was
                    contested by the Spaniards, but in 1613 a colony of Zealanders on the banks of
                    the Essequibo was reported in a flourishing condition. English and subsequently
                    French colonization was attempted up the Surinam river. The English returned in
                    1652 to Paramaribo, and in 1662 the whole colony was granted by Charles II. to
                    Lord Willoughby. In 1669, however, Dutch Guiana covered all the territory now
                    divided into British, Dutch, and French. In 1712 the French attacked the
                    settlement and exacted a contribution. In 1732 Berbice received a constitution
                    from the states-general, and in 1763 there was a formidable insurrection of
                    negro slaves who had been introduced from Africa. In 1781 Rodney took
                    possession; and though the colonies were restored to Holland in 1783, they
                    surrendered again to the British in 1796. The Dutch resumed authority in 1802,
                    and in 1803 the proper history of British Guiana began.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">British Guiana,</hi> when finally acquired in 1803, and
                    formally ceded in 1814, consisted of the three colonies, Demerara, Essequibo,
                    and Berbice, so named after the principal rivers which drain them. These were
                    consolidated into one colony in July 1831. It is bounded on the N. and N.E. by
                    the Atlantic, E. by Dutch Guiana, from which it is separated by the river
                    Corantyn, S. by Brazil, and W. by Venezuela. It lies between 0° 40' and 8° 40'
                    N. lat., and 57° and 61° W. long., and has an estimated area of 76,000 square
                    miles, but the boundaries are still disputed by Venezuela and Brazil. An
                    engagement, however, exists between the British and Venezuelan Governments that
                    neither shall occupy territory claimed by both. The colony has now three
                    divisions, called counties:—Berbice, extending from the Corantyn about 95 miles
                    along the sea-coast; Demerara, from the Abari about 65 miles, including
                    Georgetown, the capital; and Essequibo, from the river of that name about 120
                    miles to the Barima near the Orinoco mouth. There is thus a length of coast of
                    280 miles, with an extent inland varying from 300 to 450 miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface.—</hi> From the coast-line seaward the ocean deepens
                    very gradually, and at low tide extensive mud-flats and sandbanks are left bare.
                    Traced inland, this fluvio-marine deposit is found to rise to 10 or 12 feet
                    above high-water mark, and to end at an older deposit of sand and clay beds,
                    which forms an extensive undulating country, rising to not more than 150 feet
                    above the sea, and stretching back to where the solid rock strata underlying it
                    crop out. Upon the rich alluvial soil of the depressed coast-land, and for a few
                    miles up the rivers, the sugar estates are situated. They are not only protected
                    by dams from the sea, but, as in wet weather water rapidly accumulates in the
                    savannahs behind, they are similarly defended on that side also. A narrow sand
                    reef, some little distance farther inland, running parallel with the coast-line,
                    marks a previous sea limit, and still farther back a higher range of coarse
                    white sand probably marks a yet earlier coast. The eastern portion of the colony
                    from the sources of the Corantyn and Essequibo is a rough inclined plane,
                    sloping down to the sea-level from a height of about 800 feet, the most elevated
                    part being mountainous and rising to 2000 feet above the sea. Thi3 plain extends
                    westward and northward, broken by ranges of mountains, its western portion
                    constituting part of the extensive savannah which stretches eastward from
                    Brazil. Two great parallel mountain systems cross the colony from west to east,
                    the greater being that of the Pacaraima and Merumé mountains, and the lesser
                    including the Canucn, Cumucumu, and Coratamung mountains, while the Sierra
                    Acarai, a densely wooded chain rising to 2500 feet, forms the southern boundary
                    of Guiana and the watershed between the Essequibo and the tributaries of the
                    Amazon. The Pacaraima mountains, a wide extent of rough country traversed by
                    broad valleys, extend from about 4° to 5° 30' N. lat., and rise to 3000 feet
                    between the Potaro and Siparuni rivers, and to 7500 feet at Roraima mountain,
                    which rises, a perpendicular inaccessible wall of red sandstone, at the extreme
                    western limits of the colony. The southern portion of Pacaraima shows rugged
                    hills and valleys strewn with rocks, but to the north, where the sandstone
                    assumes table-shaped forms, there are dense forests, and the scenery is of
                    extraordinary grandeur. The Imataca range lies between the Cuyuni and Barima <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n263/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0263-0250"/> rivers in 7° to 8° N. lat. A sandstone formation
                    can be traced from the northern Pacaraima mountains on the west to the Corantyn
                    on the east. Interbedded with it are three great layers of greenstone. The
                    surface of a very large portion of the colony is composed of gneiss, which is
                    seen in large rounded bosses in the river beds. Schist of different kinds is
                    associated with gneiss in many localities. Quartz-porphyry and felstone occupy
                    extensive areas over the surface of the granite and underlying the gneiss. A
                    large proportion of the surface rock in the interior is granite. The white sand
                    at the sandhills on the Demerara and elsewhere is very pure and well-adapted for
                    glass-making. Gold has been found about 40 miles up the Cuyuni river. Attempts
                    to work it have met with small success, and have been complicated with questions
                    of boundary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.—</hi> The colony is traversed by numerous large rivers,
                    the principal being the Essequibo, Corantyn, Mazaruni, Cuyuni, Berbice, and
                    Demerara. The Corantyn forms the boundary between British and Dutch Guiana. It
                    rises in 2° N. lat., 100 miles eastward of the Essequibo, Hows generally
                    northward, and falls into the Atlantic by a broad estuary in 6° N. lat., 57° W.
                    long. It is navigable for small vessels for 150 miles from its mouth, and is
                    remarkable for its magnificent cataracts. The Cuyuni, coming from Venezuela,
                    runs a course of 120 miles through territory claimed as British. The Essequibo
                    rises in the Sierra Acarai, 0° 40' N. lat., and after a course of at least 600
                    miles discharges itself into the ocean by an estuary 15 miles in width, in 7° N.
                    lat., 58° 40' W. long. In this estuary are a group of islauds where sugar is
                    grown, several being from 12 to 15 miles long and 3 miles broad. The principal
                    are Hog Island, Wakenaam, and Leguan; a smaller one is named Tiger Island. The
                    entrance of the Essequibo is difficult owing to deposits of mud and sand. Its
                    course lies through forests of gigantic vegetation. About 43 miles from its
                    mouth it is joined by the Mazaruni, which is itself joined by the Cuyuni at 8
                    miles from its mouth. The cataracts, of which one of the greatest is the King
                    William’s Cataract of Schomburgk, in 3° 14' 35" N. lat., put a stop to the
                    navigation of the Essequibo by large vessels about 50 miles up. In 3° 57' 30" N.
                    lat. and 58 <hi rend="superscript"> θ</hi> 3' W. long, it receives the Rupununi,
                    which has a course of 220 miles. Another large tributary is the Potaro, upon
                    which is the celebrated Kaieteur (Old Man’s) Fall, so named from an Indian
                    legend, and discovered on April 24, 1870, by Mr C. B. Brown of the Geological
                    Survey, who, owing to cataracts, took a fortnight to reach the fall from the
                    coast up the Essequibo and Potaro. This fall, in 5° 8' N. lat. and 59° 19' W.
                    long., is produced by the river flowing over a sandstone and conglomerate
                    table-land 822 feet into a deep valley below. For the first 741 feet the water
                    falls perpendicularly, as one great continuous whitish column, circled by
                    rainbows, into a basin below, continuing thence over a sloping cataract 88 feet
                    in height, and through the interstices of great blocks of rock, to the riverbed
                    below. The head of the fall is 1130 feet above the sea. The river 200 yards
                    above the fall is 400 feet wide, and the width of the fall itself varies,
                    according to the season, from 240 to 370 feet. The Demerara or Demerary rises
                    probably near 5° N. lat., and after a northward course nearly parallel with the
                    Essequibo for more than 200 miles, enters the Atlantic near 6° 50' N. lat. and
                    58° 20' W. long. It is navigable for 85 miles, and at its mouth at Georgetown is
                    1J miles across. A bar, or depoβit of mud and sand, prevents the entrance of
                    large vessels at low tide. Farther east is the Berbice, whose source is probably
                    about 3° 40' N. lat. It is 2j miles wide at its mouth in 6° 21' N. lat., 57° 12'
                    W. long., and is navigable for 175 miles by vessels drawing 7 feet of water. The
                    Canje creek falls into the Berbice near its mouth. Several large streams called
                    creeks fall directly into the Atlantic between the Berbice and the Demerara. The
                    Boerasiri creek divides the counties of Demerara and Essequibo, and between the
                    Essequibo and the Barima are the rivers or creeks Pomeroon, Morucca, and
                    Waini.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate, especially in the interior, is
                    healthy. The even temperature is considered suitable for pulmonary complaints;
                    and tubercular consumption is unknown. There are no hurricanes, and gales are
                    not frequent. Occasionally there is a long drought, but the following order of
                    seasons is generally maintained. From the middle of April to June there is a
                    long season of heavy rains, which decrease in July; the long dry season lasts
                    from August to November; December and January comprise the short rainy season,
                    and February and March the short dry season. The winds during the rains are
                    generally westerly. In the dry seasons they blow from the ocean and modify the
                    heat. The thermometer seldom rises above 90° or falls below 75° Fahr. At
                    Georgetown the mean annual temperature is 81° 2'. The rainfall in 1878 was 69
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 94 inches, the average having been 74 inches for
                    1873-77.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The census of 1871 was as follows :— 113,570
                    born iu British Guiana (including 70,000 to 80,000 negroes, 10,000 born of
                    Indian and Chinese parents, and the “coloured” population), 42,681 immigrants
                    fromlndia, 6295 Chinese, 7925 from Madeira and Azores, 13,385 negroes from
                    West-Indian Islands, and 9635 Europeans and others; total 193,491, exclusive of
                    aborigines, estimated at 7000. The estimated total population on 31st December
                    1876 was 225,365, and further explorations have increased the estimated number
                    of aboriginal Indians. The aborigines are remnants of Indian tribes, such as the
                    Arawaks, Warraus, Caribs, and many others, scattered in the interior of the
                    country. They maintain themselves by fishing and hunting. Traces of “Indian
                    picture-writing,” or sculptured figures, have been found in some granite blocks
                    up the Essequibo. On December 31, 1877, 22,500 East Indian immigrants were
                    working under a five years’ indenture on the estates, and 26,000 not under
                    indenture. »Since 1857, 10,315 East Indian coolies (including women and
                    children), with savings amounting to £260,479, have availed themselves of their
                    right to return passage. A number re-emigrate to the colony. The Indian
                    Government supervises the emigration. In the colony an immigration department
                    regulates labour, wages, and general treatment. About 5000 are now annually
                    introduced. Chinese have also been introduced with and without indenture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetation.—</hi> The vegetation is most luxuriant. The
                    interior affords an exhaustless supply of valuable timber, such as the mora and
                    greenheart, largely used for shipbuilding. The climate insures a continuous
                    succession of tropical flowers and fruits. Many of the trees yield gums,
                    febrifuges, oils, and juices of more or less value, among which may be mentioned
                    caoutchouc, and a gum called “balata,” with properties intermediate between
                    those of caoutchouc ‘and gutta percha. The bark of the crab tree is used for
                    tanning. The silk-cotton tree, which grows 100 feet high and 12 feet round,
                    yields a light-grey silky cotton used for stuffing pillows. Among the palm-trees
                    are the picturesque mountain cabbage palm, growing to the height of 100 feet;
                    the cocoa-nut palm; the sago palm; the eta palm, much esteemed for its beauty
                    and fruit; and the cockarite palm, which produces the most delicate cabbage of
                    all the palm species. The mangrove tree, 15 to 20 feet high, skirts the
                    sea-coast. The tobacco plant grows wild, and indigenous cottons are numerous. A
                    little rice is grown. The fruit of the plantain and banana is largely used for
                    food, and the stems furnish fibre for paper-making. Orange, lime, guava, cashew,
                    and pine-apple are among the fruits. Indigo used to be cultivated. Arnotto, from
                    which the well-known dye is obtained, is indigenous; and logwood and vanilla are
                    also found. Maize, cassava, yams, papaw tree fruit, sweet potatoes, peppers, and

                    suitable for eating), many lizards, and snakes (some venomous). Tortoises and
                    turtles are common on the banks of the streams and in sandy districts of the
                    coast. The bird, insect, and fish life of Guiana is of indescribable richness

                <p><hi rend="italic">Produce, Industries, and Commerce.—</hi> There are 120 sugar
                    and 12 small coffee estates in the colony. Cotton was formerly exported, but the
                    cultivation has now ceased. Coffee, the export of which in 1830 was 9⅛ million
                    lb, is not now produced for the foreign market. The deep rich soil has induced
                    large investments in the formation of sugar estates; but the industry has
                    undergone great fluctuations. Exports in 1839, when negro apprenticeship
                    terminated, fell from an average of 66,000 to 38,443 hhds. The equalization of
                    the English duties on free and slave-grown sugar still further restricted
                    cultivation, exports in 1849 being only 32,000 hhds. In 1854 mattershad begun to
                    mend. The prospect of obtaining coolie labourers from India and China caused new
                    capital to be introduced and fresh energy employed. Cultivation was improved and
                    extended, vacuum pans came to be more used, steam ploughs and tile draining were
                    successfully introduced. The value of machinery imported from 1867 to 1876 was
                    £850,000. A quantity of 2 to 3 hhds. (of about 17 cwts. ) per acre is often
                    obtained, but the average is 30 cwts. The juice expressed by the powerful
                    rollers is about 60 per cent, of the weight of canes. The “Demarara crystals”
                    are very popular for their purity and saccharine strength, and command high
                    prices. The sugar exports in 1876 were 119,891 hhds., fully equal to 100,000
                    tons; in 1877, 111,156 hhds.; and in 1878 (a year with prolonged drought),
                    86,075 hhds. Nearly all this last quantity went to the United Kingdom, but
                    20,000 and 32,000 hhds. went to the United States in 1876 and 1877 respectively.
                    The rum exported in 1876 was 36,000 puncheons; in 1877 it was 32,531, and in
                    1878 28,752. The quantity of rum issued for consumption in the colony in 1878
                    was 330,392 gallons. The export of molasses (of which less is made as the
                    quality of the sugar improves) is principally to the United States and British
                    provinces, the quantity being 14,320, 19,862, and 17,084 casks in 1876, 1877,
                    1878. The same years the timber exports (nearly all to the United Kingdom) were
                    464,436, 357,430, and 303,693 cubic feet. The woodcutting industry, under
                    Government licence, is a considerable one, as is shθλvn by the export of about 5
                    million shingles annually. Up the rivers and creeks charcoal-burning is carried
                    on; 32,266, 35,631, and 46,746 barrels of charcoal were exported in 1876, 1877,
                    1878. There are 1,250,000 cocoa-nuts exported yearly. In 1853 the total value of
                    imports was £847,183; in 1877, £2,229,908 (£1,079,898 from the United Kingdom);
                    in 1878, £2,150,714. The exports were in 1853, £1,014,944; in 1877, £3,049,157
                    (£1,954,766 to the United Kingdom); and in 1878, £2,507,571. The tonnage,
                    inwards and outwards, was 234,089 tons in 1853, and 519,986 tons in 1877.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government. —</hi> The government is vested in a governor
                    appointed by the British crown and a court of policy, originally instituted by
                    the Dutch in 1773 for Demerara, and including Essequibo in 1789. Berbice had
                    until 1831 a separate constitution. The unofficial members of the court were
                    elected by a college of kiezers or electors, who were themselves elected by duly
                    qualified inhabitants. In 1795 this college commissioned some of their own
                    members to act with the court of policy in financial matters. This resulted in
                    an independent body, called financial representatives, being elected by the
                    inhabitants who were qualified to vote for kiezers. The financial
                    representatives and the court of policy meet in annual session as the “combined
                    court,” to discuss finance and pass the annual tax ordinance. The civil list is
                    not permanent, being renewed every seven years. All other ordinances or lc jd
                    laws are passed by the court of policy,—every ordinance being subject to
                    confirmation by the queen. The colony is divided into five electoral districts,
                    with a total of 863 registered electors. These districts elect for life one or
                    two kiezers, seven in all, and one or two financial representatives, six in all.
                    When a vacancy occurs in the court of policy the seven kiezers nominate two
                    persons, one of whom is selected by the court. There are five unofficial members
                    chosen as above, and five official members, viz., the governor,
                    attorney-general, Government secretary, auditor-general, and immigration
                    agent-general. The public revenue in 1853 was £250,017, and the expenditure
                    £236,557. In 1877 the revenue was £389,872, and in 1878 £405,092. Half of this
                    revenue is derived from import duties, and the remainder principally from wine
                    and spirit duties, rum duty, and retail spirit licences. The expenditure in 1877
                    was £380,566, and in 1878 £417,995. The public debt in 1877 was £323,563. Public
                    and mercantile accounts are kept in dollars (4s. 2d. sterling) and cents.</p>
                <p>The Roman .Dutch law is in force in civil cases, modified by orders in council
                    and local ordinances; the criminal law is based on that of Great Britain, and
                    administered in the same way, except that there is no grand jury. The supreme
                    court consists of the chief justice and two puisne judges. Appeal in cases
                    involving £500 and upwards lies to the privy council. There are an inferior
                    court of civil justice, courts of admiralty and vice-admiralty, of petty debt
                    (conducted by stipendiary magistrates), of bail and review (of magistrates’
                    decisions). One judge sits in the supreme criminal court; and there is an
                    inferior criminal court. Questions of law are decided by three judges in the
                    court of crown cases reserved. Besides apolice magistrate for Georgetown, there

                    established in 1842. The official list shows—1 bishop, 1 archdeacon, 10 rectors,
                    14 curates, 2 incumbents, and several missionary clergymen and chaplains to
                    institutions. The Church of England has 69 churches or chapels. The Coolie
                    Mission Association and Diocesan Society maintain missionaries and catechists.
                    The Church of England claims 90,000 members. The Chjιrch of Scotland has 10
                    ministers. The Roman Catholics also have several churches and mission stations.
                    The Church of England receives an annual grant of £10,000 from the public
                    revenue, the bishop’s salary (£2000) being paid from imperial funds; the Church
                    of Scotland has £5000, and the Roman Catholic Church £2500 from public revenue.
                    There are also 14 Wesleyan Methodist ministers, a Moravian mission, and several

                    lies to the E. of British Guiana, from which it is separated by the Corantijn or
                    Corantyn in 57° 5' W. long. Its coast extends for upwards of 220 miles to the
                    mouth of the Maroni or Marowijne, which forms the boundary towards French
                    Guiana. The Dutch claim possession of 58,530 square miles; but of this extensive
                    area, equal to more than four times that of Holland, not more than 3230,
                    according to Wolbers, had been explored in 1868, the colonial territory did not
                    comprise more than 640 square miles, and the actual area under cultivation was
                    little over 200. In 1875 this last was 29,852 acres (47 square miles), and in
                    1876, 22,180. The principal settlements have been made in the lower valley of
                    the Surinam, or between that river and the Saramacca on the W. and the
                    Commewijne on the E. At its mouth the Surinam is 3 miles broad, and at
                    Paramaribo, the capital, about half a mile. Ships of from 18 to 19 feet of
                    draught can reach the anchorage in front of the town, which has room for 100
                    vessels. The water is of a dirty yellow colour with brown bubbles on its
                    surface, and its current can be traced far out at sea. As yet no one has seen
                    the source of the Surinam, but it is understood to be high up in the Tumac Humac
                    hills. The principal tributaries are the navigable Para on the left hand and the
                    Paulus Creek on the right, both of which join it about 6 or 7 miles above
                    Paramaribo.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An

                    though about 4 miles broad, is full of sand-banks, and consequently it has been
                    less visited than might have beên expected from the excellent character of the

                    about 45 miles inland, the difference of level between the dry and the rainy
                    season is 23 feet. Between the rivers of Dutch Guiana there are remarkable cross
                    channels available during the floods at least. The Maroni is even connected with
                    the Corantyn on the one hand (though there is 200 miles of country between) and
                    with the Oyapock on the other. As it communicates with the Cottica, which is in
                    turn a tributary of the Commewijne, a boat can pass from the Maroni to
                    Paramaribo; thence by the Sommelsdijk canal it can reach the Saraιnacca; and
                    from the Saramacca it can proceed up the Coppename, and by means of the Nickerie
                    find its way to the Corantyn.</p>

                    Though hot and moist like a Turkish bath, it seems congenial even to the
                    European constitution. The mean temperature of the year is 80 <hi

                    September, and December. There are no endemic diseases; and though cholera,
                    fevers, and small-pox have appeared from time to time, they are not more violent
                    than in more temperate regions. Leprosy and elephantiasis, introduced it is
                    believed from Barbados, are not infrequent among the negro population. The
                    former is locally known as boassi. In 1790 there were only 7 patients in the
                    lazaretto of Voorzoorg, but by 1797 they had increased to 300, and in 1812 to
                    500. A new establishment was founded at Batavia on the right bank of the
                    Coppename in 1823. Between 1831 and 1839 an average of 103 suspected persone
                    were examined yearly, and 46 declared infected. In 1853 there were 448
                    inhabitants (216 males and 232 females) in the settlement; of these however 112
                    were personally free from the disease, though born and brought up among the

                    and 6484 females). In 1855 the total number of slaves was 31,780, of whom 27,914
                    (13,556 males and 14,358 females) were on the plantations and 3866 (2027 males
                    and 1839 females) in private service. Since the abolition in 1863 many attempts
                    have been made to augment the working population of the colony. Up till 1874 the
                    total number of immigrants was 9049, of whom at least 2028 died. In 1870 a
                    convention was signed between Holland and England for the regulation of the
                    coolie traffic, and a Dutch Government agent for Surinam was appointed at
                    Calcutta. In 1873 2448. immigrants arrived from British India, and 1405 in 1874;
                    but owing to dissatisfaction on the part of England with the Dutch arrangements
                    there were none in 1875 and 1876. In December 1875 the whole population was
                    stated at 51,329 (26,074 males and 25,255 females), exclusive of about 17,000
                    bush negroes and an uncertain number of Indians. There were 706 Europeans
                    besides the soldiers and seamen in garrison and harbour, and the immigrants
                    amounted to 4007 (2834 males and 1173 females), and comprised 2959 from British
                    India, 598 from the West Indies, 352 <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> Chinese from
                    China, and 67 from the Dutch Indies, and 37 settlers from the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>The bush negroes (bosch-negers) are the descendants of runaway slaves. They
                    consist of three tribes—the Aukanians, the Saramaccans, and the Bekou or
                    Moesinga. The first, who number from 3000 to 4000, have their chief settlements
                    in the district near the junction of the Lava and the Tapanahoni with the Upper
                    Marowijne, but they are also settled on the Sara Creek, on the Upper Cottika,
                    and on the Curmotibo. The Saramaccans, who are numerically about as important,
                    dwell between the Saramacca and the Upper Surinam. The bush negroes retain
                    curious traces of their former connexion with Christianity, though they are and
                    consider themselves pagans. Their chief god is Grau Gado (grand-god), his wife
                    is Maria, and his son Jesi Kist. Various minor deities are also worshipped,
                    Ampuka the bush-god, Toni the water-god, &amp;c. Among themselves they speak a
                    language based on a bastard English, mingled with many Dutch, Portuguese, and
                    native elements. The Moravian missionaries have promoted its cultivation, but it
                    is almost certain to give way before the Dutch.<note anchored="true"

                    industry was formerly sugar. Between 1849 and 1863 the average quantity exported
                    was 302,857 cwts.; in 1865, two years after the emancipation of the slaves, it
                    sank as low as 151,842 cwts.; and though it has again increased, the average
                    between 1864 and 1874 is only 212,906 cwts. In 1876 the production was 218,115
                    cwts., and the export 198,274 cwts. The first cocoa from Surinam was sent to
                    Amsterdam in 1733; but it is only since about 1855 or 1860 that it has risen
                    into favour with the colonists. In 1876 the production was no less than 262,907
                    cwts., and the export 26,062 cwts. Cotton and coffee are next in order, the
                    former having a yield in 1876 of 3806 cwts. and the latter of 245 cwts. The
                    total exports of the colony had a value of 2,762.568 gulden or florins; of which
                    Great Britain took 969,945, the United States 872,277, and the Netherlands
                    505,064. Of the total imports, valued at 3,183,252 gulden, the mother country
                    furnished the value of 1,228,408.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> The gold-diggings of Surinam are beginning to
                    attract attention, the commission of 1874 having found a rich auriferous
                    district about the Marowijne. By May 1876, 519,000 acres of land had been rented
                    to private persons, and a fair amount of success has attended their labours. The
                    lead, silver, and iron ores may yet prove of importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> In 1865 several changes were introduced
                    into the government of Surinam. The Code Napoléon was adopted, subject to
                    modification from time to time by orders in council. A house of assembly was
                    constituted, the members of which were never to be less than nine nor more than
                    thirteen,—four being appointed by the Government and the others by the electors.
                    The franchise was given to all citizens paying 40 gulden of taxes. Elected
                    members serve for six years. The ordinances of the governor in council become
                    law only if passed in the assembly and sanctioned by the king; but a royal
                    decree may overrule the strongest opposition of the assembly, and not
                    unfrequently the national assembly of the Netherlands disallows what has been
                    inserted in the budget by the colonial assemblies. Besides the supreme <pb

                <p><hi rend="italic">History. —</hi> The Dutch began to visit the coasts of Guiana
                    about 1580, and we find Adriaan ter Haaf sending vessels thither in 1599. In
                    1614 the states of Holland granted to any Dutch citizen four years’ monopoly of
                    any harbour or place of commerce which he might discover in that region. The
                    first settlement, however, in Surinam (in 1630) was made by an Englishman, whose
                    name is still preserved by Marshal's Creek. When Cayenne was taken by the French
                    in 1664 a number of Jews who had settled in that part of Guiana removed to the
                    Surinam district, where they soon constituted an important and flourishing
                    community. In 1666 the English settlement was taken by storm by the Zealanders
                    under Crijnssen or Krijnssen (the name is spelt in various ways), and 100,000 lb
                    of sugar were exacted as a ransom. By the peace of Breda the Dutch were formally
                    recognized as masters of Guiana, and though the Willoughbys, who considered
                    their rights infringed, did all they could to weaken the colony and draw off a
                    large part of its English population to Jamaica, it continued to flourish, and
                    was confirmed to the Dutch by the treaty of Westminster in 1674. For some time
                    the Zealanders claimed that they alone had right to the country, but it was
                    ultimately decided that the possession was a national one in the full sense of
                    the word. The New Dutch West Indian Company, founded in 1674 to replace the
                    older company which had failed, received Guiana by charter from the states
                    general in 1682.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the
                    Octroy or Charter in Hartsinck, or in <hi rend="italic">Verzαrnelνng van Stukken

                    1845.</p></note> In the following year the company sold one-third of their
                    territory to the city of Amsterdam, and another third to Cornells van Aerssens,
                    lord of Sommelsdijk. The new owners and the company incorporated themselves as
                    the Chartered Society of Surinam, and Sommelsdijk agreed to fill the post of
                    governor of the c&lt;flony at his own expense. The lucrative trade in slaves was
                    retained by the West Indian Company, but the society could import them on its
                    own account by paying a fine to the company. Sommelsdijk’s rule was marked by
                    rare wisdom and energy. He repressed and pacified the Indian tribes; he erected
                    forts and disciplined the soldiery; he constructed the canaj which still bears
                    his name; he established a high court of justice; he introduced the cultivation
                    of the cocoa-nut; and in short he devoted himself in all ways to the welfare of
                    the colony. But on 17th June 1688 he was massacred in a mutiny of the soldiers.
                    The “third” which Sommelsdijk possessed was offered by his widow to William III.
                    of England, but it was ultimately purchased by the city of Amsterdam for 700,000
                    fl. In 1712 the French, under Cassard, sailed up the river and put Paramaribo to
                    ransom; and after their departure there was hot dispute between the Society and
                    the colonists as to who should pay the indemnity. During the rest of the 18th
                    century the chief troubles of Surinam were the bush negroes and the slaves.
                    Peace with the Aukan negroes was made in 1760, and with the Saramaccans in 1762;
                    but in 1776 the governor Nepveu still found it necessary to surround the colony
                    with a military cordon against the attacks of the Bonni tribe. By the spring of
                    1786 pacification was complete. In 1795 the Society was abrogated, and the
                    affairs of Surinam placed under a committee of twenty-one members. The English,
                    who had assumed the protectorate of the colony from 1799 to 1802, took actual
                    possession in 1804, and appointed Sir Charles Green governor. In 1807 the slave
                    trade was abolished. At the restoration of the Dutch authority in 1815 the
                    colonists of the district of Nickerie sought to remain under English rule, or at
                    least to receive the right of trading with English colonies. In 1825 the
                    privileges of the Jews were annulled, and the rights of ordinary citizens
                    bestowed on them instead. Surinam and the West Indies were placed under a common
                    government in 1828, but the governor was to reside at Paramaribo. In 1832
                    several negro slaves who had set fire to the city were publicly burned alive.
                    The administration of Surinam was separated from that of the West Indies in
                    1845. Baron van Raders, who assumed the governorship in that year, had the
                    honour of greatly improving the state of the slave-laws, and of declaring the
                    commerce of Guiana open to all nations at peace with the Netherlands. The
                    suppression of slavery and the organization of immigration, as already
                    indicated, are the main moments of the recent history of the colony.</p>

                    the Arouari is the real St Vincent Pinzon, and consequently that they have a
                    right to the country for 100 miles further south along the coast. Between the
                    Maroni and the Oyapock the coast-line is about 130 miles. The fourteen quarters
                    of the colony are estimated to have an area of 1,308,739 hectares, <hi

                    much as half the area of Belgium; but if the frontier be pushed back to the
                    watershed, the whole area of the country could not be less than 53,000 square
                    miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface.</hi> —A considerable portion of the low coast-land of
                    French Guiana is occupied by swamps and marshes, the most deeply submerged of
                    which are covered with a dense growth of mangroves, and receive the name <hi
                    rend="italic">oipriρris,</hi> while the drier stretches are occupied by the
                    pinot or wassay palm <hi rend="italic">(Euterpe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >oleracea),</hi> and are designated pinotières. In a few places, as in the
                    Sinnamary quarter, there are peat bogs in process of formation. About 40 or 50
                    miles inland, where the land begins to rise, the traveller reaches the outskirts
                    of those primeval forests which stretch back vast and vague towards the
                    mountains. Between the narrow maritime selvage, so to speak, and the
                    commencement of the highlands are undulating plains or savannahs. Hitherto the
                    colony has confined itself almost exclusively to the littoral and alluvial
                    region, with its fertile mud-banks. The savannahs are still in a state of
                    nature; and though the earlier colonists made clearings in the highlands, they
                    soon grew disappointed with the barrenness of the cold granitic soil. The
                    mountains behind Guiana do not exceed 3000 or 4000 feet of elevation; the
                    principal range indeed, the Tumac Humac, was estimated by M. Creveaux, who
                    crossed it in 1877, at no more than 1312 feet above the sea-level. But the dense
                    tropical forests attract so much moisture from the ocean winds that the
                    highlands are the birthplace of a large number of rivers which in the rainy
                    season especially pour down vast volumes of water. Upwards of twenty are counted
                    between the Maroni and the Oyapock. United as they often are in their navigable
                    sections by cross channels, they constitute a valuable means of communication
                    from district to district. Omitting the Maroni already described under Dutch
                    Guiana, the first of importance as we proceed southwards is the Mana, which is
                    navigable for large vessels 10 miles from its mouth, and for smaller vessels 27
                    miles further. Passing the Sinnamary and the Kourou wo next come to the Cayenne,
                    at the mouth of which lies the island on which the colonial capital is built.
                    About a dozen lakes,of which Mepecucu, Macari, and Mapa are the largest, have
                    been counted in the French territory.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The rainy season begins in November or December,
                    and lasts till the latter part of June; but there are usually three or four
                    weeks of good weather in March.</p>

                <p>During the rest of the year there is often hardly a drop of rain for months. At
                    Cayenne the annual rainfall amounts on an average to from 10 to 11 feet, and it
                    is naturally heavier in the interior. It has been calculated indeed that, if all
                    the fluvial outlets were blocked, a single winter would be sufficient to
                    submerge the whole colony to a depth of 15 or 16 feet. During the hotter part of
                    the year—August, September, October—the temperature usually rises to about 86°
                    F., but it almost never exceeds 88°; in the colder season the mean is 79°, and
                    it seldom sinks so low as 70°. Between day and night there is very little
                    thermometric difference. The longest day is 12 hours 18 minutes, the shortest 11
                    hours 42 minutes. The prevailing winds are the N.N.E. and the S.E.; and the most
                    violent are those of the N.E. During the rainy season the winds keep between N.
                    and E., and during the dry season between S. and E. Hurricanes are unknown.
                    Sudden rises of the sea are occasionally experienced in November and December.
                    Within the present century there have been three earthquakes (1821, 1843, and
                    1877), none of which did much damage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The population of French Guiana consists of a
                    few pure whites, negroes from Africa, mulattoes, coolies, a decreasing number of
                    Indians, convicts from France and its colonies (among whom are many Arabs from
                    Algeria), and Chinese, Hindu, and Anamite immigrants. In 1877 the fixed
                    population was stated at 17,230, and the floating population included 2300
                    aboriginal Indians, a military force of 1084, 338 Government officials and
                    ecclesiastics, 4750 workmen connected with the commerce of immigration, and 1380
                    convicts outside of the penitentiaries; so that in round numbers the total
                    amounted to 27,000. Of the fixed population the males were 7972, and the females
                    9258. The widows were 1108, while the widowers were 298.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetation.—</hi> French Guiana has a rich variety of trees,
                    and several of them are attracting increasing attention from their economic
                    value. The <hi rend="italic">Leguminosen</hi> are abundantly represented,
                    including the gayac <hi rend="italic">(Coumarouna</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    palms are the cocoa-palm, the oil-palm of Africa, and the date-palm. The timber
                    of the courbaril, the bois violet, and the balata has been found to be of very
                    high excellence. Caoutchouc <hi rend="italic">(Hevea guianensis)</hi> is common
                    in the contested territory in the south; the elemi-tree <hi rend="italic">(Idea

                <p>The manioc is the principal source of food in French Guiana; rice is becoming an
                    important object of cultivation; and maize, yams, arrowroot, bananas, and the
                    bread-fruit are also known. The Guiana cocoa is excellent; coffee, introduced in
                    1716, is extensively grown; and vanilla is one of the common wild plants of the
                    country. The clove·tree has been acclimatized, and in the latter years of the
                    empire it formed a good source of wealth; the cinnamon tree was also
                    successfully introduced in 1772, but like that of the pepper-tree and the nutmeg
                    its cultivation is neglected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals. —</hi> Great interest attaches to the gold of Guiana,
                    which promises, or threatens, to modify the life of the colony. Indian
                    traditions affirmed the presence of the precious metal, and Humboldt and Buffon
                    agreed that the geological character of the country indicated the probability of
                    auriferous deposits; but it was not till 1819 that Felix Couy, at the
                    instigation of a Portuguese Indian named Paoline, discovered and opened the
                    first “placer.” In 1856 the Approuague company was formed; but, though 5762 oz.
                    were collected between 1857 and 1860, it soon after sold its rights. The
                    Martaroni company has been more successful: 23,342 oz. of gold were obtained in
                    1872; 46,044 oz., equal to 4 million francβ, were exported from Cayenne in 1874;
                    and in 1875 and 1876 the yield was 4823 oz. per month. As various ferruginous
                    minerals are abundant in some places, it is possible that iron ores may
                    exist.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> The total value of the imports into French
                    Guiana in 1871 was 5,903,413 francs; and it exported to the value of 2,556,158
                    francs to France, 10,600 francs to the French colonies, and 148,839 francs
                    abroad. It is with Martinique that it stands in closest commercial relations,
                    but the imposition in 1872 of a duty on eau de vie from that island has almost
                    put a stop to its importation. Several small steamers maintain communication
                    between different parts of the colony.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Convict Establishments.—</hi> It was in 1851 that Guiana was
                    recommended to the French Government by a special commission of inquiry as a
                    suitable place for criminal penitentiaries. In February</p>
                <p>1852 transportation thither was offered as a favour to the convicts then under
                    sentence, and more than 3000 of them accepted the change, As the minister of the
                    colonies is allowed by a decree of</p>
                <p>1853 to send to Guiana any Asiatics or Africans who are condemned to hard labour
                    or solitary confinement, and as it has been deemed better since 1864 to take the
                    European convicts to New Caledonia, theactual inhabitantsof the penitentiary
                    districts are mainly negroes, Arabs, and Anamites. The principal establishments
                    are those of Cayenne, of the three îles du Salut, of the Kourou, and of the
                    Maroni. The little island La Mère is reserved for the aged, the infirm, and the
                    convalescent. At Saint Laurent on the Maroni there is almost a little town of
                    wooden houses built on brick pillars. The convicts carry on their several trades
                    as carpenters, tanners, bakers, &amp;c. After two years in the colony, those
                    whose conduct has been satisfactory are allowed to contract marriage, to send
                    home for their families, to have a piece of ground assigned to them for
                    cultivation, and to receive the necessary implements. A tramway has been
                    constructed for the use of the “concessions.” (See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rev.</hi><hi rend="italic">Col. et</hi><hi rend="italic">Mar.,</hi> 1876.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> Besides the governor and the military
                    commandant, the administrative personnel comprises an <hi rend="italic"
                    >ordonnateur,</hi> a director of the interior, and a procurator-general, as well
                    as a privy council and a director of the penitentiary service. There is a court
                    of appeal and q <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> tribunal of first instance, and
                    justices of peace are appointed for each canton. Cayenne is administered by a
                    municipal council. Religious affairs are under an apostolic prefect.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History. —</hi> According even to the French writers, the
                    history of Guiana is little better than a series of disasters. La Revardière,
                    sent out in 1604 by Henry IV. to reconnoitre the country, brought back a
                    favourable report; but the death of the king put a stop to the projects of
                    formal colonization. In 1626 a small body of traders from Rouen settled on the
                    Sinnamary, and in 1634 a similar band took up their quarters at Cayenne. The
                    Compagnie du Cap Nord, founded by the people of Rouen in 1643, the Compagnie de
                    la France Équinoxiale, established in 1645, and the second Compagnie de la
                    France Équinoxiale, or Compagnie des Douze Seigneurs, established in 1652, were
                    so many lamentable failures, the result of incompetence, mismanagement, and
                    misfortune. The Compagnie des Indes Occidentales, chartered in 1664 with a
                    monopoly of Guiana commerce for forty years, proved hardly more successful; but
                    in 1674 the colony passed under the direct control of the crown, and the able
                    administration of Colbert began to tell favourably on its progress. The year
                    1763 was marked by a terrible disaster. Choiseul, the prime minister, having
                    obtained for himself and his cousin Praslin a concession of the country between
                    the Kourou and the Maroni, sent out about 12,000 volunteer colonists, mainly
                    from Alsace and Lorraine. They were landed at the mouth of the Kourou, where no
                    preparation had been made for their reception, and where even water was not to
                    be obtained. Mismanagement had reached its grotesquest limits; there was a shop
                    for skates (!), and the necessary tools for tillage were wanting. By 1765 no
                    more than 918 colonists remained alive, and these were a famished fever-stricken
                    band. A long investigation by the parliament of Paris proved only that some one
                    had blundered. Several minor attempts at colonization in Guiana were made in the
                    latter part of the century; but they all seemed to suffer from the same fatal
                    prestige of failure. During the terrible times of the Revolution band after band
                    of political prisoners were transported to Guiana. The fate of the royalists,
                    nearly 600 in number, who were exiled on the 18 th Fructidor, was especially
                    sad. Landed on the Sinnamary without shelter or food, two-thirds of them
                    perished miserably. In 1800 Victor Hugues was appointed governor, and he managed
                    to put the colony in a better state; but in 1809 his career was brought to a
                    close by the invasion of the Portuguese and British. Though French Guiana was
                    nominally restored to the French in 1814, it was not really surrendered by the
                    Portuguese till 1817. In 1823, at the suggestion of Μ. Catineau Laroche, an
                    attempt was made to settle a colony of French agriculturists in the basin of the
                    Mana; but they were soon driven by fevers from the town of Nouvelle Angoulême,
                    which they had founded. Since that date the principal facts in the history of
                    the unfortunate country are the discovery of its gold-fields and the
                    introduction of the convict establishments.</p>
