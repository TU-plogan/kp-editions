                    customary uses of words when in combination. In what follows, therefore, grammar
                    will be generally employed in its primary sense, as denoting the mode in which
                    words are connected together in order to express a complete thought, or, as it
                    is termed in logic, a proposition.</p>
                <p>The object of language is to convey thought, and so long as this object is
                    attained the machinery for attaining it is of comparatively slight importance.
                    The way in which we combine our words and sentences matters but little, provided
                    that our meaning is clear to others. The expressions “horseflesh” and “flesh of
                    a horse,” are equally intelligible to an Englishman and therefore are equally
                    recognized by English grammar. The Chinese manner of denoting a genitive is by
                    placing the defining word before that which it defines, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >kouejin,</hi> “mad of the kingdom,” literally “kingdom man,” and the only
                    reason why it would be incorrect in French or Italian is that such a combination
                    would be unintelligible to a Frenchman or an Italian. Hence it is evident that
                    the grammatical correctness or incorrectness of an expression depends upon its
                    intelligibility, that is to say, upon the ordinary use and custom of a
                    particular language. Whatever is so unfamiliar as not to be generally understood
                    is also ungrammatical. In other words, it is contrary to the habit of a
                    language, as determined by common usage and consent.</p>
                <p>In this way we can explain how it happens that the grammar of a cultivated
                    dialect and that of a local dialect in the same country so frequently disagree.
                    Thus, in the dialect of West Somerset, <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> is the
                    nominative of the second personal pronoun, while in cultivated English the
                    plural accusative <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (Anglo-Saxon, <hi rend="italic"
                    >eow)</hi> has come to represent a nominative singular. Both are grammatically
                    correct within the sphere of their respective dialects, but no further. <hi
                    rend="italic">You</hi> would be as ungrammatical in West Somerset as <hi
                    rend="italic">thee</hi> is in classical English; and both <hi rend="italic"
                    >you</hi> and <hi rend="italic">thee,</hi> as nominatives singular, would have
                    been equally ungrammatical in Early English. Grammatical propriety is nothing
                    more than the established usage of a particular body of speakers at a particular
                    time in their history.</p>
                <p>It follows from this that the grammar of a people changes, like its
                    pronunciation, from age to age. Anglo-Saxon or Early English grammar is not the
                    grammar of Modern English, any more than Latin grammar is the grammar of modern
                    Italian; and to defend an unusual construction or inflexion on the ground that
                    it once existed in literary Anglo-Saxon, is as wrong as to import a peculiarity
                    of some local dialect into the grammar of the cultivated speech. It further
                    follows that different languages will have different grammars, and that the
                    differences will be more or less according to the nearer or remoter relationship
                    of the languages themselves, and the modes of thought of those who speak them.
                    Consequently, to force the grammatical framework of one language upon another is
                    to misconceive the whole nature of the latter, and seriously to mislead the
                    learner. Chinese grammar, for instance, can nevet be understood until we
                    discard, not only the terminology of European grammar, but the very conceptions
                    which underlie it, while the polysynthetic idioms of America defy all attempts
                    to discover in them “the parts of speech” and the various grammatical ideas
                    which occupy so large a place in our school-grammars. The endeavour to find the
                    distinctions of Latin grammar in that of English has only resulted in grotesque
                    errors, and a total misapprehension of the usage of the English language.</p>
                <p>It is to the Latin grammarians,—or, more correctly, to the Greek grammarians,
                    upon whose labours those of the Latin writers were based,—that we owe the
                    classification of the subjects with which grammar is commonly supposed to deal.
                    The grammar of Dionysius Thrax, which he wrote for Roman schoolboys in the time
                    of Pompey, has formed the starting-point for the innumerable school-grammars
                    which have since seen the light, and suggested that division of the matter
                    treated of which they have followed. He defines grammar as a practical
                    acquaintance with the language of literary men, and as divided into six
                    parts,—accentuation and phonology, explanation of figurative expressions,
                    definition, etymology, general rules of flexion, and critical canons. Of these,
                    phonology and accentuation, or prosody, can properly be included in grammar only
                    in so far as the construction of a sentence and the grammatical meaning of a
                    word are determined by accent or letter-change; the accentual difference in
                    English, for example, between <hi rend="italic">incense</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">incense</hi> belongs to the province of grammar, since it
                    indicates a difference between noun and verb; and the changes of vowel in the
                    Semitic languages, by which various nominal and verbal forms are distinguished
                    from one another, constitute a very important part of their grammatical
                    machinery. But where accent and pronunciation do not serve to express the
                    relations of words in a sentence, they fall into the domain of phonology, not of
                    grammar. The explanation of figurative expressions, again, must be left to the
                    rhetorician, and definition to the lexicographer; the grammarian has no more to
                    do with them than he has with the canons of criticism.</p>
                <p>In fact, the old subdivision of grammar, inherited from <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n47/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0047-0038"/> the grammarians of Rome and Alexandria, must be
                    given up, and a new one put in its place. What grammar really deals with are all
                    those contrivances whereby the relations of words and sentences are pointed out.
                    Sometimes it is position, sometimes phonetic symbolization, sometimes
                    composition, sometimes flexion, sometimes the use of auxiliaries, which enables
                    the speaker to combine his words together so that they shall be intelligible to
                    another. Grammar may accordingly be divided into the three departments of
                    composition or “word-building,” syntax, and accidence, by which is meant an
                    exposition of the means adopted by language for expressing the relations of
                    grammar when recourse is not had to composition or simple position.</p>
                <p>A systematized exposition of grammar may be intended for the purely practical
                    purpose of teaching the mechanism of a foreign language. In this case, all that
                    is necessary is a correct and complete statement of the facts. But a correct and
                    complete statement of the facts is by no means so easy a matter as might appear
                    at first sight. The facts will be distorted by a false theory in regard to them,
                    while they will certainly not be presented in a complete form if the grammarian
                    is ignorant of the true theory they presuppose. The Semitic verb, for example,
                    remains unintelligible so long as the explanation of its forms is sought in the
                    conjugation of the Aryan verb, since it has no tenses in the Aryan sense of the
                    word, but denotes relation and not time.</p>
                <p>A good practical grammar of a language, therefore, should be based on a correct
                    appreciation of the facts which it expounds, and a correct appreciation of the
                    facts is only possible where they are examined and co-ordinated in accordance
                    with the scientific method. A practical grammar ought, wherever it is possible,
                    to be preceded by a scientific grammar.</p>
                <p>Comparison is the instrument with which science works, and a scientific grammar,
                    accordingly, is one in which the comparative method has been applied to the
                    relations of speech. If we would understand the origin and real nature of
                    grammatical forms, and of the relations which they represent, we must compare
                    them with similar forms in kindred dialects and languages, as well as with the
                    forms under which they appeared themselves at an earlier period of their
                    history. We shall thus have a comparative grammar and an historical grammar, the
                    latter being devoted to tracing the history of grammatical forms and usages in
                    the same language. Of course, an historical grammar is only possib’e where a
                    succession of written records exists; where a language possesses no older
                    literature, we must be content with a comparative grammar only, and look to
                    cognate idioms to throw light upon its grammatical peculiarities. In this case
                    we have frequently to leave whole forms un-expla <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi>
                    ned, or at most conjecturally interpreted, since the machinery by means of which
                    the relations of grammar are symbolize! is often change! so completely during
                    the growth of a language as to cause its earlier shape and character to be
                    unrecognizable. Moreover, our area of comparison must be as wide as possible;
                    where we have but t vo or three languages to compare, we are in danger of
                    building up conclusions on insufficient evidence. The grammatical errors of the
                    classical philologists of the last cmtury were in great measure due to the fact
                    that their area of comparison was confined to Latin an! Greek.</p>
                <p>The historical grammar of a single language or dialect, which traces the
                    grammatical forms and usagée of the language as far back as documentary evidence
                    allows, affords material to the comparative grammarian, whose task it is to
                    compare the grammatical forms and usages of an allied group of tongues, and
                    thereby reduce them to their earliest forms and senses. The work thus carried
                    out by the comparative grammarian within a particular family of languages is
                    made use of by universal grammar, the object of which is to determine the ideas
                    that underlie all grammar whatsoever, as distinct from those that are peculiar
                    to special families of speech. Universal grammar is sometimes known as “the
                    metaphysics of language,” and it has to decide such questions as the nature of
                    gender, or of the verb, the true purport of the genitive relation, or the origin
                    of grammar itself. Such questions, it is clear, can only be answered by
                    comparing the results gained by the comparative treatment of the grammars of
                    various groups of language. What historical grammar is to comparative grammar,
                    comparative grammar is to universal grammar.</p>
                <p>Universal grammar, as founded on the results of the scientific study of speech,
                    is thus essentially different from that “universal grammar” so much in vogue at
                    the beginning of the present century, which consisted of a series of <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> assumptions based on the peculiarities of European
                    grammar and illustrated from the same source. But universal grammar, as
                    conceived by modern science, is as yet in its infancy; its materials are still
                    in the process of being collected. The comparative grammar of the Aryan
                    languages is alone in an advanced state, those of the Semitic idioms, of the
                    Ugro-Altaic tongues, and of the Bâ-ntu or Kaffre dialects of southern Africa,
                    are still in a backward condition; and the other families of speech existing in
                    the world, with the exception of the Malayo-Polynesian, and the Sonorian of
                    North America, have not as yet been treated scientifically. Chinese, it is true,
                    possesses an historical grammar, and Mr Van Eys, in his comparative grammar of
                    Basque, has endeavoured to solve the problems of that interesting language by a
                    comparison of its various dialects; but in both cases the area of comparison is
                    too small for more than a limited success to be attainable. Instead of
                    attempting the questions of universal grammar therefore, it will be better to
                    confine our attention to three points,— the fundamental differences in the
                    grammatical conceptions of different groups of languages, the main results of a
                    scientific investigation of Aryan grammar, and the light thrown by comparative
                    philology upon the grammar of our own tongue.</p>
                <p>The proposition or sentence is the unit and starting-point of speech, and
                    grammar, as we have seen, consists in the relations of its several parts one to
                    another, together with the expression of them. These relations may be regarded
                    from various points of view. In the polysynthetic languages of America the
                    sentence is conceived as a whole, not composed of independent words, but, like
                    the thought which it expresses, one and indivisible. What we should denote by a
                    series of words is consequently denoted by a single long compound,— <hi
                    rend="italic">kuligatchis</hi> in Delaware, for instance, signifying “give me
                    your pretty little paw,” and <hi rend="italic">aglekkigiartor-asuαrniρok,</hi>
                    in Eskimo, “he goes away hastily and exerts himself to write.” Individual words
                    can be, and often are, extracted from the sentence; but in this case they stand,
                    as it were, outside it, being represented by a pronoun within the sentence
                    itself. Thus, in Mexican, we can say not only <hi rend="italic"
                    >ni-sotsi-temoa,</hi> “I look for flowers,” but also <hi rend="italic"
                    >ni-k-teιnoa sotsitl,</hi> where the interpolated guttural is the objective
                    pronoun. As a necessary result of this conception of the sentence the American
                    languages possess no true verb, each act being expressed as a whole by a single
                    word. In Cherokee, for example, while there is no verb signifying “to wash” in
                    the abstract, no less than thirteen words are used to signify every conceivable
                    mode and object of washing. In the incorporating languages, again, of which
                    Basque may be taken as a type, the object cannot be conceived except as
                    contained in the verbal action. Hence every verbal form embodies an objective
                    pronoun, eventhough the object may be separately expressed. If we pass to an
                    isolating language like Chinese, we find the exact converse of that which meets
                    us in the polysynthetic tongues. Here each proposition<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n48/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0048-0039"/> or thought is analysed into its several elements,
                    and these are set over against one another as so many independent words. The
                    relations of grammar are consequently denoted by position, the particular
                    position of two or more words determining the relation they bear to each other.
                    The analysis of the sentence has not been carried so far in agglutinative
                    languages like Turkish. In these the relations of grammar are represented by
                    individual words, which, however, are subordinated to the words expressing the
                    main ideas intended to be in relation to one another. The defining words, or
                    indices of grammatical relations, are, in a large number of instances, placed
                    after the words which they define; in some cases, however, as, for example, in
                    the Bâ-ntu languages of southern Africa, the relation is conceived from the
                    opposite point of view, the defining words being prefixed. The inflexional
                    languages call in the aid of a new principle. The relations of grammar are
                    denoted symbolically either by a change of vowel or by a change of termination,
                    more rarely by a change at the beginning of a word. Each idea, together with the
                    relation which it bears to the other ideas of a proposition, is thus represented
                    by a single word; that is to say, the ideas which make up the elements of a
                    sentence are not conceived severally and independently, as in Chinese, but as
                    always having a certain connexion with one another. Inflexional languages,
                    however, tend to become analytical by the logical separation of the flexion from
                    the idea to which it is attached, though the primitive point of view is never
                    altogether discarded, and traces of flexion remain even in English and Persian.
                    In fact, there is no example of a language which has wholly forsaken the
                    conception of the sentence and the relation of its elements with which it
                    started, although each class of languages occasionally trespasses on the
                    grammatical usages of the others. In language, as elsewhere in nature, there are
                    no sharp lines of division, no sudden leaps; species passes insensibly into
                    species, class into class. At the same time the several types of
                    speech—polysynthetic, isolating, agglutinative, and inflexional—remain clear and
                    fixed; and even where two languages belong to the same general type, as, for
                    instance, an Aryan and a Semitic language in the inflexional group, or a Kaffre
                    and a Turkish language in the agglutinative group, we find no certain example of
                    grammatical interchange. A mixed grammar, in which the grammatical procedure of
                    two distiuct families of speech is intermingled, is almost, if not altogether,
                    unknown.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, therefore, that grammar constitutes the surest and most important
                    basis for a classification of languages. Words may be borrowed freely by one
                    dialect from another, or, though originally unrelated, may, by the action of
                    phonetic decay, come to assume the same forms, while the limited number of
                    articulate sounds and conceptions out of which language wa3 first developed, and
                    the similarity of the circumstances by which the first speakers were everywhere
                    surrounded, naturally produce a resemblance between the roots of many
                    unconnected tongues. Where, however, the fundamental conceptions of grammar, and
                    the machinery by which they are expressed are the same, we may have no
                    hesitation in inferring a common origin.</p>
                <p>The main results of scientific inquiry into the origin and primitive meaning of
                    the forms of Aryan or Indo-European grammar may be summed up as follows. We
                    start with stems or themes, by which are meant words of two or more syllables
                    which terminate in a limited number of sounds. These stems can be classed in
                    groups of two kinds, one in which the groups consist of stems of similar
                    meanings and similar initial syllables, and another in which the final syllables
                    alone coincide. In the first case we have what are termed roots, the simplest
                    elements iuto which words can be decomposed; in the second case stems proper,
                    which may be described as consisting of suffixes attached tc roots. Roots,
                    therefore, are merely the materials out of which speech can be made, the
                    embodiments of isolated conceptions with which the lexicographer alone has to
                    deal, whereas stems present us with words already combined in a sentence and
                    embodying the relations of grammar. If we would rightly understand primitive
                    Aryan grammar, we must conceive it as having been expressed or implied in the
                    suffixes of the stems, and in the order according to which the stems were
                    arranged in a sentence. In other words, the relations of grammar were denoted
                    partly by juxtaposition or syntax, partly by the suffixes of stems.</p>
                <p>These suffixes were probably at first unmeaning, or rather clothed with vague
                    significations, which changed according to the place occupied in the sentence by
                    the stem to which they were joined. Gradually this vagueness of signification
                    disappeared, and particular suffixes came to be set apart to represent
                    particular relations of grammar. What had hitherto been expressed by mere
                    position now attached itself to the terminations or suffixes of stems, which
                    accordingly became full-grown words. Some of the suffixes denoted purely
                    grammatical ideas, that is to say, were flexions; others were classificatory,
                    serving to distinguish nouns from verbs, presents from aorists, objects from
                    agents, and the like; while others, again, remained unmeaning adjuncts of the
                    root. This origin of the flexions explains the otherwise strange fact that the
                    same suffix may symbolize wholly different grammatical relations. In Latin, for
                    instance, the context and dictionary will alone tell us that <hi rend="italic"
                    >mus-as</hi> is the accusative plural of a noun, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >am-as</hi> the second person singular of a verb, or that <hi rend="italic"
                    >mus-a</hi> is the nominative singular of a feminine substantive, <hi
                    rend="italic">bon-a</hi> the accusative plural of a neuter adjective. In short,
                    the flexions were originally merely the terminations of stems which were adapted
                    to express the various relations of words to each other in a sentence, as these
                    gradually presented themselves to the consciousness and were extracted from what
                    had been previously implied by position. Necessarily, the same suffix might be
                    used sometimes in a classificatory, sometimes in a flexional sense, and
                    sometimes without any definite sense at all. In the Greek dative-locative
                    7τ0δ-eσ-σt, for example, the suffix -eç is classificatory; in the nominative
                    τr0δ-ev, it is flexional.</p>
                <p>When a particular termination or suffix once acquired a special sense, it would
                    be separated in thought from the stem to which it belonged, and attached in the
                    same sense to other stems and other terminations. Thus in modern English we can
                    attach the suffix <hi rend="italic">-ize</hi> to almost any word whatsoever, in
                    order to give the latter a transitive meaning, and the Greek 7r0δeσσt, quoted
                    above, really contains no less than three suffixes, «ç, <hi rend="italic"
                    >-συ,</hi> and -ι, the last two both denoting the locative, and coalescing,
                    through &lt;rA, into a single syllable -σι. The latter instance shows us how two
                    or more suffixes denoting exactly the same idea may be tacked on one to another,
                    if the original force and signification of the first of them comes to be
                    forgotten. Thus, in Old English <hi rend="italic">sang-estre</hi> was the
                    feminine of <hi rend="italic">sang-ere,</hi> “singer,” but the meaning of the
                    termination has so entirely died out of the memory that we have to add the
                    Romanic <hi rend="italic">-ess</hi> to it if we would still distinguish it from
                    the masculine <hi rend="italic">singer.</hi> A familiar example of the way in
                    which the full sense of the exponent of a grammatical idea fades from the mind
                    and has to be supplied by a new exponent is afforded by the use of expletives in
                    conversational English to denote the superlative. “Very warm” expresses little
                    more than the positive, and to represent the intensity of his feelings the
                    Englishman has recourse to such expressions as “horribly warm” like the German
                    “schrecklich warm.”</p>
                <p>Such words as “very,” “horribly,” “schrecklich,” illustrate a second mode in
                    which Aryan grammar has found means of expression. Words may lose their true
                    signification<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n49/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0049-0040"/> and become the mere exponents of grammatical
                    ideas. Professor Earle divides all words into <hi rend="italic">presentive</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">symbolic,</hi> the former denoting objects and
                    conceptions, the latter the relations which exist between these. Symbolic words,
                    therefore, are what the Chinese grammarians call “empty words,”—words, that is,
                    which have been divested of their proper signification and serve a grammatical
                    purpose only. Many of the classificatory and some of the flexional suffixes of
                    Aryan speech can be shown to have had this origin. Thus the suffix <hi
                    rend="italic">tar,</hi> which denotes names of kinship and agency, seems to come
                    from the same root as the Latin <hi rend="italic">terminus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">trans,</hi> our <hi rend="italic">through,</hi> the Sanskrit <hi
                    rend="italic">tar-ami,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ii</hi> I pass over,”
                    and to have primarily signified “one that goes through” a thing. Thus, too, the
                    English <hi rend="italic">head</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hood,</hi> in words
                    like <hi rend="italic">godhead</hi> and <hi rend="italic">brotherhood,</hi> is
                    the Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">had,</hi> “character” or “rank <hi
                    rend="italic">dom,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">kingdom,</hi> the Anglo-Saxon <hi
                    rend="italic">dôm,</hi> “judgment and <hi rend="italic">lock</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ledge,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">wedlock</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">knowledge,</hi> the Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">la,c,</hi>
                    “sport” or “gift.” In all these cases the “empty words,” after first losing
                    every trace of their original significance, have followed the general analogy of
                    the language and assumed-the form and functions of the suffixes with which they
                    had been confused.</p>
                <p>A third mode of representing the relations of grammar is by the symbolic use of
                    vowels and diphthongs. In Greek, for instance, the distinction between the
                    reduplicated present δtδω∕u and the reduplicated perfect δ∈δωκα is indicated by
                    a distinction of vowel, and in primitive Aryan grammar the vowel <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> seems to have been set apart to denote the subjunctive mood
                    just as yαor <hi rend="italic">i</hi> was set apart to denote the potential. So,
                    too, according to M. Hovelacque, the change of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">u</hi> in the parent-Aryan symbolized
                    a change of meaning from passive to active. This symbolic use of the vowels,
                    which is the purest application of the principle of flexion, is far less
                    extensively carried out in the Aryan than in the Semitic languages. The Semitic
                    family of speech is therefore a much more characteristic type of the inflexional
                    languages than is the Aryan.</p>
                <p>The primitive Aryan noun possessed at least eight cases, —nominative, accusative,
                    vocative, instrumental, dative, genitive, ablative, and locative. M. Bergaigne
                    has attempted to show that the first three of these, the “strong cases” as they
                    are termed, are really abstracts formed by the suffixes <hi rend="italic"
                    >-as</hi> (-s), <hi rend="italic">-an-, -m, -t, -i-, -a,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">-ya</hi> (-i), the plural being nothing more than an abstract
                    singular, as may be readily seen by comparing words like the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">eπο-&lt;s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">οπe-ς,</hi> which mean
                    precisely the same. The remaining “weak” cιses, formed by the suffixes <hi
                    rend="italic">-sma, -sya, -sya, -ya, -i, -an, -t, -bhi,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >-su,</hi><hi rend="italic">-i, -a,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-a,</hi> are
                    really adjectives and adverbs. No distinction, for example, can be drawn between
                    “a cup of gold” and “a golden cup,” and the instrumental, the dative, the
                    ablative, and the locative are, when closely examined, merely adverbs attached
                    to a verb. The terminations of the strong cases do not displace the accent of
                    the βtem to which they are suffixed; the suffixes of the weak cases, on the
                    other hand, generally draw the accent upon themselves.</p>
                <p>According to Hübschmann, the nominative, accusative, and genitive cases are
                    purely grammatical, distinguished from one another through the exigencies of the
                    sentence only, whereas the locative, ablative, and instrumental have a logical
                    origin and determine the logical relation which the three other cases bear to
                    each other and the verb. The nature of the dative is left undecided. The
                    locative primarily denotes rest in a place, the ablative motion from a place,
                    and the instrumental the means or concomitance of an action. The dative
                    Hübschmann regards as “the cιse of the participant object.” Like Hübschmann,
                    Holzweissig divides the cases into two classes,—the one grammatical and the
                    other logical; and his analysis of their primitive meaning is the same as that
                    of Hübschmann, except as regards the dative, the primary sense of which he
                    thinks to have been motion towards a place. This is also the view of Delbrück,
                    who makes it denote tendency towards an object. Delbrück, however, holds that
                    the primary sense of the ablative was that of separation, the instrumental
                    originally indicating concomitance, while there was a double locative, one used
                    like the ablative absolute in Latin, the other being a locative of the
                    object.</p>
                <p>The dual was older than the plural, and after the development of the latter
                    survived as a merely useless encumbrance, of which most of the Aryan languages
                    contrived in time to get rid. There are still many savage idioms in which the
                    conception of plurality has not advanced beyond that of duality. In the Bushman
                    dialects, for instance, the plural, or rather that which is more than one, is
                    expressed by repeating the word; thus <hi rend="italic">tu</hi> is “mouth,” <hi
                    rend="italic">tutu</hi> “mouths.” It may be shown that most of the suffixes of
                    the Aryan dual are the longer and more primitive forms of those of the plural
                    which have grown out of them by the help of phonetic decay. The plural of the
                    weak cases, on the other hand (the accusative alone excepted), was identical
                    with the singular of abstract nouns; so far as both form and meaning are
                    concerned, no distinction can be drawn between 07res and «roç. Similarly, <hi
                    rend="italic">humanity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">men</hi> signify one and the
                    same thing, and the use of English words like <hi rend="italic">sheep</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">fish</hi> for both singular and plural shows to what an extent
                    our appreciation of number is determined by the context rather than by the form
                    of the noun. The so-called “broken plurals” of Arabic and Ethiopie are really
                    singular collectives employed to denote the plural.</p>
                <p>Gender is the product partly of analogy, partly of phonetic decay. In many
                    languages such as Eskimo and Chocktaw, its place is taken by a division of
                    objects into animate and inanimate, while in other languages they are separated
                    into rational and irrational. There are many indications that the parent-Aryan
                    in an early stage of its existence had no signs of gender at all. The
                    terminations of the names of <hi rend="italic">father</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >mother, pater</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mater,</hi> for example, are exactly
                    the same, and in Latin and Greek many diphthongal stems, as well as stems in <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ya</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
                    (like ναυς and <hi rend="italic">νeκν&lt;i,</hi> 7τoλιs and λ⅛), may be
                    indifferently masculine and feminine. Even stems in <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (of the second and first declensions), though the first
                    are generally masculine and the second generally feminine, by no means
                    invariably maintain the rule; and feminines like <hi rend="italic">humus</hi>
                    and όδό?, or masculines like <hi rend="italic">advena</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >πολίτης,</hi> show that there was a time when these stems also indicated no
                    particular gender, but owed their subsequent adaptation, the one to mark the
                    masculine and the other to mark the feminine, to the influence of analogy. The
                    idea of gender was first suggested by the difference between man and woman, male
                    and female, and, as in so many languages at the present day, was represented not
                    by any outward sign but by the meaning of the words themselves. When once
                    arrived at, the conception of gender was extended to other objects besides those
                    to which it properly belonged. The primitive Aryan did not distinguish bet ween
                    subject and object, butpersonifiedobjects by ascribing to them the motives and
                    powers of living beings. Accordingly they were referred to by different
                    pronouns, one class denoting the masculine and another class the feminine, and
                    the distinction that existed between these two classes of pronouns was after a
                    time transferred to the nouns. As soon as the preponderant number of stems in
                    <hi rend="italic">o</hi> in daily use had come to be regarded as masculine on
                    account of their meaning, other stems in <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> whatever
                    might be their signification, were made to follow the general analogy, and were
                    similarly classed as masculines. In the same way, the suffix <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ya</hi> acquired a feminine sense, and was set
                    apart to represent the feminine gender. Unlike the Semites, the Aryans were not
                    satisfied with these two <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n50/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0050-0041"/> genders, masculine and feminine. As soon as
                    object and subject, patient and agent, were clearly distinguished from each
                    other, there arose a need for a third gender, which should be neither masculine
                    nor feminine, but denote things without life. This third gender was fittingly
                    expressed either by the objective case used as a nominative <hi rend="italic"
                    >le.g., regnum),</hi> or by a stem without any case ending at all (e.y., <hi
                    rend="italic">virus).</hi></p>
                <p>The adverbial meaning of so many of the cases explains the readiness with which
                    they became crystallized into adverbs and prepositions. Au adverb is the
                    attribute of an attribute,—“the rose smells sweetly,” for example, being
                    resolvable into “the rose has the attribute of scent with the further attribute
                    of sweetness.” In our own language <hi rend="italic">once, twice, needs,</hi>
                    are all genitives <hi rend="italic">; seldom</hi> is a dative. The Latin and
                    Greek <hi rend="italic">hunιi</hi> and χαμαι are locatives, <hi rend="italic"
                    >facillime</hi><hi rend="italic">{fαcil-lumed)</hi> and ευτυχώς ablatives, <hi
                    rend="italic">τravτg</hi> and d∕zα instrumentals, πώρος, έ£ί)ς, and <hi
                    rend="italic">τfkov</hi> genitives. The frequency with which particular cases of
                    particular nouns were used in a specifically attributive sense caused them to
                    become, as it were, petrified, the other cases of the nouns in question passing
                    out of use, and the original force of those that were retained being gradually
                    forgotten. Prepositions are adverbs employed to define nouns instead of verbs
                    and adjectives. Their appearance in the Aryan languages is comparatively late,
                    and the Homeric poems allow us to trace their growth in Greek. The adverb,
                    originally intended to define the verb, came to be construed with the noun, and
                    the government of the case with which it was construed was accordingly
                    transferred from the verb to the noun. Thus when we read in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> (iv. 43), αύτου? δ’ εiσi)γov <hi rend="italic"
                    >θeiοv</hi> δόρ,ον, we see that ci? is still an adverb, and that the accusative
                    is governed by the verb; it is quite otherwise, however, with a line like
                    ’Ατρείδες δε γέροντα? άολλεας <hi rend="italic">∙ηγev</hi> ’Αχαιών ε? κλισι⅛v
                    <hi rend="italic">{Ll.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> i. 89.) where the
                    adverb has passed into a preposition. The same process of transformation is
                    still going on in English, where we can say indifferently, “What are you looking
                    at ?” using “at” as an adverb, and governing the pronoun by the verb, and “At
                    what are you looking?” where “at” has become a preposition. With the growth and
                    increase of prepositions the need of the caseendings diminished, and in some
                    languages the latter disappeared altogether.</p>
                <p>Like prepositions, conjunctions also are primarily adverbs used in a
                    demonstrative and relative sense. Hence most of the conjunctions are petrified
                    cases of pronouns. The relation between two sentences was originally expressed
                    by simply setting them side by side, afterwards by employing a demonstrative at
                    the beginning of the second clause to refer to the whole preceding one. The
                    relative pronoun can be shown to have been in the first instance a
                    demonstrative; indeed, we can still use <hi rend="italic">that</hi> in English
                    in a relative sense. Since the demonstrative at the beginning of the second
                    clause represented the first clause, and was consequently an attribute of the
                    second, it had to stand in some case, and this case became a conjunction. How
                    closely allied the adverb and the conjunction are may be seen from Greek and
                    Latin, where ώ? or <hi rend="italic">quum</hi> can be used as either the one or
                    the other. Our own <hi rend="italic">and,</hi> it may be observed, has probably
                    the same root as the Greek locative adverb ετι, and originally signified “going
                    further.”</p>
                <p>Another form of adverb is the infinitive, the adverbial force of which appears
                    clearly in such a phrase as “A wonderful thing to see.” Various cases, such as
                    the locative, the dative, or the instrumental, are employed in Vedic Sanskrit in
                    the sense of the infinitive, besides the bare stem or neuter formed by the
                    suffixes <hi rend="italic">man</hi> and <hi rend="italic">van.</hi> In Greek the
                    neuter stem and the dative case were alone retained for the purpose. The first
                    is found in infinitives like δόρ,εν and <hi rend="italic">φepecv</hi> (for an
                    earlier <hi rend="italic">φεpeHv),</hi> the second in the infinitives in -αι.
                    Thus the Greek δούναι answers letter for letter to the Vedic dative <hi
                    rend="italic">dαvane,</hi> “to give,” and the form ∣^ευδεσ0αι is explained by
                    the Vedic <hi rend="italic">vayodhai,</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >vayas-dhai,</hi> literally “to do living,” <hi rend="italic">dhai</hi> being
                    the dative of a noun from the root <hi rend="italic">dhâ,</hi> “to place” or
                    “do.” When the form <hi rend="italic">φtν∙ δeσθαι</hi> had once come into
                    existence, analogy was ready to create such false imitations as <hi
                    rend="italic">γράψασθατ</hi> or <hi rend="italic">γpaφθησεσθ&lt;u,</hi> The
                    Latin infinitive in <hi rend="italic">-re</hi> for <hi rend="italic">-se</hi>
                    has the same origin, <hi rend="italic">amare,</hi> for instance, being the
                    dative of an old stem <hi rend="italic">amas.</hi> In <hi rend="italic"
                    >fieri</hi> for <hi rend="italic">fierei</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Jiesei,</hi>
                    from the same root as our English <hi rend="italic">be,</hi> the original length
                    of the final syllable is preserved. The suffix in <hi rend="italic">-um</hi> is
                    an accusative, like the corresponding infinitive of classical Sanskrit. This
                    origin of the infinitive explains the Latin construction of the accusative and
                    infinitive. When the Roman said, “Miror te ad me nihil scribere,” all that he
                    meant at first was, “I wonder at you for writing nothing to me,” where the
                    infinitive was merely a dative case used adverbially.</p>
                <p>The history of the infinitive makes it clear how little distinction must have
                    been felt at the outset between the noun and the verb. Indeed, the growth of the
                    verb was a slow process. There was a time in the history of Aryan speech when it
                    had not as yet risen to the consciousness of the speaker, and in the period when
                    the noun did not possess a plural there was as yet also no verb. The attachment
                    of the first and second personal pronouns, or of suffixes resembling them, to
                    certain stems, was the first stage in the development of the latter. Like the
                    Semitic verb, the Aryan verb seems primarily to have denoted relation only, and
                    to have been attached as an attribute to the subject. The idea of time, however,
                    was soon put into it, and two tenses were created, the one expressing a present
                    or continuous action, the other an aoristic or momentary one. The distinction of
                    sense was symbolized by a distinction of pronunciation, the root-syllable of the
                    aorist being an· abbreviated form of that of the present. This abbreviation was
                    due to a change in the position of the accent (which was shifted from the
                    stem-syllable to the termination), and this change again was probably occasioned
                    by the prefixing of the so-called augment to the aorist, which survived into
                    historical times only in Sanskrit, Zend, and Greek, and the origin of which is
                    still a mystery. The weight of the first syllable in the aorist further caused
                    the person-endings tobe shortened, and so two sets of person-endings, usually
                    termed primary and secondary, sprang into existence. By reduplicating the
                    root-syllable of the present tense a perfect was formed; but originally no
                    distinction was made between present and perfect, and Greek verbs like δiδωμι
                    and <hi rend="italic">ηκω</hi> arc memorials of a time when the difference
                    between “I am come” and “I have come” was not yet felt. Reduplication was
                    further adapted to the expression of intensity and desire (in the so-called
                    intensive and desiderative forms). By the side of the aorist stood the
                    imperfect, which differed from the aorist, so far as outward form was concerned,
                    only in possessing the longer and more original stem of the present. Indeed, as
                    Benfey first saw, the aorist itself was primitively an imperfect, and the
                    distinction between aorist and imperfect is not older than the period when the
                    stemsyllables of certain imperfects were shortened through the influence of the
                    accent, and this differentiation of forms appropriated to denote a difference
                    between the sense of the aorist and the imperfect which was beginning to be
                    felt. After the analogy of the imperfect, a pluperfect was created out of the
                    perfect by prefixing the augment (of which the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >ερ.εμ.ηκον</hi> is an illustration); though the pluperfect, too, was originally
                    an imperfect formed from the reduplicated present.</p>
                <p>Besides time, mood was also expressed by the primitive Aryan verb, recourse being
                    had to symbolization for the purpose. The imperative was represented by the bare
                    stem, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n51/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0051-0042"/> like the vocative, the accent being drawn back to
                    the first syllable, though other modes of denoting it soon came into vogue.
                    Possibility was symbolized by the attachment of the suffix <hi rend="italic"
                    >-ya</hi> to the stem, probability by the attachment of <hi rend="italic"
                    >-a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-a,</hi> and in this way the optative and
                    conjunctive moods first arose. The creation of a future by the help of the
                    suffix <hi rend="italic">-sya</hi> seems to belong to the same period in the
                    history of the verb. This suffix is probably identical with that used to form a
                    large class of adjectives and genitives (like the Greek r7r7roιo for i7r7roσιo);
                    in this case future time will have been regarded as an attribute of the subject,
                    no distinction being drawn, for instance, between “rising sun ’·’ and “the sun
                    will rise.” It is possible, however, that the auxiliary verb <hi rend="italic"
                    >as,</hi> “to be,” enters into the composition of the future; if so, the future
                    will be the product of the second stage in the development of the Aryan verb
                    when new forms were created by means of composition. The sigmatic or first
                    aorist is in favour of this view, as it certainly belongs to the age of Aryan
                    unity, and may be a compound of the verbal stem with the auxiliary <hi
                    rend="italic">as.</hi></p>
                <p>After the separation of the Aryan languages, composition was largely employed in
                    the formation of new tenses. Thus in Latin we have perfects like <hi
                    rend="italic">scrip-si</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ama-vi,</hi> formed by the
                    help of the auxiliaries <hi rend="italic">as (sum) andfuo,</hi> while such forms
                    as <hi rend="italic">amaveram (amavi eram)</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >amarem</hi><hi rend="italic">(ama-sem)</hi> bear their origin on their face.
                    So, too, the future in Latin and Old Celtic <hi rend="italic">(amabo,</hi> Irish
                    <hi rend="italic">carub)</hi> is based upon the substantive verb <hi
                    rend="italic">fuo,</hi> “to be,” and the English preterite in <hi rend="italic"
                    >-ed</hi> goes back to a suffixed <hi rend="italic">did,</hi> the reduplicated
                    perfect of <hi rend="italic">do.</hi> New tenses and moods, however, were
                    created by the aid of suffixes as well as by the aid of composition, or rather
                    were formed from nouns whose stems terminated in the suffixes in question. Thu3
                    in Greek we have aorists and perfects in <hi rend="italic">-κα,</hi> and the
                    characteristics of the two passive aorists, <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">the,</hi> are more probably the suffixes of nominal stems than the
                    roots of the two verbs <hi rend="italic">ya,</hi> “to go,” and <hi rend="italic"
                    >dhd,</hi> “to place,” as Bopp supposed. How late some of these new formations
                    were may be seen in Greek, where the Homeric poems are still ignorant of the
                    weak future passive, the optative future, and the aspirated perfect, and where
                    the strong future passive occurs but once and the desiderative but twice. On the
                    other hand, many of the older tenses were disused and lost. In classical
                    Sanskrit, for instance, of the modal aorist forms the precative and benedictive
                    almost alone remain, while the pluperfect, of which Delbrück has found traces in
                    the Veda, has wholly disappeared</p>
                <p>The passive voice did not exist in the parent-Aryan speech. No need for it had
                    arisen, since such a sentence as “I am pleased” could be as well represented by
                    “This pleases me,” or “I please myself.” It was long before the speaker was able
                    to imagine an action without an object, and when he did so, it was a neuter or
                    substantival rather than a passive verb that he formed. The passive, in fact,
                    grew out of the middle or reflexive, and, except in the two aorists, continued
                    to be represented by the middle in Greek. So, too, in Latin the second person
                    plural is really the middle participle with <hi rend="italic">estis</hi>
                    understood, and the whole class of deponent or reflexive verbs proves that the
                    characteristic <hi rend="italic">r</hi> which Latin shares with Celtic could
                    have had at the outset no passive force.</p>
                <p>Much light has been thrown on the character and construction of the primitive
                    Aryan sentence by comparative syntax. In contradistinction to Semitic, where the
                    defining word follows that which is defined, the Aryan languages place that
                    which is defined after that which defines it; and Bergaigne has made it clear
                    that the original order of the sentence waβ (1) object, (2) verb, and (3)
                    subject. Greater complication of thought and its expression, the connexion of
                    sentences by the aid of conjunctions, and rhetorical inversion caused that
                    dislocation of the original order of the sentence which reaches its culminating
                    point in the involved periods of Latin literature. Our own language still
                    remains true, however, to the syntax of the parent-Aryan when it sets both
                    adjective and genitive before the nouns which they define. In course of time a
                    distinction came to be made between an attribute used as a mere qualificative
                    and an attribute used predicatively, and this distinction was expressed by
                    placing the predicate in opposition to the subject and accordingly after it. The
                    opposition was of itself sufficient to indicate the logical copula, or
                    substantive verb; indeed, the word which afterwards commonly stood for the
                    latter at first signified “existence,” and it was only through the wear and tear
                    of time that a phrase like <hi rend="italic">Deus bonus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >est,</hi> “God exists as good,” came to mean simply “God is good.” It is
                    needless to observe that neither of the two articles was known to the
                    parent-Aryan; indeed, the definite article, which is merely a decayed
                    demonstrative pronoun, has not yet been developed in several of the languages of
                    the Aryan family.</p>
                <p>We must now glance briefly at the results of a scientific investigation of
                    English grammar and the modifications they necessitate in our conception of it.
                    The idea that the free use of speech is tied down by the rules of the grammarian
                    must first be given up’; all that the grammarian can do is to formulate the
                    current uses of his time, which are determined by habit and custom, and are
                    accordingly in a perpetual state of flux. We must next get rid of the notion
                    that English grammar should be modelled after that of ancient Rome; until we do
                    so we shall never understand even the elementary principles upon which it is
                    based. We cannot speak of declensions, since English has no genders except in
                    the pronouns of the third person, and no cases except the genitive and a few
                    faint traces of an old dative. Its verbal conjugation is essentially different
                    from that of an inflexional language like Latin, and cannot be compressed into
                    the same categories. In English the syntax has been enlarged at the expense of
                    the accidence; position has taken the place of forms. To speak of an adjective
                    “agreeing” with its substantive is as misleading as to speak of a verb
                    “governing” a case. In fact, the distinction between noun and adjective is
                    inapplicable tc English grammar, and should be replaced by a distinction between
                    objective and attributive words. In a phrase like “this is a cannon,” <hi
                    rend="italic">cannon</hi> is objective; in a phrase like “a cannonball,” it is
                    attributive; and to call it a substantive in the one case and an adjective in
                    the other, is only to introduce confusion. With the exception of the nominative,
                    the various forms of the noun are all attributive; there is no difference, for
                    example, between “doing a thing” and “doing badly.” Apart from the personal
                    pronouns, the accusative of the classical languages can be represented only by
                    position; but if we were to say that a noun which follows a verb is in the
                    accusative case we should have to define “king” as an accusative in such
                    sentences as “he became king” or “he is king.” In conversational English “it is
                    me” is as correct as “c’est moi” in French, or “det er mig” in Danish; the
                    literary “it is I” is due to the influence of classical grammar. The combination
                    of noun or pronoun and preposition results in a compound attribute. As for the
                    verb, Mr Sweet has well said that “the really characteristic feature of the
                    English finite verb is its inability to stand alone without a pronominal
                    prefix.” Thus “dream” by itself is a noun; “I dream” is a verb. The place of the
                    pronominal prefix may be taken by a noun, though both poetry and vulgar English
                    frequently insert the pronoun even when the noun precedes. The number of
                    inflected verbal forms is but small, being confined to the third person singular
                    and the special forms of the preterite and past participle, though the latter
                    may with more justice be regarded as belonging to the province of the
                    lexicographer <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n52/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0052-0043"/> rather than to that of the grammarian. The
                    inflected subjunctive <hi rend="italic">(be, were, save</hi> in “God save the
                    Queen,” &amp;c.) is rapidly disappearing. New inflected forms, however, are
                    coming into existence; at all events, we have as good a right to consider <hi
                    rend="italic">wont, shant, cant</hi> new inflected forms as the French <hi
                    rend="italic">aimerai</hi><hi rend="italic">(amare habeo),</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aimerais</hi><hi rend="italic">(amare habebam).</hi> If the ordinary grammars
                    are correct in treating forms like “I am loving,” “I was loving,” “I did love,”
                    as separate tenses, they are strangely inconsistent in omitting to notice the
                    equally important emphatic form “I do love” or the negative form “I do not love
                    (“I don’t love ”), as well as the semi-inflexional “I’ll love,” “he’s loving.”
                    It is true that these latter contracted forms are heard only in conversation and
                    not seen in books; but the grammar of a language, it must be remembered, is made
                    by those who speak it and not by the printers.</p>
                <p>Our school grammars are the inheritance we have received from Greece and Rome.
                    The necessities of rhetoric obliged the Sophists to investigate the structure of
                    the Greek language, and to them was accordingly due the first analysis of Greek
                    grammar. Protagoras distinguished the three genders and the verbal moods, while
                    Prodicus busied himself with the definition of synonyms. Aristotle, taking the
                    side of Democritus, who had held that the meaning of words is put into them by
                    the speaker, and that there is no necessary connexion between sound and sense,
                    laid down that words “symbolize” objects according to the will of those who use
                    them, and added to the <hi rend="italic">ονοpa</hi> or “noun,” and the <hi
                    rend="italic">ρήμα</hi> or “verb,” the συvδ∈σ∕wς or “particle.” He also
                    introduced the term 7rrωσις, “case,” to denote any flexion whatsoever. He
                    further divided nouns into simple and compound, invented for the neuter another
                    name than that given by Protagoras, and starting from the termination of the
                    nominative singular, endeavoured to ascertain the rules for indicating a
                    difference of gender. Aristotle was followed by the Stoics, who separated the
                    <hi rend="italic">apθpov</hi> or “article” from the particles, determined a
                    fifth part of speech, the <hi rend="italic">πανδέκτης</hi> or “adverb,” confined
                    the term “case” to the flexions of the nouns, distinguishing the four principal
                    cases by names, and divided the verb into its tenses, moods, and classes.
                    Meanwhile the Alexandrian critics were studying the language of Homer and the
                    Attic writers, and comparing it with the language of their own day, the result
                    being a minute examination of the facts and rules of grammar. Two schools of
                    grammarians sprang up,—the Analogists, headed by Aristarchus, who held that a
                    strict law of analogy existed between idea and word, and refused to admit
                    exceptions to the grammatical rules they laid down, and the Anomalists, who
                    denied general rules of any kind, except in so far as they were consecrated by
                    custom. Foremost among the Anomalists was Crates of Mallos, the leader of the
                    Pergamenian school, to whom we owe the first formal Greek grammar and collection
                    of the grammatical facts obtained by the labours of the Alexandrian critics, as
                    well as an attempt to reform Greek orthography. The immediate cause of this
                    grammar seems to have been a comparison of Latin with Greek, Crates having
                    lectured on the subject while ambassador of Attalus at Rome in 159 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The zeal with which the Romans threw themselves into
                    the study of Greek resulted in the school grammar of Dionysius Thrax, a pupil of
                    Aristarchus, which he published at Rome in the time of Pompey, and which is
                    still in existence. Latin grammars were soon modelled upon it, and the attempt
                    to translate the technical terms of the Greek grammarians into Latin was
                    productive of numerous blunders which have been perpetuated to our own day. Thus
                    <hi rend="italic">tenues</hi> is a mistranslation of die Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >ψιλά,</hi> “unaspirated;” <hi rend="italic">genetivus</hi> of γmκi7, the case
                    “of the genus;” <hi rend="italic">accusativus</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                    >αιτιατική,</hi> the case “of the object;” <hi rend="italic">infinitivus</hi> of
                    <hi rend="italic">άπαρέμψατος,</hi> “without a secondary meaning” of tense or
                    person. New names were coined to denote forms possessed by Latin and not by
                    Greek; <hi rend="italic">ablative,</hi> for instance, was invented by Julius
                    Caesar, who also wrote a treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Analogia.</hi> By the 2d century of the Christian era the dispute between the
                    Anomalists and the Analogists was finally settled, analogy being recognized as
                    the principle that underlies language, though every rule admits of exceptions.
                    Two eminent grammarians of Alexandria, Apollonius Dyscolus and his son Herodian,
                    summed up the labours and controversies of their predecessors, and upon their
                    works were based the Latin grammar composed by Aelius Donatus in the 4th
                    century, and the eighteen books on grammar compiled by Priscian in the age of
                    Justinian. The grammar of Donatus dominated the schools of the Middle Ages, and,
                    along with the productions of Priscian, formed the type and source of the Latin
                    and Greek school-grammars of modern Europe.</p>
                <p>A few words remain to be said, in conclusion, on the bearing of a scientific
                    study of grammar upon the practical task of teaching and learning foreign
                    languages. The grammar of a language is not to be confined within the rules laid
                    down by grammarians, much less is it the creation of grammarians, and
                    consequently the usual mode of making the pupil learn by heart certain fixed
                    rules and paradigms not only gives a false idea of what grammar really is, but
                    also throws obstacles in the way of acquiring it. The unit of speech is the
                    sentence; and it is with the sentence therefore, and not with lists of words and
                    forms, that the pupil should begin. When once a sufficient number of sentences
                    has been, so to speak, assimilated, it will be easy to analyse them into their
                    component parts, to show the relations that these bear to one another, and to
                    indicate the nature and varieties of the latter. In this way the learner will be
                    prevented from regarding grammar as a piece of dead mechanism or a Chinese
                    puzzle, of which the parts must be fitted together in accordance with certain
                    artificial rules, and will realize that it is a living organism which has a
                    history and a reason of its own. The method of nature and science alike is
                    analytic; and if we would learn a foreign language properly we must learn it as
                    we did our mothertongue, by first mastering the expression of a complete thought
                    and then breaking up this expression into its several elements.</p>
