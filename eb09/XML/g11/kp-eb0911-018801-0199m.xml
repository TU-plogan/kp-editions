                    appeared to be reserved exclusively for those who devoted themselves to the

                    Grandon not only persuaded the father of Greuze to give way to his son’s wishes,
                    and permit the lad to accompany him as his pupil to Lyons, but when at a later
                    date he himself left Lyons for Paris—where his son-in-law Grétry the celebrated
                    composer enjoyed the height of favour—Grandon carried young Greuze with him.
                    Settled in Paris, Greuze worked from the living model in the school of the Royal
                    Academy, but did not attract the attention of his teachers; and when he produced
                    his first picture, Le Père de Famille expliquant la Bible à ses Enfants,
                    considerable doubt was felt and shown as to his share in its production. By
                    other and more remarkable works of the same class Greuze soon established his
                    claims beyond contest, and won for himself the notice and support of the
                    well-known connoisseur La Live de Jully, the brother-in-law of Madame d’ Épinay.
                    In 1755 Greuze exhibited his Aveugle Trompé, upon which, presented by Pigalle
                    the sculptor, he was immediately <hi rend="italic">agree</hi> by the Academy.
                    Towards the close of the same year he left France for Italy, in company with the
                    Abbé Louis Gougenot, who had deserted from the magistrature,—although he had
                    obtained the post of “conseillier au Châtelet,”—in order to take the “petit
                    collet.” Gougenot had some acquaintance with the arts, and was highly valued by
                    the Academicians,—who, during his journey with Greuze elected him an honorary
                    member of their body—on account of his studies in mythology and allegory; his
                    acquirements in these respects are said to have been largely utilized by them,
                    but to Greuze they were of doubtful advantage, and he lost rather than gained by
                    this visit to Italy in Gougenot’s company. He had undertaken it probably in
                    order to silence those who taxed him with ignorance of “great models of style,”
                    but the Italian subjects which formed the entirety of his contributions to the
                    Salon of 1757 showed that he had been put on a false track, and he speedily
                    returned to the source of his first inspiration. In 1759, 1761 (L’Accordée de
                    Village, —Louvre), and 1763 Greuze exhibited with ever increasing success; in
                    1765 he reached the zenith of his powers and reputation. In that year he was
                    represented with no less than thirteen works, amongst which maybe cited La Jeune
                    Fille qui pleure son Oiseau mort, La Bonne Mère, Le Mauvais Fils puni (Louvre),
                    and La Malédiction Paternelle (Louvre). The Academy took occasion to press
                    Greuze for his diploma picture, the execution of which had been long delayed,
                    and forbade him to exhibit on their walls until he had complied with their
                    regulations. “J’ai vu la lettre,” says Diderot, “qui est un modèle d’honnêteté
                    et d’estime; j’ai vu la réponse de Greuze qui est un modèle de vanité et
                    d’impertinence: il fallait appuyer cela d’un chef-d’oeuvre, et c’est ce que
                    Greuze n’a pas fait.” Greuze wished to be received as an historical painter, and
                    produced a work which he intended to vindicate his right to despise his
                    qualifications as a <hi rend="italic">peintre</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    genre.</hi> This unfortunate canvas,—</p>

                <p>Sevère et Caracalla (Louvre),—was exhibited in 1769 side by side with Greuze’s
                    portrait of Jeaurat (Louvre), and his admirable Petite Fille au Chien Noir. The
                    Academicians received their new member with all due honours, but at the close of
                    the ceremonies the Director addressed Greuze in these words—“Monsieur,
                    l’Académie vous a reçu, mais c’est comme peintre de genre; elle a eu égard à vos
                    anciennes productions, qui sont excellentes, et elle a fermé les yeux sur
                    celle-ci, qui n’est digne ni d’elle ni de vous.” Greuze, greatly incensed,
                    quarrelled with his <hi rend="italic">confrères,</hi> and ceased to exhibit
                    until, in 1804, the Revolution had thrown open the doors of the Academy to all
                    the world. In the following year, on 4th March 1805, he died in the Louvre in
                    great poverty. He had been in receipt of considerable wealth, which he had
                    dissipated by extravagance and bad management, so that during his closing years
                    he was forced even to solicit commissions which his enfeebled powers no longer
                    enabled him to carry out with success. The brilliant reputation which Greuze
                    acquired seems to have been due, not to his acquirements as a painter,—for his
                    practice is evidently that current in his own day,—but to the character of the
                    subjects which he treated. That return to nature which inspired Rousseau’s
                    attacks upon an artificial civilization demanded expression in art. Diderot in
                    <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Fils</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturel et
                    le Père de Famille</hi> tried to turn the vein of domestic drama to account on
                    the stage; that which he tried and failed to do, Greuze, in painting, achieved
                    with extraordinary success, although his works, like the plays of Diderot, were
                    affected by that very artificiality against which they protested. The touch of
                    melodramatic exaggeration, however, which runs through them finds an apology in
                    the firm and brilliant play of line, in the freshness and vigour of the flesh
                    tints, in the enticing softness of expression (often obtained by almost an abuse
                    of <hi rend="italic">méplats),</hi> by the alluring air of health and youth, by
                    the sensuous attractions, in short, with which Greuze invests his lessons of
                    bourgeois morality. As Diderot said of La Bonne Mère, “ça prêche la population;”
                    and a certain piquancy of contrast is the result which never fails to obtain
                    admirers. La Jeune Fille à ΓAgneau fetched, indeed, at the Pourtalis sale in
                    1865 no less than 1,000,200 francs. One of Greuze’s pupils, Madame Le Doux,
                    imitated with success the manner of her master; his daughter and granddaughter,
                    Madame de Valory, also inherited some traditions of his talent. Madame de Valory
                    published in 1813 a Comédie-vaudeville, <hi rend="italic">Greuze,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ou</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">Accordée</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Village,</hi> to which she prefixed a notice of her
                    grandfather’s life and works, and the <hi rend="italic">Salons</hi> of Diderot
                    also contain, besides many other particulars, the story at full length of
                    Greuze’s quarrel with the Academy. Four of the most distinguished engravers of
                    that date, Massard père, Flipart, Gaillard, and Levasseur, were specially
                    entrusted by Greuze with the reproduction of his subjects, but there are also
                    excellent prints by other engravers, notably by Cars and Le Bas. <hi
