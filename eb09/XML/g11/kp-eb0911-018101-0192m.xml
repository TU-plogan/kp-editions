                    his conversion, it had been his original intention to live a retired ascetic
                    life (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> vj. 30); but this wish he was not
                    permitted to gratify. Urged by Origen, and at last almost compelled by Phaedimus
                    of Amasia, his metropolitan, neither of whom was willing to see so much
                    learning, piety, and masculine energy practically lost to the church, he, after
                    many attempts to evade the dignity, was consecrated bishop of his native town
                    (about 240). His episcopate, which lasted some thirty years, was characterized
                    by great zeal, and by so mueh success that, according to the (doubtless somewhat
                    rhetorical) statement of Gregory of Nyssa, whereas at the outset of his labours
                    there were only seventeen Christians in the city, there were at his death only
                    seventeen persons in all who had not embraced Christianity. This result he
                    achieved in spite of the Decian persecution (250), during which he had felt it
                    to be his duty to absent himself from his diocese, and notwithstanding the
                    demoralizing effects of an irruption of barbarians who laid waste the diocese in
                    260. Gregory, although he has not always escaped the charge of Sabellianism, now
                    holds an undisputed place among the fathers of the church; and although the turn
                    of his mind was practical rather than speculative, he is known to have taken an
                    energetic part in most of the doctrinal controversies of his time. He was active
                    at the synods of Antioch which investigated and condemned the heresies of Paul;
                    and the rapid spread in Pontus of a Trinitarianism approaching the Nicene type
                    is attributed in large measure to the weight of his influence. Gregory is
                    believed to have died in the reign of Aurelian, about the year 270, though some
                    accounts place his death six years earlier. His festival (semiduplex) is
                    observed by the Church of Rome on the 17th of November. For the facts of his
                    biography our earliest and best authority is the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> or
                    rather <hi rend="italic">Panegyric</hi> by Gregory of Nyssa; but there are also
                    incidental notices of him in the writings of Basil the Great. Both these writers
                    represent him as having wrought miracles of a very startling description; but
                    nothing related by them comes near the astounding narratives given in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Martyrologies,</hi> or even in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Breviarium</hi><hi rend="italic">Bomanum,</hi> in connexion with his name.</p>
                <p>The principal works of Gregory Thaumaturgus are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Panegyricus</hi><hi rend="italic">in Origenem (els</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ωριγevηv</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >πανηγυρικός</hi><hi rend="italic">K&lt;Sγos),</hi> which he wrote when on the
                    point of leaving the school of that great master; a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metap&gt;hrasis in Ecclesiasten,</hi> characterized by Jerome as “short but
                    useful”; and an <hi rend="italic">Epistola Canonica,</hi> which treats of the
                    discipline to be undergone by those Christians who under pressure of persecution
                    had relapsed into paganism, but desired to be restored to the privileges of the
                    church. An <hi rend="italic">Expositio Fidei,</hi> usually attributed to
                    Gregory, and traditionally alleged to have been received by him immediately in
                    vision from the apostle John himself, is of doubtful authenticity. There have
                    been several editions of the works of this father; of these may be mentioned
                    that of Gerard Voss, in Greek and Latin (Mainz, 1604); the Paris edition of
                    1622; and that contained in the third volume of Galland’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliotheca Patrum</hi> (Paris, 1788). They are also to be found in a Latin
                    translation in Migne’s <hi rend="italic">Patrologia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Graeca,</hi> vol. vii. A separate reprint of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Panegyricus</hi><hi rend="italic">in Origenem</hi> was published by Bengel in
                    1722. The life of Gregory has been written by Pallavicini (Rome, 1644) and by
                    Boye (Jena, 1703).</p>
