                    celebration of the battle of Liitzen, on the 6th of November 1832; a proposal to
                    collect funds fora monument to Gustavus Adolphus having been agreed to, it was
                    suggested by Superintendent Grossmann that the best memorial to the great
                    champion of Protestantism would be the formation of a union for propagating his
                    ideas. For some years the society was somewhat limited in its area and
                    operations, being practically confined to Leipsic and Dresden, but at the
                    Reformation festival in 1841 it received a new impulse through the energy and
                    eloquence of the Hofprediger Zimmermann of Darmstadt, and in 1843 a general
                    meeting was held at Frankfort-onthe-Main where no fewer than twenty-nine branch
                    associations, belonging to all parts of Germany except Bavaria and Austria, were
                    represented. The want of a positive creed on the part of the Union tended from
                    the first, however, to make many of the stricter Protestant churchmen doubtful
                    of its probable usefulness; though on the other hand its purely negative
                    attitude in relation to Roman Catholicism secured for it the sympathy of the
                    masses. At a general convention held in Berlin in September 1846 a keen dispute
                    arose about the admission of the Königsberg delegate Rupp, the founder of the
                    “Free Congregations”; his exclusion, which was carried by a majority, called
                    forth many energetic protests, and at one time it seemed likely that the society
                    would be completely broken up. A peaceful solution of the difficulty, however,
                    was reached at Darmstadt in 1847. Amid the complications of the Revolution of
                    1848 the whole movement fell into stagnation; but in 1849 another general
                    convention (the seventh), held at Breslau, showed that, although the society had
                    lost both in membership and income, it still was possessed of considerable
                    vitality. From that date the Gustav-Adolf-Verein has been more definitely
                    “evangelical” in its tone than formerly; and under the direction of Zimmermann
                    of Darmstadt it has greatly increased both in numbers and in wealth. In 1853 the
                    income was .£13,500; in 1858 it had risen to £21,000; while in 1876 there was
                    divided among 1406 congregations a sum of nearly £35,000. The total number of
                    congregations assisted up to that date was 2558, and the sums distributed
                    amounted to an aggregate of nearly £637,000. Apart from any influence it may
                    have had in advancing the cause of Protestantism in places where it was
                    struggling or weak, there can be no doubt that the Union has had a very great
                    effect in helping the various separate Evangelical churches of Germany to <pb

                    interests. It ought to be added that the stricter Lutherans still continue to
