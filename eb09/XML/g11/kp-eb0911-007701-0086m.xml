                    London, December 26, 1716. His father, Philip Gray, an exchange broker and
                    scrivener, was a wealthy and nominally respectable citizen; but he treated his
                    family with brutal severity and neglect, and the poet was altogether indebted
                    for the advantages of a learned education to the affectionate care and industry
                    of his mother, whose maiden name was Antrobus, and who, in conjunction with a
                    maiden sister, kept a millinery shop. A brother of Mrs Gray was assistant to the
                    master of Eton, and was also a fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge. Under his
                    protection the poet was educated at Eton, and thence went to Peterhouse,
                    Cambridge, attending college from 1734 to September 1738. At Eton he had as
                    contemporaries Richard West, son of the lord chancellor of Ireland, and Horace
                    Walpole, son of the triumphant Whig minister, Sir Robert Walpole. West died
                    early in his 26th year, but his genius and virtues and his sorrows will for ever
                    live in the correspondence of his friend. In the spring of 1739 Gray was invited
                    by Horace Walpole to accompany him as travelling companion in a tour through
                    France and Italy. They made the usual tour, and Gray wrote remarks on all he saw
                    in Florence, Rome, Naples, &amp;c. His observations on arts and antiquities, and
                    his sketches of foreign manners, evince his admirable taste, learning, and
                    discrimination. Since Milton, no such accomplished English traveller had visited
                    those classic shores. In their journey through Dauphiné, Gray’s attention was
                    strongly arrested by the wild and picturesque site of the Grande Chartreuse,
                    surrounded by its dense forest of beech and fir, its enormous precipices,
                    cliffs, and cascades. He visited it a second time on his return, and in the
                    album of the mountain convent he wrote his famous Alcaic Ode. At Reggio the
                    travellers quarrelled and parted. Walpole took the whole blame on himself. He
                    was fond of pleasure and amusements, “intoxicated by vanity, indulgence, and the
                    insolence of his situation as a prime minister’s son,”—hiä own confession,—while
                    Gray was studious, of a serious disposition, and independent spirit. The
                    immediate cause of the rupture is said to have been Walpole’s clandestinely
                    opening, reading, and resealing a letter addressed to Gray, in which he expected
                    to find a confirmation of his suspicions that Gray had been writing unfavourably
                    of him to some friends in England. A partial reconciliation was effected about
                    three years afterwards by the intervention of a lady, and Walpole redeemed his
                    youthful error by a life-long sincere admiration and respect for his friend. F
                    rom Reggio Gray proceeded to Venice, and thence travelled homewards, attended by
                    a <hi rend="italic">laquais</hi><hi rend="italic">de voyage.</hi> He arrived in
                    England in September 1741, having been absent about two years and a half. His
                    father died in November, and it was found that the poet’s fortune would not
                    enable him to prosecute the study of the law. He therefore retired to Cambridge,
                    and fixed his residence at the university. There he continued for the remainder
                    of his life, with the exception of about two years spent in London, when the
                    treasures of the British Museum were thrown open. At Cambridge he had the range
                    of noble libraries. His happiness consisted in study, and he perused with
                    critical attention the Greek and Roman poets, philosophers, historians, and
                    orators. Plato and the <hi rend="italic">Anthologia</hi> he read and annotated
                    with great care, as if for publication. He compiled tables of Greek chronology,
                    added notes to Linnaeus and other naturalists, wrote geographical disquisitions
                    on Strabo, and, besides being familiar with French and Italian literature, was a
                    zealous archaeological student, and profoundly versed in architecture, botany,
                    painting, and music. In all departments of human learning, excepting
                    mathematics, he was a master. But it follows that one so studious, so critical,
                    and so fastidious could not be a voluminous writer. A few poems include all the
                    original compositions of Gray— the quintessence, as it were, of thirty years of
                    ceaseless study and contemplation, irradiated by bright and fitful gleams of
                    inspiration. In 1742 Gray composed his <hi rend="italic">Ode to Spring,</hi> his
                    <hi rend="italic">Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College,</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Ode to Adversity,—</hi> productions which most readers of poetry
                    can repeat from memory. H e commenced a didactic poem, <hi rend="italic">On the
                    Alliance of Education and Government,</hi> but wrote only about a hundred lines.
                    Every reader must regret that this philosophical poem is but a fragment. It is
                    in the style and measure of Dryden, of whom Gray was an ardent admirer and close
                    student. His <hi rend="italic">Elegy written in a Country Churchyard</hi> was
                    completed and published in 1751. In the form of a sixpenny <hi rend="italic"
                    >brochure</hi> it circulated rapidly, four editions being exhausted the first
                    year, and within the same period it also appeared in three magazines—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Magazine of Magazines</hi> for February, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >London Magazine</hi> for March, and the <hi rend="italic">Grand Magazine of
                    Magazines</hi> for April. This popularity surprised the poet. He said
                    sarcastically that it was owing entirely to the subject, and that the public
                    would have received it as well if it had been written in prose. The solemn and
                    affecting nature of the poem, applicable to all ranks and classes, no doubt
                    aided its sale; it required high poetic sensibility and a cultivated taste to
                    appreciate the rapid transitions, the figurative language, and lyrical
                    magnificence of the odes; but the elegy went home to all hearts; while its
                    musical harmony, originality, and pathetic train of sentiment and feeling render
                    it one of the most perfect of English poems. No vicissitudes of taste or fashion
                    have affected its popularity. When the original manuscript of the poem was
                    offered for sale in 1854, it brought the almost incredible sum of £131, The two
                    great odes of Gray, the <hi rend="italic">Progress of Poetry</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Bard,</hi> were published in 1757, and were but coldly
                    received. His name, however, stood high, and, on the death of Cibber the same
                    year, he was offered the laureateship, which he wisely declined. He was
                    ambitious, however, of obtaining the more congenial and dignified appointment of
                    professor of modern history in the university of Cambridge, which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n87/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0087-0078"/> fell vacant in 1762, and, by the advice of his
                    friends, he made application to Lord Bute, but was unsuccessful. Lord Bute had
                    designed it for the tutor of his son-in-law, Sir James Lowther. No one had heard
                    of the tutor, but the Bute influence was all-prevailing. In 1765 Gray took a
                    journey into Scotland, penetrating as far north as Dunkeld and the Pass of
                    Killiecrankie; and his account of his tour, in letters to his friends, is
                    replete with interest and with touches of his peculiar humour and graphic
                    description. One other poem proceeded from his pen. In 1768 the professorship of
                    modern history was again vacant, and the duke of Grafton bestowed it upon Gray.
                    A sum of £400 per annum was thus added to his income; but his health was
                    precarious—he had lost it, he said, just when he began to be easy in his
                    circumstances. The nomination of the duke of Grafton to the office of chancellor
                    of the university enabled Gray to acknowledge the favour conferred on himself.
                    He thought it better that gratitude should sing than expectation, and he
                    honoured his grace’s installation with an ode. Such occasional productions are
                    seldom happy; but Gray preserved his poetic dignity and select beauty of
                    expression. He made the founders of Cambridge, as Mr Hallam has remarked, “pass
                    before our eyes like shadows over a magic glass.” When the ceremony of the
                    installation was over, the poet-professor went on a tour to the lakes of
                    Cumberland and Westmoreland, and few of the beauties of the lake-country, since
                    so famous, escaped his observation. This was to be his last excursion. While at
                    dinner one day in the college-hall he was seized with an attack of gout in his
                    stomach, which resisted all the powers of medicine, and proved fatal in less
                    than a week. He died on the 30th of July 1771, and was buried, according to his
                    own desire, beside the remains of his mother at Stoke Pogis, near Slough in
                    Buckinghamshire, in a beautiful sequestered village churchyard that is supposed
                    to have furnished the scene of his elegy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A claim has been put up for the churchyard of Granchester,
                    about two miles from Cambridge, the great bell of St Mary’s serving for the
                    “curfew.” But Stoke Pogis is more likely to have been the spot, if any
                    individual locality were indicated. The poet often visited the village, his aunt
                    and mother residing there, and his aunt was interred in the churchyard of the
                    place. Gray’s epitaph on his mother is characterized, not only by the tenderness
                    with which he always regarded her memory, but by his style and cast of thought.
                    It runs thus :— “Beside her friend and sister here sleep the remains of Dorothy
                    Gray, widow, the careful tender mother of many children, one of whom alone had
                    the misfortune to survive her. She died March 11, 1753, aged 72.” She had lived
                    to read the <hi rend="italic">Elegy,</hi> which was perhaps an ample recompense
                    for her maternal cares and affection. Mrs Gray’s will commences in a similar
                    touching strain:—“In the name of God, amen. This is the last will and desire of
                    Dorothy Gray to her son Thomas Gray.” They were all in all to each other. The
                    father’s cruelty and neglect, their straitened circumstances, the sacrifices
                    made by the mother to maintain her son at the university, her pride in the
                    talents and conduct of that son, and the increasing gratitude and affection of
                    the latter, nursed in his scholastic and cloistered solitude—these form an
                    affecting but noble record in the history of genius.</p></note></p>
                <p>The literary habits and personal peculiarities of Gray are familiar to us from
                    the numerous representations and allusions of his friends. It is easy to fancy
                    the recluse poet sitting in his college-chambers in the old quadrangle of
                    Pembroke Hall. His windows are ornamented with mignonette and choice flowers in
                    China vases, but outside may be discerned some iron-work intended to be
                    serviceable as a fire-escape, for he has a horror of fire. His furniture is neat
                    and select; his books, rather for use than show, are disposed around him. He has
                    a harpsichord in the room. Ina corner of one of the apartments is a trunk
                    containing his deceased mother’s dresses, carefully folded up and preserved. His
                    fastidiousness, bordering upon effeminacy, is visible in his gait and manner,—in
                    his handsome features and small well-dressed person, especially when he walks
                    abroad and sinks the author and hard student in</p>
                <p>“the gentleman who sometimes writes for his amusement.” He writes always with a
                    crow quill, speaks slowly and sententiously, and shuns the crew of dissonant
                    college revellers who call him “a prig,” and seek to annoy him. Long mornings of
                    study, and nights feverish from ill-health, are spent in those chambers; he is
                    often listless and in low spirits; yet his natural temper is not desponding, and
                    he delights in employment. He has always something to learn or to communicate,
                    some sally of humour or quiet stroke of satire for his friends and
                    correspondents, some note on natural history to enter in his journal, some
                    passage of Plato to unfold and illustrate, some golden thought of classic
                    inspiration to inlay on his page, some bold image to tone down, some verse to
                    retouch and harmonize. His life is on the whole innocent and happy, and a
                    feeling of thankfulness to the Great Giver is breathed over alL</p>
                <p>Various editions of the collected works of Gray have been published. The first,
                    including memoirs of his life and his correspondence, edited by his friend, the
                    Rev. W. Mason, appeared in 1775. It has been often reprinted, ana forms the
                    groundwork of the editions by Mathias (1814) and Mitford (1816). Mr Mitford, in
                    1843, published Gray’s correspondence with the Rev. Norton Nicholls, and in 1854
                    his correspondence with Mason, from which Mason had made only a partial
                    selection in bis memoirs of Gray. A second edition of the correspondence with
                    additional notes was published in 1855.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
