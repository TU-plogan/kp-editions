                    the Channel Islands” in <hi rend="italic">The Geological Magazine,</hi> London,
                    1878, it consists geologically of three very unequal portions, one characterized
                    by a very felspathic syenite and gneiss, another by a hornblendic “granital,”
                    and a third by a micaceous syenite. The felspathic portion yields magnificent
                    crystals of felspar, surpassing those of the porphyritic granites of Cornwall or
                    Cumberland; and the hornblendic portion occasionally affords crystals of black
                    hornblende in similar perfection. No Secondary or Tertiary rocks are found in
                    position, but postTertiary clays containing flints are found all round the
                    island and even on its summit, and Mr Bird is disposed to assign them to the
                    interglacial period of submergence. The soil of Guernsey is generally a light
                    sandy loam, and the subsoil consists for the most part of angular gravel, except
                    in certain places occupied by a curious clay, chiefly composed of a silicate of
                    alumina, which proves destructive to vegetable life. While the island does not
                    grow sufficient grain for its own consumption, it has a large export of fruits
                    and other garden produce. Parsnips were formerly one of the principal items, but
                    they are now less extensively cultivated, having been supplanted by potatoes and
                    turnips. Grapes, which were exported to the amount of 50 tons in 1873, are the
                    source of an increasing trade. Granite is largely shipped at St Sampson.</p>
                <p>For administrative purposes Guernsey is united with Alderney, Sark, Herrn, and
                    the adjacent islands in the bailiwick of Guernsey. The island proper is divided
                    into the ten parishes of St Peter Port, St Sampson, Vale, Câtel, St Saviour, St
                    Andrew, St Martin, Forest, St Peter du Bois, and Torteval. The administration is
                    under the supervision of a lieutenant-governor appointed by the crown; and the
                    parliamentary assembly consists of a bailiff, twelve jurats, a procureur or
                    attorney-general, the beneficed clergy, and twelve delegates elected by the
                    people. Taxation is very light, and the annual revenue amounts to about £10,000.
                    Ecclesiastically the island is a deanery of the Winchester diocese of the Church
                    of England.</p>
                <p>The only town of any great importance is St Peter Port on the eastern coast. In
                    1861 it had a population of 16,388 (6968 males and 9420 females), and in 1871,
                    16,166 (6731 males and 9435 females). The sea frontage of the town extends for
                    about a mile, and is protected in nearly all its length by a wall with an
                    esplanade. On the improvement of the harbour, which was begun in the 13th
                    century by order of King Edward I., a sum of £285,000 has been expended since
                    1854. It is formed by two piers, which enclose an area of 73 acres, the
                    southernmost of the two running out to Castle Cornet and then sending out a
                    breakwater for about 3000 yards. The whole of the works are of the most massive
                    description. Among the principal buildings of the town, which has been greatly
                    improved by the formation of a new street from the harbour up to the hill, are
                    the Government house, the court-house, Elizabeth college, the town hospital, St
                    Stephen’s church built in 1866, the Roman Catholic church designed by Pugin, and
                    the new vegetable market constructed at a cost of £16,000. On the higher ground
                    above the town is a monument in memory of the Queen’s visit to the island in
                    1846, and on the pier there was erected in 1863 a monument to the Prince Consort
                    by Mr Durham, a copy of the monument in the gardens of the Horticultural Society
                    at South Kensington. St Sampson, which is the only port besides St Peter Port,
                    is situated at the eastern end of the Braye du Vai, a depression which at no
                    distant date used to form an arm of the sea at high tides, cutting the island
                    into two unequal parts. The harbour accommodation has been improved at St
                    Sampson contemporaneously with that of St Peter Port. To the south of the latter
                    is the strong fort of St George’s with barracks for 5000 men, and smaller forts,
                    batteries, and martello towers are to be found on suitable points all round the
                    coast.</p>
                <p>By the old Guernsey laws, all the male population from sixteen to sixty are
                    obliged to serve in the militia; but the custom of paying exemption fines has
                    gradually become so common that the real force is very far below its nominal
                    limit. Guernsey is both populous and wealthy, and the wealth is very evenly
                    distributed among the people. In 1873 the assessment value of the town parish
                    was <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n261/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0261-0248"/> £3,564,750, or £2262 per head, and that of the
                    rural parishes £1,831,620, or £1233 per head. Like the neighbouring part of
                    France, Guernsey still possesses numerous traces of its early inhabitants, in
                    the form of sepulchral caves, dolmens, and maenhirs. The most remarkable group
                    of the second class is in the north at Ancresse. Details will be found in Mr
                    Lukis’s paper in vol. i. of the <hi rend="italic">Archaeological Journal,</hi>
                    and in vols. i. and viii. of the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the</hi><hi

                    The island is usually identified with the Sarnia of the latter Roman writers.
                    Its present name would appear to be a corruption of the Norse for Green Isle.
                    For details on its history see <hi rend="smallcaps">Channel Islands.</hi> An
                    account of a number of its more eminent natives, many of whom have served with
                    high distinction in the British army, will be found in <hi rend="italic">Sarnia,
                    or brief Memorials of many of her Sons,</hi> Guernsey, 1862. Among the better
                    known families are the Sau-marezes, the Tuppers, and the Careys.</p>
