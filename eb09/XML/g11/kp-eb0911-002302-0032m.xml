                    (1596-1656), was born at Leyden on the 13th of January 1596, learned painting
                    under several masters at Leyden and Haarlem, married in 1618, and settled at the
                    Hague about 1631. One of the few Dutch painters who failed to captivate English
                    taste, his influence was great on Dutch art; and he was one of the first to
                    emancipate himself from the traditions of minute imitation embodied in the works
                    of Breughel and Savery. Though he preserved the dun scale of tone peculiar to
                    those painters, he studied atmospheric effects in black and white with
                    considerable skill. He formed Solomon Ruysdael and Pieter Potter, forced
                    attention from Rembrandt, and bequeathed some of his precepts to Pieter de
                    Molyn, Coelenbier, Safcleven, Van der Kabel, and even Berghem. His life at the
                    Hague for twenty-five years was very prosperous, and he rose in 1640 to be
                    president of his guild. A friend of Van Dyck and Bartholomew van der Heist, he
                    sat to both these artists for his likenes3. His daughter Margaret married Jan
                    Steen, and he had steady patrons in the stadtholder Frederick Henry, and the
                    chiefs of the municipality of the Hague. He died at the Hague in 1656, possessed
                    of land and houses to the amount of 15,000 florins.</p>
                <p>Between 1610 and 1616 Van Goyen wandered from one school to the other. He was
                    first apprenticed to Isaak Swanenburgh; he then passed through the workshops of
                    De Man, Klok, and De Hoorn. In 1616 he took a decisive step and joined Esaias
                    van der Velde at Harlem; amongst his earlier pictures, some of 1621 (Berlin
                    Museum) and 1623 (Brunswick Gallery) show the influence of Esaias very
                    perceptibly. The landscape is minute. Details of branching and foliage are
                    given, and the figures are important in relation to the distances. After 1625
                    these peculiarities gradually disappear. Atmospheric effect in landscapes of
                    cool tints varying from grey green to pearl or brown and yellow dun is the
                    principal object which Van Goyen holds in view, and he succeeds admirably in
                    light skies with drifting misty cloud, and downs with cottages and scanty
                    shrubbery or stunted trees. Neglecting all detail of foliage he now works in a
                    thin diluted medium, laying on rubbings as of sepia or Indian ink, and finishing
                    without loss of transparence or lucidity. Throwing his foreground into darkness,
                    he casts alternate light and shade upon the more distant planes, and realizes
                    most pleasing views of large expanse. In buildings and water, with shipping near
                    the banks, he sometimes has the strength if not the colour of Albert Cuyp. The
                    defect of his work is chiefly want of solidity. But even this had its charm for
                    Van Goyen’s contemporaries, and some time elapsed before Cuyp, who imitated him,
                    restricted his method of transparent tinting to the foliage of foreground
                    trees.</p>
                <p>Van Goyen’s pictures are comparatively rare in English collections. Unrepresented
                    in the national galleries, he is seen to advantage abroad, and chiefly at the
                    Louvre, and in Berlin, Gotha, Vienna, Munich, and Augsburg. Twentyeight of his
                    works were exhibited together at Vienna in 1873. His panels fell in value during
                    the 17th century, when they fetched prices as low as 10 and seldom as high as
                    100 florins. Now they are worth ten times more than in 1700. Though he visited
                    France once or twice, Van Goyen chiefly confined himself to the scenery of
                    Holland and the Rhine. Nine times from 1633 to 1655 he painted views of
                    Dordrecht. Nimeguen was one of his favourite resorts. But he was also fond of
                    Haarlem and Amsterdam, and he did not neglect Arnheim or Utrecht. One of his
                    largest pieces is a view of the Hague, executed in 1651 for the municipality,
                    and now in the town collection of that city. Most of his panels represent
                    reaches of the Rhine, the Waal, and the Maese. But he sometimes sketched the
                    downs of Scheveningen, or the sea at the mouth of the Rhine and Scheldt; and he
                    liked to depict the calm inshore, and rarely ventured upon seas stirred by more
                    than a curling breeze or the swell of a coming squalL He often painted winter
                    scenes, with ice and skaters and sledges, in the style familiar to Isaac van
                    Ostade. There arc numerous varieties of these subjects in the master’s works
                    from 1621 to 1653. One historical picture has been assigned to Van Goyen—the
                    embarkation of Charles II. in the Bute collection. But this canvas was executed
                    after Van Goyen’s death. When he tried this form of art he properly mistrusted
                    his own powers. But he produced little in partnership with his contemporaries,
                    and we can only except the Watering-place in the gallery of Vienna, where the
                    landscape is enlivened with horses and cattle by Philip Wouvermans. Even Jan
                    Steen, who was his son-in-law, only painted figures for one of his pictures, and
                    it is probable that this piece was completed after Van Goyen’s death. More than
                    250 of Van Goyen’s pictures are known and accessible. Of this number little more
                    than 70 are undated. None exist without the full name or monogram, and yet there
                    is no painter whose hand it is easier to trace without the help of these
                    adjuncts. An etcher, but a poor one, Van Goyen has only bequeathed to us two
                    very rare plates.</p>
