                <p><label type="entry">GUNNERY</label></p>
                <p>IN its early days this science might have been simply defined as the art of
                    determining the motions of projectiles discharged from pieces of ordnance; in
                    its present state it includes also the employment of projectiles specially
                    adapted to the purpose in view, and the manipulation of artillery so as to
                    enable the projectiles to produce the maximum effect.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theory of Gunnery.—</hi> Instruments of great precision,
                    mechanical construction of much accuracy, and a considerable knowledge of the
                    higher mathematics are necessary to obtain and make use of trustworthy data for
                    the establishment of sound principles on which to base the theory of gunnery. It
                    is therefore not surprising that, owing to the early discovery of gunpowder, the
                    art was long practised in a rude manner, without any attempt being made to
                    reduce it to a science. Thus, though firearms appear to have been in use from
                    the early part of the 14th century, little of value was understood of the laws
                    regulating the flight of projectiles till the time of Nicholas Tartaglia, who
                    published a treatise on the subject at Venice in 1537. About sixty years before
                    that date, Leonardo da Vinci had enunciated some of the mathematical principles
                    of trajectories in a manner which shows him to have possessed far more insight
                    than any of his contemporaries; but he did not pursue the inquiry, and Tartaglia
                    may be regarded as the father of ballistics. He was a man of great talent and
                    ingenuity, but unfortunately had no opportunities of observing artillery
                    practice; he was unable, therefore, to bring his calculations and speculations
                    to the test of fact, and failed to carry conviction to the minds of the
                    philosophers of the age. Before his time it had been generally believed that a
                    ball on leaving the bore of a gun proceeded for some distance in a straight
                    path,—a fallacy which lurks in the phrase “point-blank,” not yet expunged from
                    popular speech. He saw, however, that “a piece of artillery cannot shoot one
                    pace in a right line,” and propounded the axiom that “the more swifter a pellet
                    doth flie, the lesse crooked is his range,”—a truth expressed at the present day
                    by the statement that a high velocity gives a flat trajectory. This eminent
                    philosopher claimed the invention of the gunner’s quadrant; he took into account
                    in his calculations the resistance of the air, but placed the angle of elevation
                    at which the maximum range would be obtained at 45°, which would only be the
                    case <hi rend="italic">in vacuo.</hi> Galileo was the next mathematician of note
                    who investigated the subject. In his <hi rend="italic">Dialogues on Motion,</hi>
                    published in 1638, he recognized fully the resistance of the air, and pushed on
                    the inquiry in the direction indicated by Tartaglia. It was not, however, till
                    Newton’s time that a substantial basis was laid down for a true theory of
                    gunnery. The grand discovery of the law of gravitation revealed the hitherto
                    unguessed secret of the projectile’s fall to earth. The great improvements in
                    mathematical methods of analysis invented by him rendered possible solutions of
                    previously impracticable problems; while the splendour of his achievements in
                    natural science stimulated philosophers of all countries. Towards the end of the
                    17th century he investigated the trajectory of a projectile on the supposition
                    that the resistance of the air varied as the first power of the velocity.
                    Bernoulli in 1718 gave a solution of the problem, on the supposition that the
                    resistance varied as any given power of the velocity. This solution was,
                    however, left in such a complicated state that no practical use can be made of
                    it. No further progress was made till Benjamin Robins in 1742 published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Hew Principles of Gunnery,</hi> in which he furnishes a notable
                    example of the manner in which theory should be wedded to practice, and
                    hypothesis to experiment. Had Robins been in the possession of accurate
                    instruments he would probably have arrived at results of considerable
                    correctness. He invented the ballistic pendulum, and was the first to ascertain
                    experimentally with any degree of correctness the velocities of projectiles on
                    leaving a gun. A “triangle” or gyn supported a pendulum of iron having a massive
                    wooden bob; to the bob was fixed a steel ribbon which passed through a steel
                    clamp set to the desired pressure. A bullet fired into the wooden bob caused the
                    pendulum to swing; the length of the arc described was recorded by the steel
                    ribbon; the weight of the bullet and the conditions of oscillation of the
                    pendulum being known, the velocity of the bullet could be calculated from the
                    length of the arc. The weight of Robins’s first pendulum was 56 B), and it was
                    therefore only suited for small arms. It could measure the velocity at only one
                    point each round, and therefore, to ascertain the velocity lost by a ball in
                    passing through the air, it was necessary to fire a series of rounds at one
                    distance, and afterwards a similar series of rounds at another distance,
                    Velocities of 1700 feet per second were measured, and the loss of velocity due
                    to the resistance of the air, up to a distance of 250 feet from the muzzle, was
                    approximately ascertained. Robins discovered that the resistance of the air was
                    greatly increased as soon as the ball travelled faster than sound, and
                    attributed it to the creation of a vacuum behind the shot, into which the air
                    could not rush with speed greater than that of sound. Count Rumford in 1751 made
                    use of the recoil to measure the velocities of bullets, on the principle that
                    the momentum of the bullet forward was equal to the momentum of the gun
                    backward. To carry this out, the gun was suspended as a pendulum, and the length
                    of the arc it described on firing measured. By firing a bullet from a gun thus
                    suspended into the ballistic pendulum, two independent records were obtained,
                    and it would have been easy to calculate the lυs3 of velocity, from the muzzle
                    to any range at which the pendulum could be hit, by the combination. The
                    roughness of the methods unfortunately did not permit completely satisfactory
                    results. Dr Hutton next took up the inquiry, and increased the weight of the
                    pendulum and the bullets. No very great advance, however, seems to have been
                    made till 1840, when experiments on the resistance of the air to the motion of
                    spherical shot were carried on at ^Metz by the French Government. MM. Piobert,
                    Morin, and Didion were the chief experimenters. They raised the weight of the
                    receiving pendulum to nearly 6 tons, and fired into it 50-pound balls at a range
                    of 330 feet. The information now obtained spread over a much wider field than
                    that traversed by Robins. It was even found possible to construct the
                    trajectories of projectiles with some approach to truth, and empirical formulae
                    were laid down by which ranges and times of flight could be approximately
                    calculated. It was not, however, till the introduction of electricity as a means
                    of determining the velocities of projectiles that accurate knowledge of the
                    resistance of the air was obtained. In 1840 Professor Wheatstone invented an
                    instrument for this purpose, called the electromagnetic chronoscope. He has had
                    many successors, whose productions exhibit a great amount of ingenuity; those
                    from which the most valuable results have been obtained, and which are in use at
                    the present moment, are the Bashforth chronograph, the Noble chronoscope, the Le
                    Boulengé chronograph, and the Watkin chronograph.</p>
                <p>The general principle on which these four instruments are designed is that a
                    projectile after leaving the gun shall <pb break="no"

                    breaking an electric current, and causing a record to be made by the instrument
                    at the moment. The Le Boulengé is connected with two wire screens only, the
                    others with several. As two records are necessary to obtain a velocity, reading
                    the time taken by the shot to pass between two screens, the number of points of
                    a shot’s flight at which an instrument is capable of indicating the velocity is
                    one less than the number of screens employed. The chronograph invented by the
                    Rev. F. Bashforth, late professor of mathematics to the Advanced Class of the
                    Royal Artillery, is shown in fig. 1.</p>
                <p>A is a fly-wheal, which, in revolving, carries with it K, a cylinder covered with
                    paper specially prepared to receive the records of the clock and screen. B is a
                    toothed wheel which turns the drum M and unwinds the string CD, thus allowing
                    the platform S to descend slowly down the slide L. E, E' are two electromagnets,
                    whose keepers are supported by the frames <hi rend="italic">d, d'; f,f</hi> are
                    the ends of springs which act against the attraction of the electromagnets.
                    There are two distinct currents—one through the screens and E, the other through
                    the clock and E'. When these are interrupted, one by the shot cutting a screen,
                    or the other by the clock beating seconds, so that the magnetism is destroyed,
                    the spring/or/'carries back its keeper, which, by means of the arm <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> or α', gives a blow to the lever <hi rend="italic">b or
                    b',</hi> causing the marker <hi rend="italic">m</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >m'</hi> to depart from the uniform spiral it has been describing—a spiral
                    consisting of a double line running round the cylinder. The apparatuses adjusted
                    so that the platform L, and consequently the markers <hi rend="italic">rn,
                    m',</hi> descend about ⅜ inch for each revolution of the cylinder; the folds of
                    the spiral are thus I inch apart. The cylinder is made to revolve with
                    considerable rapidity, so that the intervals between the successive clock marks
                    indicating seconds measure from 20 to 25 inches; hence the screen marks
                    indicating the moment of the severance of the wire by the shot can be allotted
                    to their proper value in seconds with great accuracy. The screens are so
                    contrived that the current, interrupted by the passage of the shot through one,
                    is completed again before the next is reached. To accomplish this, the cutting
                    of the wire is made to release a spring which makes a fresh contact; thus any
                    number of screens can be used and a corresponding number of records
                    obtained.</p>
                <p>The chronoscope invented by Captain Noble of Elswick, late Royal Artillery (figs.
                    2, 3, 4), is constructed to furnish eight or more records, according to the
                    number of discs, and is so excellently adapted for the measurement of
                    exceedingly minute portions of time that it is usually employed to ascertain the
                    velocity acquired by the shot in moving from a state of rest inside the gun at
                    different parts of the bore. It is thus intimately connected with gunmaking, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n314/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0314-0299"/> but, having the same character as other velocity
                    instrument's, is described here. The screens used for recording the flight of
                    the shot through the air are now discarded, and the</p>
                <p>“cutting plugs,” shown in figs. 5, 6, 7, are substituted for them. In figs. 5 and
                    6 B is the bore, and A a flat-headed shot or cylinder passing along it in the*
                    direction of the arrow. The plugs are screwed into the sides of the gun, as in
                    fig. 7, which gives an end view of the bore. As</p>
                <p>; the shot passes, its foremost edge pushes up the knife D, cutting the wire <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> which passes in at one side of the plug C, then through a
                    hole in the knife D, and out again at the other side of the plug. The ends of
                    this wire are connected with the main wires leading to the instrument, and the
                    knife D, in cutting it, interrupts the current. Fig. 4 shows a 10-inch gun
                    pierced to receive cutting plugs in eighteen places. The main wires run from a
                    plug to the primary of a Ruhmkorff coil, fig. ∙2, near the instrument, with
                    which the secondary communicates. Figs. 2 and 3 show the instrument in plan and
                    elevation.</p>
                <p>A, A are disks, 36 inches in circumference, fixed on a horizontal shaft S. This
                    shaft is caused to rotate, so that the edge of the disks travel at about 1100
                    inches per second, by a series of toothed wheels F, F, gearing as shown, and
                    worked into rapid motion by the handle C. This motion is kept up with regularity
                    by the descent of the weight B acting on the hindmost shaft, the speed of which
                    is multiplied 200 times at the shaft S. At V is a vernier, reading a graduated
                    circle, which is fixed on the shaft S. The edges of the disks are covered with a
                    coating of lampblack. One of the secondary wires G is brought from the coil, and
                    placed in communication with the revolving disk; the other secondary wire H is
                    fixed in a discharger Y, just clear of the edge of the disk. A stop-clock is
                    placed on a stand D, and records the rate of revolution of one of the shafts.
                    When the gun is fired the shot begins to move, and, as it travels along the
                    bore, cuts the wires of the plugs in succession, breaking the primary currents,
                    and causing sparks to pass in the secondary current from the dischargers Y, Y,
                    to the disks A, A, which are in rapid revolution. The sparks burn off the
                    lampblack and record their positions on the disks by a minute spot. Now if the
                    shot could cut all the plug-wires simultaneously, all the spots on the disks
                    would be in a straight line, but it does not do so, and during the intervals
                    between the cutting of successive plug-wires the disks continue to rotate, so
                    that the line of spots forms a spiral round the cylinder represented by the
                    disks, as is apparent on bringing the machine to rest. The shaft S is then
                    turned so as to place each spot in succession opposite an index, and the spaces
                    travelled by the circumferences of the disks between the spots are read off on
                    the graduated circle. As the circumference of the disks is made to travel at the
                    rate of 1100 inches per second, and the vernier reads to thousandths of an inch,
                    the machine indicates portions of time rather less than a millionth of a second;
                    it is, in fact, practically correct to hundred-thousandths of a second. A
                    millionth is about the same fractiou of a second as a second is of a fortnight.
                    Thus the distance between two successi ze spots gives the actual time occupied
                    by the shot in moving over the portion of the bore between two corresponding
                    successive plugs, and therefore the velocity acquired at some point of this
                    travel. As the <hi rend="italic">increment</hi> of velocity is constantly
                    decreasing after the charge is fairly lighted, the point at which the measured
                    velocity is acquired is very slightly behind the middle of the space between the
                    two plugs. The observations are worked out, accidental errors eliminated, and
                    the results put in the form shown in column 3 of Table I.</p>
                <p>The “crusher gauge” (fig. 8) is so closely associated in its use with the Noble
                    chronoscope that it is convenient· to give a description of it here, though its
                    indications are valuable to the gunmaker rather than to the gunner. In fig. 4
                    are shown three plugs, A, B, and C, driven through the walls of the gun, and
                    terminating flush with the bore. These plugs contain gauges for measuring
                    directly the pressure of the gas on the surface of the bore. They are of the
                    same diameter as the cutting plugs, and can be used in any of the twenty-one
                    holes pierced in the gun. Fig. 8 shows the construction. The bottom of the plug
                    is chambered out, and a steel anvil E is placed at the top of the chamber.
                    Against’ this anvil is pressed a cylinder of pure copper A, carefully tested for
                    quality, which is held in its place by a spring B. A piston C fits accurately
                    the lower part of the chamber, any ingress of gas being prevented by the
                    gas-check D, which is flush with the bore. When the gun is fired the powder-gas
                    presses the piston hard against the copper cylinder A, which yields and becomes
                    shorter, expanding laterally. The plug is then removed from the gun, and the
                    nozzle unscrewed; the cylinder is extracted and measured. Its compression is
                    compared with those given in a table constructed from experiment, and the
                    pressure of the gas per square inch recorded. With the chronoscope the
                    velocities are obtained directly from the time shown by the instrument to have
                    been taken by the shot in passing over the interval between two cutter plugs.
                    From these velocities calculation deduces the pressures required to produce the
                    increments of velocity. These calculated pressures are compared with and
                    confirmed by those obtained directly from the indications of the crusher gauge.

                <p>the combination of the two instruments, when used with a 38-ton gun, firing an
                    800-K&gt; projectile, with 130 lb of 1 ’ 5-inch cubical powder.</p>
                <p>The last velocity is calculated from that taken by a Le Boulengé instrument
                    outside the gun. This chronograph, the invention of an officer of the Belgian
                    artillery, is shown in figs. 9, 10, and its mode of application in fig. 11.</p>
                <p>The shot, after leaving the gun, cuts the wire of the first screen, and
                    subsequently the wire of the second screen. The wire of the first screen conveys
                    a current through an electromagnet A (figs. 9, 10), which then supports a
                    cylindrical rod C. This rod is sheathed with a zinc tube D, which is renewed
                    from time to time as required; several short zinc tubes are slipped on, instead
                    of one long one, if no great variation in the velocities is expected, so as to
                    save material. Directly the first screen is cut, the rod C, which is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">chronometer,</hi> drops. The wire of the second screen conveys
                    a current through another electromagnet B, which supports a much shorter rod F,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">registrar.</hi> The shot, in cutting the second
                    screen, releases this short rod, which falls on a disk 0, setting free a spring
                    Μ. This spring carries a horizontal knife N, which flies forward and nicks the
                    zinc tube covering the long rod. The nick made by the knife, if released while
                    the long rod is still suspended, is the zero point. The currents from both
                    screens pass through a disjunctor by which they can be cut simul taneously. When
                    this is done the long and the short rods fall at the same moment. A certain time
                    is consumed by the short rod in reaching the disk, setting free the spring, and
                    cutting a nick on the zinc. During this time the long rod is falling into a
                    recess in the stand, deep enough to receive its full length. The instrument is
                    so adjusted that the nick thus made is 4 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 435
                    inches above the zero point, corresponding to0∙15sec. This is the disjunctor
                    reading, and requires to be frequently corrected during experiments unless the
                    weather is exceptionally favourable to the electrical conditions. Instead now of
                    using the disjunctor to cut both currents simultaneously, suppose the shot to
                    cut them in succession; then the long rod will be falling for a certain time,
                    while the shot is travelling from one screen to the other, before the short rod
                    is released. The longer the shot takes to travel this distance, the farther the
                    long rod falls, and the higher up on it will be the nick made by the knife. A
                    simple calculation connects the distance fallen through by the rod with the time
                    occupied by the shot in travelling over the distance between the screens, and
                    hence its velocity at the middle point is known. A graduated rule is generally
                    supplied with each instrument, arranged for a certain distance between the
                    screens; from this any velocity obtained can be read off at once.</p>
                <p>The electric chronograph, invented by Captain Watkin, R.A. is shown in figs. 12,
                    13, 14.</p>
                <p>Two brass cylinders A, A revolve on pivots B, B, C, C. Between them, at the top,
                    hangs a brass weight (fig. 13), suspended freely by means of a piece of steel B,
                    which pivots in another piece A let into the base of the weight. Two arms E
                    enter, on falling, two V springs on the bed of the instrument, which catch the
                    weight, A finely-pointed brass wire, CD, enclosed through part of its length in
                    an ebonite tube, passes through the upper end of the weight from side to side;
                    the piece B of the weight is placed between the ends A, C of the lever arms of
                    the holder (fig. 14). The arm CD pivots on the pin F; AB is fixed. K, K is an
                    electromagnet; on its keeper H is fixed a strong spring· G, G. When this spring
                    is placed between the ends B, D of the arms, it forces the opposite end C to <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n316/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0316-0301"/> press against A and to sustain the weight by
                    gripping the piece B (fig. 13) of the weight. In this position the keeper H is
                    at a short distance from the poles of the electromagnet. Directly the current is
                    allowed to circulate, the keeper is attracted down to the magnet, the spring G,
                    G is pulled away, a small spring L presses on the arm CD, the jaw AC flies open
                    and the weight is released. The two cylinders A, A (fig. 12) form part of the
                    circuit of a secondary induction coil. The screens are similar to those employed
                    for the Bashforth chronograph; they are traversed successively by the shot,
                    which momentarily interrupts the primary current, and thus causes an induced
                    current to pass through the cylinders A, A. As these, however, are not in
                    electrical connexion, the current has to pass across through the brass wire of
                    the weight, which is in the act of falling. The cylinders are covered with
                    smoked paper, and the passages of the spark in and out leave minute spots
                    showing the exact position of the weight at the moment: any number of screens
                    may be used, and a duplicate record is obtained in one experiment of the space
                    fallen through by the weight, while the shot is traversing each interval between
                    the screens. As before, a simple calculation connects time and space, and an
                    ingenious scale enables the experimenter to read off the velocities whatever be
                    the distance between the screens.</p>
                <p>In all these instruments slight errors exist, arising from mechanical
                    imperfection, or from irregularity in the electric currents; still, the accuracy
                    arrived at is sufficient for practical purposes, as is well shown by the

                <p>These instruments enable the experimenter to ascertain the velocity of a
                    projectile up to considerable distances from the gun. With rifled ordnance no
                    difficulty is found in hitting screens of moderate size at a range of 2000
                    yards; and, practically, the loss of velocity due to the resistance of the air
                    can be determined for all ranges and all velocities.</p>
                <p>It might be supposed that, having the means of acquiring this knowledge, the
                    artillerist would find little difficulty in solving the grand problem of his
                    art, which may be thus briefly stated :—Given a projectile of known weight and
                    dimensions, starting with a known velocity at a known angle of elevation in a
                    calm atmosphere of approximately known density; to find its range and time of
                    flight, its velocity, direction, and position at any moment,—or, in other words,
                    to construct its trajectory. This state of perfection has, however, not yet been
                    reached; mathematics has hitherto proved unable to furnish complete formulae
                    satisfying the conditions. The resistance of the air to slow movements of, say,
                    10 feet per second seems to vary with the first power of the velocity. Above
                    this the ratio increases, and, as in the case of the wind, is usually reckoned
                    to vary with the square of the velocity; beyond this it increases still farther,
                    till at 1200 feet per second the resistance is found to vary as the cube of the
                    velocity. The ratio of increase after this point is passed is supposed to
                    diminish again; but thoroughly satisfactory data for its determination do not
                    exist. From this it would appear that, as the motion of the shot increases in
                    rapidity, the air finds continually greater difficulty in filling up the space
                    left by the advancing projectile, but that, when once a point is reached where
                    the vacuum in rear is complete, further increase of speed only encounters
                    additional difficulty in displacing the air in front. The difficulty of meeting
                    the conditions by mathematical formulae is very great, since the velocity of the
                    projectile changes continually, and moreover is resisted by air continually
                    varying in density as the shot rises and falls again. It is evident’that the
                    greater the weight of a shot in proportion to the column cf air displaced by it,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to the square of its diameter, the less effect will
                    the resistance of the atmosphere have upon its motion; thus very heavy
                    projectiles moving with very low velocities will be but little retarded by this
                    cause. It is desirable, therefore, before proceeding to explain what has been
                    done towards the complete solution of the problem above stated, to establish the
                    limit, and investigate the trajectory when the resistance of the air is
                    neglected.</p>

                <p>Let the projectile start with velocity <hi rend="italic">v</hi> from the point O
                    (fig. 15) in the direction OM, so that MOX is the angle of elevation. Let OM be

                    distance through which the shot would fall in time ( under the action of gravity
                    only. Complete the parallelogram 0MPN. Then P will be the position of the
                    projectile at the end of the time <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> We have then—</p>

                <p>Since OM <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> bears a constant ratio to MP, the

                <p>In Robins’ experiments in 1742 and subsequent years, it became apparent that up
                    to a certain point the resistance of the air increased with an increasing power
                    of the velocity. Hutton in 1790 placed this point at 1600 f. s., and considered
                    that the ratio decreased after this velocity was passed. He proposed as a
                    formula for the resistance Roc <hi rend="italic">av+lnfi.</hi> General Didion,
                    in 1840, deduced from the experiments at Metz the formula Roc αv <hi

                    on at Gavre in 1861 led Professor Hélie to the conclusion that the resistance of
                    the air at practical velocities was more nearly proportional to the cube of the
                    velocity than to any other working expression. He constructed a formula for the
                    trajectory by empirically modifying the formula given above for the path of a
                    projectile <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> thus—</p>

                    for velocities between 800 f. s. and 1400 f. s. is very fairly accurate, and
                    which furnishes the simplest method yet devised of roughly constructing a range

                <p>The above value of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is given for ogival heads; with
                    hemispherical, pointed, or flat heads a different coefficient of resistance
                    would be required. The ogival is the form which suffers least retardation from
                    the air. The most complete and valuable series of experiments yet carried out is
                    that of Professor Bashforth (1865 to 1870) at Woolwich and Shoeburyness. He
                    found that, velocities and forms being equal and similar, the resistance varies
                    exactly as the square of the diameter of the projectile. He further arrived at
                    the conβlusion that between 900 and 1100 f. s. Roc ⅛ <hi rend="superscript">

                    i</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> These results confirm in great measure those
                    previously obtained, but unfortunately do not lend themselves readily to the
                    construction of mathematical formulae. Bashforth adopted the cubic law as his
                    basis, as it offers the least difficulty in manipulation, and, putting R = cv
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, made the coefficient <hi rend="italic">c a</hi>
                    variable, the values of which he has tabulated. His method consists in building
                    up the arc of the trajectory bit by bit, taking each portion so that a mean
                    value of <hi rend="italic">c</hi> for that portion may be used without important
                    error. The path of the projectile may thus be constructed with almost any
                    desired amount of accuracy, but the process is excessively laborious, and
                    requires the use of a lengthy set of tables which cannot be reproduced here. For
                    a complete knowledge of the subject the reader is referred to Mr Bashforth’s
                    work. Mr Bashforth, however, tabulated the loss of velocity due to the
                    resistance of the air with regard to the time and distance of the shot’s flight,
                    and subsequent experiments carried out by the War Office in 1878- 79 have now
                    confirmed and extended the results he had previously obtained. As most of the
                    problems of modern gunnery can be approximately solved by the use of these
                    tables, we give in Table III. an abstract with explanation.</p>

                <p>The rate of loss of velocity is here inversely recorded for an ogival projectile
                    having a weight in pounds equal to the square of its diameter in inches. Thue a
                    9-pounder shell of 3-inch calibre starting with a velocity of 2500 f. s. would
                    retain a velocity of 400 f. s. at a distance of (26,696-5000=) 21,696 feet after
                    a time of (34’166 - 5’000 = ) 29 Ί66 seconds. As the value of decreases the
                    resistance of the air retards the projectile less; thus if the 3-inch shell
                    weigh 18 lb it will overcome the resistance twice as well as the 9-pounder,
                    since its — =0 ’ 5 instead of l ’ 0.</p>

                <p>We have now to consider what muzzle velocity will cause the projectile to
                    traverse the given distance in the given time. It must move at a mean speed of
                    1315 f. s. Assume the muzzle velocity to be 1600 f. s.; corresponding to this
                    are found 23,607 feet and 32 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 599 seconds.
                    Subtracting from these the reduced range and time, we have 21,119 feet and 3O
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7O7 seconds; if the velocity has been correctly
                    assumed, it is clear that the range and the time of flight should result in the
                    same terminal velocity. In the present instance, opposite 21,119 feet stands
                    1130 f. s., while opposite 30’707 seconds stands 1125 f. s. Thus it appears that
                    the velocity has diminished more rapidly in the time travelled than in the
                    distance travelled. This shows that it is assumed too high. Trying 1584 f. s.,
                    and proceeding as before, each column indicates 1120 f. s., which therefore is
                    the terminal velocity, showing that the projectile has lost 464 f. s. of its
                    speed during flight.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Drift.—</hi> Projectiles fired from rifled guns do not move in
                    a vertical plane, but deviate to the right or to the left according to the
                    direction of their rotation. All nations have adopted the right-handed twist,
                    probably because it happened to be selected first. If the observer stands in
                    rear of the piece and looks at the gun when fired, the projectile rotates in the
                    same direction as the hands of a watch. It then steadily bears away to the
                    right. The reason of this is not very clearly understood; in fact, two rival
                    theories are put forward to account for it. If there were no resistance of the
                    air, the path of the shot would be a parabola, and the axis of an elongated
                    projectile would remain parallel to its original direction. The resistance
                    offered by the air causes the axis to tend to assume a position tangential to
                    the trajectory. On leaving the gun the projectile moves in the direction of its
                    axis, which is also the direction of the axis of the gun. The action of gravity
                    soon causes the path of the shot to make a small angle with the original
                    direction of the axis; that is, the trajectory soon deviates from a straight
                    line; the axis of the projectile is urged by the resistance of the air to
                    accommodate itself to the new path, but as the path is constantly changing, the
                    axis is always too late, since the rotation tends to preserve its parallelism.
                    Thus there is always an angle—depending in amount on the velocities of rotation
                    and translation, weight of shot, and density of the air—between the axis of the
                    shot GB and the trajectory CD (fig. 16). Thus far both theories agree as to the
                    facts, but they differ as to the deductions. The first view is that the
                    resultant resistance of the air, which has the effect of a force in the
                    direction DC, tends to turn the shot about an axis passing through G, and
                    perpendicular to the plane containing BGD, so that if the shot had no rotation,
                    it would turn end over end. But as it has a right-handed twist, this motion is
                    combined with that which the resistance of the air tends to impart to the shot,
                    and the point A is therefore slightly deflected to the right at first.
                    Continuing the action, the axis GA describes a cone about CD, rotating in the
                    same direction as the shot rotates about its own axis. The resultant of the
                    air’s resistance tends to increase the angle BGD, therefore the shot will have a
                    sinuous motion: but as the first deflexion is to the right, and afterwards the
                    point is more to the right than to the left, the deviation will on the whole be
                    to the right. The other view is that, as the axis of the shot is always directed
                    a little above the trajectory, the resistance of the air meets the surface on
                    the under side, on which therefore there is more pressure than on the upper
                    side. The consequence of this is that the friction of the air with the rotating
                    surface is greater below than above, and therefore causes the projectile to roll
                    bodily to the right while travelling forward. The path thus curves away from the
                    vertical plane, and the resistance of the air tends to cause the axis to lose
                    its parallelism with that vertical plane, though it is, as before, too slow in
                    altering its direction to become tangential to the curve described. Crucial
                    experiments to set this point at rest are as yet wanting. The “drift” or
                    “deflexion” is usually corrected in the British service by inclining the tangent
                    sight. The result of this is that as the range increases, the higher the sight
                    is raised, and the farther is the eye-notch to the left of the vertical plane
                    containing the axis of the gun. In the German service the tangent sight is
                    placed vertically in the gun, and the deflexion is allowed for by a graduated
                    sliding leaf in the head. The same arrangement is used in those British guns, as
                    the howitzers, which fire variable charges, as the slope of the tangent sight
                    will accurately suit only one muzzle velocity.</p>
                <p>To ascertain the correct slope, the actual deflexion is determined for each gun
                    on the practice ground at various ranges with a vertical sight; then, in fig.
                    17, AD is the line of sight when the axis of the gun is horizontal. CD is the
                    line of sight with a vertical tangent sight set at the angle of elevation ADC
                    required for the range DF. Since the projectile deflects to the right, it is
                    necessary that the line CD should point to E in order to hit F. This is
                    accomplished by inclining the tangent sight AB, so that BC shall give the
                    requisite allowance. The relation is thus established. By similar triangles, <pb

                    rend="italic">Projectiles.—</hi> The requirements of modern artillery have
                    necessitated many complications in the preparation and use of projectiles, which
                    now vary greatly in their nature and in the purposes for which they are
                    employed. A general description of the several kinds supplied to European armies
                    will be found under <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammunition,</hi> and but few remarks
                    will be required to connect them with the guns for which they are intended.
                    Smooth-bored ordnance use solid round shot and case, common shell, and diaphragm
                    shrapnel shell. Solid shot are used against masonry, wooden shipping, and masses
                    of men. They were at one time fired red hot at shipping. Roughly, the cube of
                    the diameter in inches multiplied by 0 ’ 133 gives the weight of the shot in
                    pounds. Case shot consist of iron balls packed in iron or tin cylindrical cases.
                    They are effective up to about 350 yards against troops, boats, and rigging, and
                    are especially suitable for flanking ditches. Common shell are completely filled
                    with powder, and are burst in flight by time fuzes, or, on striking, by
                    percussion fuzes. They are used against men in masses, buildings, works, and
                    material generally. Diaphragm shrapnel shell contain a small bursting charge and
                    a number of balls. They are fitted with a time fuze which explodes the charge
                    when they near the object, so that the released bullets fly forward. They are
                    very destructive against troops. In addition to the above projectiles,
                    incendiary shells, called carcasses, filled with a violently burning
                    composition, are thrown into villages and amongst shipping. Ground light balls
                    cast among the enemy’s working parties at night disclose their position.
                    Parachute light balls contain a parachute tightly folded up, and a cup of
                    illumining composition; they are fired with a fuze timed to burst in the air,
                    and they then remain suspended for a time, throwing a light down on the enemy’s
                    working parties.</p>
                <p>The great advantage of rifling was long recognized in small arms and sporting
                    pieces before it was extended to ordnance. The first rifled arms threw bullets
                    which, except for certain projections designed to fit the grooves of the barrel,
                    were spherical. These guns surpassed smooth-bores in accuracy, but it was not
                    till the introduction of elongated projectiles that a distinct gain in power was
                    recognized. The gain in accuracy is due in great measure to the superior
                    correctness with which the ball is centred in the bore by the action of the
                    grooves, while the rotation imparted to it annuls or greatly lessens the
                    disturbing effect of the pressure of the air on surface inequalities, or of
                    variations in the position of the centre of gravity. An elongated shot is also
                    enabled to travel point first, or nearly so, and as the resistance of the air
                    depends upon the area of the transverse section, a far greater weight can be
                    given to the long than to the round shot without increasing this resistance.
                    Thus, in addition to greater accuracy, rifling confers a flatter trajectory and
                    greater penetration. The elongated form permits a head of the best shape, an
                    increase in the contents of the shell, and the use of fuzes which explode when
                    the point strikes an object. The projectiles used with rifled guns are case
                    shot, common shell, shrapnel shell, and Palliser shell. The case shot differ
                    little from those made for smooth-bore ordnance. Common shell are generally from
                    2j to 3 calibres in length. They are designed to contain as much powder as
                    possible, consistently with strength of wall to resist the shock of firing.
                    Their effect is almost entirely due to explosion; velocity has little to do with
                    it beyond conferring range and penetration. Common shells are generally fuzed
                    with percussion fuzes. They are effective for breaching, for setting fire to
                    buildings, against troops if not much scattered, and especially against wooden
                    or thinly plated vessels. The introduction of ironclad ships is almost entirely
                    due to the terribly destructive fire of shells. Shrapnel shell are filled with
                    bullets, and have a bursting charge only sufficient to open the case and release
                    the contents, which then fly forward with the velocity possessed by the
                    projectile before breaking up. The bullets and fragments very speedily lose this
                    velocity after separation. It is therefore most important to judge the range
                    correctly and to form an accurate estimate of the practice, so that the result
                    of each round may guide the aiming and timing of the next. When the shrapnel is
                    burst in the air by a time fuze, it is exceedingly difficult to judge its
                    precision by the puff of smoke. The splashes or puffs of dust of the bullets
                    striking the ground should therefore be carefully looked for. When the shrapnel
                    is burst on striking the ground by a percussion fuze, it is much easier to
                    estimate the accuracy of the shooting, and it is common therefore to get the
                    range by firing a round or two with percussion fuzes before setting the time
                    fuzes. If the ground is hard and the distance of the enemy such that the shell
                    strikes at but a small angle of descent, percussion fuzes generally burst the
                    shrapnel better than time-fuzes, which, in their turn, have the advantage at
                    long ranges and over soft ground. For field service time-fuzed shrapnel should
                    be burst at from 50 to 100 yards in front of the object, and about 10 to 15 feet
                    above the ground. The cone of dispersion of the bullets and fragments is
                    considered to be so proportioned that the diameter at any point of the axis is
                    one-third of the distance of that point from the burst or apex. To get
                    satisfactory results from time fuzes it is necessary to have a gun which shoots
                    with great regularity, a fuze composition which burns evenly, and an accurate
                    mode of setting the fuze. Of late years improvements in powder and design of
                    ordnance have rendered the velocities practically uniform. The fuze composition
                    is somewhat liable to deterioration, but is tolerably satisfactory; and a new
                    fuze auger has just been introduced which can be set to any desired degree of
                    accuracy. As the power of shrapnell shell is entirely due to the velocity
                    possessed by the bullets when freed from the envelope, it is of paramount
                    importance in long-range firing that the shell should start with a high velocity
                    and retain as much of it as possible. It is considered that with field guns the
                    velocity of the projectile at the moment of bursting should not fall below 800
                    f. s., otherwise the contents will have a much diminished effect. The bullets
                    themselves should retain a velocity of about 500 f. s. on striking to be
                    thoroughly effective. With the more modern field guns the effective range of
                    shrapnel extends up to about 3000 yards; with heavy guns to 4000 or even 5000
                    yards.</p>
                <p>Palliser shells are made of a mixture of selected brands of iron, and are cast in
                    moulds so constructed that the metal of the head is in contact with iron and
                    that of the body with sand. The head is thus “chilled,” as the rapid carrying
                    off of the heat by the iron mould causes the particles of the metal to dispose
                    themselves rigidly, and confers intense hardness, which property is essential
                    for the penetration of iron plates. The head is of the ogival shape, that being
                    found most effective in combining strength with sharpness (fig. 18). It is a
                    moot point whether projectiles of hardened steel are more effective than those
                    of chilled iron against armour. Probably the steel can get through a <pb

                    fragments of the Palliser after perforation is more serious. The cost of the
                    steel shell is about five times that of the iron ones. The bodies are cast in
                    sand, because extreme hardness is not there required, and a sounder casting is
                    thus obtained. No fuzes are used with these shells; they are burst by the shock
                    of impact on armour which explodes the powder charge. It is doubtful if they
                    would explode on striking iron vessels not armour-plated, and they would fail to
                    burst on striking wooden ships. They are effective in destroying masonry, and
                    have been driven through great thicknesses of stone. They hold about a quarter
                    as much powder as common shell of the same diameter. The greatest penetration of
                    armour yet known was obtained by the 80-ton gun at Shoeburyness in 1877. The
                    target consisted of four 8-inch wrought-iron plates, sandwiched with three
                    5-inch layers of teak, the whole put together with immense strength. The
                    projectile perforated three plates and the teak, digging its nose about half-way
                    into the last plate, which was much cracked and bulged. The 100-ton gun has
                    perforated with ease 22 inches of solid wrought iron plate strongly backed, but
                    failed to drive a hole through a similar target when the plate was of steel.
                    Very recently extraordinary penetration has been obtained by a 6-inch 70-pounder
                    made by Sir W. G. Armstrong &amp; Co. Fired with a velocity of nearly 2000 f.
                    s., this small projectile pierced about 11 inches of wrought iron. The subject
                    of penetration is treated under <hi rend="smallcaps">Gunmaking.</hi></p>
                <p>A description of some of the fuzes and firing tubes used in gunnery will be found
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammunition.</hi> The general principle guiding the
                    selection of time or percussion fuzes is that when a shell is required to burst
                    in the air a time fuze is employed, when on striking an object a percussion fuze
                    is chosen. In muzzle-loading guns (not using gaschecks), time fuzes are ignited
                    by the flash of discharge; otherwise the shock is taken advantage of to light
                    the composition by exploding a detonator. Percussion fuzes are sometimes found
                    to act too rapidly; where it is desired that penetration to a certain depth in
                    earth or other material shall take place before explosion, it is found necessary
                    to <hi rend="italic">slow</hi> the fuze by interposing a small column of
                    composition, burning for, say, a quarter of a second, between the detonator and
                    the bursting charge. In firing a heavy shell with high velocity at a weak
                    vessel, the resistance of the side is so slight that it may happen that the fuse
                    either fails to act (the shell not being sufficiently retarded to set it in
                    action), or explodes the shell after it has passed through both sides. To meet
                    this case a specially sensitive and rapidly-acting fuze has been devised.</p>
                <p>Guns were formerly primed with loose powder and fired by a match, next by common
                    quill tubes filled with composition and ignited by a portfire, then by
                    detonating tubes exploded by a hammer. Now friction tubes have superseded these
                    methods for ordinary service. When it is desired to fire a gun from a distance,
                    or to fire a number of guns absolutely at the same moment, Abel’s electric tubes
                    are employed. In them two fine copper wires pass down through the head,
                    insulated by gutta percha, except at the ends, which are separated by <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th of an inch of a composition of subphosphide and
                    subsulphide of copper with chlorate of potash. The other ends of the wires are
                    in contact with the copper lining of two holes in the head. The wires from the
                    battery are placed in these holes; when the curtent passes, the composition is
                    heated to ignition and explodes the tube.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Service of Ordnance.—</hi> The general principles guiding the
                    employment and manipulation of artillery are applicable to the schemes of
                    warfare of all civilized nations. Slight differences exist in calibres and
                    weights; but it may be taken that the considerations which regulate the service
                    of English guns have the same force elsewhere. The details of manufacture, the
                    systems of loading, and the methods of rifling, are the chief points regarding
                    which artillerists differ; these matters are treated under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gunmaking.</hi> Of two pieces constructed with equal skill to perform the same
                    kind of work, the heavier will always be the more powerful. Thus weight is the
                    chief controlling element in the employment of guns, though cost and convenience
                    of manipulation have often to be taken into account. The artillery of the
                    present day is the outcome of a long series of improvements, and the whole
                    system of this important arm bears traces of frequent modification and continual
                    compromise. The first introduction of firearms appears to have taken place in
                    England in the reign of Edward III. On the Continent it was probably somewhat
                    earlier, but the actual date and the circumstances attending their introduction
                    are involved in obscurity. It is said that cannon were used in the English
                    expedition against Scotland in 1327, and at the battle of Crécy in 1346. In 1360
                    there were four copper guns in the Tower. For about two centuries cannon
                    continued to be manufactured of copper, brass, or bronze, good castings of which
                    were made long before the art of smelting iron ores was perfected. In the early
                    part of the 16th century guns were sometimes made of wrought iron plates put
                    together longitudinally and hooped with wrought iron. In 1545 cast iron ordnance
                    were manufactured in England, and supplanted pieces of all other materials for a
                    time. The growing needs of warfare, however, soon demanded guns possessed of
                    fair mobility to accompany armies in the field, and the cast iron pieces used
                    being found excessively cumbrous, bronze was once again resorted to for field
                    artillery. From about the middle of the 17th century till the introduction of
                    rifled cannon, all the heavier natures of ordnance—fortress, siege, and ship
                    guns—were made of cast iron; and all the lighter—field and boat guns—of bronze.
                    In 1717 the bronze foundry was established at Woolwich, and most of the
                    smooth-bored field pieces, howitzers, and mortars used in the service were made
                    there. The heavy cast iron guns were supplied by contractors, and proved by
                    Government officials. The long peace which succeeded the Napoleonic wars was
                    highly unfavourable to the progress of gunnery, but a great development took
                    place in the arts and sciences, so that, on the breaking out of the Crimean War,
                    the latest discoveries in metallurgy and the excellence attained in machinery at
                    once enabled inventors to make a great advance in artillery. At the transition
                    period, a few wrought iron smooth-bores, throwing spherical shot of 150 and 100
                    B⅛, were manufactured to overcome the resistance of iron plates then recently
                    introduced for armouring ships. These pieces were speedily discarded for rifled
                    guns; and practically it may be said that the adoption of steel and wrought iron
                    for guns coincided with the change from smooth-bores to rifles, both steps of
                    progress being thoroughly established about 1860. In spite of the great
                    superiority of the new ordnance, it cannot be said that the old pieces are yet
                    superseded; vast numbers of them exist over all parts of the world, and often
                    form the only defence. Even the fortifications in England are still largely
                    armed with them on land fronts; and though they are gradually disappearing, they
                    yet claim notice. Bronze guns are now obsolete in the British service. Figs. 19
                    to 24 show typical kinds of cast iron ordnance. Those denominated acccording to
                    the weight of their projectile are made strong enough to fire solid shot or
                    shell; those called by the diameter of the bore fire shell only. It must be
                    remembered that, with spherical projectiles, the solid must be heavier than the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n321/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0321-0306"/> hollow kinds, which need not be the case with
                    rifled ordnance, as the projectile may be of any length. The guns are used for
                    direct fire, the howitzers for curved fire, the mortars for vertical fire, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> they are set at 45° elevation, and the requisite range
                    attained by varying the charge of powder, instead of firing at various degrees
                    of elevation, as with guns and howitzers.</p>
                <p>The old field smoothbores were fairly effective up to 1000 or 1200 yards, and so
                    established a great superiority over the smooth-bored musket; but as soon as the
                    rifled musket was generally adopted, an advance in artillery power became
                    necessary if the arm was to retain its position in the scale of efficiency.
                    After the Crimean War Napoleon III. rifled his bronze field guns on Treuille de
                    Beaulieu’s system, and the new pieces exhibited great merit at Magenta and
                    Solferino in 1859. England, and indeed every</p>
                <p>European power, was busily engaged in experimenting during this period. The early
                    Armstrong guns in England, Broadwell’s and Krupp’s in Prussia, and imitations of
                    the French plan in other countries, speedily caused field artillery to regain
                    its place in war. The northern kingdoms of Denmark and Norway and Sweden,
                    favoured by specially good iron ores, and free from the immediate alarm of war,
                    retained cast iron as the material for light ordnance. Prussia had already begun
                    to use steel for smooth-bores, and naturally adhered to it for rifled guns,
                    while the coil system brought forward by Armstrong was found cheap and enduring
                    in England. The new Prussian guns were breechloaders, constructed on the
                    double-wedge system; they proved unsatisfactory, and since the Franco-Prussian
                    war of 1870-71 have been abandoned in favour of a single-wedge system of great
                    neatness and efficiency. The Armstrong guns were also breech loaders, and when
                    tested by land and sea, on actual service in China, New Zealand, and Japan,
                    proved to be very powerful when compared with the old smooth-bores, but also
                    exhibited many defects of construction. At this time no thoroughly successful
                    breech-loader had been invented, and England reverted to muzzle-loading, while
                    the Continental powers for the most part endeavoured to improve their methods of
                    breech-loading. In 1872 the British wrought iron and steel muzzle-loading
                    flpounder of 8 cwt. had been introduced into the service, and the 16-pounder of
                    12 cwt., of similar construction, was being brought forward. Against these guns
                    the Prussian 6-cwt. field breech-loader had no chance. Its lightness was almost
                    its only merit. Throwing common shell with percussion fuzes (which were useless
                    on soft ground), having but a poor muzzle velocity, and suffering much from
                    retardation by the air, its effect was feeble compared with that of the British
                    9-pounders, which threw with 200 f. s. more velocity a time-fuzed shrapnel of
                    excellent construction, while the 16-pounder, though not equally fortunate with
                    the 9-pounder in the arrangement of its projectile, yet by sheer power and
                    weight of metal surpassed in deadly effect every field gun in existence.
                    England’s field artillery was undoubtedly the most powerful known at that
                    period. No one was more alive to this fact, or more dissatisfied with it, than
                    the Germans. Their great gunmaker, Krupp, forthwith improved his breech-closing
                    fittings, and instituted series upon series of experiments till he produced two
                    guns —one for horse artillery, and one for field batteries, also horsed—which
                    were an enormous advance on the weapons previously employed against the French.
                    The lighter gun weighs 7 cwt,, and throws a shell of 11 B) weight, with a muzzle
                    velocity of 1525 f. s.; the heavier weighs 9 cwt., and throws a shell of 17
                    ft&gt; weight, with a muzzle velocity of 1460 f. s. These are figures indicating
                    power not to be attained by the English 8-cwt. gun, or even the newer pattern of
                    6 cwt. throwing a 9 tt&gt; shell with a muzzle velocity of 1380 f. s., and the
                    12-cwt. gun, throwing a 16 5) shell with a muzzle velocity of 1360 f. s, The
                    immediate consequence of the introduction of these improved German pieces was
                    the instituting of a series of experiments in England which resulted in the
                    production of a muzzle-loading field gun, weighting 8 cwt., and throwing a 13-Bb
                    projectile with a muzzle velocity of 1560 f. s. Shrapnel shell from this gun
                    will retain velocity over 800 f. s. (the speed below which they cease to possess
                    high efficiency) up to 3500 yards range. In this new gun advantage is taken of
                    all the latest improvements, such as an enlarged powder chamber, increased
                    length of bore, polygroove rifling, rotation by gascheck, and powder specially
                    adapted to the piece. Although the introduction of this field gun once more
                    places English light-artillery in the van, further progress is near. Sir W.</p>

                <p>G. Armstrong &lt;⅛ Co. are now (1879) experimenting with field guns, both muzzle
                    and breech-loading, yielding velocities of 2000 f. s., and no doubt a fresh
                    development of the new principles of air-spacing and chambering (already
                    initiated in the Royal Gun Factories) is at hand (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gunmaking).</hi> never earned adoption. Subsequently the breech-loaders have
                    been gradually ousted by 25-pounder, 40-pounder, and 64- pounder muzzle-loaders,
                    with 8-inch, 6 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6-inch, and 6∙3-inch howitzers,
                    new patterns of which latter pieces have just passed their early trials. The
                    64-pounders were introduced in 1864. For naval purposes the calibre was chosen
                    so that</p>
                <p>32-pounder round shot could be fired from it on emergency. The 40-pounders are
                    stronger, and fire much heavier charges than their breech-loading congeners. The
                    25-pounder was introduced in 1874 to supersede the 20-pounder breechloader for
                    light siege trains, and as a gun of position. Ever since 1853 experiments have
                    been carried out by the Eng lish and other nations for the improvement of
                    mortars and howitzers, first in a smooth-bored and then in a rifled state. These
                    experiments are still in progress, and it cannot be said that the art of
                    throwing heavy shell at high angles has as yet arrived at perfection. In 1872
                    short pieces throwing shells of 180 lb and 64 lb were adopted,</p>
                <p>The history of the progress of siege guns would be in a great measure a
                    repetition of that of the field artillery. Briefly, the smooth-bored siege train
                    of cast-iron 18-pounders and 8-inch howitzers was replaced in 1859-63 by one
                    composed of 20-pounders, 40-pounders (figs. 25-28), and 7-inch rifled
                    breech-loading pieces, with certain howitzers which but recently longer and more
                    powerful shell-guns have been tried, throwing heavier projectiles with greater
                    accuracy. In these new pieces polygroove rifling with gas-check rotation affords
                    a hope that the necessary precision may be attained.</p>
                <p>The “converted guns” must not be passed over, since they are largely employed to
                    arm our land fronts and to provide cheap and efficient pieces for practice by
                    the reserve forces. When first elongated rifled projectiles were introduced, a
                    great many methods of strengthening the old cast iron ordnance were proposed.
                    The most satisfactory was that put forward by Palliser, and consisted of lining
                    bored-out cast iron shells with wrought iron tubes. Some of the smaller
                    men-of-war carry these pieces, but the great majority are used only for the
                    secondary purposes above mentioned. The 32-pounders of 58 cwt., and the 8-inch
                    shell-guns of 65 cwt., have thus become 64-pounders, and the 68-pounder of 95
                    cwt. has become an 80-pounder.</p>
                <p>Important as are the land-service pieces of the army to England, yet, viewing her
                    naval supremacy as one of the chief sources of her greatness, we must consider
                    heavy ship and coast-defence ordnance to take the first place in modern gunnery.
                    The contest between guns and armour has now continued with scarcely any
                    intermission for upwards of twenty years, during which time the armour has
                    increased in thickness from 4 to 24 inches, and the guns from 68- pounders to
                    2000-pounders; that is, from the most powerful of the old cast-iron smooth-bores
                    to the 100-ton gun. The first armour-piercing rifled guns were the 7-inch
                    Armstrong breech-loaders, but their supremacy was of short duration. They were
                    the heaviest made on that system, and were speedily succeeded by far more
                    powerful muzzle-loaders. In 1867 8-inch and 9-inch guns had already been
                    introduced. The 9-inch Woolwich rifled gun of 12 tons was tried in competition
                    with the xv-inch American smooth-bore, which weighed nearly half as much again,
                    against armour. The British piece gained a decisive victory. In 1868 it was
                    decided to introduce a 10-inch gun of the same character. Since that time
                    progress has been continual, and the latest productions of the three great
                    gunproducing establishments of the world are the 71-ton steel breech-loader,
                    recently tested, of the German maker (Krupp), the 80-ton muzzle-loader of
                    Woolwich, and the 100-ton muzzle-loader of the Elswick firm (Sir W. G. Armstrong
                    &amp; Co.).</p>
                <p>Tables IV. and V. show all the principal rifled guns in the land and sea services
                    of Great Britain. It has always been an object with the authorities to
                    assimilate the guns of the two services as far as their respective requirements
                    will permit, and so to avoid multiplication of stores at the numerous home and
                    foreign stations where supplies are made; but still it will be observed that
                    considerable differences<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n323/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0323-0308"/> exist, and, judging from the progress of events,
                    it appears likely that these differences will increase, because, as the science
                    of gunnery becomes developed, each new kind of gun is more exactly fitted to the
                    performance of the special work for which it is intended, and therefore less
                    suitable for other purposes.</p>

                    mounted round our coasts in casemates and barbette batteries. Their function is
                    to protect the British shores from the attack of ironclad ships, wooden vessels,
                    and boats. They are accordingly provided with Palliser projectiles, common
                    shells, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n324/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0324-0309"/> a small proportion of shrapnel shell. In order to
                    strike vessels steaming past at high speed, great accuracy, combined with
                    rapidity of fire, is requisite. The guns are aimed either by eye or map,
                    according to the nature of the coast. In the former case, the detachment
                    commander estimates the range, gives the necessary elevation by means of the
                    tangent sight, directs the line of fire according to his judgment, jumps down
                    and gives the word to fire—allowing for the vessel’s motion and the time of the
                    projectile’s flight. The map system has been recently perfected by Captain
                    Watkin, R.A.</p>
                <p>In it the whole navigable front commanded by the battery is plotted down in small
                    squares numbered and lettered. Tables of the distances of the centres of these
                    squares, the degree of training on the traversing arc required to lay the gun on
                    the desired square, together with the actual elevation necessary to deposit the
                    shot in that square, are constructed for each group of guns.</p>
                <p>In fig. 31 F is a fort defending the channel; ABFC the line of shore; O the
                    object to be hit, a vessel passing. A, B, and C are stations of observation. In
                    a convenient spot the commanding officer of the artillery in the fort places the
                    map, over which play two arms A'O', CO' kept constantly parallel to the two
                    lines of sight AO, CO, by means of mechanism actuated by currents of electricity
                    transmitted by a cable connecting A and A', C and O'. As A'C' represents, on the
                    scale of the map, the distance AC, the junction O' represents on the same scale
                    the position and distance of the object O. Tell-tales are distributed in the
                    casemates, which constantly exhibit the number of the square over which the
                    vessel is passing, showing the position of the ship, so that when the gun, or
                    group of guns, are loaded, they can be either laid in the ordinary way, taking
                    the range from the tables, or, if the object is invisible from the casemate, by
                    trailing the gun round till the number of degrees indicated by the tell-tale
                    agrees with the reading on the traversing arc, and giving elevation to suit the
                    range. The arcs showing the direction of the guns are so arranged that guns
                    trailed to any given number of degrees are parallel with each other. Supposing
                    that from smoke or other cause the object cannot be distinguished from C, an
                    observer is placed at B, and the arm is shifted from C' to B'. The practical
                    working of the system is as follows. The commanding officer watches the course
                    of a vessel as indicated to him by the arms on the map, the observers at A and C
                    constantly following the centre of the object with their glasses. He telegraphs
                    to the battery orders to load and lay, in accordance with the instructions given
                    for each square of the map, and transmitted to the tell-tales. As the vessel
                    passes over the square for which the guns are laid, the commanding officer can
                    fire electrically the group of guns by pressing a key with his finger, or he may
                    direct each detachment to keep up independent practice, laying in accordance
                    with the indications sent by him through the tell-tale. The arrangements for
                    exploding submarine mines or fixed torpedoes, where hostile vessels are passing
                    close to them, are somewhat of the same character as those above described.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">land-front guns</hi> of fortresses shown in the table
                    are intended to overpower and quell the fire of any pieces λvhich can be brought
                    against them by a besieger. They are very largely supplemented in most fortified
                    places by a number of the old smooth-bored guns and carronades, which are well
                    adapted for the use of case shot at close quarters, for sweeping the glacis, and
                    for the defence of ditches. The rifled guns throw common shell into the siege
                    works, and where possible among the enemy’s material. They harass his working
                    parties and reliefs with shrapnel, and endeavour to cut down his parapets and
                    dismount his artillery by direct fire.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Siege-train guns</hi> accompany an army on a campaign where
                    great mobility is not required, and where it is necessary to reduce fortified
                    places. They should be the most powerful pieces which the means of transport
                    will permit. In the more civilized parts of the world, where roads and cl imate
                    are favourable, it is generally considered that about 70 cwt. is the heaviest w
                    eight of piece that can be carried with an army. In less favourable countries it
                    is frequently impossible to transport more than half that weight. The early
                    rifled siege-train guns were grouped into two classes. A unit of the heavy train

                <p>Lately 8 ’ 0" howitzers of 70 cwt. and 6 ’ 6" howitzers of 35 cwt. have been
                    introduced, but their allotment has not yet been settled. Siege guns are
                    supplied with special shell, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n325/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0325-0310"/> somewhat similar to Palliser projectiles, for
                    penetrating masonry; also with common and shrapnel shell. The howitzers rarely
                    use shrapnel shell. On first attacking a fortress at a long range, the duty of
                    the guns is to cut down the defender’s parapets, dismount his artillery,
                    dismantle his ramparts, and subdue his fire, so as to facilitate the con
                    struction of batteries nearer the place. In the meanwhile the howitzers lob
                    heavy shell into his works, and bombard the town, if necessary. As soon as
                    practicable, breaching batteries are thrown up in such spots as may be found
                    suitable for the attack of a weak point. It is rarely possible to breach by
                    direct fire in the case of works of modern design. Here it is that curved fire
                    is so effective, and here it is that the accuracy of rifled howitzers becomes so
                    necessary. In order to make a practicable breach up which an assault can be
                    delivered, the masonry at B (fig. 34), must be cut away, and owing to the height
                    of the cover at A the fire must be curved to reach a point sufficiently low.
                    Direct fire— <hi rend="italic">tir à plein fouet,</hi> as the French express
                    it—would strike too high up. Sometimes a work is so constructed that it is
                    necessary to strike a point half-way down the masonry revetment to form a
                    practicable breach. As it is desirable to strike with as much force as possible
                    in breaching, it is evident that where the profile of the work requires the
                    angle of descent of the shell to be considerable, it is necessary to select a
                    spot for the battery at the longest range compatible with accuracy. For, given a
                    certain angle of descent, the longer the trajectory <hi rend="italic"
                    >{caet.</hi><hi rend="italic">par.)</hi> terminating in that angle, the greater
                    will be the remaining velocity. Sometimes the guns of the siege train are
                    employed with an army in the field to hold certain valuable ground against
                    attack. They are then called guns of position, and are so placed as to command
                    the approaches most effectively, and yet, if possible, to be dragged away at the
                    last moment in case of retreat. They will usually fire shrapnel shell when thus
                    employed.</p>
                <p>4. The all-important qualities of <hi rend="italic">field guns</hi> (figs. 35,
                    36, 37) are mobility and shrapnel-throwing power. They must be able to make long
                    marches rapidly, to change position with celerity, to crush troops and the
                    enemy’s artillery with accurate, well-sustained fire at high velocities, and to
                    support rough usage without detriment to their efficiency. They are supplied
                    with shrapnel and common shell, and case shot, of which shrapnel form by far the
                    largest proportion.</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">'mountain-train guns</hi> are both 7-pounders; they fire
                    the same shell, but the heavier one uses a 12-oz. cartridge, while 6 ounces is
                    as much as can be fired from the lighter one. Both guns are intended for mule
                    transport, one mule taking the gun, another the carriage, and a third the
                    wheels, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.;</hi> but at the Cape of Good Hope the heavier
                    7-pounder is mounted on a light high field-carriage for transport as well as for
                    firing, while in Ashantee the lighter 7-pounders were dragged on a kind of
                    sleigh. The lighter gun is tolerably effective for nearly a mile, and the
                    heavier for about a mile and a half. Some jointed guns, proposed by an artillery
                    officer, are now under trial. They are composed of two pieces screwed together,
                    and, being carried separately, form a gun of about twice the weight of the
                    ordinary mountain gun. Great increase of power is expected from this method of
                    construction. Mountain guns are principally employed to throw time-fuzed
                    shrapnel at troops, and percussion-fuzed common shell into hill works and woods
                    occupied by the enemy.</p>
                <p>In Table V. the principal sea-service rifled guns are shown. Three kind3 of work
                    are performed by them, viz., to pierce ironclads and armoured forts, to attack
                    unarmoured vessels, and to keep up a fire on troops on shore or on approaching
                    boats. The heavy armour-piercing guns are well provided with common shell, as
                    well as with chilled projectiles, so as to perform the first and second duties,
                    but they have a very small proportion of shrapnel shell, which is intended to be
                    used by them against troops or boats only on emergency. The 7-inch and
                    64-pounder guns are supposed to be quite sufficient in ordinary cases for the
                    second and third duties, assisted in the third case by the smaller boat guns.
                    All these are well furnished with common shell and shrapnel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gun Carriages.—</hi> The development which has taken place of
                    late years in the power of artillery has necessitated corresponding changes in
                    gun carriages. Formerly, every carriage was capable of travelling to some
                    extent; even the heaviest guns were mounted on carriages fitted with trucks,
                    which permitted motion on the ramparts or about a deck. Later on, sloping
                    traversing platforms were introduced, up which the gun carriage recoiled on
                    firing. Extra means of checking recoil became necessary as the power of the guns
                    grew; compressors, or friction plates, were introduced, and are now only
                    partially superseded by the hydraulic buffer. Mobility of carriage has almost
                    entirely been given up, except for field and mountain artillery. The heavier
                    siege guns travel on platform waggons, not on their firing carriages; and it is
                    possible that the traversing platform and slide principle will extend yet
                    further.</p>
                <p>Tables IV. and V. show how the various pieces in the British service are mounted.
                    Differences of detail exist, but the general system is the same for all European
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n326/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0326-0311"/> countries. Wrought iron is rapidly supplanting
                    wood in the construction of carriages, and there are signs that it will in its
                    turn be in great measure superseded by a mild steel. The subject of gun
                    carriages is too long and too complicated to be treated in detail here, but, as
                    guns are of no use without carriages from which to fire them, it is necessary to
                    give some idea of the chief modes of mounting modern artillery. Figs. 38, 39
                    show the details of the 9-pounder rifled muzzle-loader carriage. It consists of
                    three parts, the wheels, the axle, and the trail. The wheels have oaken spokes
                    and ash felloes, the tire is of wrought iron, the nave and pipe box (which holds
                    the end of the axletree arm) of a mixture of copper, tin, and zinc. The dish is
                    considerable, amounting to 2 inches in the 5-foot wheel. There is little strut,
                    so that the lowest spoke is nearly vertical, and the tire forms a frustum of a
                    cone, instead of being a cylinder. The object of this form is to obtain lateral
                    strength, especially in travelling on uneven ground. The axletree bed is of
                    wrought iron, constituting, with the axle, a beam of box-girder section, the
                    axletree forming the bottom. The trail consists of two side brackets, fixed by
                    two transoms, two bolts, and the trail piece carrying the trail eye. The
                    brackets are made of plate iron, riveted to a frame of angle iron. The axle
                    carries two seats for gunners; into the trail are fitted the elevating screw and
                    wheel, and the drag shoe with chain hangs below. Fig. 38 shows the gun and
                    carriage in the firing position; when it is desired to move it to any distance
                    exceeding a few yards, the point of the trail is raised, the limber is brought
                    up, the trail eye is passed over the limber hook and keyed fast. The gun
                    carriage and limber then form a four-wheeled vehicle, and travel as such. Figs.
                    40, 41 show the limber, which consists of wheels and axletree similar to those
                    of the gun carriage, ammunition boxes, platform, and a pair of shafts. In the
                    British service each gun carriage and limber are drawn by three or four pairs of
                    horses, according to the nature of the piece. The driver of each pair mounts the
                    near horse; the off wheel horse is between the shafts. In some countries pole
                    draught is preferred.</p>

                    of stone. The level of the traversing platform rises towards the rear, so as to
                    assist in absorbing the work of recoil on firing, and to facilitate running
                    forward again after loading. The recoil is also checked either by a system of
                    friction plates, called a compressor,. or by an hydraulic buffer, placed
                    parallel to and between the sides of the traversing platform, so that the
                    carriage on recoil forces a piston into a cylinder containing oil, which
                    escapes, through holes cut through the piston held, into the space round the
                    piston rod; the size of the holes and the amount of the oil regulate the
                    resistance offered to recoil, and enable the gunner to stop the piece at the
                    proper place.</p>
                <p>Several kinds of carriages on the “disappearing” principle have from time to time
                    been put forward. In these the gun is exposed to the fire of the enemy only
                    while being aimed and discharged; loading is performed under cover. The
                    Moncrieff carriages are the most successful of this class. In them the force of
                    recoil is stored up and employed to raise the gun from the loading to the firing
                    position. Colonel Moncrieff applies his principle in two ways: the recoil either
                    raises a counter-weight or forces a piston into a cylinder, compressing, by the
                    aid of a fluid, air already much compressed. The counter-weight carriages are
                    used to some extent in coast defence, and the hydro-pneumatic carriages are
                    under trial for siege-train guns. Plate V. gives the details of the former. On a
                    level traversing platform rolls a carriage or “elevator,” which places the gun
                    in the required position either for loading or firing. The end of the elevator
                    opposite to that which carries the gun is weighted, so that the recoil causes
                    the elevator to roll to the rear and the gun to descend, at the same time
                    raising the weight, which is retained in the upward position till released after
                    loading, when its descent again raises the gun. Thus the elevator is a lever of
                    the first order working on a shifting fulcrum, the curve (an involute) of the
                    rolling surface being so adjusted that the resistance of the weight gradually
                    increases as the gun recoils, and finally stops it smoothly and without
                    violence. Conversely, by this form the gun is raised to the firing position
                    gradually and without being jolted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hydraulic Gear for Guns.—</hi> As soon as the weights of
                    ordnance increased so greatly that their service exceeded the power of manual
                    labour, it became necessary to find some substitute. Steam power is always at
                    hand in steam vessels, and it was quickly seen that it was best applied through
                    the medium of water pressure. The simplicity and compactness of hydraulic
                    machinery, the circumstance of its direct action rendering toothed gear
                    unnecessary, and the perfect control it gives over the motion of heavy weights,
                    especially adapt it for the purpose.</p>
                <p>Plate VI. represents the mode in which the system is applied to the working of
                    the 80-ton guns on board H.M.S. “Inflexible.” A circular turret contains two
                    guns placed side by side, and strictly parallel as to line. The hydraulic
                    pressure is conveyed through the trunk A by pipes to the presses in the turret.
                    At B is a press for elevating the gun; this press also absorbs the force
                    vertically given off during recoil on the elevating beam C. D is the gun-slide
                    which carries the recoil press G for checking the recoil. This press is supplied
                    with a tank T, up into which the water from the press G must escape through
                    valves V loaded to the required pressure by springs. Έ is the gun run forward in
                    the firing position; its trunnion S is fixed to the end of a piston rod, the
                    head of which enters the press G; when the gun E is fired it recoils into the
                    position F, shown by the dotted outline. The trunnion S forces the piston home
                    into the cylinder G, driving the water up into the tank; the trunnion fittings
                    run along the gun-slide horizontally, and the attachment or saddle below the gun
                    runs up the elevating beam C, which is pivoted at the fixed point T, so as to
                    depress the muzzle outside the port P of the turret PR. The gun is then in the
                    loading position. In the meanwhile the turret has been caused to revolve ou the
                    conical rollers H, H by hydraulic pressure till the muzzle of the gun is brought
                    opposite the loading apparatus, which is securely housed below deck. The water
                    power is taken down the ammunition hoist K, which raises a truck L, carrying a
                    shell, on the top of which is laid a cartridge, to the loading position Μ. The
                    sponge N, similarly worked by hydraulic pressure, serves as a rammer also. To
                    perform the operation of loading, the sponge is forced home through the bore of
                    the gun against the bottom, by contact with which a button on the head is
                    pressed, setting free a rush of water; this thoroughly and visibly drenches the
                    bore, and prevents the remotest possibility of a burning fragment remaining from
                    the previous round; the sponge is then withdrawn, and the ammunition raised to
                    M; the sponge now becomes a rammer, thrusts the cartridge into the muzzle of the
                    gun, and is drawn back; the truck is raised still higher, the rammer then pushes
                    the projectile into the muzzle, and rams home both cartridge and shell together;
                    a wad previously placed on the head of the rammer is left behind, fast in the
                    bore in front of the projectile, which is thus prevented from moving forward. An
                    indicator on the rammer shows whether the charge is home. The press B is then
                    put in action to lower the breech, raising the muzzle to the elevation required
                    to suit the range of the object to be fired at; the gun is run forward to the
                    firing position E, and the turret is revolved till the guns point at the object.
                    The sighting is not on the guns, but on the turret; the captain of the battery
                    looks through a hole in the roof R, behind the guns, and arrests the movement of
                    the turret at the correct place, when the line between the sights, which is
                    parallel to the axes of the guns, is directed to the object. The firing may be
                    performed either in the usual way, or by electric tubes and wires from a
                    distance.</p>
                <p>Plate V., fig. 2, shows a 100-ton rifled muzzle-loading gun, mounted <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">barbette</hi> for coast defence, and
                    adjusted for hydraulic loading. After being fired the gun is traversed round to
                    the position A, where its muzzle is brought opposite the loading apparatus G,
                    which is contained in a recess in the parapet D. An hydraulic hoist E raises the
                    ammunition on a truck F to the muzzle; a similar apparatus is constructed on the
                    right of the gun, which is traversed to either at pleasure. The carriage B
                    slides on the platform C, which pivots on P, a trunk through which is introduced
                    the hydraulic power for running the gun back and absorbing the recoil.</p>
                <p>Many other applications of hydraulic power to gunnery besides those just
                    described are due to Mr G. Rendel of the great Elswick firm. One of the most
                    novel is that adopted in H.M.S. “Téméraire,” in which 25-ton guns are mounted on
                    the disappearing principle in a turret having no roof and no ports; inside the
                    turret is a turn-table carrying the gun by the trunnions on two arms, which are
                    raised by hydraulic power, enabling the gun to fire <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">barbette</hi> over the wall of the turret. The recoil brings it
                    down again, and it is placed opposite the loading gear by revolving the
                    turn-table. The general principles are the same as those on which the
                    .previously described systems are constructed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Loading.—</hi> This article would be scarcely complete without
                    a reference to the comparative advantages of the muzzle and breech-loading
                    systems. Many have been much impressed with the great superiority of
                    breech-loaders as small arms, whether for sporting or military purposes, and
                    have concluded that the same superiority must extend to ordnance constructed on
                    this plan. Others, having seen the difficulty of avoiding complication and
                    accident to the parts in the early breech-loaders, have hastily condemned the
                    whole system. The truth, as is often the case, lies between the two views, as
                    will be seen from the following considerations. The chief p0int3 of excellence
                    to be attained by a field gun are—(a) high ratio of power to weight; (δ)
                    immunity from injury by its own fire; (c) immunity from injury by the enemy’s
                    fire; <hi rend="italic">(T)</hi> capability of supporting the accidents of
                    service; (e) rapidity and facility of manipulation; <hi rend="italic">(f)</hi>
                    efficiency of projectile, (a.) The power of a gun is most conveniently measured
                    by the energy (in foot tons) communicated to the projectile on leaving the
                    muzzle. The following table shows how the latest English and German field guns
                    compare together in this respect. The English guns are muzzle-loaders, the
                    German ones breechloaders.</p>

                <p>The English 9 and 16-pounders at the time of their introduction were the most
                    powerful field guns known, but were after a time beaten by the new German guns,
                    which will in their turn be beaten by the new English piece, the first supply of
                    which was lately issued. Recently a trial was carried out of two field guns made
                    by Sir W. Armstrong &amp; Co. They were precisely similar in all respects,
                    except that one was a breech-, the other a muzzle-loader. No difference in their
                    excellence could be detected. Thus it may be considered as certain that the
                    power of a gun is in no way affected by the mere fact of its being a
                    muzzle-loader or a breech-loader. Should, however, the adoption of one system
                    favour an improved construction, or lend itself more readily than the other to
                    the use of improved ammunition, this equality would disappear, and whichever
                    system should gain a decided advantage in power, which cannot be obtained by its
                    rival, must certainly prevail. It is almost impossible to overrate the
                    importance of high velocity, combined, of course, with efficiency of projectile.
                    In the field it enables the gunner to place the enemy under fire at long ranges,
                    and so to force him to change his formations, and show his hand. It intensifies
                    both the moral and physical effect of shell upon troops. It permits the guns to
                    occupy good positions without the necessity of constant moving to get within
                    range. In entrenchment firing it is, if possible, of still greater importance.
                    Low velocity projectiles fired from field guns are almost harmless against
                    earthworks. They have not sufficient bursting charge to do damage to the work by
                    mere explosion, nor impetus enough to cut down the parapets; while the defenders
                    hear the gun and crouch under cover as the shell comes. Thus it is not
                    surprising that all our recent advances have been towards high velocities.
                    Nothing has tended more to this end than the enlargement of the diameter of the
                    powder chamber, which facilitates the profitable consumption of increased
                    charges. This improvement is found to act differently on the two systems of
                    loading. A chambered muzzle-loιder requires an expanding cartridge (in field
                    guns); a chambered breech-loader requires a breech-closing apparatus of
                    increased size and weight. Supposing a satisfactory expanding cartridge to be
                    devised, the muzzle-loader gains in ratio of power to weight. If this be found
                    impracticable, the breech-loader secures an important advantage iα this respect.
                    Experiments are still in progress, and it would be premature to pronounce
                    definitely in favour of either at present, especially as some fresh discovery or
                    new explosive may at any moment confer preponderance on either system. (6.) In
                    the Franco-German War of 1870, a large number of old pattern doublewedge
                    breech-loaders became unserviceable by their own fire. This difficulty appears
                    to have been quite overcome in the newer patterns of Krupp field guns by the
                    adoption of the cylindro-prismatic wedge, with Broadwell ring and steel
                    facing-plate. It would probably be incorrect to affirm that a breech-loader has
                    <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> as great immunity from injury by its own fire as a
                    muzzle-loader, since no joint, however well contrived, can be as strong as the
                    solid-ended steel tube forming the breech of the latter. But, putting
                    mathematical certainty of security out of the question, it may now be accepted
                    that practically field guns can be made as safe and enduring on one system as on
                    the other, (c.) As regards immunity from injury by the enemy’s fire, the
                    muzzle-loader has a decided advantage. It is difficult to estimate the real
                    value of this advantage, depending as it does partly on the manner in which
                    artillery is employed, and partly on the doctrine of chances. During the
                    Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 but few guns were placed <hi rend="italic">hors de
                    combat</hi> by the enemy’s fire. In such cases as did occur, the injuries were
                    nearly always such as would not have effected muzzle-loaders. The wedge handles
                    were usually bent up by the action of percussion fuze shell jamming the wedges.
                    The Russian field guns were generally of a feeble class; the proportion of
                    entrenchment fighting was unusually large; and in the field the Turkish
                    artillery habitually fired at long ranges. It may therefore be fairly concluded
                    that the number of guns injured by the enemy’s fire was not so great as to
                    render the superior invulnerability of muzzle-loaders of much importance. These
                    conditions will probably be reversed in any great war in which England may take
                    part; and hence the advantage gained by muzzle-loaders in immunity from damage
                    by hostile fire must be carefully borne in mind in comparing the two systems of
                    loading, <hi rend="italic">(cl.)</hi> In capability of supporting the accidents
                    of service, there is not much to choose between the two rivals. The
                    breech-loader is more liable to injury from being upset, and exposes more parts
                    and finer fittings to the action of the weather. On the other hand, it is easier
                    to clean, and the officer can better see that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi>
                    clean. The jamming of projectiles in the bore when ramming home, which sometimes
                    occurs with muzzle-loaders, is impossible with breechloaders. This defect, it is
                    hoped, has been overcome in the new English field gun. The preservation of
                    breechloaders, especially in mountainous countries, necessitates a profuse
                    expenditure of oil and grease, (e.) In comparing the rapidity and facility of
                    manipulation of the two methods of loading, it is necessary to consider the
                    circumstances under which the guns are employed. Suppose a horsed battery of
                    guns to gallop to an open spot whence they command a body of hostile troops in
                    motion. Coming into action, the gunners load and fire as rapidly as accuracy
                    will permit, unhampered by parapets. It is evidently of great importance to
                    throw as many projectiles as possible among the enemy. Here the muzzle-loader
                    will have some advantage. With full detachments in the open it takes rather les3
                    time to load, aim, and fire a muzzle-loading field gun than a breech-loading
                    one. The reason of this is that with the former the man laying the piece can
                    manipulate the sight and usually take aim while the loading is being performed,
                    while, when the projectile and cartridge are thrust in from behind, he has to
                    wait till the loading is done before he can get to the sight. There is no
                    practical difference in the time occupied by the actual loading. In one case,
                    the cartridge and shell are rammed down a long distance together; in the other,
                    first the shell is put in a short distance, and afterwards the cartridge, and
                    the wedge has also to be withdrawn and replaced. Next, suppose a commanding
                    position to have been selected for a battery, and a light entrenchment to have
                    been thrown up, over which the guns fire. Here the muzzle-loader will lose the
                    advantage gained when firing in the open, as it must be loaded before being run
                    up to the parapet, and aimed afterwards. Both natures of gun recoil, and it
                    makes no difference in time whether the ammunition be thrust home when the gun
                    is back at the recoil position, or after it is run up. Here the breech-loader
                    and the muzzle-loader stand upon equal terms. Thirdly, suppose—a rare case with
                    field guns—that firing with reduced charges is required, that shell are being
                    lobbed from behind a parapet at high angleβ into a work. Here we shall have
                    little recoil, probably not enough to permit loading at the muzzle without the
                    gun <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n333/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0333-0314"/> being run back by hand. Loading at the breech
                    will, however, be perfectly simple. In this case the breech-loader gains a very
                    decided advantage over the muzzle-loader, since not only does it not require to
                    be run back, but it has to be run up merely a very short distance. To this the
                    advocate of muzzle-loading will probably reply that shells are lobbed with low
                    velocities into works only at considerable intervals of time, that rapidity is
                    therefore of no use, and that the advantage claimed is worthless. No doubt there
                    is truth in this argument, but suppose the action of reduced charges on the gun
                    to be imitated by the introduction of a brake which shall check the recoil
                    within a short space, even when the gun is firing rapidly with high velocity,
                    then the breech-loader behind entrenchments gains a distinct advantage. The
                    German guns are supplied with powerful but clumsy brakes, more for travelling
                    purposes than for firing, and it is doubtful how far they answer for the latter
                    object. In the British service it has not been thought important to check
                    recoil, since a certain amount of it has been necessary for loading behind
                    parapets; but trials have been made of brakes, &amp;c., for the purpose of
                    preventing guns from running backwards down a reverse slope when fired from the
                    crest of a hill, or, more generally, for checking excessive recoil. Up to the
                    present time (1879) no great success has attended these efforts, nor does it
                    appear feasible to abolish recoil altogether by sinking the wheels in a ditch,
                    since the strain on the carriage would then be much increased. There is no doubt
                    the question offers grave difficulties, especially as lightness is such an
                    important feature in the construction of field gun carriages. As yet, then, the
                    reduction or checking of recoil behind a parapet confers but a problematical
                    superiority on breech-loaders, and cannot be held to counterbalance the
                    advantage gained by muzzle-loaders in the open, <hi rend="italic">(fj)</hi> In
                    the older pattern guns of both systems, where studs and windage were pitted
                    against lead coating and no windage, the muzzle-loading projectile was able to
                    take a better time-fuze than could be used in the breech-loader, but it did not
                    possess the same accuracy of shooting. Since the introduction of the polygroove
                    system, in which rotation is given and windage sealed by a copper-flanged ring
                    or disc at the base of the shell, the muzzle-loading projectile ha3 lost the
                    advantage of being able to use the simpler time-fuze, but has gained in several
                    important respects. The breech-loading shell has also been improved by the
                    substitution of two copper wires for the lead coating, but is probably inferior
                    to the new muzzle-loading projectile, which, however, can be used equally well
                    for breech-loaders. It may be said therefore that the systems are equal in
                    respect to efficiency of projectile.</p>
                <p>Thus then, taking the six qualities named as chief excellences to be sought for
                    in field artillery, it appears that in four of them there is practically little
                    or’ no advantage gained by either system over the other, while, in the two
                    remaining qualities, the muzzle-loader has slightly the best of it. On the whole
                    it seems therefore that, at the present moment, the balance of evidence is in
                    favour of muzzle-loading for field guns.</p>
                <p>In comparing the advantages of the rival methods of loading siege guns, the
                    entirely different character of the two classes of pieces composing a train at
                    once forces itself on the attention. One class consists of long guns, projecting
                    far over a parapet, and usually fired at low elevations with heavy charges; the
                    other of short guns, usually fired at high elevations with low charges, the
                    muzzles on recoil coming well within the emplacement. The Germans use long and
                    short 15-centimetre guns, both breech-loaders, and both throwing shell of the
                    same weight. The long gun, fired with heavy charges, weighs three times as much
                    as the short gun, which is fired with light charges. Supposing the dimensions of
                    the short gun were increased, the proportions remaining unchanged, till its
                    weight equalled, that of the long gun, then it would be able to fire shell of
                    three times the weight. This is what is actually being done in the British
                    service. Now all these heavy pieces, firing either heavy powder charges or heavy
                    shell, require very strong and consequently very heavy carriages to bear the
                    recoil, and it is found convenient to transport the guns on comparatively light
                    platform waggons apart from their firing carriages. Hence there is no longer any
                    necessity for constructing firing carriages with a view to travelling purposes;
                    and it is probable that traversing slides will be introduced for all heavy siege
                    pieces. It is not requisite to institute at length a comparison of the various
                    qualities desired for siege guns. Rapidity is very rarely of importance with
                    them; they are always fired under cover, and it may be at once assumed that, as
                    far as power and endurance go, the two systems are practically equal. A fresh
                    set of conditions comes into play: the projectiles are heavy; and convenience of
                    loading, combined with safety to the gunners from the enemy’s fire, should now
                    be considered. As these points are connected with the form of carriage employed,
                    it was necessary to call to mind in comparing breech with muzzle loading, that
                    slides are likely to take the place of travelling carriages. When long guns are
                    fired, in order to permit loading at the muzzle, it is requisite that the recoil
                    should be great, and the emplacement deep. Many devices, such as flexible rope
                    rammers, jointed staves, &amp;c., have been tried, but have not proved perfectly
                    successful in overcoming this difficulty. Breech-loading here has a considerable
                    advantage. Long guns are fired at low angles of elevation, and no difficulty
                    therefore is experienced in thrusting the projectile home from behind in a
                    nearly horizontal bore. High velocity is required, and the breech-loading system
                    lends itself readily to enlargement of the powder chamber, without necessitating
                    the complications of an expanding cartridge. If slides are used the hydraulic
                    buffer checks the recoil at once; on the other hand, the parapet affords rather
                    better protection to men standing close to it at the muzzle than to men standing
                    a little way off at the breech. These conditions are reversed with the short
                    pieces. The rammer is short, and no great recoil is necessary to permit loading
                    at the muzzle. The elevation is high, and it is much easier to drop a shell in
                    from the front than to thrust it up from behind. Indeed this cannot usually be
                    done, and a breech-loader has to be brought nearly horizontal for loading. High
                    velocity is never required, and enlargement of powder chamber is not wanted. The
                    men are in the most sheltered position at the muzzle. If these views be admitted
                    as correct, it seems clear that the long pieces of a siege train should be
                    breech-loaders, and the short ones muzzle-loaders. To this it may be objected
                    that uniformity would be sacrificed by such a combination. There is not much in
                    this objection. The mere fact of two guns being loaded in different ways is
                    surely of little consequence, and can easily be grasped by the dullest gunner.
                    It is done every practice day on board ship, where the old pattern Armstrong
                    vent-piece breech-loaders are combined with modern muzzle-loaders. As regards
                    the stores, a long and a short gun of the same weight would not under any
                    circumstances fire the same ammunition, and even in cases where a heavy long gun
                    is associated with a light short one having the same diameter of bore, as in the
                    case of the German 15-centimetre pieces, there is no reason why the same
                    projectile should not be used for both if desired; that is, the new smooth
                    muzzle-loading shell, with a gascheck on the base, would answer for both.</p>
                <p>The question of breech-loading or muzzle-loading is obviously not only
                    complicated, but is liable to alteration in its conditions with every advance
                    made in the science of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0334-0315"/> gunnery. To decide that an army or a navy should
                    have nothing but breech-loaders, or nothing but muzzle loaders, would be to make
                    a fetich of uniformity; there is plenty of room for both systems. With regard to
                    heavy fortress and ship guns, it is easy to suggest positions where it will
                    probably be found that one system has a decided advantage over the other. Thus,
                    taking the sea service first, in turrets the muzzle-loader is preferable. The
                    loading can be performed with great facility outside the ports, and a turret of
                    a given diameter will house a pair of bigger guns than when the loading has to
                    be done inside at the breech, unless some method of exterior loading can be
                    devised for the breech-loaders also. For broadside guns, on the other hand, it
                    seems equally clear that breech-loading has the advantage, as muzzle-loaders
                    have to be run in so far to permit loading that they must be too short for
                    ballistic excellence. For a small gun placed on a slide in the bow of a boat, it
                    appears far more convenient to load at the breech. For those gunboats in which
                    the vessel is simply the gun carriage and the line of fire is given by the helm,
                    loading at the muzzle from below deck offers great advantages. Land service
                    heavy guns, mounted on sea fronts for the protection of harbours, &lt;fcc.,
                    present a great variety of conditions. In some cases the rocks or ground on
                    which the battery is erected have such a form that a heavy gun loaded at the
                    breech could be used where only a comparatively small one could be loaded at the
                    muzzle. Sometimes a turret can be erected with loading gear outside, and then
                    the conditions are reversed. In the case of very heavy guns, which once ⅛ <hi
                    rend="italic">situ</hi> are not intended ever to be moved, the argument from
                    uniformity loses much of its cogency; and the circumstances of every gun
                    position could therefore be separately considered. The guns and howitzers arming
                    land fronts of fortresses should follow the same rule as given for the siege
                    train, the conditions of service in battery being very similar. The long pieces
                    should be breechloaders, the short ones muzzle-loaders. Wherever the comparative
                    advantages of breech-loading and muzzle-loading are nearly equal, the decision
                    should be in favour of the muzzle-loaders as possessing the inherent advantages
                    of simplicity, solidity, and cheapness.</p>
