                <p>In Europe we have five well-marked species of <hi rend="italic">Podiceps</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> the commonest and smallest of which is the very
                    well-known Dabchick of our ponds, <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fluviatilis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">minor,</hi> the Little Grebe of
                    ornithologists, found throughout the British Islands, and with a wide range in
                    the Old World. Next in size are two species known as the Eared and Horned
                    Grebes, the former of which, <hi rend="italic">P. ηigricollis,</hi> is a visitor
                    from the south, only occasionally showing itself in Britain, while the latter,
                    <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">auritus,</hi> has a more northern
                    range, breeding plentifully in Iceland, and is a not uncommon wintervisitant.
                    Then there is the larger Red-necked Grebe, <hi rend="italic">P. griseigena,</hi>
                    also a northern bird, and a native of the subarctic parts of both Europe and
                    America, while lastly the Great Crested Grebe, <hi rend="italic">P.
                    cristatus,</hi> or Gaunt—known as the Loon on the meres and broads of East
                    Anglia, and some other parts of England, is also widely spread over both Worlds,
                    and though apparently not found within the tropics, is known in the extreme
                    south as a native of Australia and New Zealand. North America is credited with
                    seven species of Grebes, of which three (P. <hi rend="italic">cristatus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">P. griseigena,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >auritus)</hi> are admitted to be specifically inseparable from those already
                    named, and two <hi rend="italic">(P. occidentalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >P.</hi><hi rend="italic">californicus)</hi> appear to be but local forms; the
                    remaining two <hi rend="italic">(P. dominicus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P.
                    ludoνicianus)</hi> may, however, be accounted good species, and the last differs
                    so much from other Grebes that many systematists make it the type of a distinct
                    genus, <hi rend="italic">Podilymbus.</hi> South America seems to possess four or
                    five more species, one of which, the <hi rend="italic">P. micropterus</hi> of Mr
                    Gould <hi rend="italic">(Proc, Zooh Society,</hi> 1858, p. 220), has been
                    deservedly separated from the genus <hi rend="italic">Podiceps</hi> by Messrs
                    Sclater and Salvin <hi rend="italic">(Exot.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithology,</hi> p. 189, pl. xcv.), owing to the form of its bill, and the
                    aborted condition of its wings, which seem to render it absolutely flightless.
                    Lake Titicaca in Bolivia is, so far as is known at present, its only habitat.
                    Grebes in general, though averse from taking wing, have much greater power of
                    flight than wouj <hi rend="subscript"> b</hi> d seem possible on examination of
                    their alar organs, and are capable of prolonged aerial journeys. Their plumage
                    is short and close. Above it is commonly of some shade of brown, but beneath it
                    is invariably white, and so glossy as to be in much request for muffs and the
                    trimming of ladies’ dresses. Some species are remarkable for the crests or
                    tippets, generally of a golden-chestnut colour, they assume in the breeding
                    season. <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">auritus</hi> is particularly
                    remarkable in this respect, and when in its full nuptial attire presents an
                    extraordinary aspect, the head (being surrounded, as it were, by a <hi
                    rend="italic">nimbus</hi> or aureole, such as that with which painters adorn
                    saintly characters), reflecting the rays of light, glitter3 with a glory that
                    passes description. All the species seem to have similar habits of nidification.
                    Water-weeds are pulled from the bottom of the pool, and piled on a convenient
                    foundation, often a seminatant growth of bog-bean <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Henyanthes),</hi> till they form a large mass, in the centre of which a
                    shallow cup is formed, and the eggs, with a chalky white shell almost equally
                    pointed at each end, are laid—the parent covering them, whenever she has time to
                    do so, before leaving the nest. Young Grebes are beautiful objects, clothed with
                    black, white, and brown hair, disposed in streaks, and their bill often
                    brilliantly tinted with orange or yellow. When taken from the nest and placed on
                    dry ground, it is curious to observe the way in which they progress—using the
                    wings almost as fore-feet, and suggesting the notion that they must be
                    quadrupeds instead of birds. In water, however, they equal if not surpass their
                    parents in the power of diving, which is a special accomplishment of all Grebes.
