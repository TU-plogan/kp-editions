                <p><label type="entry">GRACES</label> is the name generally given to the Greek
                    goddesses Charites. The chief seat of their worship was the ancient Boeotian
                    city Orchomenus. They were three in number, but their names were not known; and
                    stones fallen from heaven stood in their temple as symbols of the goddesses
                    (Paus., ix. 35). Their worship was instituted by a king Eteocles, whose three
                    daughters fell into a well while dancing in honour of the Charites (Westermann,
                    <hi rend="italic">Myth. Gr.,</hi> p. 387). In no Greek legend is the pre-Greek
                    Indo-Germanic character more strongly marked. Eteocles, he whose glory is real,
                    is the Vedic Satyaçravas, the sun; and his genealogy consists of a string of
                    epithets for sun anl dawn. Charis (Skt. <hi rend="italic">han,</hi> bright), is
                    an old adjective, originally an epithet of the light-illumined clouds which seem
                    to escort the dawn, often applied in the Rig-Veda to the horses of the dawn or
                    of the sun, and at last growing into a distinct deity who preserves the
                    character of the ancient dawn-goddess (see Müller, <hi rend="italic">Led.
                    Laug.,</hi> ii.; Sonne in Kuhn, <hi rend="italic">Zft.,</hi> x.). The burning
                    bright <hi rend="italic">vasas</hi> (Ushas, τ)ως, Aurora, with a different
                    suffix Ostara, Easter) —who restores the blessings lost during the night, who
                    lights up what was dark and reveals the hidden wrong, who give3 active labour
                    and wealth to men, growth and fertility to plants—had been from the earliest
                    time the centre of a great worship To appearance these religious ceremonies have
                    been lost in Greece; and in a people so retentive of all that relates to
                    religion, this implies merely that the worship of the dawn has been changed in
                    outward form. Eos is of slight importance; but Charis, Hebe, Aphrodite (in so
                    far as the genuine Greek goddess has not given way to the Oriental deity)
                    preserve and develop the original idea. Charis then was the goddess of the
                    freshness and vigour of life, of fertility and growth; like Aphrodite, she
                    closely resembles Persephone (see Gerhard, <hi rend="italic">Venus
                    Proserpina'),</hi> and in later art the Graces often hold corn eιrs in their
                    hands; like Hebe, she is often associated with Hera (see Welcker, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gr. Gott.,</hi> iii. 174). The single goddess grew into a triad,
                    as occurs often in Greek mythology; in Sparta, however, and in Athens only two
                    Charites were known. Rites of peculiar antique character belong to the worship
                    of the Charites: in Orchomenus nightly dances took place in their honour
                    (compare the legend of Eteocles’s daughters, who obviously are bye forms of the
                    goddesses); in Paros their worship was celebrated without music or garlands; in
                    Messene they were worshipped along with the Eumenides; in Athens their rites
                    secret from the vulgar were held at the entrance of the Acropolis; one swore by
                    the Charites as one did by the deities of the lower world (Pollux, viii. 106).
                    Far as these characteristics seem removed from the nature of a dawn-goddess we
                    find a similar double character in many other cases, such as Artemis-Hecate.
                    They are thus brought into the cycle of older more purely nature worship, which
                    we find in Greece alongside of the more moral religion of the Olympian deities,
                    and which has in mythology its counterpart in the older generation of Titans
                    destroyed by the younger gods. The Charites were received into the Olympian
                    Pantheon only in a subordinate character. In Homer we have a transitional stage;
                    they appear sometimes as distinct independent beings, one being wife of
                    Hephaestus, another of Sleep (7Z., xviii. 382, xiv. 231); often they are a set
                    of nymphs attending on Aphrodite, herself then wife of Hepliaestus <hi
                    rend="italic">(Od.,</hi> viii. 364, &amp;c ). The dawn is naturally the wife of
                    Hephaestus, the fire of the sun in heaven and of the morning sacrifice on earth.
                    In later literature this second form prevails. Obviously the noun <hi
                    rend="italic">charis</hi> and the connected verbs and substantives, which
                    existed alongside of the mythological name, exercised a continually growing
                    influence on it. The Charites become then the impersonation of the bloom of all
                    sensuous appearance, of grace and cheerfulness, both in nature and in moral
                    action. They form part of the train attendant on the greater gods, especially
                    Aphrodite and Apollo. Their names, Aglaia, Euphrosyne, and Thalia, occur first
                    in Hesiod <hi rend="italic">(Theog.,</hi> 907). Pindar, however, following the
                    Boeotian belief, celebrates them <hi rend="italic">(Ol.,</hi> xiv.) as the
                    queens of glittering Orchomenus and as the guardian goddesses of the ancient
                    Minyae. In art they were represented in earlier time as draped goddesses with
                    varying attributes; gradually the one well-known conception predominated of the
                    three beautiful nude figures gracefully intertwined. Jacobi <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Wörter!).</hi><hi rend="italic">d. Myth.)</hi> gives a very complete list of
                    ancient authorities.</p>
