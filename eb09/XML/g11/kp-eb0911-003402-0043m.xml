                    Britain. The correct spelling is “Graal.” In the present article the subject
                    will be considered under the following four heads :—(1) the meaning of the Graal
                    conception; (2) the authorship of the conception; (3) the meaning of the word;
                    (4) the spread of the conception from the land of its origin to other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>1. The “Saint Graal” was the name given—if not originally, yet very soon after
                    the conception was started— to the dish, or shallow bowl (in French, <hi
                    rend="italic">escuelle),</hi> from which Jesus Christ was said to have eaten the
                    paschal lamb on the evening of the Last Supper with his disciples. In the French
                    prose romance of the <hi rend="italic">Saint Graal,</hi> it is said that Joseph
                    of Arimathea, having obtained leave from Pilate to take down the body of Jesus
                    from the cross, proceeded first to the upper room where the supper was held and
                    found there this vessel; then, as he took down the Lord’s dead body, he received
                    into the vessel many drops of blood which issued from the still open wounds in
                    his feet, hands, and side. This last feature, which Tennyson in his beautiful
                    idyll <hi rend="italic">The Holy Grail</hi> has overlooked, is obviously of the
                    essence of the conception. According to Catholic theology, where the body or the
                    blood of Christ is, there, by virtue of the hypostatic union, are His soul and
                    His divinity. That the Graal, such being its contents, should be marvellous—
                    divine—mysterious, was but logical and natural. The Graal was “the commencement
                    of all bold emprise, the occasion of all prowess and heroic deeds, the
                    investigation of all the sciences, . . . the demonstration of great wonders, the
                    end of all bounty and goodness, the marvel of all other marvels.” Nasciens,
                    taking off the paten which covered the Graal, comprehends innumerable marvels,
                    but is struck blind. By the Graal Joseph’s life is sustained in prison during
                    forty-two years without food, while as an oracle it instructs him in heavenly
                    knowledge. Nothing could be more fantastic and extravagant than all this, were
                    the Graal conceived of merely as a relic, however venerable; but all is altered
                    when it is brought into close relations, according to the design of its
                    inventors, with the mystery of the eucharist.</p>
                <p>2. The authorship of the conception involves one of the most difficult of
                    literary questions. Mr Price, in the able and eloquent dissertation prefixed to
                    vol. i. of Warton’s <hi rend="italic">History of English Poetry,</hi> seems to
                    maintain the view that it can be attributed to no individual, but was the
                    spontaneous outgrowth of a group of widely prevalent superstitions, in all which
                    a magical cup or divining bowl was the central object. Others, as Fauriel,
                    Simrock, and Schulz, find the original home of the legend in Γroveuce. M. Paulin
                    Paris, who has been engaged for nearly forty years in the study of Arthurian
                    romance, and whose latest speculations <hi rend="italic">{Romans de la
                    Table</hi><hi rend="italic">Ronde,</hi> v. 352) bear the recent date of 1876, is
                    of opinion that the original conception came from some Welsh monk or hermit who
                    lived early in the 8th century; that its guiding and essential import was an
                    assertion for the British Church of an independent derivation of its
                    Christianity direct from Palestine, and not through Rome; that the conception
                    was embodied in a book, called <hi rend="italic">Liber Gradalis</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">De Gradali</hi>; that this book was kept in abeyance by the
                    British clergy for more than 300 years, from a fear lest it should bring them
                    into collision with the hierarchy and make their orthodoxy suspected; that it
                    came to be known and read in the second half of the 12th century; that a French
                    poet, Robert de Boron, who probably had not seen the book, but received
                    information about it, was the first to embody the conception in a vernacular
                    literary form by writing his poem of <hi rend="italic">Josephe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;ΓArirnathie;</hi> and that, after Boron, Walter Map and others
                    came into the field. Lastly, it is maintained, by English writers. generally,
                    that the conception arose certainly on British ground, but in the 12th century,
                    not in the 8th; that it was introduced by some master-hand, probably that of
                    Walter Map, into every branch of Arthurian <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n44/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0044-0035"/> romance; and that if Map was not the author of
                    the conception, as seems highly probable, he first, by writing the French
                    romances of the <hi rend="italic">Saint Graal,</hi> the second part of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lancelot,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mort Artur,</hi> invested it
                    in literary form.</p>
                <p>These theories cannot be discussed here; but it may be remarked that, in order to
                    pave the way for any rational theory, it is indispensable to have a clear view
                    of the condition of romance literature at and before the time when the
                    conception arose. The legend of Arthur, which barely rises to the surface in the
                    narrative of Gildas, had in the time of Nennius (9th century) attained to
                    considerable consistency, and through the appearance of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia Britonum</hi> of Geoffrey of Monmouth, which everywhere excited an
                    extraordinary sensation, had become European. To the Norman and French poets it
                    had become known, long before the appearance of Geoffrey’s book, through the
                    Breton lays; and the mysticism, the tender depths of sentiment, the wild flights
                    of imagination and fancy which were found in these lays, had so captivated and
                    dazzled them as to induce them almost to desert their own rough <hi
                    rend="italic">Chansons</hi><hi rend="italic">de Geste,</hi> of which Charlemagne
                    was the chief figure, for this new field. A succession of startling incidents,
                    in which giants, knights, dwarfs, fairies, and goblins were actors, and a nature
                    in mystic sympathy with man was the background, appealed to the feelings of
                    wonder and awe; the instinct of revenge and the lust of war were gratified by
                    battle-recitals innumerable, while around the chief characters of the legends
                    there floated the rapture and the hyperbole of amorous passion. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Brut</hi> of Wace, founded on Geoffrey’s work, we find the story
                    of Arthur in ample proportions, and the “Round Table” appears for the first
                    time—</p>
                <p>“Fist reis Ertur la Runde Table, Dunt Bretun dient meinte fable.”</p>
                <p>The exuberance of invention here attributed to the Bretons was faithfully
                    imitated by the poets of northern France. Chrestien of Troyes, born near the
                    middle of the 12th century, besides versifying many tales from Ovid, reproduced
                    parts of the Arthur legend in his poem on <hi rend="italic">King Mark and Yseult
                    the Blonde,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Chevalier au</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lion.</hi> In these, however, there is no mention of the Graal. Suddenly a
                    narrative, possibly in Latin but more probably in French prose, makes its
                    appearance, containing the story of the commission of the Holy Graal to Joseph
                    of Arimathea, as given above, of his subsequent adventures in Syria and
                    elsewhere, and of the ultimate arrival of his son, his brother-in-law, and
                    others of his kindred, in Britain, where they settle in the island of Avallon.
                    The birth of Arthur is prophesied in this narrative, but otherwise he is
                    scarcely mentioned. About the same time, the prose romances of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lancelot</hi> (part i.) and <hi rend="italic">Tristan,</hi> containing rich
                    developments of the Arthurian legend, made their appearance and were warmly
                    welcomed. The first is ascribed in the MSS. to Walter Map, and the second to Luc
                    or Luces de Gast; but both statements, in the opinion of M. Paulin Paris, are
                    extremely doubtful. At any rate, if Map wrote the first part of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lancelot,</hi> he continued and finished it in a totally different
                    spirit. The first part is mere love and chivalry, “the most secular,” says M.
                    Paulin Paris, “of all romances”; while the second part is the most mystical of
                    all. The first part contains no allusion to the Graal; in the second it is an
                    element of overpowering interest. Lancelot joins in the quest for the Graal,
                    fails to see it or only half sees it, repents, becomes a holy hermit, and dies.
                    <hi rend="italic">Tristan</hi> in its original form was the legend of a
                    favourite Breton hero; it was then connected with the cycle of Arthur; lastly,
                    perhaps by the same powerful hand that transmuted <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lancelot,</hi> it was brought within the sweep of the Graal conception.</p>
                <p>But who invented the story of Joseph of Arimathea! or rather, who connected that
                    story with the Graal legend, and both with Arthur! The importance of a work of
                    William of Malmesbury in assisting us to answer this question has been somewhat
                    overlooked. In his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Antiquitate</hi><hi rend="italic">Glastoniensis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecclesioe,</hi> written probably soon after Henry of Blois, abbot of
                    Glastonbury, to whom it is dedicated, was raised to the see of Winchester
                    (1129), Malmesbury records with considerable detail the legend which brought
                    Joseph to Glastonbury, and made him the first preacher of Christianity to the
                    Britons. Everything connected with Glastonbury had a duodenary character; Joseph
                    was sent to Britain by St Philip the evangelist as the chief among twelve
                    missioners; the holy men who afterwards tenanted the abbey always sought to
                    maintain the number of twelve; Glasteing, from whom the place was named, was one
                    of twelve brothers; the chief estate of the abbey was called “the Twelve Hides,”
                    &amp;c. This same feature distinctly reappears in the Graal legend, where Bron,
                    the brother-in-law of Joseph, has twelve sons, who are all sent to Britain, but
                    one among them, Alain, who renounces marriage, is set over the rest. Again, we
                    read in Malmesbury that Avallon is another name for Glastonbury; and in the
                    Graal legend we read that Joseph’s kindred are directed by a divine voice to
                    seek, in the far west, the “valleys of Avaron.” Lastly, in the strange story
                    about the altar called “sapphirus,” which angels brought from Palestine to St
                    David, and which after a long disappearance was rediscovered in Malmesbury’s own
                    day, we seem to lay our finger, as it were, on the origin, the rudimentary
                    suggestion, of the Graal conception.</p>
                <p>Now if we accept the general testimony of the MSS., and assume without further
                    proof that Map composed, whether in Latin or in French, the original book of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Saint Graal,</hi> the genesis of the work seems not difficult
                    to trace. In early life Map was a canon of Salisbury (see Wright’s preface to
                    the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Nugis Curialium)</hi>; either
                    afterwards or at the same time he was parish priest of Westbury near Bristol.
                    Gloucestershire and Wiltshire are both neighbouring counties to Somersetshire,
                    in which Glastonbury was the most sacred and celebrated spot. Visiting that
                    ancient abbey, Map would have become acquainted with the legend of Joseph of
                    Arimathea in all its details; and he would have seen the altar said to have been
                    transported by angels from Palestine, and which, long hidden from mortal sight
                    on account of the wickedness of the times, had lately been revealed and
                    reinstated. His versatile and capacious mind would, as a matter of course, have
                    been familiar with the whole Arthur legend as it then (1170-1180) existed, if
                    for no other reason, because he lived in the very part of England which was
                    studded with Arthurian sites. He fully answers to the description of the “great
                    clerks” who, according to Robert de Boron first made and told the history of the
                    Graal. He seems to have conceived the vast design of steeping the Arthurian
                    legend, and through it the whole imaginative literature of the age, in the
                    doctrine of the Christian sacrifice. He is generally credited in the MSS. with
                    the composition of the <hi rend="italic">Saint Graal</hi> (containing the legend
                    of Joseph of Arimathea), of the <hi rend="italic">Quest of the Saint Graal,</hi>
                    of <hi rend="italic">Lancelot</hi> in whole or in part, and of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mort Artur.</hi> But it appears that no MS. of any of these
                    romances now exists of an earlier date than 1274, and it is certain that a set
                    of “arrangers” and continuators (like the rhapsodists and cyclic poets of the
                    Homeric epos) commenced their confusing operations on the legend at an early
                    period. Hence it seems impossible now to recover the exact order in which the
                    different romances were composed.</p>
                <p>3. On the origin ot the word Graal, the opinion of M. Paulin Paris seems to be
                    satisfactory. He thinks that graal is a corruption of gradale, or graduale, the
                    Latin name for a liturgical collection of psalms and texts of scripture, so
                    called “quod in gradibus canitur,” as the priest is passing <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n45/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0045-0036"/> from the epistle to the gospel side of the altar.
                    The author of the Graal conception meant by graal, or gradale, not the sacred
                    dish (escuelle), but the mysterious book revealed to the supposed hermit of 717,
                    in which he finds the history of the escuelle. Robert de Boron, mistaking this,
                    transfers the name to the dish, and connects it with <hi rend="italic">grè</hi>
                    (gratus, gratia) on account of the inward solace connected with it (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Homans de la T. P.,</hi> i. 143). The word rapidly became popular
                    in the sense of bowl, or shallow cup, so that Hélinand (1204) could say,
                    “Dicitur vulgari nomine <hi rend="italic">graalz,</hi> quia grata et
                    acceptabilis est in ea comedenti.” This etymology is the same as Boron’s. The
                    older French word <hi rend="italic">greet,</hi> meaning service-book (Ducange,
                    article “Gradale ”), was displaced by the new <hi rend="italic">graal</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">greal.</hi> On the other hand, Μ. Fauriel derives graal from
                    an old Provençal word for a cup, <hi rend="italic">grazal.</hi> But this <hi
                    rend="italic">grazal,</hi> according to the article in Ducange, seems to be of
                    Armorican origin; anyhow Μ. Fauriel has not proved its use in the sense of cup
                    at a period earlier than the rise of the Graal legend.</p>
                <p>4. The spread and ascendency to which the Graal conception rapidly attained in
                    all Christian countries made the creations of Arthurian romance the delight of
                    all cultivated minds, from Caerleon to Venice, and from Iceland to the Straits
                    of Gibraltar. From England, which we must regard as the land of its origin, the
                    Graal legend at once passed to France, and found an enthusiastic and capable
                    interpreter in Robert or Robiers de Boron. This Boron was no Englishman of
                    Nottinghamshire, as some English writers have pretended, but, as Paulin Paris
                    conclusively proves, a French poet of the county of Montbéliard in the region of
                    the Vosges. Chrestien de Troyes in his <hi rend="italic">Percival</hi> (written
                    before 1191, for it is dedicated to Count Philip of Flanders who died in that
                    year), gives in a metrical dress the legend of Percival, one of the knights of
                    the round table, under the transformation which the introduction of the Graal
                    conception had effected. The continuations of the poem, by Denet and Manessier,
                    come down to about 1240. The famous Mid-German poem of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parzival,</hi> by Wolfram von Eschenbach, which appeared near the beginning of
                    the 13th century, is founded partly on Chrestien’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Percival,</hi> but partly also on some other, perhaps Provençal, source, which
                    is now lost. A rude English metrical version of the French prose romance of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Saint Graal,</hi> by one Harry Lonelich, dating from the reign
                    of Henry VI., has been recently edited by Mr Furnivall for the Roxburghe Club.
                    Flemish, Icelandic, and Welsh reproductions of the Graal romances have been
                    found to exist. One of the first employments of the printing press in England,
                    France, and Germany was to multiply poems or romances embodying this legend.
