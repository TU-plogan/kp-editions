                    Augustine, and Jerome being the other three), wa3 born at Rome about the year
                    540. His father Gordianus possessed senatorial rank, and his mother Sylvia is
                    said to have been remarkable for her mental endowments. Educated for the legal
                    profession, Gregory about his thirtieth year was chosen by the citizens to the
                    high position of praetor urbanus; this post he is said to have occupied for
                    three years (571-574), discharging its duties with great pomp and magnificence;
                    but on the death of his father, having become deeply impressed with a sense of
                    the transitoriness and vanity of all earthly things, he retired from public life
                    and gave up his whole fortune to pious uses, building six monasteries in Sicily
                    and one in Rome; in this last, which was dedicated by him to St Andrew, he
                    embraced the Benedictine rule, and divided his whole time between works of
                    charity and the exercises of fasting, meditation, and prayer. It was while he
                    was still a simple monk of St Andrew that the often repeated incident related by
                    Bede is believed to have occurred. Having seen some English slaves of striking
                    beauty exposed for sale in the public market, “non Angli sed Angeli,” he set his
                    heart upon the evangelization of Britain, and was only prevented by the command
                    of his ecclesiastical superiors from setting out in person to seek the
                    realization of his pious wish. About 578 or 579 he was appointed abbot of his
                    monastery, and likewise one of the seven deacons (regionarii) of the Roman
                    Church; and in 582 he was sent by Pelagius II. to Constantinople as papal
                    apocrisiarius or responsatis at the imperial court. There he remained for
                    upwards of three years, during which he negotiated several matters of importance
                    and delicacy; but amid his diplo matic and other engagements he found time to
                    begin, if not even to complete, one of his largest works, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moralia,</hi> or exposition of the book of Job. A few years after his return
                    from the Eastern capital, the death of Pelagius (590) caused a vacancy in the
                    papal chair, and the choice of. the clergy, senate, and people unanimously fell
                    upon Gregory. He strongly deprecated the bestowal of this honour, and wrote to
                    the emperor (Maurice) imploring him not to confirm the nomination. A pious
                    fraud, committed by the city praetor then in office, prevented the letter from
                    reaching its destination; and though Gregory hid himself for a time, he was at
                    length obliged to yield to the urgency of his friends by accepting the papal
                    crown (September 590). The pontificate of fourteen years which followed was
                    marked by extraordinary vigour and activity, which made themselves felt
                    throughout almost every department of the doctrine, discipline, and worship of
                    the entire Western Church. By means of earnest prayer and wisely expended pains
                    the aggressions of the Lombards were checked, and order and tranquillity were
                    speedily restored to Rome; in Italy and France he tightened the too long relaxed
                    reins of ecclesiastical discipline; in England, Spain, and Africa the powers of
                    Paganism, Arianism, and Donatism were perceptibly weakened; as against the
                    Eastern emperor and the patriarch of Constantinople the prerogatives of the
                    bishop of Rome were asserted with a vigour previously unwitnessed; the
                    ceremonies of the church were regulated and extended, the liturgy further
                    developed. The anniversary of Gregory’s death, which took place at Rome on the
                    12th of March 604, is observed as a duplex by the Latin Church, and even in the
                    Greek Church his wisdom and sanctity continue to be commemorated. The
                    hyperbolical panegyrics of those ecclesiastical writers who lived nearest his
                    time (such as Gregory of Tours and Isidore of Seville) must of course be taken
                    with considerable reservation; but they are interesting as showing how powerful
                    and profound was the impression he left upon his contemporaries and immediate
                    successors—an impression and an influence well entitling him to the epithet of
                    “great.” Of the personal qualities of Gregory, the most obtrusive are beyond all
                    question the singular strength and energy of his character. Firmly and intensely
                    convinced of the divineness of the Christian doctrine and life as these had
                    presented themselves to his mind and heart, he suffered no obstacle and no
                    discouragement to triumph over his determination to give them all the currency
                    and prevalence that were possible in his day. Having clearly seen the end he had
                    in view, he with equal discernment made choice of his measures for its
                    attainment. The refinements alike of literature and of art had for him no place
                    in the Christian scheme; it is needless to say that he therefore despised them
                    both for himself and for others. There is some room for hoping indeed that the
                    burning of the books of the Palatine library was due to some ruder pontiff; but
                    there is no possibility of mistake as to the literary taste of the man who could
                    write (pref, to <hi rend="italic">Moralia)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> “non
                    metacismi collisionem fugio, non barbarismi confusionem devito, situs motusque
                    etiam et praepositionum casus servare contemno, quia indignum vehementer
                    existimo utverba coelestis oraculi restringam sub regulis Donati.” The
                    uniformity of the Roman ritual, the ascendency of the Roman hierarchy, the
                    prevalency of the Catholic dogma,—these were not merely the highest, they were
                    the only, ideals he had ever caught sight of. It ought not therefore to surprise
                    us if in striving towards them he sometimes was tempted, and yielded to the
                    temptation, to sacrifice truthfulness to what he conceived to be the truth, and
                    the mere claims of humanity to the demands of what he regarded as a higher love.
                    Never purely selfish, he was, apart from the exigencies of his ecclesiastical
                    position, singularly tolerant, liberal, and kindly.</p>
                <p>Of the numerous extant works attributed to Gregory the Great the following are
                    undisputed:—the <hi rend="italic">Moralia,</hi> in thirty-five books, being an
                    exposition of the book of Job, composed between 580 and 590; the twenty-two <hi
                    rend="italic">Homilies on Ezekiel</hi> (about 595), and the forty <hi
                    rend="italic">Homilies on the Gospels</hi> (about 592); the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Regula</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Cura)</hi><hi rend="italic">Pastoralis,</hi>
                    dedicated to John, archbishop of Ravenna (about 590); the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dialogues</hi> with Peter the deacon, in four books, on the lives and miracles
                    of the Italian saints (593 or 594); and the <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> in
                    fourteen “registers,” aιτanged according to the years of his pontificate. He was
                    also the author of various rhymed hymns, nine of which are still extant and
                    appear in the collected editions of his works. They are characterized more by
                    simplicity of language than by depth of feeling. The <hi rend="italic">Concordia
                    quorundam</hi><hi rend="italic">testimoniorum sacrarum scripturarum,</hi> and
                    also the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> on 1 Kings, Canticles, and the
                    seven penitential psalms usually ascribed to him, are spurious. His liturgical
                    works, the <hi rend="italic">Sacramentarium</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Λntiphon-arium,</hi> have been considerably tampered with by mediaeval
                    collectors and revisers; and even the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> are not
                    wholly free from interpolations. Of Gregory’s merits as an expositor little need
                    be said; he avowedly adopts in all cases the allegorical method, which in his
                    hands is unflinchingly carried out, with, in many cases, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n187/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0187-0176"/> sufficiently astounding results. As Milman has
                    remarked, “It may safely be said that, according to Gregory’s licence of
                    interpretation, there is nothing which might not be found in any book ever
                    written.” In practical homiletics, however, he is very often just and profound
                    as well as high-toned; but it would be too much to say that he was superior to
                    the prejudices of his time; in particular his preference for the monastic and
                    ascetic forms of the Christian life is carried to a height which a wider
                    observation of the conditions of human usefulness and happiness will never cease
                    to regaι ’ d as excessive. His <hi rend="italic">Dialogues,</hi> which have been
                    translated into Anglo-Saxon, Greek, and even Arabic, describe the most
                    astonishing miracles with an artless simplicity which, as suggestive of entire
                    belief, is certainly interesting to the student; yet it is difficult (as Gibbon
                    has pointed out) to free the lavish dispenser of miraculous filings from the
                    chains of St Peter from the suspicion of some degree of pious insincerity. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> are, as might be expected, of great importance
                    from the light they throw upon the history of those times.</p>
                <p>The complete editions of the works of this great father of the Latin Church have
                    been, as was to be expected, numerous. The earliest was that of Lyons (1516),
                    which was rapidly followed by those of Paris (1518-39), Basel (1551), and Rome
                    (1588). The best edition is the Benedictine (Paris, 1705), in 4 vols, fol.,
                    reprinted at Venice (1768-76), in 17 vols. 4to, and in Migne’s <hi rend="italic"
