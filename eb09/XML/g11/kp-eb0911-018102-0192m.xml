                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0193-0182"/> of one of the oldest and most powerful Christian
                    families in the country; at his baptism he received the name of George, that of
                    Gregory not having been assumed until his consecration at least thirty years
                    afterwards. He received his education under the superintendence of his uncle
                    Gallus, at that time bishop of Clermont, and afterwards under Avitus, who
                    succeeded to that see. Having been ordained a deacon on attaining the canonical
                    age, the youthful Georgius Florentius for a time attended in some ecclesiastical
                    capacity the court of Sigebert of Austrasia; and when in 573 a vacancy occurred
                    in the see of Tours, which had been occupied by many of his kindred, his
                    reputation for piety and wisdom led to his being immediately designated as a
                    suitable successor to that bishopric. Circumstances soon occurred which brought
                    into great prominence his peculiar fitness for this post; first in 575, when
                    Guntran had taken refuge from Chilperic in the sanctuary of St Martin, and
                    afterwards in 577, when Pretextatus of Rouen had been unjustly condemned by the
                    rest of his brethren. The firmness and courage which he showed on these and
                    other occasions brought upon him the bitter hostility of the strong-minded Queen
                    Fredegond, who caused him to be summoned before a council at Braine on a charge
                    of treason, of which, however, he was acquitted. In 581 he took a leading part
                    in adjusting that arrangement between Chilperic and Childebert which gave peace
                    to France for many years. During the later years of his life he used his
                    political influence and prestige, which were now immense, with singular
                    unselfishness and judgment in the interest alike of his diocese and of the whole
                    country. He died at Tours on the 17th of November 591, and subsequently attained
                    the honours of beatification and canonization, his day in the calendar
                    (semiduplex) being November 17th.</p>
                <p>Of his writings, besides the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Francorum</hi> in ten books, we possess a treatise <hi rend="italic">Be</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Miraculis</hi> in seven books, containing the miracles of Christ
                    and his apostles, those of Julian, of Martin, and also of others. Other
                    treatises which he mentions have perished. The <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Miraculis</hi> appears to have occupied him at intervals durin»
                    the whole of his prelacy; of the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Francorum</hi> he is supposed to have written as far as to about
                    the middle of the fifth book by 577; the eighth book was completed before 585,
                    and the tenth about 591, the epilogue being of still later date. This work,
                    which gives Gregory of Tours a just title to be called the father of French
                    history, has no pretensions to elegance or even grammatical accuracy of style,
                    it is wholly uncritical, and betrays in every page the prejudice and ignorance
                    of the age to which it belongs. But it is honestly and truthfully written from
                    the point of view of one whose avowed intention was to trace ‘ ‘ the wars of
                    kings with hostile nations, of martyrs with pagans, of churches with heretics;”
                    and as an original source for the period of 174 years which it covers it is
                    still, notwithstanding the unfavourable judgment which Gibbon has expressed,
                    invaluable.</p>
                <p>The edition of the works of Gregory of Tours, which appeared at Paris in 1511-12,
                    has been entirely superseded by that of Ruinart (Paris, 1699). It includes the
                    not very valuable life of the saint by Odo. The 71st volume of Migne’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Patrology</hi> adds to a reprint of Ruinart an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia Septem Dormientium</hi> which is sometimes (but improperly) attributed
                    to Gregory. Translations by Bonnet, Guizot, and others into French have been
                    frequently reprinted; a German version appeared at Würzburg in 1847-49; it was
                    followed by Giesebrecht’s in 1851. See Kries, <hi rend="italic">De Greg. Tur.
