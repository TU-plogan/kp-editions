                    (1786-1839), Hungarian theologian and scholar, was born 7th April 1786 at
                    Vâmos-Csalâd, in the county of Sopron. His early education was conducted at
                    Köszeg (Giins), Szombathely (Stein-am-Anger), and Sopron (Oedenburg); in the
                    last-mentioned town he was instructed in the art of poetry by Paul Horvath. On
                    the 28th October 1805 he entered the Benedictine order, but left it on the 30th
                    August of the following year. Having almost immediately repented this step, he
                    again assumed the monastic garb on the 10th November 1806. At the monastery of
                    Pannonhegy he applied himself to the study of Greek under Farkas T&lt;5th. In
                    1808 we find him <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Various French biographical

                    1630 remarked—“All acetosus and sower things doe so close the powers, and

                    Dr George Thomson had in 1666 described how, preparing for the “dissection of a
                    pestilent body,” he got in readiness “a porringer containing Sulphur to burn
                    under the Corps,” and how, suspecting the entry into his hand during the
                    operation of “slie, insinuating, venemous Atoms,” or, in modern phrase, septic
                    germs, he sought to nullify their effects by holding the hand in the gas of
                    burning brimstone <hi rend="smallcaps">(Λoimotomia</hi><hi rend="italic">or the

                <p>at Györ (Raab), in the middle school of which town he was teaching during the two
                    following years. In 1811 he was again at Pannonhegy, whence in 1812 he was sent
                    to Pesth to study theology. Here he became acquainted with the works of the best
                    German and Hungarian authors, and also took part in the editorship of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Nemzeti</hi> (National) <hi rend="italic">Plutarkus,</hi> and
                    in the translation of Hübner’s <hi rend="italic">Lexicon.</hi> After about four
                    years’ stay at Pesth, he obtained the degree of doctor of divinity, and returned
                    to Pannonhegy, where he devoted himself to dogmatic theology and literature. So
                    great was his activity that it is said that there was hardly an Hungarian
                    periodical to which Guzmics was not a contributor. The most important of his
                    theological works are— <hi rend="italic">A hath, aηyaszentegyhdzηak hitbeli
                        tanitdsa</hi> (The doctrinal teaching of the Holy Catholic Church), and <hi
                        rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic">keresztényeknek</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >vallasbeli egyesiilesokrol</hi> (On Religious Unity among Christians), both
                    published at Pesth in 1822; also a Latin treatise entitled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Theologia</hi><hi rend="italic">Christiana</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >fundamentalis et theologia dogmatica</hi> (Györ, 1828-29, 4 vols.). Of the
                    other literary labours of Guzmics the most meritorious is a translation of
                    Theocritus in hexameters published in 1824. His versions of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Oe</hi><hi rend="italic">dipus</hi> of Sophocles and of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia</hi> of Euripides were rewarded by the Hungarian
                    Academy, of which in 1838 he was elected honorary member. From 1832 to the date
                    of his death he was editor of the <hi rend="italic">Egyhazi Tar</hi>
                    (Ecclesiastical Treasury). In 1832 he was appointed abbot of the wealthy
                    Benedictine house at Bikonybél, a village in the county of Veszprém. While there
                    he built an asylum for 150 children, and founded a school of harmony and
                    singing. He died at Bakonybél on the 1st September 1839.</p>
