                <p><label type="entry">GRONOVIUS, or GRONOV</label>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jakob</hi>
                    (1645-1716), one of the very great scholars of the 17th century, was born 20th
                    October 1645 at Deventer, where his father, J. F. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Gronovius</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.},</hi> was at that time professor of
                    rhetoric and history. On the completion of his studies at Leyden, where he had
                    early distinguished himself by his powers of intellectual acquisition, he in
                    1698 visited England, where he became acquainted with Pocock, Pearson, and Mery
                    Casaubon, and where he devoted several months to the collation of rare
                    manuscripts at Oxford and Cambridge. His edition of Polybius, published at
                    Leyden in 1670, in addition to his own and variorum notes, contained those which
                    Casaubon on his deathbed had bequeathed to him. Declining an invitation to a
                    chair at Deventer, he in 1671 visited France, and was brought into intimate
                    relations with D’Herbelot, Thevenot, and other distinguished scholars; and after
                    another brief interval at Leyden he in 1672 travelled in Spain, whence he passed
                    into Italy. There he accepted from the grand duke of Tuscany a chair at the
                    university of Pisa, which, however, he resigned at the end of two years. Having
                    returned to Deventer by way of Germany, he had settled down with the purpose of
                    working uninterruptedly at an edition of Livy, when in 1679 he was invited by
                    the curators of the university of Leyden to occupy a professorial chair. Here,
                    untempted by several pressing invitations to various foreign universities, he
                    spent the remaining years of his life, in which the calmness which normally
                    characterizes even the most ardent scholarly research was unfortunately too
                    often broken by literary quarrels conducted on his part with excessive violence
                    and scurrility. He died 21st October 1716.</p>
