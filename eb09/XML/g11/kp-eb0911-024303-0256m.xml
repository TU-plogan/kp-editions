                    duchy of the empire, bounded by Friesland, Westphalia, Brabant, Holland, and the
                    Zuydersee. At the beginning of the Christian era the land was held by Batavians
                    and Chama vians, and a few centuries later both Saxons and Franks were added to
                    its population. The Carolingian kings ruled over it by means of a number of
                    counts, among whom those of Hameland, Teisterbant (Testrebante), and Nimeguen
                    were the most prominent; but hitherto it has not been discovered how these
                    counts are connected with the later dynasty of the counts of Guelderland and
                    Zutphen, which makes its appearance in the 11th century. There is documentary
                    proof at Braunweiler of the existence of a Count Otto at the end of the 10th
                    century, and a charter of 1096 is sealed by Gerhard of Gelder. Count Gerhard II.
                    of Gelder married Ermgardof Zutphen, and their son Henry succeeded to the double
                    inheritance. Both Henry (1131-1182) and his son and successor Otto I.
                    (1182-1207) considerably extended their dopιains, and Otto deserves to be
                    remembered for the civic rights which by a happy innovation he bestowed on the
                    town of Zutphen in 1190. Gerhard III. (1207-1229) obtained from the emperor
                    Frederick II. the right of removing the toll of Arnheim to Lobith, where it long
                    proved the principal source of income to the countship. Otto II., son of Gerhard
                    III., greatly augmented his power and territory, and secured the internal
                    stability of his government by erecting numerous free communes, such as
                    Harderwijk, Arnheim, Emmerich, Lochern, &amp;c. Reinald I. (1271-1326) had the
                    chagrin of seeing the dukedom of Limberg, which fell to him by the death of his
                    father-in-law, seized by John I. of Brabant in 1288; but from the emperor Henry
                    VII. he received, in 1310, the right of bestowing full municipal privileges on
                    any free communities he might establish, and in 1317 he was raised to the rank
                    of prince of the empire by Frederick of Austria, which implied possession of
                    legislative authority and liberty to coin his own money. A steady increase of
                    power rewarded the exertions of Reinald II. (1326- 1339), and shortly before his
                    death (March 19, 1339) he received the hereditary title of duke of Guelderland
                    from the emperor Louis of Bavaria. The new duchy, however, had an ill beginning
                    of its history. Reinaid III., the natural successor, found a bitter rival in his
                    brother Edward, and in 1361, after a contest of eleven years, he was completely
                    defeated in the battle of Tiel; and though ten years later, on Edward’s death,
                    he recovered his rightful position, he survived his restoration only three
                    months. A protracted contest between the hostile factions was at length decided
                    in favour of William a nephew of the last duke, and son of William of Juliers,
                    who succeeded in 1378, but did not receive imperial recognition till 1383.
                    Between 1384 and 1386 he assisted the Teutonic knights against the Prussians;
                    and in 1393 he became duke of Juliers by the death of his father. He died 16th
                    February 1402, and was followed by his brother Reinaid IV., whose reign of three
                    and twenty years was mainly noticeable for several contests with Holland, the
                    surrender of Emmerich and other portions of territory, and the gradual
                    consolidation of the Guelderland states. Reinald IV. dying childless in 1423,
                    the coronet passed to his grand-nephew Arnold, the son of John of Egmond. Arnold
                    of Egmond was at first recognized by the emperor Sigismund in 1424, but in 1425
                    the emperor revoked his sanction, and gave his support to Adolphus of Cleves. In
                    the war that followed the people of Guelderland stood true to Arnold, but his
                    extravagance and carelessness brought the financial affairs of his duchy into
                    confusion; and at length, in 1444, after the defeat of his forces by Adolphus at
                    Linnich, he was constrained to pawn part of his territory to Cleves. The states
                    had complained of the maladministration in a diet of 1436, and the malcontents
                    ultimately, in 1456, found a leader in the duke’s own son Adolphus, who, after
                    an apparent reconciliation with his father made the old man a prisoner in
                    January 1465, and confined him in the castle of Büren. A civil war now broke
                    out, and Charles the Bold of Burgundy <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n257/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0257-0244"/> seized the opportunity for his own advantage; in
                    1471 Adolphus was forced to set his father at liberty; and Arnold, in return for
                    the service done him, made over his duchy to the Burgundian duke for 20,000
                    gulden, only reserving the usufruct till the close of his own life. On 23d
                    February 1473 Arnold died, and Charles was duke of Guelderland. The town of
                    Nimeguen made an heroic effort to oppose the Burgundian accession, but it fell
                    after a lengthened siege. On Charles’s death at the battle of Nancy in 1477, a
                    party in the powerful city of Ghent became anxious to marry Charles of Egmont to
                    their princess, Mary of Burgundy. Before the year was out, however (29th June
                    1477), the young man had perished before the walls of Tournay, against which he
                    had led an army of Burgundians and Flemings to recover it from the French. By
                    his marriage with the Princess Mary, Maximilian of Austria considered himself
                    the rightful possessor of Guelderland, and he succeeded by 1482 in quelling all
                    opposition. But ten years later young Charles of Egmond, the son of Adolphus,
                    set foot once more in his native country; the people soon flocked to his
                    standard; and victorious campaigns proved the capacity of the leader and the
                    enthusiasm of the soldiers. The fierce contest continued for years, and Charles
                    carried the war into the enemy’s territories. In 1507 he pushed into Holland and
                    Brabant, in 1512 appeared before Amsterdam, andin 1514 made capture of
                    Groningen. It was not till 1528 that Charles V. granted him the lifelong
                    occupation of Guelderland, Zutρhen, Groningen, Coevorden, and Drenthe. In return
                    he agreed that if he died childless his possessions should revert to the
                    emperor; but such was his hatred of the house of Austria that towards the close
                    of his life he planned to make France his heir. This, however, was prevented by
                    the states of Guelderland insisting on his appointing as his successor William,
                    the youthful son of the duke of Cleves and Juliers. Charles died 30th June 1538,
                    and William assumed the title of duke. But Charles V. was not disposed to give
                    up the rights secured by the treaty of Gorinchem, and after a contest in which
                    much damage was done to various parts of the Low Countries, William was obliged
                    to surrender his claims on 7th /September 1543. On the rise of the Dutch
                    republics most of Guelderland threw off the Spanish yoke. One “quarter” only,
                    that of Roermonde, continued subject, and it received the name of Spanish
                    Gelderland; the other three “quarters,” Nimeguen, Zutphen, and Arnheim, became
                    Dutch Guelderland, and had their provincial diets twice a year. By the peace of
                    Utrecht Spanish Guelderland or the Upper Quarter (Overkwartier) passed to
                    Prussia, including the town of Guelder.s, but excluding Venloo, which went to
                    the Netherlands, and Roermonde, which went to Austria. By the peace of Paris
                    (1814) the temporary divisions of the French revolutionary period were
                    abolished, and all Guelderland was incorporated with Holland except the portion
                    which still forms the Prussian circle of Düsseldorf.</p>
