                    constituting the order <hi rend="italic">Gramineoe.</hi> No plant is correctly
                    termed a grass which is not a member of this family, but the word is in common
                    language also used, generally in combination, for many plants of widely
                    different affinities which possess some resemblance (often slight) in foliage to
                    truly graminaceous species; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> knot-grass <hi

                    In agriculture the word has an extended signification to include the various
                    fodder-plants, chiefly leguminous, often called “artificial grasses” (see <hi

                    and Micheli (1729), embraced in addition the <hi rend="italic">Cyperaceoe,

                    the sexual system of Linnaeus (1735) served to mark off more distinctly the true
                    grasses from these allies, since very nearly all of the former then known fell
                    under his Triandria Digynia, whilst the latter found themselves under other ôf
                    his artificial classes and orders.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Structure.</hi> —The general type of true grasses is
                    familiar in the cultivated cereals of temperate climates— wheat, barley, rye,
                    oats, and in the smaller plants which make up our pastures and meadows and form
                    a principal factor of the turf of natural downs. Less familiar are the grains of
                    warmer climes—rice, maize, millet, and sorgho, or the sugar cane. Still further
                    removed are the bamboos of India and America, the columnar stems of which reach
                    to the height of forest trees. All are, however, formed on a common type, which
                    we proceed to examine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hoot.—</hi> Most cereals and many other grasses are annual, and
                    possess a tuft of very numerous slender root-fibres, much branched, and of great
                    length. The greater part of the order are of longer duration, and have the roots
                    also fibrous, but fewer, thicker, and less branched. In such cases they are very
                    generally given off from just above each node (often in a circle) of the lower
                    part of the stem or rhizome, perforating the leaf-sheaths. In some bamboos they
                    are very numerous from the lower nodes of the erect culms, and pass downwards to
                    the soil around them, whilst those from the upper nodes shrivel up and form
                    circles of spiny fibres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stem.—</hi> The root-stock of perennial grasses is usually well
                    developed, and often forms very long creeping or subterranean rhizomes, with
                    elongated internodes and sheathing scales; it is also frequently short, with the
                    nodes crowded. The very large root-stock of the bamboos (fig. 1) is a striking
                    example of “definite” growth; it is much branched, the short thick curved
                    branches being given off below the apex of the older ones and at right angles to
                    them, the whole forming a series of connected arched axes, truncate at their
                    ends which were formerly continued into leafy culms. The root-stock is always
                    solid, and has the usual internal structure of the monocotyledonous stem.</p>
                <p>The aerial leaf-bearing branches (Culms) are a characteristic feature of grasses.
                    They are generally numerous, erect, cylindrical (rarely flattened), and
                    conspicuously jointed with evident nodes. The nodes are solid, a strong plate of
                    tissue passing across the stem, but the internodes are commonly hollow, although
                    examples of completely solid stems are not uncommon (many Andropogons,
                    sugarcane). The general character is thus not unlike that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pmbelliferae.</hi> The exterior of the culms is more or less concealed by the
                    leaf-sheaths; it is usually smooth and often highly polished, the epidermal
                    cells containing an amount of silica sufficient to leave after burning a
                    distinct skeleton of their structure. Tabasheerisa white substance mainly
                    composed of silica, found in the joints of several bamboos. A few of the lower
                    internodes may become enlarged and sub-globular, forming nutriment-stores, and
                    grasses so changed are termed “bulbous” <hi rend="italic">(Arrhenatherum, Poa
                    bulbοsa,</hi> &amp;c.). In internal structure grass-culms, save in being hollow,
                    conform to that usual in monocotyledons; the vascular bundles run parallel in
                    the internodes, but a horizontal interlacement occurs at the partitions. Nearly
                    all grasses branch to some extent, and many extensively; the branches are
                    strictly distichous, and many buds are abortive, or the resulting branches short
                    and stunted. In many bamboos they are long and spreading or drooping and
                    copiously ramified, in others reduced to hooked spines. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diηochloa</hi> is truly scandent, and climbs over trees 100 feet or more in
                    height. <hi rend="italic">Clyra</hi><hi rend="italic">latifolia</hi> is also a
                    climber on a humbler scale.</p>
                <p>Grass-culms grow with great rapidity, as is most strikingly seen in bamboos,
                    where a height of over 100 feet is attained in from two to three months, and
                    many species grow two, three, or even more feet in twenty-four hours. Silicic
                    hardening does not commence till the full height is nearly attained. The largest
                    bamboo recorded is 170 feet, and the diameter is usually reckoned at about 4
                    inches to each 50 feet. A specimen in the British Museum is over 8 inches in
                    diameter. In the same collection are some remarkable monstrosities, in which the
                    septa are oblique and the internodes triangular or rhomboidal; Kurz has also
                    figured one in the Calcutta Museum in which the cavities are confluent into a
                    continuous spiral.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Leaves.—</hi> These present special characters usually
                    sufficient for ordinal determination. They are always solitary at each node and
                    strictly distichous, and consist of two distinct portions, the sheath and the
                    blade. The <hi rend="italic">sheath</hi> is often of great length, and generally
                    completely surrounds the culm; as a rule it is split down its whole length, thus
                    differing from that of <hi rend="italic">Cyperaceoe,</hi> which is almost
                    invariably <hi rend="italic">(Erwspora</hi> is an exception) a complete tube. In
                    a few grasses <hi rend="italic">(Melica,</hi><hi rend="italic">Browns')</hi> the
                    edges are soldered together as in the latter order. The sheaths are much dilated
                    in <hi rend="italic">Alopecnrus vaginatus</hi> and in a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Potmaochloa,</hi> in the latter serving as floats. At the summit
                    of the sheath, above the origin of the blade, is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ligule,</hi> a usually membranous process of small size (occasionally reaching
                    an inch in length) erect and pressed around the culm. It is rarely quite absent,
                    but may be represented by a tuft of hairs (very conspicuous in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pariana). Melica</hi><hi rend="italic">uniflora</hi> possesses, in addition to
                    the ligule, a green erect tonguelike process, from the line of junction of the
                    edges of the sheath.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">blade</hi> is frequently wanting or small and imperfect in
                    the basal leaves, but in the rest is long and set on to the sheath at an angle.
                    The usual form is familiar,—sessile, more or less ribbon-shaped, tapering to a
                    point, and entire at the edge. The chief modifications are the articulation of
                    the (deciduous) blade on to the sheath, which occurs in all the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bambuseoe</hi> (except <hi rend="italic">Plaηotia)</hi> and in <hi
                    rend="italic">Sp&gt;artinα</hi><hi rend="italic">stricta,</hi> and the
                    interposition of a petiole between the sheath and the blade, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Leptaspis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Pharus, Pariana,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lophatherum, &amp;c. In</hi> the latter case the form of the leaf
                    usually becomes oval, ovate, or even cordate or sagittate, but these forms are
                    found in sessile leaves also <hi rend="italic">(Olyra,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Panicum).</hi> The venation is strictly parallel, the midrib usually strong,
                    and the other ribs more slender. In <hi rend="italic">Anomochloa</hi> there are
                    several nearly equal ribs, and in some broad-leaved grasses <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Bambusece, Phams, Leptaspis)</hi> the venation becomes tesselated by
                    transverse connecting veins. The thick prominent veins in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agropyrum</hi> occupy the whole upper surface of the leaf. Epidermal appendages
                    are rare, the most frequent being marginal, saw-like, cartilaginous teeth,
                    usually minute, but occasionally <hi rend="italic">(Danthoηia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">scabra, Panicum serratum)</hi> so large as to give the margin a

                <p><hi rend="italic">Inflorescence.—</hi> This possesses an exceptional importance
                    in grasses, since, their floral envelopes being much reduced and the sexual
                    organs of very great uniformity, the characters employed for classification are
                    mainly derived from the arrangement of the flowers and their investing bracts.
                    The subject also presents unusual difficulties from the various interpretations
                    which have been given to these glumaceous organs and the different terms
                    employed for them by various writers. It may, however, be now considered as
                    settled that the whole of the bodies known as glumes and paleae, and
                    distichously arranged externally to the flower, form no part of the floral
                    envelopes, but are of the nature of bracts. These are so arranged round the
                    small flowers as to form <hi rend="italic">spikelets</hi> (locustae), and each
                    spikelet may contain one, two, three, or a greater number of flowers (in some
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Eragrostis</hi> nearly 60). The flowers are, as a
                    rule, placed laterally on the axis (rachis) of the spikelet, but in uniflorous
                    spikelets they appear to be terminal, and are probably really so in <hi
                    rend="italic">Anthoxanthum</hi> (fig. 9, 2) and in two anomalous genera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Anomochloa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Streptochaete.</hi></p>
                <p>In immediate relation with the flower itself, and often entirely concealing it,
                    is the <hi rend="italic">palea</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pale</hi> (“upper pale”
                    of most systematic agrostologists; “paleola interior,”</p>
                <p>Dumortier; “spathella,” Doll). This organ (fig. 3, 1) is peculiar to grasses
                    among <hi rend="italic">Hlumtferae,</hi> and is almost always present, certain
                    <hi rend="italic">Oryzeae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phalarideae</hi> being the
                    only exceptions. It is of thin membranous consistence, usually obtuse, often
                    bifid, and possesses no central rib or nerve, but is furnished with two lateral
                    ones, one on either side; the margins are frequently folded in at the ribs,
                    which thus become placed at the sharp angles. This structure points to the
                    fusion of two organs, and the pale was by R. Brown considered to represent two
                    portions soldered together of a trimerous perianth-whorl, the third portion
                    being the “lower pale,” to be immediately mentioned. By Bentham the homology of
                    the organ is suggested to be with the two bracteoles found in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hypolytrum pungens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Platyleρis,</hi> and with the
                    perigynium of the female flower of <hi rend="italic">Carex</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyperaceoe.</hi> It is rarely <hi rend="italic">(fΓriachyrum,
                    Diachy-rium)</hi> found split into two separate organs.</p>
                <p>The flower with its pale is sessile, and is placed in the axil of another bract
                    in such a way that the pale is exactly opposed to it, though at a slightly
                    higher level, It is this second bract which has been generally called by
                    systematists the “lower pale,” and with the “upper pale" considered to form an
                    outer floral envelope (“calyx,” Jussieu; “perianthium,” Brown; “stragulum,”
                    Palisot de Beauvois; “glumella,” Dumortier). In the writings of most botanists
                    even though this view is not held, yet, where the term “flower” is employed, it
                    includes these organs. It is, however, certain that the two bracts are on
                    different axes, one secondary to the other, and cannot therefore be parts of one
                    whorl of organs. This was made out from the study of so-called “viviparous”
                    grasses, in which the lower pales become transformed into ordinary foliage
                    leaves, first by Von Mohl in 1845, and more clearly by Germain de St Pierre in
                    1852, who terms the lower pale the “glume fertile.” Doll and Bentham hate also
                    independently arrived at the same result, and the latter in 1858 first published
                    the terminology here adopted, and used for the same organ the name <hi
                    rend="italic">flowering glume.</hi> The two bracts are usually quite unlike one
                    another, but in some genera (e.y., most <hi rend="italic">Festucaceae)</hi> they
                    are considerably similar in shape and appearance.</p>
                <p>The flowering glume has generally a more or less boatshaped form, is of firm
                    consistence, and possesses a well-marked central midrib and frequently several
                    lateral ones. The midrib in a large proportion of genera extends into an
                    appendage termed the <hi rend="italic">awn</hi> (fig. 10, 2), and the lateral
                    veins more rarely extend beyond the glume as sharp points <hi rend="italic"
                    >le.g., Pappoρhorum).</hi> The form of the flowering-glume is very various, this
                    organ being plastic and extensively modified in different genera. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Leρtaspis</hi> it is formed into a closed cavity by the union of
                    its edges, and encloses the flower, the styles projecting through the pervious
                    summit. Valuable characters are obtained from the awn. This presents itself
                    variously developed from a mere subulate point to an organ several inches in
                    length, and when complete (as in <hi rend="italic">Andropogoneoe, Aveneoe,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Stipeoe)</hi> consists of two well-marked portions, a
                    lower twisted part and a terminal straight portion, usually set in at an angle
                    with the former sometimes trifid and occasionally beautifully feathery. The
                    lower part is most often suppressed, and in the large group of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Paniceoe</hi> awns of any sort are very rarely seen. The awn may
                    be either terminal or may come off from the back of the flowering-glume, and
                    Duval Jouve’s observations have shown that it represents the blade of the leaf
                    of which the portion of the flowering-glume below its origin is the sheath; the
                    twisted part (so often suppressed) corresponds with the petiole, and the portion
                    of the glume extending beyond the origin of the awn (very long in some species,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Danthoηif)</hi> with the
                    ligule of the developed foliage-leaf. When terminal the awn has three
                    fibro-vascular bundles, when dorsal only one; it is covered with stomate-bearing
                    epidermis.</p>
                <p>The flower with its palea is thus sessile in the axil of a floriferous glume, and
                    in a few grasses <hi rend="italic">(Leeτsia</hi> (fig. 2), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coleαnthus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Nardus)</hi> the spikelet consists of nothing
                    more, but usually (even in uniflorous spikelets) other glumes are present. Of
                    these the two placed distichously opposite each other at the base of the
                    spikelet never bear any flower in their axils, and are called the <hi
                    rend="italic">basal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">empty glumes</hi> (fig. 10, 1).
                    They are the “glumes” of most writers (“paleae” of Dumortier), and together form
                    what was called the “gluma” by R. Brown (“tegmen,” Palisot de Beauvois). They
                    rarely differ much from one another, but one may be smaller or quite absent <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ρaηicum</hi> (fig. 8, 2), <hi rend="italic">Vulpia,
                    Paspal·iim,</hi><hi rend="italic">Lolium),</hi> or both be altogether
                    suppressed, as above noticed. They are commonly firm and strong, often enclose
                    the spikelet, and are rarely provided with long points or imperfect awns.
                    Generally speaking they do not share in the special modifications of the
                    flowering glumes, and but rarely themselves undergo modification, chiefly in
                    hardening of portions <hi rend="italic">(Sclerachne, Manisuris, Anteρhora,
                    Peltophorum),</hi> so as to afford greater protection to the flowers or fruit.
                    But it is usual to find, besides the basal glumes, a few other empty ones, and
                    these are in two-or more-flowered spikelets (fig. 11, 2) at the extremity
                    (numerous in <hi rend="italic">Lσphatherum),</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    qt</hi> in uniflorous ones (fig. 8, 2) below, interposed between the floral
                    glume and the basal pair. Descriptive writers have been accustomed to call these
                    empty glumes “barren” or “neutral flowers,” a misleading use of terms.</p>
                <p>The axis of the spikelet, when short and rounded, has been termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">callus,</hi> when long the <hi rend="italic">rachillus.</hi> It is
                    frequently jointed and breaks up into articulations above each flower. Tufts or

                    Phragmites, Aηdropogon),</hi> often so long as to surround and conceal the
                    flowers. The axis is often continued beyond the last flower or glume as a
                    bristle or stalk.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Involucres</hi> or organs outside the spikelets are not
                    unfrequent, the morphology of which is various. Thus in <hi rend="italic"

                    hard globular spiny case to the spikelets. The cup-shaped involucre of <hi

                    spikelet. True <hi rend="italic">bracts</hi> of a more general character

                    >Cyperaccoe,</hi> where they are so conspicuous. They however occur in a whole

                    at the apex, and contains the female spikelet, the stalks of the male
                    inflorescence and the long styles emerging through the smdl apical orifice.</p>
                <p>Any number of spikelets may compose the inflorescence, and their arrangement is
                    very various. In the spicate forms, with sessile spikelets on the main axis, the
                    latter is often dilated and flattened <hi rend="italic">{Paspalum),</hi> or is
                    more or less thickened and hollowed out <hi rend="italic">{Stenotaphrum,
                    Rottboellia, Tripsacum),</hi> when the spikelets are sunk and buried within the
                    cavities. Every variety of racemose and paniculate inflorescence obtains, and
                    the number of spikelets composing those of the large kinds is often immense.
                    Rarely the inflorescence consists of very few flowers; thus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lygeum</hi><hi rend="italic">Spartum,</hi> the most anomalous of European
                    grasses, has but two or three large uniflorous spikelets, which are fused

                    hooded spathe-like bract.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flower.—</hi> This is characterized by remarkable uniformity.
                    The <hi rend="italic">perianth</hi> is represented by very rudimentary, small,
                    fleshy, hypogynous scales called <hi rend="italic">lodicules</hi>
                    (“squamulae,”</p>
                <p>Kunth; “nectarium,” Schreber); they are elongated or truncate, sometimes fringed
                    with hairs, and are in contact with the ovary. Their usual number is two, and
                    they are placed collaterally at the anterior side of the flower, that is, within
                    the flowering glume. They are generally considered to represent the inner whorl
                    of the ordinary monocotyledonous (liliaceous) perianth, the outer whorl of these
                    being suppressed as well as the posterior member of the inner whorl. This latter
                    is present almost constantly in <hi rend="italic">Stipece</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Bambuseoe,</hi> which have three lodicules, and in the latter
                    group they are occasionally more numerous (five, spreading and persistent in <hi

                    lodicules, alternately arranged in two whorls. They are often quite absent. In
                    some cases lodicules are of the nature of stipules to the palea, and appear as
                    though split off from its sides at the base. Such stipular lodicules often
                    co-exist along with the perianthial ones, and are then either free from oτ
                    combined with the two anterior ones.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sexual Organs.—</hi> Grass-flowers are usually hermaphrodite,
                    but there are very many exceptions. Thus it is very common to find one or more
                    imperfect (usually male) flowers in the same spikelet with bisexual ones, and
                    their relative position is important in classification. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Holcus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arrhen-aiherum</hi> are examples in English
                    grasses; and as a rule in species of temperate regions separation of the sexes
                    is not carried further. In warmer countries monoecious and dioecious grasses are
                    more frequent. In such cases the male and female spikelets and inflorescence may
                    be very dissimilar, as in the maize, Job’s tears, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euchloena,</hi><hi rend="italic">Spinifex,</hi> &lt;fcc.; and in some dioecious
                    species this dissimilarity has led to the two sexes being referred to different

                    no such dimorphism obtains. <hi rend="italic">Amphicarpum</hi> is remarkable in
                    having cleistogamic flowers borne on long radical subterranean peduncles which
                    are fertile, whilst the conspicuous upper paniculate ones, though apparently
                    perfect, never produce fruit. Something similar occurs in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leersia oryzoides,</hi> where the fertile spikelets are concealed within the
                    leaf-sheaths.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Androecium.—</hi> In the vast majority there are three stamens
                    alternating with the lodicules, and therefore one anterior, <hi rend="italic"

                    contact with the palea. They are hypogynous, and have long and very delicate
                    filaments, and large, linear or oblong two-celled anthers, dorsifixed and
                    ultimately very versatile, deeply indented at each end, and commonly exserted
                    and pendulous. Suppression of the anterior stamen sometimes occurs <hi
                    rend="italic">(p.g., Aηthoxanthum),</hi> or the two posterior ones may be absent

                    On the other hand there is in some genera <hi rend="italic">{0ryza,</hi> most

                    the male flowers of a few monoecious genera <hi rend="italic">{Pariana·,</hi><hi

                    connate at the base, and with densely hairy or feathery stigmas (fig. 4).
                    Occasionally there is but a single style <hi rend="italic">{Nardus,</hi><hi

                <p>We thus see that, comparing the flower of <hi rend="italic">Gramineae</hi> with
                    the normal liliaceous plan (fig. 5), it differs in the complete suppression of
                    the outer row and the posterior member of the inner row of the perianth-leaves,
                    of the whole inner row of stamens, and of the anterior carpel, whilst the
                    remaining members of the perianth are in a rudimentary condition. But each or
                    any of the usually missing organs are to be found normally in different genera,
                    or as occasional developments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fruit.—</hi> The ovary ripens into a usually small ovoid or
                    rounded fruit, which is entirely occupied by the single large seed, from which
                    it is not to be distinguished, the thin pericarp being completely united to its
                    surface. To this peculiar fruit the term <hi rend="italic">caryopsis</hi> has
                    been applied (more familiarly “grain”); it is commonly furrowed longitudinally
                    down one side (usually the inner, but in <hi rend="italic">Coix</hi> and its
                    allies, the outer), and an additional covering is not unfrequently provided by
                    the adherence of the persistent palea, or even also of the flowering glume
                    (“chaff” of cereals). From this type are a few deviations; thus in <hi
                    rend="italic">Sporobohιs,</hi> &amp;c. (fig. 6), the pericarp is not united with
                    the seed but is quite distinct, dehisces, and allows the loose seed to escape.
                    Sometimes the pericarp is membranous, sometimes hard and brittle, whilst, on the
                    other hand, in some genera of <hi rend="italic">Dambuseoe,</hi> it becomes thick
                    and fleshy, forming a “berry,” or rather a drupe. In <hi rend="italic">Melocanna
                    baccifera</hi> this forms a fruit 3 or 4 inches long, with a pointed beak of 2
                    inches more; it is indehiscent, and the small seed germinates whilst the fruit
                    is still attached to the tree, putting out a tuft of roots and a shoot, and not
                    falling till the latter is 6 inches long. A similar germination also occurs in
                    <hi rend="italic">Pseudostackyum compactum,</hi> which has the largest fruit of
                    the order.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Seed.—</hi> The testa is thin and membranous but occasionally
                    coloured, and the embryo small, the great bulk of the seed being occupied by the
                    hard farinaceous endosperm (albumen) on which the nutritive value of the grain
                    depends.</p>
                <p>The embryo presents many points of interest. Its position is remarkable, closely
                    applied to the surface of the endosperm at the base of its outer side. This
                    character is absolute for the whole order, and effectually separates <hi
                    rend="italic">Gramineae</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Cyperaceae.</hi> The part in
                    contact with the endosperm is flat and plate-like, and is known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">scutellum.</hi> Some difference of opinion is held on the nature
                    of this; but it is probably correctly regarded (as by Van Tieghem) as the main
                    portion of the cotyledon, the white epigoeal sheath <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pileola)</hi> protecting the plumule—which is often described as the
                    cotyledon—being the ligule only of that organ greatly developed. The radicle is
                    inferior, broad, and blunt; the primary root is very slightly developed in
                    germination, but several secondary lateral ones burst through above its point,
                    and thus become surrounded at their base with little sheaths (coleorrhizae).</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Classification.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Gramineoe</hi>
                    are thus sharply defined from all other plants, and there are no genera as to
                    which it is possible to feel a doubt whether they should be referred to it or
                    not. The only order closely allied is <hi rend="italic">Cyperacece,</hi> and the
                    points of difference between the two have been alluded to above, but may be here
                    brought together. The best distinctions are found in the position of the embryo
                    in relation to the endosperm—lateral in grasses, basal in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyρeraceae—</hi> and in the possession by <hi rend="italic">Gramineae</hi> of
                    the 2-nerved palea below each flower. Less absolute characters, but generally
                    trustworthy ømd more easily observed, are the feathery stigmas, the always
                    distichous arrangement of the glumes, the usual absence of more general bracts
                    in the inflorescence, the split leaf-sheaths, and the hollow, cylindrical,
                    jointed culms,—some or all of which are wanting in all <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyperaceoe.</hi> The same characters will distinguish grasses from the other
                    glumiferous orders, <hi rend="italic">Pestiaceoe, Eriocauloneoe,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Desvauxi-acece,</hi> which are besides further removed by their
                    capsular fruit and pendulous ovules. To other monocotyledonous families the
                    resemblances are merely of adaptive or vegetative characters. Some <hi
                    rend="italic">Commelynaceoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Marantaceoe</hi> approach
                    grasses in foliage; the leaves of <hi rend="italic">Allium,</hi> Ac., possess a
                    ligule; the habit of some palms reminds one of the bamboos; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Juncaceae</hi> and a few <hi rend="italic">Liliaceoe</hi> possess
                    an inconspicuous scarious perianth.</p>
                <p>The great uniformity among the very numerous species of this vast family renders
                    its <hi rend="italic">classification</hi> very difficult. The difficulty has
                    been increased by the confusion resulting from the multiplication of genera
                    founded on slight characters, and from the description of identical plants under
                    several different genera in consequence of their wide distribution.</p>
                <p>No characters for main divisions can be obtained from the flower proper or fruit;
                    though both Kunth and Reichenbach have used them—especially the form of the
                    styles and stigmas, the lodicules and the caryopsis—they have not been generally
                    employed by botanists, who have found it necessary to trust to characters
                    derived from the usually less important inflorescence and bracts.</p>
                <p>The earlier authors made the general arrangement of the spikelets (spicate,
                    paniculate, &amp;c.) the basis of their classifications. Palisot de Beauvois’s
                    main divisions are founded on the existence in the same inflorescence of similar
                    or diverse spikelets. Fries has proposed a division into <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eury-</hi><hi rend="italic">antheae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clisanthece,</hi> according to the condition of the flowering glume and pale,
                    separated or close during inflorescence. Dumortier gives a classification into
                    <hi rend="italic">Eachideoe, Rachillifioroe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Callifioroe</hi>; the first with the spikelets inserted into excavations of the
                    rachis, the second with the flowers of the free spikelet inserted on its axis
                    (rachillus), and the last with the flower or flowers borne on the short callus
                    of the glumes. Both these systems, and others which have been suggested, possess
                    merits of their own, but they have not as yet been found capable of application
                    to the order as a whole, having been framed for the accommodation mainly of
                    European genera.</p>
                <p>For such general treatment no better primary divisions have been found than those
                    proposed by Robert Brown in 1810 and further elaborated in 1814, which have <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0067-0058"/> been accepted by Munro (1868) and Bentham (1878)
                    in their most recent revisions of the Cape and Australian genera. The basis of
                    Brown’s division of the whole order into <hi rend="italic">Paniceoe</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Poaceoe</hi> is the position of the most perfect flower in the
                    spikelet; this is the upper (apparently) terminal one in the first, whilst in
                    the second it occupies the lower position, the more imperfect ones (if any)
                    being above it. Munro has supplemented this by another character easier of
                    verification, and of even greater constancy, in the articulation of the pedicel
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Paniceoe</hi> immediately below the glumes; whilst in
                    <hi rend="italic">Poaceoe</hi> this does not occur, but the axis of the spikelet
                    frequently articulates <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the pair of empty basal
                    glumes. Neither of these two great divisions will well accommodate certain
                    genera allied to <hi rend="italic">Phalaris,</hi> for which Brown proposed
                    tentatively a third group (since named <hi rend="italic">Phalarideoe)·,</hi>
                    this, or at least the greater part of it, is placed by Bentham under the <hi

                <p>The following arrangement is based on the writings of these authors, but it
                    cannot be considered very satisfactory. Probably no serial disposition can
                    represeut the tangled network of genera related in different ways and various
                    degrees which make up this very natural but complicated family, and though some
                    of the following tribes ate fairly natural, the limits of others are but

                <p>Ill, <hi rend="smallcaps">Distribution.</hi> —Grasses are the most universally
                    diffused over the globe of all flowering-plants. There is no district in which
                    they do not occur, and in nearly all they are a leading and dominant feature of
                    the flora. In actual number of species <hi rend="italic">Gramineoe</hi> comes
                    considerably after <hi rend="italic">Compositae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leguminosoe,</hi> the two most numerous orders of phanerogams, but in number of
                    individual plants it probably far exceeds either; whilst from the wide extension
                    of many of its species, the proportion of <hi rend="italic">Gramineoe</hi> to
                    other orders in the various floras of the world is much higher than its whole
                    number of species would lead one to expect. This number can, however, scarcely
                    be put much below 6000, which is probably somewhat more than a fifth of all
                    monocotyledons. This is only about ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ⅛th of the
                    phanerogams as a whole, yet in any given locality, with a very few exceptions,
                    this proportion is largely exceeded. In tropical regions, where <hi
                    rend="italic">Leguminosoe</hi> is the leading order, grasses closely follow as
                    the second, whilst in the warm and temperate regions of the northern hemisphere,
                    in which <hi rend="italic">Compositoe</hi> takes the lead, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gramineoe</hi> again occupies the second position. As the colder latitudes are
                    entered the grasses become relatively more numerous, and are the leading family
                    in Arctic and Antarctic regions. The only countries where the order plays a
                    distinctly subor Jinate part are some extra-tropical regions of the southern

                    graminaceous species to the whole phanerogamic flora in different countries is
                    found to vary from nearly ∣th in the Arctic regions to about ⅛th at the Cape; in
                    the British Isles it is about -⅛th, The following are proportions per cent, in

                <p>The principal climatic cause influencing the number of graminaceous species
                    appears to be amount of moisture; it is only in very dry countries that they
                    become distinctly less numerous. A remarkable feature of the distribution of
                    grasses is its uniformity; there are no great centres for the order, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Compositoe,</hi> where a marked preponderance of endemic species
                    exists; and the genera, except some of the smallest or monotypic ones, have
                    usually a wide distribution. Speaking generally, however, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Panicaceoe</hi> are tropical and warm temperate plants, whilst the grasses of
                    temperate and colder regions are members of the <hi rend="italic">Poaceoe.</hi>
                    The former are very sparingly represented in Europe by a few species of the vast
                    tropical genera <hi rend="italic">Andropogoη</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Panicum.</hi><hi rend="italic">Poaceoe,</hi> on the other hand, form a fair
                    proportion of tropieal <hi rend="italic">Gramineoe,</hi> especially in the
                    higher districts ’ where, as in the mountains of Abyssinia, are several endemic
                    genera and many species. The largest tropical genus of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poaceoe</hi> is <hi rend="italic">Eragrostis.</hi></p>
                <p>The distribution of the tropical tribe <hi rend="italic">Bambuseoe</hi> is
                    interesting. There are 170 or more species, which are about equally divided
                    between the Indo-Malayan region and tropical America, only one species being
                    common to both. Apparently there is but a single native species ou the African
                    continent, where it has a wide range, and none are recorded for Australia,
                    though species may perhaps occur on the northern coast. One species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Arundinaria</hi> reaches northwards as far as Virginia, and the
                    elevation attained in the Andes by some species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chusquea</hi> is very remarkable,— one, <hi rend="italic">C. aristata,</hi>
                    being abundant from 15,000 feet up tσ nearly the level of perpetual snow.</p>
                <p>Many grasses are almost cosmopolitan, such as our common reed, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phragmites communis;</hi> and many range throughout the warm regions of the
                    globe, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Cynodon</hi><hi rend="italic">Dactylon, Eleusine
                    indica, Imperata arundinacea, Sporobolus</hi><hi rend="italic">indiens,</hi>
                    &amp;c., and such weeds of cultivation as species of <hi rend="italic">Setaria,
                    Echinochlοa,</hi> which are found over both Old and New Worlds. The recent
                    masterly revision of the whole of the Australian species by Bentham well
                    exhibits the wide range of the genera of the order in a flora generally so
                    peculiar and restricted as that of Australia. Thus of the 90 indigenous genera
                    (many monotypic or very small) only 14 are endemic, 1 extends to South Africa, 3
                    are common to Australia and New Zealand, 18 extend also into Asia, whilst no
                    less than 54 are found in both the Old and New Worlds, 26 being chiefly tropical
                    and 28 chiefly extra-tropical.</p>
                <p>Of specially remarkable species <hi rend="italic">L·ygeum</hi> is found on the
                    sea-sand of the eastern half of the Mediterranean basin, and the minute <hi
                    rend="italic">Coleanthus</hi> has only occasionally occurred at intervals in
                    three or four isolated spots in Europe (Norway, Bohemia, Normandy). Many
                    remarkable endemic genera occur in tropical America, including <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anomochloa</hi> of Brazil, and most of the large aquatic species with separated
                    sexes are found in this region. The only genus of flowering plants peculiar to
                    the arctic regions is the beautiful and rare grass <hi rend="italic">Pleuropogvn
