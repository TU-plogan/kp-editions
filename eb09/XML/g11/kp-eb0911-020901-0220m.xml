                    distinguished by the great size of their bill. Taken alone it is commonly a

                    a prefix is most usually added to indicate the species, as Pine-Grosbeak,
                    Cardinal-Grosbeak, and the like. By earlier writers the word was generally given
                    as an equivalent of the Linnaean <hi rend="italic">Loxia,</hi> but that genus,
                    as first established, has been found to include many forms which, according to
                    more recent notions, cannot possibly be placed in the same Family.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Pine-Grosbeak</hi><hi rend="italic">{Piηicola</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">enucleator)</hi> is, with the exception of the Hawfinch just
                    mentioned, the best known species to which the name is applied. It inhabits the
                    conifer-zone of both the Old and the New Worlds, seeking, in Europe and probably
                    elsewhere, a lower latitude as winter approaches—often journeying in large
                    flocks; and stragglers have occasionally reached the British Islands, though the
                    records of not more than half a dozen such occurrences can be wholly trusted
                    (Yarrell, <hi rend="italic">Dr. Birds,</hi> ed. 4, iι pp. 177- 179). In
                    structure and some of its habits much resembling a Bullfinch (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Finch,</hi> vol. ix. p. 192), but much exceeding that bird in
                    size, it has the plumage of a Crossbill (vol. vi. p. 614), and appears to
                    undergo exactly the same changes as do the members of the restricted genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Loxia,—</hi> the young being of a dull greenish-grey streaked with
                    brownish-black, the adult hens tinged with golden-green, and the cocks glowing
                    with crimson-red on nearly all the body-feathers, this last colour being
                    replaced after moulting in confinement by bright yellow. Nests of this species
                    were found in 1821 by Zetterstedt near Juckasjärwi in Swedish Lapland, but
                    little was really known with certainty concerning its nidification until 1855,
                    when the late Mr Wolley, after two years’ ineffectual search, succeeded in
                    obtaining in the not very distant district of Muonioniska well-authenticated
                    specimens with the eggs, both of which are like exaggerated Bullfinches’. The
                    food of this species seems to consist of the seeds and buds of many sorts of
                    trees, though the staple may very possibly be those of some kind of pine. The
                    cock has a clear and pleasing song, which makes him in many countries a
                    favourite cage-bird; and the notes of the hen may even be deemed to qualify her
                    as a musician of no small merit.</p>
                <p>Allied to the Pine-Grosbeak are a number of species of smaller size, but its
                    equals in beauty of plumage.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    that an English writer would have to call “Grosbeaks.”</p></note> These have
                    been referred to several genera, such as <hi rend="italic">Carpodacus,
                    Propasser, Bycanetes, Uragus,</hi> and others; but possibly <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carpodacus</hi> is sufficient to contain all. Most of them are natives of the
                    Old World, and chiefly of its eastern division, but several inhabit the western
                    portion of North America, and one, <hi rend="italic">C. githagineus</hi> (of
                    which there seem to be at least two local races), is an especial native of the
                    deserts, or their borders, of Arabia and North Africa, extending even to some of
                    the Canary Islands—a singular modification in the <hi rend="italic">habitat</hi>
                    of a form which one would be apt to associate exclusively with forest trees, and
                    especially conifers.</p>

                    >virginianus,</hi> next claims notice here, though doubts may be entertained as
                    to the family to which it really belongs. No less remarkable for its bright
                    carmine attire, and the additional embellishment of an elongated crest of the
                    same colour, than for its fine song, it has been an object of attraction almost
                    ever since the settlement of its native country by Europeans. All American
                    ornithologists speak of its easy capture and its ready adaptation to
                    confinement, which for nearly three centuries have helped to make it a popular
                    cage-bird on both sides of the Atlantic. The vocal powers possessed by the cock
                    are to some extent shared by the hen, though she is denied the vivid hues of her
                    partner, and her plumage, with exception of the wings and tail, which are of a
                    dull red, is light olive above and brownish-yellow beneath. This species
                    inhabits the eastern parts of the United States southward of 40 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> β</hi> N. lai., and also occurs in the Bermudas. It is
                    represented in the south-west of North America by other forms that by some
                    writers are deemed species, and in the northern parts of South America by the
                    <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">phoeniceus,</hi> which would really
                    seem entitled to distinction. Another kindred bird, placed from its short and
                    broad bill in a different genus, and known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pyrrlιuloxia</hi><hi rend="italic">sinuata</hi> or the Texan Cardinal, is found
                    on the southern borders of the United States and in Mexico; while among North
                    American “Grosbeaks” must also be named the birds belonging to the genera <hi
