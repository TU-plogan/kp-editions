                    fabrics or paper were immersed in cold concentrated nitric acid for a short
                    time, the free acid being subsequently removed by washing, these materials
                    became, without important alteration of structure, converted into substances
                    possessed of explosive properties. These were at the time accepted as closely
                    allied to the substance named <hi rend="italic">xyloidin,</hi> described some
                    years previously by Braconnet, which is obtained by adding water to a solution
                    of starch in cold nitric acid. But subsequent observation established the
                    identity of these explosive products with the explosive cotton, or gun-cotton,
                    of which in 1845 Schönbein announced the discovery, and which he at once
                    proposed as a substitute for gunpowder. Soon after this announcement Böttger and
                    Otto published the method of producing guncotton by immersing carded cotton in
                    cold concentrated nitric acid, and subsequently Knop introduced the more
                    advantageous method of treating the cotton wool with a mixture of nitric and
                    sulphuric acids, the latter being used as a dehydrater of the nitric acid, and
                    as an absorbent of the water eliminated by the nitrification of the cellulose or
                    cotton fibre. The composition of gun-cotton was subsequently made the subject of
                    study by Böttger, Pélouze, Péligot, Von Kirchhoff, Sobrero, Béchamp, Porret,
                    Crum, Gladstone, Hadow, and others, and various formulae were proposed as
                    representing its composition. The divergence of opinion on this point arose
                    partly from difficulties attending the preparation of uniform products, and the
                    obtaining of trustworthy analytical results with these, and partly from
                    differences of opinion regarding the nature of the chemical reaction, whereby
                    the cellulose becomes converted into an explosive body. The products obtained in
                    the earlier investigations differed very much as regards their solubility in
                    mixtures of alcohol and ether, and also with respect-to the proportion which
                    their weight bore to that of the cotton wool employed in the experimental
                    operations. Crum was the first to entertain the view that gun-cotton might be
                    regarded as cellulose, in which the two or three atoms of hydrogen are replaced
                    by their equivalent of nitric peroxide. This view was afterwards also advanced
                    by Gerhardt, and it received strong support from the researches of Hadow, whose
                    results established the fact that several distinct varieties of pyroxilin could
                    be produced by varying the proportions of nitric and sulphuric acids used, and
                    who definitely established the composition of three of these, the most explosive
                    of which constituted the chief proportion of the product ordinarily obtained as
                    gun-cotton, and had the composition expressed by the name trinitrocellulose.
                    This highest nitro-product in its pure state is insoluble in mixtures of ether
                    and alcohol, whereas the lower products (one of which is the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">collodion gun-cotton,</hi> used for photographic purposes, see·
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Collodion,</hi> vol.vi. p. 149) differed in regard to their
                    ready solubility in different mixtures of those solvents. Crum’s formula for
                    pyroxilin, thus confirmed by Hadow, was afterwards strongly supported by
                    Schrötter, Redtenbacher, and Schneider, in their joint investigation of
                    gun-cotton manufactured in Austria by the improved process of Von Lenk, and
                    though again disputed by Pélouze and Maury, and by Champion and Pellet, the
                    correctness of the formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"

                    conclusively established in 1866 by the exhaustive analytical and synthetical
                    experiments of Abel. In the manufacture of gun-cotton, even when most carefully
                    conducted, the most explosive product, trinitrocellulose, is never obtained in a
                    condition even approaching purity; it always contains an admixture (ranging from
                    4 to 10 per cent, in the products of highest quality) of the lower
                    nitrocellulose products, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the soluble varieties of
                    gun-cotton. In addition to these impurities it contains, even when the cotton
                    employed has been submitted to purification by treatment with alkali, small
                    proportions of nitrogenized matters, soluble in alcohol, formed from resinous or
                    fatty substances retained within the cotton fibre. These substances are very
                    much more prone to undergo decomposition (with development of nitrogen acids) by
                    exposure to heat or light than the cellulose derivatives themselves; and Abel’s
                    experiments demonstrated that the uncertain stability of gun-cotton, which
                    brought this material into bad repute not long after its discovery, from the
                    occurrence of disastrous explosions arising apparently from its spontaneous
                    decomposition, was ascribable primarily to the development of free acid in the
                    gun-cotton by the action of comparatively moderate heat or of light upon these
                    impurities.</p>
                <p>The occurrence of a violent explosion at the works of Messrs Hall of Faversham,
                    not long after they had commenced the manufacture of Schönbein’s gun-cotton
                    wool, followed by a similar casualty in France, led to the abandonment of
                    endeavours to apply this substance, within a brief period of its discovery,
                    except in Austria, where Von Lenk persevered in attempts to devise means for
                    obtaining it in a purer and therefore more stable condition, as well as for
                    bringing its explosive action sufficiently under control to permit of its
                    advantageous employment as a substitute for gunpowder, not only for destructive
                    but also for projectile purposes. The system of manufacture elaborated by Von
                    Lenk consisted in loosely spinning long staple cotton into yarn of various sizes
                    and different compactness; this yarn was converted into gun-cotton by very
                    careful treatment with a large excess of the strongest nitric and sulphuric
                    acids, the product being immersed for many weeks in running water, and then
                    treated with weak alkali; the guncotton yarn and thread were either wound more
                    or less compactly on reels or cores, for employment in firearms, or made up into
                    very compact ropes with hollow cores, or into plaits, of lamp-wick form, for
                    employment in shells or mines. The rapidity of explosion of the gun-cotton, <hi
                    rend="italic">in open air,</hi> or under slight confinement, was thus brought to
                    a great extent under control, but if the resistance opposed to the expansion of
                    the highly heated gases upon the first ignition of the confined gun-cotton
                    developed sufficient pressure to cause them at once to penetrate the inner
                    structure of gun-cotton fibre which composed a charge, a sudden and violent
                    explosion was thus brought about. Hence no practical advance was made in the
                    reduction of the violence <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0291-0278"/> of action of gun-cotton by Von Lenk’s researches.
                    By the system which Abel has more recently elaborated the fibre after its
                    conversion into gun-cotton is reduced to a very fine state of division; when in
                    this condition the explosive substance is readily converted into sheets or
                    granules, or by compression into homogeneous masses of various degrees of
                    compactness, and of any desired form. In this manner the rapidity of action or
                    explosion of gun-cotton may be reduced to a minimum, though uniformity of action
                    in firearms is still very difficult to attain with it. As the reduction of the
                    gun-cotton fibre to a very fine state of division greatly facilitates the
                    removal by washing, and by alkaline treatment, of the small quantities of
                    unstable impurities already spoken of, the stability of gun-cotton as now
                    manufactured is much greater than that of former products. Compressed gun-cotton
                    needs, like the other forms in which this explosive has been used, very strong
                    confinement for the development of violent explosion, but this can be readily
                    accomplished without any confinement of the substance, through the agency of an
                    initiative detonation; the explosion of 2 grains of strongly confined mercuric
                    fulminate wι <hi rend="italic">close contact with the compressed material</hi>
                    suffices to ensure this result (see <hi rend="italic">Detonations</hi> article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Explosives,</hi> vol. viii. p. 809). Gun-cotton contains in
                    the normal (air dry) condition 2 per cent, of water. The compressed material of
                    the ordinary density ( = about 1) contains from 25 to 30 per cent, of water when
                    saturated; even with 15 per cent, it is uninflammable, and when containing 17-20
                    per cent, it may be cut and drilled with perfect safety. If gun-cotton contains
                    more than the normal 2 per cent, of water it can no longer be detonated by the
                    minimum quantity of fulminate, and the strength of the initiative detonation has
                    to be increased in proportion to the amount of water it contains; when it
                    contains 17 per cent, of water, its detonation cannot be accomplished with less
                    than 200 grains of confined fulminate. An initiative charge of 1 ounce of air
                    dry guncotton (detonated by means of an ordinary fulminate fuze) suffices,
                    however, to ensure the detonation of wet gun-cotton (as used in mines,
                    torpedoes, rockets, &amp;c.). The susceptibility of gun-cotton to detonation
                    when wet (and therefore perfectly uninflammable) gives this substance a great
                    advantage over other explosive agents, as it may be stored in a perfectly
                    harmless condition (wet gun-cotton being quite unalterable) and at once used in
                    that state as a powerful destructive agent through the agency of a detonating
                    charge. The explosive action of wet gun-cotton is somewhat sharper than that of
                    the dry material, the detonation being transmitted through its mass with greater
                    rapidity in consequence of the displacement of air in its pores by the
                    incompressible liquid. Gun-cotton, if it consists entirely of trinitrocellulose,
                    does not contain sufficient oxygen for the complete oxidation of its carbon;
                    hence more work can be accomplished with a given weight of gun-cotton if a solid
                    oxidizing agent (a nitrate ora chlorate) be incorporated with it in proportion
                    sufficient for complete oxidation. The compressed preparations (chlorated or
                    nitrated gun-cotton) are as sensitive to detonation as guncotton itself, but are
                    less sudden or sharp in their action. These preparations, first manufactured by
                    Abel, were extensively experimented with some years ago, and one of them,
                    prepared with barium nitrate, is now manufactured under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">tonite</hi> for blasting purposes. Preparations allied to
                    gun-cotton, in the production of which woodfibre is used as the starting point,
                    are manufactured for sporting and blasting purposes under the name of Schulze’s
                    powder, sawdust powder, and patent gunpowder, <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. a.
