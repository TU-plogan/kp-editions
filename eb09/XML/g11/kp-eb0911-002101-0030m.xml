                    one of the best of the English minor poets, was born in or about the year 1325;
                    but the date is not exactly known. It has been conclusively shown by Sir Harris
                    Nicolas that he belonged to the county of Kent. His family was wealthy; and he
                    seems to have had various country houses. So far as we know he did not marry
                    till 1397, when he was united to Agnes Groundolf. He was an intimate friend of
                    Chaucer; but there is no evidence to prove that they were fellowstudents. A few
                    years after his marriage, Gower became blind, and had to give up writing. He
                    spent his declining years in the priory of St Mary Overies, or, as it is now
                    called, St Saviour’s, in Southwark, where his monument is still to be seen.</p>
                <p>Near the close of the <hi rend="italic">Confessio Amantis,</hi> Gower puts the
                    following compliment to Chaucer into the mouth of Venus:— “And greet weel
                    Chaucer when ye meet,</p>
                <p>As my disciple and my poet;</p>
                <p>For in the noures of his youth, In sundry wise, as he well couth Of ditties and
                    of songes glade, The which he for my sake made, The land fulfilled is over all
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In these lines he was merely requiting a compliment that had been paid him some
                    years before by his brother-poet, who, in dedicating to him his <hi
                    rend="italic">Troilus</hi><hi rend="italic">and Cressida,</hi> addressed him as
                    “0 moral Gower,” an epithet which, though not remarkably happy, has stuck to
                    him. Gower died in 1408. In his will he leaves a number of religious legacies to
                    various ecclesiastical persons and institutions, and £100, along with the rents
                    of his manors, to his wife Agnes. The beautiful church in which Gower lies was
                    rebuilt in great part at his expense, and proves, among other things, that he
                    must have been exempt from one of the usual misfortunes of poets—poverty.</p>
                <p>Gower’s poetical works are four in number— <hi rend="italic">Balades</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">and other Poems,</hi> in French, printed in 1818 for the Roxburghe
                    Club; the <hi rend="italic">Speculum Meditantis,</hi> a treatise on the duties
                    of married life, written in French verse, and divided into ten books; <hi
                    rend="italic">Vox</hi><hi rend="italic">Clamantis,</hi> a narrative in Latin
                    elegiacs, of the insurrection of the commons in the reign of Richard II.; and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Confessio Amantis.</hi> The second of these works is
                    believed to have perished; of the third there is a good edition by the Rev. H.
                    O. Coxe, printed for the Roxburghe Club in 1850; and the fourth was first
                    printed by Caxton in 1483. The <hi rend="italic">Confessio Amantis,</hi> or
                    Lover’s Confession, is a huge miscellaneous collection of physical,
                    metaphysical, and moral reflexions, and of stories culled from the common
                    repertories of the Middle Ages. A kind of unity is given to these apparently
                    incongruous materials by the form of the poem, which is a dialogue between a
                    lover and his confessor, who is a priest of Venus, and is called Genius. In the
                    moral part of his theme, Gower is confessedly wise, impressive, and sometimes
                    almost <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n31/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0031-0022"/> sublime. But, as Ellis, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Specimens of the Early English Poets,</hi> observes, “His narrative is often
                    quite petrifying; and when we read in his works the tales with which we have
                    been familiarized in the poems of Ovid, we feel a mixture of surprise and
                    despair at the perverse industry employed in removing every detail on which the
                    imagination had been accustomed to fasten. The author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metamorphoses</hi> was a poet, and at least sufficiently fond of ornament.
                    Gower considers him as a mere annalist, scrupulously preserves his facts,
                    relates them with great perspicuity, and is fully satisfied when he has
                    extracted from them as much morality as they can reasonably be expected to
                    furnish.” As Professor Lowell has well remarked, Gower “has positively raised
                    tediousness to the precision of a science.” Though his descriptions are often
                    extremely agreeable, and his diction easy and smooth, his prolixity, and the
                    prosaic feebleness of the conceptions, will prevent the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lover's Confession</hi> from ever rivalling the writings of Chaucer, or even
                    approximating them in popularity.</p>
