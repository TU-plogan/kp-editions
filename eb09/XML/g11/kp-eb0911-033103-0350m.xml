                    between the Bias and the Ravi. An intrusive spur of the British dominions runs
                    northward into the lower Himalayan ranges, to include the mountain sanatarium of
                    Dalhousie. This station crowns the most westerly shoulder of a magnificent snowy
                    range, the Dhâola Dhâr, between which and the plain two minor ranges intervene.
                    Below the hills stretches a picturesque and undulating plateau covered with
                    abundant timber and made green by a copious rainfall, and watered by the streams
                    of the Bâri Doâb, which, diverted by dams and embankments, now empty their
                    waters into the Bias directly, in order that their channels may not interfere
                    with the Bâri Doâb canal. The district contains several large and important <hi
                    rend="italic">jhils</hi> or swampy lakes. Few facts can now be recovered with
                    regard to the early annals of Gurdâspur. Our first distinct historical knowledge
                    begins with the rise of the Sikh confederacy. The whole of the Punjab then was
                    distributed to the chiefs who triumphed over the imperial governors. In the
                    course of a few years, however, the famous Ranjit Sinh acquired all the
                    territory which those chiefs had held. Pathânkot and the neighbouring villages
                    in the plain, together with the whole hill portion of the district, formed part
                    of the area ceded by the Sikhs to the East India Company after the first Sikh
                    war in 1846. In 1861-62, after receiving one or two additions, the district was
                    brought into its present shape, having its headquarters at Gurdâspur.</p>
                <p>Owing to the numerous transfers of territory which took place between the census
                    of 1855 anil 1868, it is impossible to give a detailed comparison of their
                    results. The enumeration of 1868 was taken over an area of 1822 square miles,
                    and it disclosed a total population of 906,126 persons,—males, 501,247; females,
                    404,879. Classified according to religion there are—Hindus, 303,107; Mahometans,
                    422,196; Sikhs, 79,387; anti “others,” 101,436. Only six towns have a population
                    exceeding 5000, namely, Batâla, 26,897; Deni Manak, 7199; Dinânagar, 6626;
                    Sujanpur, 6556; Kalanaur, 6030; and Srigovindpur, 5531. Gurdâspur, the chief
                    town and administrative headquarters of the district, had only 4137 inhabitants
                    in 1875. The sanatarium of Dalhousie, 7687 feet above sea-lével, though only
                    returned as containing 2019 inhabitants, has a large fluctuating population
                    during the warmer months. The district possesses throughout an excellent soil,
                    except in some small patches on the Bias side, where sand covers the surface.
                    The chief agricultural staples comprise wheat, barley, and gram for the spring
                    harvest, with rice, pulses, cotton, and sugar-cane for the autumn crop. Abundant
                    means of irrigation exist where required, either from canals, wells, or mountain
                    streams; but in no part of the Punjab province can better crops be produced
                    without such artificial aid. In 1875-76 the total cultivated area amounted to
                    855,675 acres, of which 140,639 acres were protected by irrigation against the
                    effects of drought. The trade of the district consists mainly in the export of
                    its agricultural produce. The imports are insignificant,—English piece-goods,
                    salt, and fancy articles forming the main items. The local traffic centres on
                    Batala. The principal road of the district connects Amritsar with Pathânkot, at
                    the foot of the hills, and passes through Batâla, Gurdâspur, and Dinânagar. The
                    total mileage of highways in 1875-76 showed 54 miles of metalled and 507 miles
                    of unmetalled road. The total revenue in 1876 was £123,608. In 1875-76 the
                    district contained 12 civil and revenue judges; and 14 officers exercised
                    magisterial powers. In the same year the police force numbered 596 men,
                    supplemented by a large body of rural watchmen. In 1875-76 there were 112
                    schools, having an aggregate roll of 5708 pupils. The climate of Gurdâspur is
                    not unhealthy, but large swamps and excessive irrigation expose some
                    neighbourhoods to malarious fevers and ague. The mean temperature for 1871 was
                    86 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 85° in May and 53’8° in December at Gurdâspur,
                    and 67 ’ 8° in May and 46 ’ 96° in December at Dalhousie. The average annual
                    rainfall for eight years ending 1873-74 was 30 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 96
                    inches. Seven charitable dispensaries afforded relief (1875—76) to 80,614
                    persons.</p>
