                    Chambal river, dividing it from the British districts of Agra and Etâwah; on the
                    E. by Bundelkhand and Sâgar (Saugor) districts; on the S. by the states of
                    Bhopal and Dhar; on the W. by those of R∙ιjgarh, Jhaläwar, and Kotah; and on the
                    N.W. by the Chambal, separating it from Karauli (Kerowlee), and Dholpùr in
                    Râjputàna. The extreme points of the Gwalior territory are in 23° 2Γ and 26° 52'
                    N. lat., 76° 3Γ and 79° 2Γ E. long. The area, including part of the ancient
                    province of Agra and most of Malwa, is 33,119 square miles. The extreme
                    north-eastern part is generally level, bare, and of no great fertility. A little
                    farther south the surface rises into hills. The country is dotted over with
                    small hills, which start abruptly out of the level plain. On one of these stands
                    the fortress of Gwalior. The geological formation of these rocky eminences is a
                    very fine-grained sandstone, yielding an excellent building stone. The middle
                    tract is a plateau, having probably an average elevation of about 1500 feet. The
                    Mandu range running east and west forms the southern boundary of the plateau,
                    sloping gently northwards towards it, and dipping precipitously southwards
                    towards the Narbadâ (Nerbudda). The state is watered by numerous rivers. The
                    Nerbudda, flowing west, forms the boundary of the most southern part of the
                    state. The greater part of the drainage is discharged into the Chambal, which
                    forms the north-western and northern and eastern boundary. The Sind, with its
                    tributaries the Kuwâri, Asar, Sankh, and other smaller streams, flows through
                    the state. The chief products are opium, known asMalwa opium, wheat, gram,
                    pulses of various kinds, <hi rend="italic">joar, bajra, mug,</hi> maize, rice,
                    linseed and other oil-seeds, garlic, tumeric, ginger, sugar-cane, indigo, <hi
                    rend="italic">al</hi> yielding a fine red dye, tobacco, and cotton. Many species
                    of wild beasts and birds are found throughout the state. The rivers abound in
                    fish, especially of the carp kind.</p>
                <p>Burhânpur is the site of a considerable manufacture of fine cottons, silks, and
                    rich brocades. Iron ore is raised and smelted in many places. The principal
                    imports are British woollens, cottons, silks, cutlery, cashmere shawls, pearls
                    from the Persian Gulf, Ceylon diamonds, and agates from Bundelkhand, gold,
                    silver, mercury, copper, lead, and zinc. The chief exports are opium, cotton,
                    tobacco, dyes, and iron. The Indore and Ajmere narrow-gauge railway, now (1879)
                    in course of construction, will pass through the west of Gwalior state, while a
                    railway on the broad gauge, to connect Gwalior town with Agra, is approaching
                    completion.</p>
                <p>During the hot and dry seasons the climate is not unhealthy, but during the rainy
                    season fevers prevail, especially in the north. The range of the thermometer is
                    unusually small, except during the sultry season, when it sometimes rises to
                    nearly 100° during the day. The average rainfall during the rainy season is 50
                    inches.</p>
                <p>The population of the north-eastern part of this territory is of many elements,
                    comprising, besides Marhattâs (the ruling race), Bundelas, Jâts, and Râjputs,
                    with some less distinctly defined divisions of Hindus and Mahometans. There is
                    perhaps no part of India where the tribes of Brâhmans are so various and their
                    number so great as in the southern and south-western parts. The Mahometan
                    population is estimated at about a twentieth of the whole. Including the
                    cessions to Sindhia under the treaty of 1860, the territories of the Gwalior
                    state were in 1875 estimated to contain a population of about 2,500,000 souls.
                    The total revenue in 1875 was &lt;£1,200,000. Education is afforded by 92
                    schools attended by 3206 pupils.</p>
                <p>The Gwalior family, whose armies and chiefs have played so conspicuous a part in
                    the history of India, and whose representative now rules over a state larger
                    than Scotland and Wales united, and richer than many independent kingdoms, was
                    founded by Ranoji Sindhia, whose father was <hi rend="italic">pdtel</hi>
                    (head-man) of a Deccan village. Once in the household of the peshwâ, Ranoji’s
                    rise was rapid, and he was soon at the head of the bodyguard. After heading many
                    Marhattâ raids through Malwa into Hindustan, he was at the time of his death the
                    acknowledged possessor of lands which still form part of the Gwalior state. He
                    was succeeded by his son Mahâdaji Sindhia, whose ability as a statesman and a
                    soldier has rarely been surpassed. At his death he was succeeded by his
                    grand-nephew Daulat Rao Sindhia. The power of Sindhia was at this time most
                    dangerous to the. British Government, who now began to take measures to check
                    the power of this chief. Sindhia entered into a league with the raja of Berar to
                    defeat their aim, but their allied armies were defeated in 1803 at Assaye by a
                    British force commanded by General Sir Arthur Wellesley, subsequently duke of
                    Wellington. By the end of the same year, the Marhattâs were completely
                    overthrown, and Sindhia was compelled to sue for peace and to sign a treaty by
                    which he resigned his conquered territories. Eventually, by a treaty concluded
                    in 1805, Gwalior and Gohad were ceded to Sindhia. Daulat Râo died at Gwalior in
                    1827 without an heir. On his deathbed, he left the state and succession in the
                    hands of the British Government. The succession of a boy of the Sindhia family,
                    Mιigat Rao, to whom it was thought the wishes of Daulat Râo turned, was admitted
                    by the British Government. The young maharaja was subsequently married to the
                    granddaughter of Daulat Râo, and took the name of Janakji Sindhia. In 1843 he
                    died without issue. His widow, with the concurrence of the chief nobles, adopted
                    Bajirât Râo, a lad eight years of age. The British Government recognized the
                    adoption, and Bajirât Râo, under the name of Bâji Rao Sindhia, succeeded, and is
                    the present ruler (1879). Early in the regency disturbances took place, and the
                    advance of British troops on Gwalior became necessary to restore order. Two
                    battles, Maliârâjpur and Panniar, were fought on the same day—the 29th December
                    1843—between the British forces and the mutinous army. They both resulted in the
                    total defeat of the Gwalior troops. No event of historical importance has taken
                    place since, except the revolt between the Gwalior contingent and Sindhia’s aπny
                    iu 1857. The maharaja’s conduct throughout has been conspicuous for its loyalty.
                    In recognition of his services, the Government conferred upon him the right of
                    adoption, together with lands yielding a revenue of £30,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gwalior,</hi> the capital of Gwalior state, and fortress
                    residence of the Mahârâjâ Sindhia, is situated in 26° 13' N. lat. and 78° 12' E.
                    long., 65 miles S. from Agra, and 277 N.W. of Allahâbâd. Gwalior city has a
                    threefold interest :—first, as a very ancient seat of Jain worship: <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n365/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0365-0346"/> secondly, for its example of palace architecture
                    of the best Hindu period (1486-1516); and thirdly, as the fortress capital of
                    one of the greatest native chiefs of India.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Jxin Remains.—</hi> There are several remarkable Hindu temples
                    in Gwalior. One, known as the Sas Bahu, understood to be of Jain erection, is
                    beautifully adorned with bas-reliefs, and is now resorted to both by the
                    Vaishnav and Siva sects. It was finished in 1093 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi>
                    D., and, though much dilapidated, still forms a most picturesque fragment. An
                    older Jain temple has been used as a mosque. Another temple in the fortress of
                    Gw⅛lior is called the <hi rend="italic">Teli-kα-Mandir,</hi> or “Oilman’s
                    Temple.” This building was originally dedicated to Vishnu, but afterwards
                    converted to the worship of Siva. The most striking part of the Jain remains at
                    Gwalior is a series of caves or rock-cut sculptures, excavated in the rock on
                    all sides, and numbering nearly a hundred, grèat and small. Most of them are
                    mere niches to contain statues, though some are cells that may have been
                    originally intended for residences. One curious fact regarding them is that,
                    according to inscriptions, they were all excavated within the short period of
                    about thirty-three years, between 1441 and 1474. Some of the figures are of
                    colossal size; one, for instance, is 57 feet high, which is taller than any
                    other in the north of India.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hindu Palace Architecture.—</hi> The palace built by Mau Sinh
                    (1486- 1516) forms the most interesting example of early Hindu work of its class
                    in India. Another palace of even greater extent was added to this one in 1516;
                    both Jahangir and Shah Jahan added palaces to these two,—the whole making a
                    group of edifices unequalled for picturesqueness and interest by anything of
                    their claes in Central India. Among the apartments in the palace was the
                    celebrated chamber, named the <hi rend="italic">Baradari,</hi> supported on 12
                    columns, and 45 feet square, with a stone roof, forming one of the most
                    beautiful palace-halls in the world. It was, besides, singularly interesting
                    from the expedients to which the Hindu architect was forced to resort to imitate
                    the vaults of the Moslems. Of the buildings, however, which so excited the
                    admiration of the emperor Bâbar, probably little now remains.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rock Fortress.—</hi> The fort of Gwalior stands on an isolated
                    rock. The face of the fort is perpendicular, and where the rock is naturally
                    less precipitous it has been scarped. Its greatest length from northcast to
                    south-west is a mile and a half, and the greatest breadth 300 yards. The rock
                    attains its maximum height of 342 feet at the northern end. A rampart,
                    accessible by a steep road, and farther up by huge steps cut out of the rock,
                    surrounds the fort. The citadel stands at the north-eastern corner of the
                    enclosure, and presents a very picturesque appearance. The old town of Gwalior,
                    which is of considerable size, but irregularly built, and extremely dirty, lies
                    at the eastern base of the rock. It contains the tomb of Muhammad Ghaus, which
                    was erected during the early part of Akbar’s reign. The fort of Gwalior,
                    according to Wilford, was built in 773 A.D. by Surya Sen, the raja of the
                    neighbouring country. In 1196 Gwalior was captured by Mahmud Ghori; it then
                    passed into the hands of several chiefs until in 1556 Akbar gained possession of
                    it, and made it a state prison for captives of rank. Ou the dismemberment of the
                    Delhi empire, Gwalior was seized by the Jit rânâ of Gohad. Subsequently it was
                    garrisoned by Sindhia, from whom it was wrested in 1780 by the forces of the
                    East India Company. A contest took place about the successor of Janakji,
                    governor of Gwalior, the adopted son of Daulat Rao Sindhia, who died in 1843
                    without an heir. A revolution was impending, and the British Government had to
                    interfere. Troops crossed the Chambal, and unexpectedly found the insurgent
                    forces drawn up at Maharaj pur, a few miles distant from the fortress. A battle
                    ensued on the 29th December 1843, resulting in the complete overthrow of the
                    Marhattis. The British contingent stationed in the town was increased, and
                    affairs were placed on a peaceful footing.</p>
