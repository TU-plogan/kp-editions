                    Santiago, about 280 miles W.N.W. of the city of Mexico, in 20° 4Γ 10" N. lat.
                    and 103° 21' 15" W. long. Owing to its considerable elevation above the sealevel
                    (according to the <hi rend="italic">Boletin del</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ministerio</hi><hi rend="italic">de Fomentos,</hi> 1876, 1552 metres, but
                    according to older authorities 1580 metres), Guadalajara enjoys an excellent
                    climate. On the whole it is well laid out, and its streets are kept in tolerably
                    good condition. All the houses, whether built of stone, brick, or adobe, are
                    plastered and whitewashed, and hardly a dozen of them attain the height of three
                    stories. In the outskirts of the town the buildings are of an inferior type. The
                    Plaza Mayor is a square about 300 feet in each direction, one side of which is
                    occupied by the cathedral, another side by the <hi rend="italic">casa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de gobierno del estado</hi> or state buildings, and the remaining
                    sides by <hi rend="italic">portales</hi> or arches in the shelter of which are
                    some of the main shops of the city. The cathedral, commenced in 1571 and
                    finished in 1618, is a rather fine structure with two steeples and a large dome
                    between them covered with figures in coloured tiles. The interior is gloomy but
                    impressive. No small interest attaches to the Hospital de San Miguel de Belen,
                    which comprises, not only a hospital proper with male and female wards, but a
                    lunatic asylum and a school for little children. Contiguous to it is the
                    principal cemetery of the city, which is arranged in rather an unusual fashion:
                    three sides of the area are bounded by walls and colonnades, and the inner
                    surface of the walls is divided into six tiers of niches or <hi rend="italic"
                    >gavetas</hi> in which the dead are deposited. Another remarkable institution is
                    the hospicio, occupying twenty-four large blocks of building, and not only
                    affording an asylum for foundlings and orphans, for the blind, the deaf and
                    dumb, and the infirm of all ages, for old people unable to secure a livelihood,
                    but also serving as a reformatory and training school. It presents a fine
                    appearance with its dome and pillared portico. Its inmates number upwards of
                    1000, 700 being children, and 200 old men and women. Among the other public
                    buildings and institutions of Guadalajara are the university (formerly the
                    Jesuit college), eleven conventual establishments, a theological seminary, an
                    academy for the fine arts, a mint, a theatre, and a bull-ring. The favourite
                    promenade is the <hi rend="italic">paseo</hi> which runs for a mile and a
                    quarter through the city, and terminates northward in the alameda or public
                    garden. Guadalajara is a fairly busy town, with paper-mills and woollen and
                    cotton factories; but all the principal establishments are in the handsof
                    Frenchmen, Germans, or Englishmen. The confectionery of the town is held in high
                    repute, and the Indians of the neighbourhood are remarkable for the artistic
                    ability with which they mould figures in clay or rags. The silk embroidery
                    produced in the hospicio is also worthy of mention. Guadalajara was founded in
                    1531 by Nunez Guzman, and was made a bishop’s see in 1549. The population, which
                    was only 19,500 in 1800, had increased to 46,804 by 1841, and to 70,947 by 1870.
                    At Puente Grande in the neighbourhood, the Rio Grande forms a magnificent
                    waterfall; and the bridge of Calderon is famous for the defeat of the insurgents
                    under Hidalgo in June 1811. Several excellent views of Guadalajara will be found
                    in Geiger, <hi rend="italic">A Peep at Mexico.</hi> On the 11th of March 1875
                    Guadalajara was visited by a severe earthquake, which did damage to nearly every
                    large building in the town. An account of the mint of Guadalajara, founded in
                    1811, is given in <hi rend="italic">Bol. Soc. de geogτ. de la rep. Mexicaηa</hi>
                    for 1871. In 1877 the value of the new coin was 1,467,660 piastres or dollars,
                    5000 piastres being in copper and the rest iu silver. New machinery driven by
                    steam was imported from France in 1878. The total import trade of the town was
                    reckoned at 3,280,000 piastres in 1878,—Great Britain having about 40 per cent,
                    of the amount, France 25 per cent., the United States 10, and Germany 8. Full
                    details on the money transactions of the city will be found in the <hi
