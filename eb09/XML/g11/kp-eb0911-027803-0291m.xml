                <p>UNDER this head falls the manufacture of every description of firearm, from the
                    pistol to the 100- ton gun. The term “small arms” includes sporting and military
                    weapons carried by the shooter; instruments fitted for firing a rapid succession
                    of bullets through one or more barrels from a rest are termed “machine guns;”
                    while the heavier pieces, used exclusively in war, are denominated
                    “ordnance.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Small Arms.</hi></p>
                <p>The date and circumstances of the introduction of portable firearms are involved
                    in obscurity. No doubt many attempts were made and failed previously, but
                    gunpowder does not appear to have come into practical use as a rival to the
                    crossbow for the propulsion of bolts or bullets till the reign of Edward III.;
                    in 1375 mention is made of men armed with “gonnes” at an attack made on a
                    Yorkshire manor-house. The <hi rend="italic">arquebuse à mèche,</hi> was
                    employed in Germany in 1378, and it is therefore probable that some rough weapon
                    was introduced much earlier. The hand-gun (fig. 1) was used by both infantry and
                    cavalry; it consisted of a simple iron or brass tube with touch-hole at the top,
                    fixed on a straight stock of wood; when used on foot, the soldier held it firmly
                    by passing the stock under the arm; when used on horseback the stock was
                    shortened to butt against the breast, the barrel resting on a fork secured to
                    the saddle bow. About the beginning of the reign of Henry VII. the hand-gun was
                    improved by the addition of a cock, which was brought down by a trigger to a pan
                    at the side of the barrel; this cock held a match which ignited a priming in the
                    pan, the priming communicating with the charge by a small hole. The next
                    alteration consisted in the introduction of the wheel-lock, in which a steel
                    wheel, rasped at the edge, protruded into the priming pan. Into the cock was
                    fitted a piece of sulphuret of iron (pyrites) instead of a match; this was kept
                    down to the priming pan by a spring; another spring, when wound up, acted on the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n292/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0292-0279"/> wheel, which, when released by the trigger, spun
                    round, rubbing against the pyrites and causing sparks, which set fire to the
                    priming. The wheel-lock was, however, found to be complicated, expensive, and
                    uncertain, so that the match-lock remained in use till the middle of the 17th
                    century, when it was displaced by the flint-lock, the earliest form of which,
                    the “snaphaunce,” seem3 to have been invented about the end of the 16th century
                    in Germany. Tn this lock the priming pan was provided with a steel cover and the
                    cock held a flint; on pulling the trigger the cock fell, the flint struck the
                    steel cover, forcing it back from the pan, evolving at the same time sparks,
                    which fired the priming. During these developments of the lock the shape of the
                    barrel was gradually changed; in 1621 the length of that of the musket was 4
                    feet, and the size of the bore such that twelve bullets weighed 1 lb. Soon after
                    this the infantry soldier was supplied with a dagger.</p>
                <p>which fitted into the muzzle and served as a pike. This was improved at Bayonne
                    into the bayonet, and during the latter part of the 17th century was still
                    farther improved by the addition of a socket, so that the musket could be fired
                    while the bayonet was fixed ready for use. Little change in firearms took place
                    in the 18th century, but in 1807 a Scotch clergyman named Forsyth obtained a
                    patent for priming with fulminating powder, an invention which, though it
                    slumbered till 1834, was destined to cause a complete revolution in the
                    mechanism of firearms. Early in the present reign its value was fully
                    recognized; the magazine of detonatiug composition and the priming pan used by
                    Mr Forsyth were improved into the cap and nipple, and the flint-lock was
                    entirely superseded. At this point, the progress of invention renders it
                    necessary for us to treat separately the two branches of the subject, and to
                    divide sporting from military arms.</p>
                <p>For sporting purposes smooth-bored shot-guns and grooved rifles are employed.
                    Both are nearly always double-barrelled, and of late years the old
                    muzzle-loaders have been almost entirely supplanted by the many breech-loading
                    systems recently invented, which enable the sportsman to reload with greatly
                    increased rapidity and uniformity, the latter quality being specially important
                    in rifle shooting. The chief parts composing the arm are the barrel, the lock,
                    and the stock. Barrels for sporting arms are made of four different kinds of
                    material—Damascus twist, laminated steel, stub iron, and mild cast-steel;
                    besides these, common material is worked up into cheap barrels for exportation.
                    Damascus twist consists of alternate rods of iron and steel placed one upon
                    another; usually six of each kind are thus arranged; they are then forged and
                    thoroughly welded together into a solid bar, which is afterwards rolled into
                    rods, having a section about ∣ inch square. The rod thus formed is raised to a
                    brightish red heat, and one end of it is placed in a revolving chuck, while the
                    other remains fixed; the turning of the chuck subjects the rod to a severe
                    twisting throughout its whole length, so that at last-it acquires the appearance
                    of a screw having a very fine thread. Three of these rods are then placed
                    together, the twist of one being in a contrary direction to that of the other
                    two. They are then welded together into a bar, and rolled into a strip about f
                    inch in width. The thickness of this strip depends on the part of the barrel it
                    is intended to form; if for the breech end it is made ∣ inch thick, if for the
                    centre <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi>- inch, if for the muzzle -θ-inch. These strips are now
                    ready for coiling, which is performed by raising the strip to a bright red heat,
                    fixing one end of it to a hook projecting from a taper mandril, which is placed
                    in a machine and provided with a handle. On turning the handle the strip is
                    wound round the mandril into a coil about 10 inches in length. The coil is then
                    welded by about 3 inches at a time till the spirals unite to form a hollow
                    cylinder; it is then hammered on a small mandril till the welding is complete.
                    Three coils welded together end to end form a barrel, to which the three
                    different thicknesses of metal above m entioned give a slightly conical form,
                    approximating to the ultimate shape. About three-fourths of the material is cut
                    away in the making; 16 δ&gt; of iron are used in the first instance to make a
                    pair of barrels, which weigh only 8 lb when the welding is finished, and only
                    between 3 and 4 lb after boring and grinding, In the manufacture of laminated
                    steel barrels the best quality of steel scrap, after thorough cleaning in a
                    revolving drum, is mixed with a small proportion of charcoal iron. The mixture
                    is heated in a furnace, and puddled into a ball, which is well worked up under a
                    forge hammer. It is then drawn out under a tilt hammer, and rolled into strips
                    of the required length and thickness, after which it is treated as above
                    described. This material is much esteemed for its hardness and closeness of
                    grain, but it does not possess the elegant marking and appearance of the
                    Damascus twist. Stub iron for barrels was formerly made by putting a quantity of
                    old horse-shoes or stubs into an iron ring, welding them into a solid mass, and
                    then rolling them out to strips of the requisite dimensions. Now a mixture of
                    best wrought scrap, and sometimes steel scrap with stubs, is preferred, as
                    giving more hardness and durability to the barrels. A description of the
                    manufacture of cast-steel barrels will be found below, in connexion with
                    military rifles. A sham-twist barrel is apt to impose on the purchaser; plain
                    iron is cheaper than twisted iron, and sometimes a thin coil of twist is rolled
                    round a plain inner tube; the whole is then welded together, and has all the
                    appearance of a genuine twisted barrel. Other cheap barrels are made by rolling
                    up strips of iron plate, and welding them together so that each barrel has a
                    weld running down its whole length. As the breech end is thicker than the muzzle
                    end, these barrels are usually made in two lengths.</p>
                <p>In the rough state just described the barrels are sent from the forge to the
                    gunmaker, who bores them carefully out to nearly the finished size. He then
                    turns them down at intervals, obtaining correct surfaces by means of inside and
                    outside gauges. The barrels are then “stripped” —that is, turned down the whole
                    length to correspond with the bore. For double guns two barrels are now brazed
                    together, near the muzzle and near the middle. At the breech the barrels are
                    separated by a “steel lump.” The axes of the barrels are not quite parallel to
                    each other, but are usually adjusted to cross at about 40 yards from the gun.
                    When packed together, a rib is soldered on down the entire length, and they are
                    sent to be proved at the proof-house<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n293/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0293-0280"/> of the Company of Gun makers at Whitechapel or
                    Birmingham. The scale of proof is fixed by Act of Parliament, according to the
                    size of the bore; it is considerably more than double the ordinary shooting
                    charge. For the provisional proof, muzzle-loaders have the breech screwed in
                    before firing; breech-loading barrels are pressed against a false breech. The
                    second or definitive proof is less severe, and is carried out at a later stage,
                    when the action of the breech-loader, or the percussion fitting of the
                    muzzle-loader, is completed.</p>
                <p>The best stocks are made of English or Italian walnut, piecee of which reach the
                    gunmaker roughly shaped. They are so cut that the grain shall run lengthways
                    down the stock, and the wood is dried and seasoned to prevent warping. For
                    expensive guns, much attention is paid to beauty of mottling and depth of
                    colour. A considerable variety of tools is employed in shaping the stocks and
                    cutting out the beds for locks, processes which, for sporting pieces, are
                    performed by hand. All parts of the lock except the plate are of steel, and
                    reach the gunmaker hammered into shape. The lock-plate is of wrought iron,
                    case-hardened. The parts are worked to fit by hand with a number of special
                    tools. Bar locks are those which have a forward action, arranged so that the
                    main-spring fits under the bar below the breech end of the barrels; back-action
                    locks have the spring reversed, so as to extend down the hand or grip of the
                    stock. The remaining portions ot the gun are termed the furniture. They are the
                    heelplate which covers the butt, the break-off into which the breeching hooks
                    for muzzle-loaders, the trigger plate, the trigger guard, the hammers, the
                    escutcheons, and bolt fastening the barrel to the stock, &amp;c. For
                    breechloaders the action is a most important part of the furniture. The
                    ingenuity of gunmakers has devised an immense variety of actions, and every day
                    sees progress made in strength and simplicity. M. Lefaucheux is entitled to the
                    credit of inventing the modern sporting breechloader. He first hit on the
                    combination of a pair of barrels open at the breech, playing on a hinge and
                    abutting against a false breech (fig. 2), with a strong-based cartridge-case
                    containing powder and shot ready for firing, and supplied with its own means of
                    ignition. His early guns were found weak in the fastening of the barrels to the
                    stock, while the mode of igniting the charge was far from perfect.</p>
                <p>It consisted of a pin passing through the upper part of the cartridge case, the
                    point resting just above a percussion cap placed at the centre of the base of
                    the charge; the hammer fell on the head of the pin, driving the point into the
                    cap, and exploding the detonating composition. The gas was found to escape
                    through the pin hole, the extraction was sometimes difficult, and a fall on hard
                    ground would occasionally explode the cartridge; for these reasons the pin
                    system was superseded by the central-fire method (fig. 3), in which the base of
                    the cartridge case was made to hold a small anvil, on to which the cap was
                    driven by a needle or striker passing through the false breech, and receiving
                    the blow of the hammer. Fig. 4 shows a centralfire gun, having the action
                    considerably strengthened by the double grip. In this system the extraction is
                    accomplished automatically, by a piece of steel fitting between the two-barrels,
                    and so cut as to clip the rims of both cartridges. Tσ this extractor is attached
                    a rod which runs down between the barrels through a hole in the steel lump as
                    far as the hinge; on opening the joint the rod is driven backward, carrying with
                    it the head and forcing the cartridge cases out of the barrels. Guns on the
                    central-fire system afford no indication of being loaded; extraction and loading
                    are, however, so rapid and easy that every sportsman should invariably withdraw
                    the cartridges on laying down his gun, and reload on again taking the field.
                    Hammers sometime»</p>
                <p>catch in the brambles, or even in the clothes of the shooter; even the double
                    grip has been known to yield under the effect of the heavy charges now used. The
                    latest guns leave little room for improvement in respect to the action. Fig 5
                    shows one of the newest developments. The hammers are abolished altogether, the
                    striker being a needle in the interior, which is driven against the cap of a
                    central-fire cartridge by a spring when the trigger is pressed; a lever on the
                    top is pushed aside by the thumb, liberating the catch which holds the barrels
                    against the false breech; the barrels then drop from the hinge, and are open for
                    loading. On raising the barrels, the action snaps to, and holds them fast; the
                    dropping of the barrels causes an extractor to withdraw the empty cartridge
                    cases. A key at the side regulates the cocking and safety of the lock and
                    striker.</p>

                <p>The sizes of barrels are designated according to the weight of the solid
                    spherical lead ball which will just fit them, and hence their diameters vary
                    inversely as the cube roots of their numbers. In the case of No 12 bore, the
                    ball fitting it weighs 12 to the pound, and measures ’ 729 in. in diameter.
                    Ounce bullets (No. 16) fit a bore of ∙662 in. in diameter.</p>
                <p>Barrels were formerly bored cylindrically, but the experiments of gunmakers led
                    them to suppose that better shooting could be obtained by boring to shapes
                    departing in various ways from the simple cylinder. The first modification
                    introduced consisted in enlarging the breech end slightly for about 10 inches;
                    subsequently the last few inches at the muzzle were enlarged also, so that the
                    barrel really consisted of two frusta of cones, having the smaller ends
                    together,—the position of the narrowest part, like many other matters, was
                    dependent on the fancy of the gunmaker. Of late an attempt has been made to
                    reduce the interior form of the barrel to something like a system, and several
                    kinds of “choke” boring have been introduced. The object to be attained with a
                    shot-gun is to so arrange the charge that the pellets shall be uniformly and
                    thickly distributed round the mean trajectory, and shall also occupy a small
                    space longitudinally. In fig. 6 a side view of the charge as it passes through
                    the air is given, <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> being the mean trajectory. Exact
                    experiments to determine the proportions of the cloud of shot fired from
                    different guns do not exist, but, judging from observation, they will usually
                    not depart greatly from those of the figure. In fig. 7 is seen the appearance of
                    the target after being struck by the charge. The test of excellence is
                    regularity of pattern, combined with penetration; that is, a circle of 30 inches
                    diameter should be so pitted by the shot at 40 yards range that gaps of the size
                    of a small bird should no where exist, while the individual pellets should
                    retain force enough to penetrate a certain number of sheets of brown paper. As
                    the shot pass along a barrel driven violently forward by the powder gas, it is
                    probable that the edges of the charge are retarded by friction against the sides
                    of the bore, so that the centre portion extricates itself rather sooner than the
                    edges, and travels with a slightly higher velocity. Supposing the charge to
                    retain an average velocity, on reaching the object fired at, of 300 feet per
                    second, and the leading pellets to have gained 10 feet on the hindmost ones, so
                    that the charge is distributed over a length of 10 feet, a period of time of
                    ι⅛th θf a second will elapse between the blows of the first and last pellet. If
                    the object be stationary, this interval will be almost, imperceptible, and the
                    pattern made on the target by the impact of the shot will exhibit no trace of
                    it. But if the object be a bird flying across at the rate of 60</p>
                <p>feet per second (about 40 miles an hour), it will traverse a space of 2 feet in
                    the interval, and so will not receive the charge at all in the manner shown on
                    the target. Figs. 8, 9, 10 show some of the choke bores fancied by different
                    makers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>No accurate or
                    crucial experiments have as yet been carried out to determine the true action of

                    >Fielet</hi> is now preparing instruments and endeavouring to approach the
                    subject in a scientific manner. The general principles, as far as they can be
                    gathered at present, are, that enlarging or relieving the barrel slightly
                    reduces the friction and allows the shot to acquire greater velocity, while
                    choking the barrel at the muzzle has the effect of directing the outer pellets
                    inwards, and so concentrating the charge.</p></note></p>
                <p>The manufacture of sporting rifles does not greatly differ from that of
                    shot-guns. Greater strength and weight of barrel are necessary to resist the
                    pressure of the charge, withstand the wedging action of the bullet, and deaden
                    the recoil. The breech-closing action also demands greater strength, but the
                    general arrangements are not different in principle. Rifles for sporting
                    purposes differ from military pieces in being double-barrelled, and in requiring
                    accuracy and penetration at short ranges, instead of a flat trajectory at very
                    considerable distances. Hence they generally resemble the shot-guns in their
                    action, and fire more powder in proportion to the weight of the bullet than
                    military rifles.</p>
                <p>In fig. 11 the treble grip snap action is shown as specially devised for rifles
                    firing heavy charges. In addition to the holding power thus provided, a piece is
                    sometimes made to extend from the rib between the barrels, terminating in a
                    projection which catches in a recess in the top of the false <pb break="no"

                    shown in fig. 5 may be adopted. Some makers, instead of using the hinge
                    principle introduced by Lefaucheux, close the breech in other ways; thus in the
                    Henry action the barrel does not move, but is closed at the breech end by a
                    sliding vertical block, which is depressed for the admission of the cartridge by
                    a lever underneath the trigger guard; the striker passes through the block,
                    which on being lowered extracts the cartridge. The power of a modern rifle is
                    limited only by the power of the shooter to withstand the effect of recoil and
                    to use a heavy piece. The momentum of the bullet forwards up to the time of its
                    leaving the muzzle is equal (neglecting the weight and motion of the gas
                    generated by the powder charge) to that of the gun backwards at any instant.
                    Supposing the gun to weigh 150 times as much as the bullet, it will acquire a
                    velocity against the shoulder equal to the 150th part of that acquired by the
                    bullet. Practically it is this velocity which measures the severity of the
                    recoil, and the heavier the gun and the more powerful the shooter the more
                    momentum can he afford to impart to his bullet. This momentum may be composed of
                    high speed and low weight, or of low speed and high weight. A light bullet
                    starting with a high velocity travels fast at first and drops but little at a
                    short range; it speedily, however, suffers retardation by the resistance of the
                    air, and would soon be beaten by a heavier bullet of the same diameter starting
                    with the same momentum. The Express rifles carry out this principle with great
                    completeness, employing heavy powder charges and imparting very high speed to a
                    light bullet, so that a range of about 130 to 150 yards is traversed with a drop
                    not exceeding 1 foot. Fig. 12 shows the nature of bullet generally used for
                    these pieces; the hollow in the centre permits the lead to expand and flatten
                    out on striking, inflicting a wound of great severity. Explosive bullets are
                    also employed by some sportsmen. In fig. 13 are shown rifle cartridges loaded
                    ready for use. The solid brass-drawn case is now almost universally adopted,
                    both for sporting and military purposes. The Martini-Henry rifles used by the
                    British army, however, still use the soft brass-crimped case.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Military Rifles.—</hi> The principle of rifling small arms
                    seems to have been discovered about the beginning of the 16th century, but does
                    not appear to have been employed for warlike purposes till the middle of the
                    17th. In 1680 each troop of life-guards was supplied with eight rifled carbines.
                    In 1800 the 95th regiment, now the rifle brigade, was armed with a 20-bore
                    muzzle-loading rifle. The difficulty of loading a rifle after firing a few
                    rounds was the great obstacle to its use in the field. Several methods were
                    devised of providing anvils at the bottom of the bore on which a loose ball
                    dropped in could be hammered to fit the grooves, but the principle of expansion
                    by the action of the powder was not brought forward till 1836, when Mr Greener
                    submitted an egg-shaped bullet, having an opening at one end to receive a
                    conical plug, which when driven home by the gas expanded the bullet into the
                    grooves. Shortly after this the French chasseurs were armed with a rifle
                    throwing an elongated bullet with a hollow-coned base. This was improved by
                    Captain Minié, who added an iron cup to fit into the cone and expand it when
                    forced home by the gas. For this cup a wooden plug was substituted in the
                    three-grooved Enfield rifle in 1855. About this time Sir J. Whitworth brought
                    forward his hexagonal rifling, the guiding idea of which was that every part of
                    the hexagon except the actual corner should do its share of the work of giving
                    rotation. He proposed for a barrel 39 inches long a bore of *45 inch, having one
                    turn in 20 inches. This was intended to be suitable either for an expanding
                    bullet, or for one possessing an easy mechanical fit. The length of the bullet
                    was increased, and the form thus modified suffered much less from the resistance
                    of the air than the previous patterns. The question of breech-loading for
                    military weapons now began to assume importance. About 1841 the Prussians had
                    adopted the needle gun, a breech-loader on the bolt principle. It was a rough
                    weapon compared with the pieces lately introduced, but a great advance on any
                    known at the time. A conical bullet rested on a thick wad, behind which was
                    packed the powder, the whole being enclosed in strong lubricated paper. The
                    detonator was in the centre of the hinder surface of the wad, so that to explode
                    it a needle had to be driven forward from the breech through the base of the
                    cartridge and through the powder. This was accomplished by the action of a
                    spiral spring, when set free by the pulling of the trigger. This arrangement
                    possessed many defects: the gas escaped freely at the breech; the long needles
                    rusted and broke; the springs failed; and the weight of the piece was excessive.
                    Such failings caused the sterling merit of the principle to be underrated, and
                    it was not till 1864 that a committee of officers recommended the introduction
                    of breech-loading arms for general adoption in the British army. The triumph of
                    Prussia in the Seven Weeks’ War with Austria in 1866 at once drew attention to
                    the urgency of the case, and caused all civilized powers to re-arm their troops.
                    In England the Enfield rifles (three-grooved expanding bullet muzzle-loaders)
                    were converted into breech-loaders by the adoption of the Snider method, which
                    consisted in cutting away 2 inches of the upper part of the breech end of the
                    barrel so as to admit the cartridge, which was pushed forward into a chamber
                    formed by enlarging the end of the bore. A block, opening on a hinge, was then
                    shut down to fill up the space behind, forming a false breech against which the
                    base of the cartridge abutted. The striker consisted of a needle passing through
                    this breech block; when struck from behind by the hammer it was driven against a
                    cap in the base of the cartridge, exploding the charge. By this means the
                    existing rifles were rapidly converted, and the army was provided with a
                    breech-loader of satisfactory efficiency should any emergency arise. Proposals
                    were then invited, and a number of inventions submitted, the result of which was
                    that in 1869 the combination of the Martini breech action with the Henry barrel
                    was decided on for future manufacture, and the whole of the British army is now
                    provided with these weapons (see figs. 14,15,16,17). The general principles of
                    manufacture are the same for all kinds of military breech-loading rifles. It
                    will be sufficient to give the details of one <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi

                <p>The manufacture of the Martini-Henry rifle, as carried out at the Government
                    factory near Enfield, involves 2004 separate operations which have to be
                    performed on each rifle before it is complete for issue. This number is subject
                    to slight variations caused by changes of pattern from time <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n296/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0296-0283"/> to time. It will be sufficient if the principle
                    of these operations are described, without entering minutely into details.</p>
                <p>The rifle is composed of three parts :—the barrel, carrying the sights; the
                    stock, into which fits the cleaning rod; the body, containing the lock and
                    breech action. The soldier is also provided with a bayonet to fit on the
                    muzzle.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">barrel</hi> is made of mild steel manufactured on the
                    Siemens principle. Cylinders of this material, 16 inches long and 1⅜ in. thick,
                    are supplied by contract, and tests are made of a proportion from time to time.
                    These cylinders are first rolled in the factory to a long cone, having slightly
                    greater dimensions than the exterior of the finished barrel. The cylinder is
                    heated in the furnace and passed straight through a series of eight pairs of
                    roll; each pair is grooved to receive it, the grooves becoming narrower and
                    shallower as each successive pair is reached. The pairs are alternately vertical
                    and horizontal; when they are in full work they can roll about 250 cylinders per
                    hour.</p>
                <p>The cone is next placed between friction rollers; these are set at a slight
                    angle, so that in revolving they pass the cone along slowly. It emerges from
                    their clutch polished with the compression, and showing their action by a close
                    spiral traced on the surface. We have now a solid piece of mild steel, slightly
                    thicker than the barrel, fairly straight and thoroughly well-consolidated.</p>
                <p>The next step is to obtain true bearings for boring the interior and turning the
                    exterior. The cone is placed in a clamp milling machine, and the ends milled
                    down. This operation requires some judgment; the milling-down of the ends must
                    be so performed that the centres shall be approximately true centres; that is,
                    the amount of metal to be subsequently turned down off the exterior of the
                    barrel shall be about equal all round. The ends, when milled down, serve for
                    bearings by which the cone is next held horizontally, and drilled in a
                    double-acting machine for 1⅜ in.; these act as centres when the barrel is placed
                    vertically and drilled through from each end. Three tools are used, the last
                    being of slightly greater diameter than the others. A shoulder is left in the
                    centre to avoid the inconvenience of the tools from opposite ends not exactly
                    meeting in the middle, as might be the case with the long slender drills
                    necessarily employed. This shoulder is removed by a square tapered tool or
                    “bit.” We have now a cone slightly larger than the barrel, with a hole through
                    it ’ 433 in. in diameter. This hole is then bored out to <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 444 inch. Having now got a true inside, the next step is to obtain a true
                    outside from it.</p>
                <p>The cone is placed vertically in a machine, the lower end fitting accurately on a
                    pin, the upper end passing loosely through a hollow chuck, which revolves round
                    a centre in truth with the centre of the pin and the axis of the bore of the
                    cone; the exterior of the cone, being slightly irregular, will be out of truth;
                    sulphur therefore is melted and poured into the hollow chuck, filling up the
                    space between the interior of the chuck and the exterior of the cone, and
                    hardening on cooling. The chuck then holds the cone by the outside in truth, and
                    serves as a bearing. The cone is then placed in a lathe, and two or three short
                    cuts taken off the outside as bearings for the rough turning. This is called
                    “spotting.” It is now rough and finish turned, the outside becoming concentric
                    with the inside; and the cone becomes a <hi rend="italic">barrel.</hi></p>
                <p>It is next tested for truth of interior. Two tests are employed,—the first being
                    that by <hi rend="italic">shading.</hi> The barrel is placed in a rest, so
                    arranged that the eye looking through the tube sees the straight line of the top
                    of a window cutting horizontally across the aperture a little above the centre.
                    If the barrel is accurately straight and brightly polished, the shadow thrown by
                    the dark window-frame down the tube appears as in fig. 18. The interior circle
                    shows the window as seen through the barrel, with the dark frame cutting across;
                    the next circle shows the shadow extending in a cone from A to B and C. This
                    shadow is quite dark, and AB, AC are quite straight. BC is a portion of the arc
                    cutting off the shadow sharply at a point half-way down the barrel.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n297/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0297-0284"/>
                <p>There are two outer circles extending to the eye, and approximately resembling
                    the sketch in shading. If the barrel is untrue in interior surface, or bent, the
                    cone will at once lose its regularity, and the sides AB, AC will no longer be
                    straight. Should they be irregular, the barrel is “set” by striking with a
                    hammer or ebonite mallet across a setting block.</p>
                <p>The barrel is next placed in a machine, and a horizontal spindle is run through
                    it <hi rend="italic">; on</hi> this spindle are two closefitting gauges, one in
                    the centre and one at the end; the barrel is then caused to revolve on the
                    spindle, and an indicator with a long arm recording small graduations is
                    inserted at the free end between the spindle and the barrel; any irregularity of
                    turning is multiplied 200 times by the long arm, and becomes at once
                    apparent.</p>
                <p>After passing these tests the barrel is finish-turned; the back sight is soldered
                    on and screwed, and the fore sight is brazed on; the size of bore is then
                    gauged, after which the process of polishing is completed and the barrel is
                    ready for rifling.</p>
                <p>The rifling consists of seven grooves of the form shown in fig. 17. The twist is
                    such that the bullet makes one complete revolution while travelling 22 inches;
                    that is, one turn in 49 calibres of 0 ’ 45 in., to employ the phraseology
                    generally applied to the rifling of cannon. Each groove is cut separately by a
                    tool which acts when pulled; it forms the groove by five successive -cuts, being
                    forced to project a little more at each cut; it thus passes thirty-five times up
                    and down the barrel to complete the rifling, which can be done in half an hour
                    The size of bore is now finally tested; it must lie between 0 ’ 449 and 0 ’ 45l
                    inch. The rifling is similarly tested, and the twist gauged.</p>
                <p>The breech end of the barrel is next chambered out to receive the cartridge,
                    which is of the kind known as “bottleshaped.” The exterior of the breech end is
                    of “Nock’s” form, the upper surface being a flat, true to the bore. This flat
                    guides all the fittings; the barrel is placed in a machine true to the flat, and
                    the sights are gauged for line and elevation. No allowance is made for the
                    deflexion due to twist of rifling, it being very slight. The barrel is lastly
                    screwed at the breech end to fit the body.</p>
                <p>Each barrel is twice subjected to proof by powder, once before rifling, once
                    after. Sixteen are placed in a cast-iron frame; a temporary steel screw,
                    furnished with a vent, closes each breech end, which rests against a leaden bar.
                    The barrels are loaded from the muzzle; a train of powder ignited by a cap fires
                    them simultaneously; the bullets are caught in a hollow cast-iron receiving
                    frame, shaped like the shell of a snail. The charge for the first proof is 7∣
                    drs. ( = 205 grs.) of powder and a bullet weighing 715 grs,, secured by a
                    half-inch cork wad forced down over it. The second proof is the same, except
                    that only 5 drs. ( = 137 grs.) of powder are used. The service charge is 85 grs.
                    of powder with a bullet of 480 grs.</p>
                <p>The barrel when finished is browned by being coated with browning mixture, and
                    caused to rust in a steam tank; it is then brushed with wire brushes. This
                    process is repeated four times, after which the exterior is oiled over. The
                    browning mixture consists of—</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">stoch</hi> is in two parts,—the butt and the fore-end. They
                    are of Italian walnut wood, and are supplied roughly shaped. They are tested for
                    straightness of grain; weight, as indicating strength; “shakes” or cracks;
                    “galls,” caused by injuries over which the wood has grown; saltness (which would
                    cause absorption of moisture and consequent rusting), bv putting a shaving into
                    a solution of nitrate of silver; and also for appearance. Those accepted are
                    thoroughly seasoned by keeping, or dried in a desiccating chamber, warmed by hot
                    air; they then go to the shaping machines, where they are cut to size by
                    revolving cutters, making 4000 revolutions per minute, and are afterwards turned
                    iu copying lathes, hollowed out by copying gouges, and bored to take the
                    fittings. They are then tested, machined, hand-finished, and oiled up.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">body</hi> is of mild steel; it is stamped out from the bar;
                    it is then drifted through by a slightly tapered bar carrying a succession of
                    cutters on it. The front part of the body is then screwed to suit the screw on
                    the barrel, so that when home it shall fit accurately to the breech end. The
                    lever, and indeed all parts except screws and springs, are stamped out of solid
                    bar. Each part is milled by machinery to a correct fit; every fitting is
                    interchangeable, and nothing is marked for selection to fit anything else. Each
                    part is browned in the same way as the barrels, or blued.</p>
                <p>On completion all parts are taken to the assembling room, where they are fitted
                    together, screwed up, and turned out as finished rifles; after which they are
                    taken to the practice ground, and tested for accuracy and extraction of
                    cartridge by being fired from a rest at a target, the range being 500 yards.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">bayonet</hi> consists of a steel blade welded to a
                    wrought-iron socket. Steel of a superior quality being used, it is supplied in
                    bars, is cut into lengths, and is welded by the aid of borax to a short rod of
                    rolled iron. The two are so put together as to form a right angle; the steel bar
                    is put into a “Rydering” machine, which gives it a great number of rapid blows,
                    and shapes it roughly into a blade. It is then rolled and cooled gradually under
                    charcoal and coal-dust for annealing purposes. The socket is then drilled, and
                    the blade ground. They are then bent into position and become a bayonet. Turning
                    and finish-boring complete the sockets, while the blades are fine-ground,
                    hardened, tempered, tested, and polished. The sockets are then browned and
                    adjusted to the rifles.</p>
                <p>About 1400 operatives are employed at the Government factory; each Martini-Henry
                    rifle costs about 48s., all expenses reckoned; and to render the establishment
                    thoroughly remunerative, the out-turn should be about a rifle a week per

                <p>It will be noticed that the Vetterli gun, used by the Italians and Swiss, is a
                    repeater or magazine gun. It contains a supply of eleven cartridges, arranged in
                    a tube running under the barrel, and forced by a spring into the loading
                    position one by one, as the previously fired empty one is extracted. The arm can
                    thus fire twelve rounds with great rapidity without reloading; it can also be
                    used as an <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n298/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0298-0285"/> ordinary breech-loader, a fresh cartridge being
                    inserted at every round, and the magazine kept constantly full. This is no doubt
                    a great advantage under certain circumstances, but entails grave inconveniences.
                    Thus the Vetterli gun, with magazine full, weighs just half as much again as the
                    Martini-Henry, and gives less energy to its bullet at the muzzle in the
                    proportion of 5 to 8, a proportion which increases to the disadvantage of the
                    magazine gun as the range increases. Still, for a <hi rend="italic">mel'ee,</hi>
                    and at short ranges, the Vetterli is no doubt a very formidable piece.</p>
                <p>These considerations have led the Government of the United States to make trials
                    of a number of magazine guns, of which one, the Hotchkiss, has been selected for
                    adoption. The working of it is shown in fig. 19. The magazine is contained in
                    the stock, and holds five cartridges, a sixth being in the chamber ready for
                    loading. These cartridges are the same as those used for Government Springfield
                    rifles; they are pushed successively into the loading position by a spiral
                    spring till the magazine is empty, or a fresh cartridge can be inserted after
                    each round as in an ordinary breechloader. The action of bringing the
                    knob-handle upright and withdrawing the bolt extracts and throws out the emptied
                    cartridge to the side; the next cartridge is then pushed up into the loading
                    position by the spring, and is forced into the barrel when the handle presses
                    the bolt forward; this action also cocks the piece, but the striker cannot reach
                    the cartridge till the knob-handle is turned down, and the bolt thus locked in
                    position. The weight of the piece fully loaded is 9⅜ ft&gt;. Trials of this
                    weapon are about to be made by the English Government.</p>
                <p>Of all the military rifles adopted by the various Governments, the Martini-Henry
                    is the most powerful; the practical test it underwent in Turkey, where a cheap
                    gun of this pattern was supplied on contract by an American firm during the war

                <p><hi rend="italic">Pistols.—</hi> These handy little weapons were formerly made as
                    single or double-barrelled smooth-bored muzzle-loaders, and their system
                    involved no departure in principle from the ordinary firearm of the day. The
                    introduction of the revolver as a practical weapon was a great step in advance;
                    the idea is old, and roughly constructed weapons on the same plan have long
                    existed in museums of old arms; Colonel Colt of the United States revived it,
                    and is the father of the modern revolver. In his pistol a revolving
                    muzzle-loading cylinder contains a number of chambers, usually five or six,
                    bored from the front parallel to the axis; the back of the cylinder is left
                    solid, and forms the breech; a nipple is screwed into each chamber. As the
                    cylinder revolves, each chamber arrivée at the top, and is then opposite to a
                    barrel; the pistol is cocked by the thumb, an action which locks the chamber
                    against the barrel, so that the two form a continuous bore; the trigger is
                    pulled in the usual way, and the hammer brought down on the upper nipple,
                    exploding the charge in the top chamber. The action of recocking brings the next
                    chamber into position. When on half-cock, the cylinder revolves freely. Since
                    Colt’s time great improvements have been made in these handy weapons; the
                    trigger was made to cock the hammer, turn the cylinder, and fire the charge by
                    one continuous draw; this arrangement enabled the shooter to fire all the shots
                    very rapidly without lowering his hand: the strength of mainspring required,
                    however, rendered it very difficult to shoot with any degree cf accuracy,
                    especially as the exact moment when the hammer would fall was hard to estimate.
                    A second improvement gave the shooter the choice of cocking the hammer and
                    firing it in the usual way, if he preferred it. The next step was to make the
                    chambers breech-loading, by boring them right through, and packing the powder
                    and bullet in a strong based cartridge, carrying its own ignition. In pistols
                    constructed on this plan the chamber arriving at the top is brought against a
                    false breech through which the striker is driven by the hammer. In the latest
                    pattern of this pistol, the cylinder and barrel open away from the false breech
                    on a hinge underneath; the action of opening throws out the empty
                    cartridge-cases. If the user is on horseback, he thrusts the barrel muzzle
                    downwards into his breast, belt, or holster, the hinge remaining open; fresh
                    cartridges are taken out of the pouch and placed in the chambers; the breech is
                    closed sharply on the hinge and is held by a snap-catch; the pistol is then
                    withdrawn ready for use. All this can be very quickly done with one hand at full
                    gallop.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Machine Guns.</hi></p>
                <p>This term comprehends all weapons made to fire a rapid succession of bullets from
                    a staud or carriage, so that, while requiring but two or three men to work them,
                    they may throw in a fire equal to that of a detachment of infantry. In the
                    Franco-German war of 1870 a species of <hi rend="italic">mitrailleur</hi> was
                    largely employed, and when used under favourable conditions attained fair
                    success. It consisted of a number of barrels (usually 25 or 37) secured in a
                    frame round an axis, and parallel to it. The barrels were open at the breech,
                    and were loaded by a disc pierced to correspond with them containing a cartridge
                    in each chamber. This disc was placed against the breech end of the barrels, the
                    false breech containing the strikers was held firmly against it, and the whole
                    Qf the charges were exploded at once. This arrangement had many defects. The
                    recoil of so many charges fired simultaneously required strength and weight; at
                    short ranges the bullets all went to the same spot; the number of rounds could
                    not be regulated at pleasure; and only volleys could be fired. The Gatling
                    machine gun, which first appeared in the United States, was vastly superior to
                    the mitrailleur, and speedily obtained entrance into the armies of most of the
                    civilized powers. Figs. 20 to 26 show the general construction of the weapon. In
                    fig. 20 the Gatling is ready for firing. A block of ten barrels is secured round
                    an axis, which is fixed in a frame <hi rend="italic">aa.</hi> On turning the

                    revolve. A drum T (figs. 20, 24, 25) is placed on the top at the breech end of
                    the barrels over a hopper, through a slot in which the cartridges drop into the
                    carrier, which consists of ten grooves or chambers M (fig. 23) corresponding to
                    the ten barrels. The construction of the lock is shown in fig. 26. It consists
                    of a bolt, through which passes a striker driven by a spiral spring. AAAA is a
                    cam, sloping as in the drawing, which it must be understood represents the
                    circular construction opened out and laid flat. As the barrels, carrier, and
                    locks revolve, the slope of the cam forces the locks forward and backward
                    alternately. At position I. the cartridge has just fallen into the carrier, the
                    lock and bolt are completely withdrawn. At positions II., III., IV., the cam is
                    forcing them forward, so that the bolt pushes the cartridge into the barrel. At
                    IV. the cocking cam R begins to compress the spiral spring, releasing it at V.

                    clutching the base of the cartridge case, which is withdrawn as the locks
                    retreat down the slope of the cam, till at X it falls through an aperture to the
                    ground. The line <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> marks the commencement of the
                    rifling. In fig. 20 the drum T consists of a number of vertical channels
                    radiating from the centre. The cartridges are arranged horizontally, one above
                    the other, in these channels, bullet ends inwards. The drum revolves on the
                    pivot <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (fig. 23), and the cartridges fall through the
                    aperture B. When all the channels are emptied, a full drum is brought from the
                    limber, and substituted for the empty one. Each barrel fires in turn as it comes
                    to a certain position, so that by turning the handle quickly an almost
                    continuous stream of bullets can be ejected. An experimental pattern of Gatling
                    has been lately tried, fitted with a multiplying arrangement which could be made
                    to fire nearly 1000 shots a minute. In fig. 21 an automatic traversing
                    arrangement is shown, which can be put in or out of gear as desired, and by
                    means of which the amount of traverse can be regulated. The spindle <hi
                    rend="italic">gg</hi> turns the wheel A, projections on which act on the arm F,
                    and traverse the breech through a small arc, thus spreading the bullets
                    laterally over the required front.</p>
                <p>Effective though this piece is for land service, especially in defending
                    approaches, it is scarcely suitable for the navy, as the mobility of the boats
                    or vessels carrying it causes immense waste of ammunition, it being impossible
                    to fire more than ⅛ few rounds at the object before an important change of
                    direction occurs. The Nordenfelt machine gun, shown in figs. 27 to 31, is found
                    specially suitable under these circumstances. The barrels are here placed
                    horizontally, and have no movement. A box containing the locks, bolts, strikers,
                    and spiral springs, one of each corresponding to each barrel, moves straight
                    backwards and forwards when worked by the handle of the lever on the right. When
                    the box is drawn back the cartridges fall from the holder on the top into the
                    carriers simultaneously. When the box is pushed forward the bolts push the
                    cartridges into the barrel, cocking-catches compress the spiral springs, the
                    lever releases the catches one after the other at very minute intervals of time,
                    and the cartridges are fired in rapid succession. In this piece, careful aim can
                    be taken from a moving platform, and at the right moment the barrels can be
                    fired at the object almost simultaneously; they could be made to fire at the
                    same instant, <pb break="no"

                    fire single shots would be lost, and the recoil would be increased. This gun
                    would probably never be able to fire with such extreme rapidity as the
                    experimental form of Gatling mentioned above, but it could be made to fire six
                    or seven hundred rounds a minute. It is generally considered that a machine gun
                    should be able to fire easily two hundred rounds in half a minute.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ordnance.</hi></p>
                <p>The manufacture of ordnance is a much more scientific and complicated study than
                    that of small arms. As the forces increase in magnitude and intensity, while the
                    ultimate strength of material remains constant, the nicety of adaptation of
                    means to ends grows <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with the guns. In
                    producing a piece of ordnance, two distinct sets of conditions are
                    involved—those belonging to its actual construction, and those by which its
                    proportions are regulated. In constructing a gun, the material must be so
                    selected and disposed as economically and safely to sustain the effect of the
                    forces developed by the charge; in designing a gun, it is necessary to know the
                    nature and direction of the forces which will combine to produce the desired
                    ballistic results. The two sets of conditions are as distinct as those involved
                    in the separate operations of writing and printing this article.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Construction.—</hi> Nearlyall the accurate knowledge asyet
                    obtained of the true action of gunpowder has been acquired within the last
                    twenty years. The general idea previously held was that the explosion was
                    instantaneous, and that the more violent the powder the greater would be the
                    velocity of the projectile. The mode of proving the quality of the explosive was
                    to place a small quantity in a short mortar, and to measure the distance to
                    which it projected a light shell—a test altogether wrong in principle, as will
                    be shown later on. No accurate idea had been formed of the true pressure of the
                    powder gas on the bore during discharge; but it was understood that a gun was
                    subjected to two principal strains orstresses—a circumferential tension tending
                    to split the gun open longitudinally, and a longitudinal tension tending to pull
                    the gun apart in the direction of its length.</p>
                <p>When guns are made of cast metal, and are, in fact, homogeneous hollow cylinders,
                    a limit is soon reached beyond which additional thickness is practically useless
                    in giving strength to resist the circumferential tension. Supposing the metal
                    employed to be incompressible, each concentric layer would take up a strain on
                    discharge inversely proportionate to the square of its distance from the axis of
                    the bore. Every metal, however, is compressible as well as extensible, and hence
                    the exterior always affords more support to the interior than the foregoing rule
                    indicates. The great aim then of a gunmaker is so to select and arrange his
                    material that the exterior shall take up as much as possible öf the strain
                    thrown upon the interior.</p>
                <p>In America, Captain Rodman introduced a method of casting guns hollow and cooling
                    them down from the interior, so that the inner portions being first solidified
                    were compressed and supported by the contraction of the outer parts when they
                    subsequently cooled down. Thus, on discharge, the compressed inner p.ortions
                    expanded under the action of the powder gas to or beyond their natural diameter,
                    throwing at once the strain on the outer portions which were already in a state
                    of tension. But however well cast-iron may be disposed, it is naturally too weak
                    and brittle for use with heavy guns, and those nations which employ it thus do
                    so because it is comparatively cheap and easy to manufacture, and not because it
                    is the best material. Austria and Russia have of late years made light guns of
                    bronze cast in chill, and subjected to the wedging action of steel mandrils
                    driven through the bore. The several layers of the metal are thus placed in a
                    state of tension as regards the exterior, and of compression as regards the
                    interior. At the present day systems of building up guns have been devised so
                    that each portion of the metal is made to bear its fair share of the strain.</p>
                <p>The longitudinal tension is usually less important than the circumferential
                    stress. It is considered to be provided against in homogeneous guns if the metal
                    is as thick over the bottom of the bore as round the end. The strain is now
                    measured by calculating the total pressure of the powder gas on the bottom of
                    the bore, and comparing it with the area of the transverse section of the gun at
                    the same place. This is not absolutely correct; but, practically, the chief
                    modes of gun construction now adopted leave a considerable margin of strength in
                    this direction.</p>
                <p>Sir William Armstrong first successfully employed the principle of iuitial
                    tensions for all parts of a gun. In his system, wrought-iron coils are shrunk
                    over one another, so that the inner tube is placed in a state of compression and
                    the outer portions in a state of tension, an endeavour being made to so regulate
                    the amount of tension that each coil should perform its maximum duty in
                    resisting the pressure from within. Further, he arranged the fibre of the
                    several portions so as to be in the best positions for withstanding the
                    pressures. It must be noted that wrought-iron bar is about twice as strong in
                    the direction of the fibre as across it. He therefore constructed the exterior
                    of the gun of coiled bars of wrought iron welded into hoops and shrunk one over
                    the other, thus disposing the fibre to resist the circumferential strain. These
                    outer coils were shrunk over a hollow cylinder of forged iron, having the fibre
                    running lengthways so as to resist the longitudinal strain. Within this cylinder
                    or forged breech-piece was placed a steel tube, gripped in like manner by
                    shrinkage. This grand principle of modern gun construction is carried out by
                    turning the inner coil in a lathe to an exterior diameter slightly greater than
                    the interior diameter to which the outer coil is bored. The outer coil is
                    expanded by the application of heat, and slipped over the inner one. It
                    contracts on cooling, and if the strength of the two coils is properly adjusted,
                    the outer will remain in a state of tension, and the inner in a state of
                    compression. On this view, the ideal gun would be constructed of a vast number
                    of excessively thin rings so shrunk over each other that, on discharge, each
                    should be equally strained. An attempt has been made by Mr Longridge, M.I.C.E.,
                    to approximate to this condition by winding steel wire under tension round a
                    steel tube. This system, though possessing much ingenuity, has never made way,
                    and might possibly be found wanting in longitudinal strength.</p>
                <p>Great success attended the early introduction of the coil principle. Guns of
                    considerable size were made: the largest weighed as much as 23 tons, and
                    projected a 600-δ&gt; shot with a fair velocity. It was found, however, that
                    much difficulty attended the accurate shrinking of a number of thin rings, and
                    that occasionally one or more of the outer ones would be strained to cracking,
                    while the inner ones were intact. The original mode of construction was
                    therefore modified, as experience was gained in the Government factory at
                    Woolwich. Acting under General Campbell, R. A., Mr Fraser, M.I.C.E., thickened
                    the coils, and extended their use to the breech-piece, it being found that the
                    longitudinal disposition of the fibre in that part was not required to sustain
                    the longitudinal strain, and that the steel tube forming the bore was better
                    supported by coils.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of ordnance at Woolwich and Elswick may be briefly described as
                    follows. Steel cylinders, slightly larger than the exterior dimensions of the

                    tested for quality of metal, and toughened after being bored by being raised to
                    the temperature shown by the tests to be most suitable to the particular
                    cylinder, and then plunged in oil. They are subsequently tested by water
                    pressure at 4 tons per square inch. The tubes are not bored quite through for
                    muzzle-loaders; a solid end is left to form the bottom of the bore. The rest of
                    the gun is made of wrought iron. The material is chiefly received from the
                    contractor in the form of wrought scrap, but a certain proportion of iron p
                    iddled in the works is used also. Blooms of these materials are rolled into flat
                    bars, which are fagoted together and rolled into long bars of the section
                    required for the part of the gun for which they are intended. These bars are
                    then placed in a long narrow reverberatory furnace, and raised to a bright red
                    heat. When ready for coiling, one end is drawn out and fixed to a revolving
                    mandril, which pulls the bar out and winds it into a coil, like rope round a
                    capstan. Sometimes a second bar is wound round outside the first coil; in this
                    case the mandril is made to revolve in the opposite direction. The coil is next
                    placed upright in a reverberatory furnace, and raised to a white or “welding”
                    heat. In this state it is placed under a steam hammer, and welded till it
                    becomes a compact hollow cylinder. On cooling it is bored and turned to the
                    proper dimensions. Two parts of the gun are made of forged iron (not
                    coiled),—the cascable screw which supports the breech end of the tube, and the
                    hoop which carries the trunnions. The latter is either welded to the outer coil
                    or shrunk on.</p>
                <p>Figs. 32-39 show the method of building up Woolwich ordnance as exemplified in
                    the 80-ton guns. The various coils are hooked together by shoulders to prevent
                    slipping or distortion from the shock of discharge. Thus, in fig. 36, shoulders
                    are turned on the exterior of the breech-piece and inside the IB coil; the
                    latter is expanded by being raised to a dull red heat and slipped over the tube
                    from the muzzle end. The expansion enables the shoulders to pass, and on cooling
                    they grip each other as shown, while the IB coil contracts on and slightly
                    compresses the part of the tube within it.</p>
                <p>A method of strengthening and utilizing as rifled guns some of the old cast-iron
                    ordnance of the service has been largely employed to supply pieces of secondary
                    power and excellence for land fronts and for practice. It was brought forward in
                    its present shape by Sir W. Palliser in 1863, and is now being much used in the
                    United States’ gun factories. The cast-iron block or gun is bored out to the
                    requisite dimensions, and a tube of coiled wrought iron is thrust into it; no
                    shrinking is here employed, but a tolerable fit is ensured by accurate turning.
                    When fitted, the tube is secured by a collar screwed in at the muzzle; a plug of
                    iron passes through the under side of the gun into the tube near the trunnions
                    to prevent any shift of position. The tube is in two parts, the breech end being
                    turned down and a second tube shrunk over it. The bottom of the bore is formed
                    by a wrought-iron cup, which is forged and stamped into shape under a steam
                    hammer. A screw is cut on the outside of the cup and inside the end of the tube;
                    the cup is then screwed tightly home. The tube is next severely tested by water
                    pressure, after which the second tube is shrunk on. The whole tube is then
                    fitted into the cast-iron casing, the greatest care being taken that the breech
                    end bears firmly home. The gun is now ready for rifling, and, after that
                    operation is performed, undergoes proof by firing heavy charges, which expand
                    the tube closely against the cast-iron envelope, which then takes up the strain
                    and affords the necessary support. The relation between the powers of the three
                    classes of guns will be gathered from the following comparison :—</p>

                <p>The great German gunmaker, Krupp, employs nothing but steel in the manufacture of
                    his ordnance. His earlier pieces were bored from solid blocks of this metal
                    forged under heavy hammers. They were homogeneous, and therefore the exterior
                    did not assist the interior to bear the strain of the powder gas on discharge to
                    the extent which scientific methods of construction admit. Still the excellent
                    quality of the material enabled the artillerist to get results from these pieces
                    which have been surpassed only by the coil guns, and by Krupp’s later
                    productions. As, however, progress was made and the ratio of power to weight
                    increased, it was found necessary to introduce a system of building up for steel
                    ordnance also, and Krupp adopted the principle of shrinkage to w hich the
                    English guns owed so <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n303/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0303-0290"/> much. The interior of the recent German gun is a
                    steel tube as in the Armstrong construction, but it is very much thicker and
                    forms the body of the piece, instead of being chiefly used to provide a sound
                    surface for the bore. It is thickest over the powder and shot chambers, tapering
                    towards the muzzle (fig. 40). Over the thickest part, and in some guns over a
                    considerable portion of the chase, hoops of cast steel are shrunk on,—the
                    shrinkage being adjusted to bring the strength of the outer hoops into play to
                    support the body of the gun on discharge. The number of hoops depends on the
                    size of the gun and the severity of the strain it has to withstand; they are
                    usually much more numerous than the English coils, and the section of a heavy
                    Krupp gun presents somewhat the appearance of a stone wall. It is believed that
                    the steel is not toughened in oil, but the details of manufacture have not as
                    yet been made public.</p>
                <p>Steel of the excellent quality employed by Krupp is undoubtedly a stronger
                    material than wrought iron; its present trustworthinesss is, however, of late
                    date, and it has hardly gained the general confidence accorded to wrought iron.
                    Possibly the method of construction adopted by Krupp, containing as it does a
                    number of unwelded joints, scarcely permits the several parts of the guns to
                    support each other as efficiently as is the case with the magnificent forgings
                    of the coil system; be this as it may, the German pieces, though made of
                    stronger and more expensive material than the English ones, are just as heavy
                    for any given power, proportions and ammunition being similar.</p>
                <p>In France and Italy a combination of cast iron and steel has been introduced with
                    a view to economy. The interior of the gun is a moderately thick steel tube as
                    in the coil guns; over this is a thick cast-iron body, corresponding to the
                    steel body of the Krupp guns. On the exterior are shrunk steel hoops.</p>
                <p>Sir J. Whitworth uses his fluid-compressed steel for the manufacture of ordnance.
                    He forces massive hoops over a central tube, and over one another by hydraulic
                    pressure or by shrinkage.</p>
                <p>Mr Vavasseur employs Firth’s crucible steel for his guns, which are built up
                    somewhat in the same way as Krupp’s. He also uses exterior coils of wrought iron
                    in some patterns.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Systems of Loading.—</hi> The comparative advantages of
                    breech-loading and muzzle-loading for ordnance on service are fully discussed in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Gunnery.</hi> We have now to mention the
                    principal modes of closing the breech, either permanently as in muzzle-loaders,
                    or temporarily as in breech-loaders. The former is comparatively a simple
                    matter. When the whole gun, or the interior of it, is formed of cast metal,
                    iron, bronze, or steel, the block is merely bored to the required depth, and the
                    end left unbored to form the breech. Should the inner part of the gun be formed
                    of wrought material, such as coils, it becomes necessary to close the end with
                    some device which shall render it gas-tight and strong. Several kinds of cups
                    and plugs have been tried for this purpose, the most successful of which is the
                    cup already mentioned in the description of the converted guns. When we come to
                    the temporary closing of the end of the bore demanded by breech-loading, a far
                    inore difficult problem presents itself. This problem has been more or less
                    satisfactorily solved in a great variety of ways, but it will be sufficient to
                    examine the three principal types or systems of breech-loading employed in
                    modern artillery. They are popularly known as the Armstrong, the Krupp, and the
                    French systems.</p>
                <p>The Armstrong system is the earliest of these in point of date. In it a slot is
                    cut through the top of the breech of the gun into the tube at A (fig. 41); a
                    breech block (fig. 43), through which the vent is driven, is dropped into this
                    slot, and is pressed firmly against the bore from behind by the breech screw
                    (fig. 42), which is provided with two powerful lever handles for the purpose.
                    Where the breech block, or vent piece, as it is usually called, presses against
                    the lip of the bore, both surfaces are of copper, and are renewed from time to
                    time as channels are worn through between them by the rush of the escaping
                    powder gas. There are many guns, from 6-pounders to 7-inch, made on this plan in
                    the British service, and at the time of their introduction they constituted a
                    great advance in gun construction. Experience in the field and at practice has,
                    however, revealed many grave faults in them. No joint consisting simply of two
                    abutting surfaces can be made so tight as to prevent the gas from escaping on
                    the discharge of the piece; the pressure in the powder chamber is so great that
                    a considerable expansion takes place for the moment, and permits a fan of flame
                    to flash out. The eroding effects of gas in motion at high pressure are
                    extraordinarily destructive, and constant necessity for repair arises from this
                    cause. It has also been found that in rapid firing the breech screw may be too
                    quickly forced home, nipping the vent piece before it has fallen into its proper
                    position; the end of the bore is then not sealed, and important and perhaps
                    dangerous accidents occur. Moreover, even with moderate-sized ordnance, the vent
                    piece becomes too heavy for convenient lifting.</p>
                <p>In the Krupp system (fig. 44), a slot is cut through both sides of the breech of
                    the gun; in this slot, in the latest patterns, runs a cylindro-prismatic wedge,
                    or, in other words, a wedge of D section, the round side to the rear. The flat
                    side forms the bottom of the bore. For loading, the wedge is pulled out to the
                    left side of the piece as far as the stop will allow it to go, the shell and
                    cartridge are thrust up the gun from behind, the wedge is pushed in, and is
                    pressed hard home and secured by an ingeniously-contrived screw with powerful
                    handles. As was mentioned with regard to the Armstrong system, no amount of
                    pressing home and securing would by itself be of any avail in preventing<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0304-0291"/> escape of gas at the breech, and a special
                    arrangement is therefore provided for this purpose (fig. 45). The end of the
                    bore is enlarged, and into the recess thus formed fits a Broadwell ring, against
                    which the face of the wedge abuts when forced home. The ring is so formed that
                    it must always fit against the wedge, and be pressed firmly to it by the action
                    of the gas on firing. This is accomplished by making the recessed surface of the
                    gun and the exterior surface of the ring portions of a sphere. In spite of the
                    theoretical perfection of the system, and the excellence of manufacture
                    attained, it has always been found that after a time—after firing a very
                    variable number of rounds—gas would begin to escape, and then speedily cut a
                    channel between the ring and the wedge. Krupp has fully recognized this, and has
                    been succcessful in minimizing and localizing the injury thus caused. The gas
                    has two ways of escape: it can pass either between the ring C and the body of
                    the gun D, and so out to Y; or from X to Y. Several forms of Broadwell ring have
                    been tried by Krupp; the form shown in fig. 45 is now in use. When the gun is
                    fired the gas acts on the rounded surface of the ring C, pressing it down hard
                    against the facing-plate A, and also expanding it against the body of the gun D.
                    The tendency of the gas is also to expand the body of the gun away from the
                    ring, and many bronze guns have been destroyed from this cause, having expanded
                    more than the ring was able to follow. A recess is cut in the exterior of the
                    ring, partly to give it greater spring and partly to afford a relief channel for
                    any gas that may have forced its way in. The form of ring here shown appears to
                    have overcome the efforts of the gas to escape in this direction.</p>
                <p>Having stopped the gas from getting round the outside of the ring and injuring
                    the gun, we have now to consider the results of escape from X to Y. A channel
                    cut through here would disable ring and wedge, which, though not so bad as
                    disabling ring and gun, would yet be productive of much inconvenience. The
                    insertion of the steel facing-plate A at once saves the wedge and localizes the
                    injury. It allows, moreover, of the introduction of copper discs behind the
                    plate, for the purpose of making up for wear, compression of metal of wedge,
                    &amp;c. Two relief channels are cut round that surface of the ring which abuts
                    on the facingplate. Spare Broadwell rings and facing-plates are supplied with
                    the guns; should wear set in and escape of gas ensue, the defective fittings can
                    be removed from the gun and new ones inserted in a couple of minutes. Each set
                    should last on the average for several hundred rounds.</p>
                <p>In the French system no slot is cut in the gun (fig. 46). The breech is closed by
                    a screw plug from the rear, which swings on a hinge to the side when withdrawn,
                    The male screw on the plug and the female screw in the gun are divided
                    circumferentially into six parts, of which three have the threads cut away, so
                    that the surface is alternately screw and plain cylinder. When the threads of
                    the plug coincide with the plain parts in the gun, the plug can be moved
                    straight in or out. When pushed in, one-sixth of a turn engages the threads,
                    which thus give half the bearing of an ordinary screw. This is called the
                    interrupted screw system. The plug is larger than the bore, so as to afford room
                    for the shell and cartridge to be thrust in. The end of the bore is recessed to
                    take a ring against which the end of the plug abuts, somewhat as in Krupp’s
                    guns; or a cup of steel is fixed on the end of the plug, which is slightly
                    convex; the pressure of the gas drives the flat back of the cup firmly against
                    the convex surface, bending out the lips, which are at the same time pressed
                    against the sides of the gun by the gas. This method has been lately introduced
                    by the Elswick Company.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to award superiority to the Krupp or the French system. Each
                    appears to possess some little advantage over the other, and both have attained
                    great success. The Krupp system has undergone the more thorough testing in the
                    field, and has the merit of allowing the parts which become damaged by the
                    escape of gas to be replaced with greater ease and quickness. The French system,
                    on the other hand, takes up less of the gun, so that in a piece of given length
                    the bore may be upwards of one calibre longer than with Krupp’s. In the French
                    system, also, the breechfittings are less exposed to damage by the enemy’s fire,
                    being behind the gun instead of at the side.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Destoning.</hi> —A gun, like all other machines, must be
                    designed to fulfil certain definite conditions. Its projectile may be required
                    to pierce a given thickness of armour at a given distance <hi rend="italic">;
                    or</hi> weight of piece may be the limit, and it may be wished to throw the most

                    consistent with that limit. To work out problems of this nature, it is
                    all-important to possess an accurate knowledge of the action of the charge
                    inside the bore. By means of the Noble chronoscope and the crusher gauge (sec
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Gunnery),</hi> this knowledge is obtained, and we shall now
                    explain how the indications of these instrumente are employed to assist in
                    determining the proportions of ordnance.</p>
                <p>Gunpowder is not properly so much an explosive as a substance burning and giving
                    off gas with great rapidity. It offers in this respect a marked contrast to
                    gun-cotton, dynamite, and other true explosives. If one of these agents be
                    detonated, the detonation is immediately carried through the mass, whatever its
                    size, and the whole at once turns into gas. Gunpowder, on the other hand, as far
                    as is known at present, cannot be detonated, but simply evolves its gas by
                    burning in layers from the outside to the inside. Thus a large grain will take
                    longer to burn up and become <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n305/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0305-0292"/> entirely converted into gas than a small one
                    will; hence the effect of enlarging the grains is to render the action of the
                    charge less violent, the composition of the powder being the same in all gun
                    charges. The projectile is driven out of the bore by the pressure of the gas on
                    its base,—that is, on aι area which varies with the square of the calibre. The
                    weight of projectiles of similar form varies with the cube of the calibre. Hence
                    the larger the gun the heavier will be the column of metal or projectile driven
                    by each square inch of its base; and the greater must be either the pressure
                    applied, or the time of its application, if a given velocity is to be attained.
                    The great object of the gunmaker is to obtain the highest possible ratio of
                    muzzle velocity to breech pressure. His ideal would be a charge so arranged that
                    a pressure equal to the amount the gun is constructed to bear should be
                    uniformly maintained till the shot has left the m izzle. Science is still a long
                    way from this, but has done a good deal towards it in the last few years. A
                    charge of gunpowder, composed of service ingredients in service proportions,
                    exploded in a closed vessel at a density of 1Ό0 (equal to that of water), sets
                    up a pressure of 43 tons per square inch; at a density of 0 ’ 75, of 23 ’ 2
                    tons; at 0 ’ 50, of 11 ’ 8 tons. Supposing a gun cartridge to be rammed home to
                    the density of water, and entirely converted into gas before the projectile
                    began to move, the pressure in the bore would rise to 43 tons per square inch at
                    the breech, and fall towards the muzzle, as the travel of the shot afforded
                    increasing room for expansion behind it. The column of metal to be moved, even
                    in the heaviest projectiles yet known, is only a few pounds to the square inch
                    of base, while the maximum pressure of the powder gas is measured in tons; it is
                    clear therefore that the shot must get under way at some period antecedent to
                    the setting up of the maximum pressure. In a breech-loader, where the projectile
                    has to be forced through a bore slightly less than its greatest diameter, it
                    will be detained longer than in a muzzle-loader, where it moves freely away, but
                    the difference is insignificant as regards the present argument. The result of
                    the shot’s early motion is that space is at once given for expansion, and the
                    normal 43 tons is never reached. Before these matters were fully understood,
                    badly-proportioned charges of violent powder were found sometimes to set up what
                    are known to artillerists as “wave pressures,” which were dynamical in
                    character, being caused by rushes of gas from one end of the charge to the
                    other, so that the gauges indicated far higher pressures at the ends of the
                    powder chamber than in the centre. This has now been overcome, and a great
                    increase of both power and safety has been obtained. Several important
                    improvements have been made of late years; the principal ones are three in
                    number :— (1 ) a great stride was made in the manufacture of powder when
                    pebbles, prisms, and 1⅜-inch cubes were introduced; (2) the discovery of the
                    beneficial effect of “chambering,” that is, of boring out the powder chamber to
                    a greater diameter than that of the rest of the bore; (3) the method of “air
                    spacing” the cartridge, so that a certain weight of powder should have a certain
                    definitespace allotted to it, irrespective of the actual volume of the powder
                    grains. Thus in the 80-ton gun powder cubes of 1∣ in. edge are used, having an
                    absolute density a little over L75, or about 15‘7 cubic inches to the pound. If
                    these grains were rammed tightly home in a silk-cloth bag, the space occupied
                    behind the shot would be 24 ’ 6 cubic inches per pound; as actually used, an
                    air-space over and within the cartridge is left, so that the space behind the
                    shot amounts to 34 cubic inches per pound. This density would set up a pressure
                    in a closed vessel of 26 ’ 6 tons per square inch, but the relief afforded by
                    the shot’s motion reduces it to about 19 tons per square inch. The effect of
                    chambering out the end of the bore where the powder lies is practically to
                    permit a small gun to consume effectively the charge of a larger one. The
                    cartridge is shortened, and the mechanical conditions of burning are greatly
                    improved, so that, with large charges, higher velocity with lower pressure is
                    obtained from a chambered than from an unchambered gun. The above information is
                    derived from the indications of the crusher gauge, which registers the pressure
                    of the gas at various parts of the bore. The chronoscope measures the rate at
                    which the projectile acquires velocity during its travel from the breech to the
                    muzzle. Knowing the increment of velocity at any point, we can calculate the
                    amount of pressure required to produce this increment, and thus confirmation is
                    obtained of the accuracy of the records obtained by the crusher gauge. The
                    following table gives the increase obtained at successive stages in the
                    development of the power of the 80-ton gun, which was first under-bored for
                    experiment, and gradually brought to its present dimensions <hi rend="italic"

                <p>It will be observed that each improvement has tended to facility of consumption
                    of increased charges, so that, while the pressures are diminished, the
                    penetrating power of the projectile is augmented, a heavier and more destructive
                    shell being driven through thicker armour.</p>
                <p>The manner in which the various principles, of which an explanation has been
                    above attempted, are practically applied is laborious and complicated; the
                    conditions are often conflicting, and the ultimate dimensions of a piece of
                    ordnance is commonly a compromise. A couple of simple examples will illustrate
                    the <hi rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic">operandi.</hi> Suppose that it
                    is required to design a gun which shall not exceed a given length, but shall
                    throw a projectile capable of piercing a given thickness of iron at a given
                    range. There are several formulae of a more or less empirical nature for
                    calculating the perforating power of a projectile moving with a known velocity.
                    Penetration is by some regarded as a punching action, by some as a wedging
                    action; probably it is a compound of the two. Recent experiments carried on with
                    the very high velocity of about 2000 f. s. have thrown some doubt on the
                    soundness of any of the formulae. That generally used in England is as follows
                    :—</p>

                    inches; <hi rend="italic">v=</hi> velocity of do. in feet per second; E = =
                    energy of do. in foot tons; <hi rend="italic">t =</hi> thickness of plate

                <p>2π∙r</p>
                <p>This formula tells the gun-designer what energy is necessary to overcome the
                    resistance of the plate. Guided by experience, he assumes for the moment a
                    striking velocity; the other component of the energy, the weight of the
                    projectile, is then directly arrived at. The proportions of armour-piercing
                    shell are the same for all guns, so that the weight guides the dimensions, and
                    the calibre of the gun follows. Should this appear to be in no way unsuitable to
                    the length already laid down in the conditions, the gun-designer calculates the
                    loss of velocity in the given range and from the striking velocity deduces the
                    muzzle velocity and the muzzle energy. The excellent labours <hi rend="italic"

                <p>affords the means of determining the total work performed by any charge in any
                    gun. A certain portion of this work is expended in heating the gun and
                    projectile, in giving rotation, and so forth; the remainder appears as the
                    energy of translation of the shot on leaving the muzzle. Large guns realize a
                    greater proportion of the total work than small ones; the gunmaker knows very
                    approximately by experience what percentage may be expected from certain classes
                    of ordnance with certain descriptions of powder. Roughly the factor of effect
                    may be put within the following limits:—· for mountain guns, 45 to 50 per cent;
                    field guns, 60 to 65 per cent.; medium guns, 70 to 80 per cent.; heavy guns, 85
                    to 95 per cent. The method of calculation will be best understood from an
                    example. Suppose a charge of 425 lb of P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> powder is
                    to be fired from the 80-ton gun chambered to 18 inches diameter; the projectile
                    weighs 1700 lb, and the space behind it is 14,450 cubic inches. The whole
                    content of the bore is 60,400 cubic inches, and the volume of the charge is
                    (425×27 ’ 7) 11,773 cubic inches, the number of expansions therefore is 5*13;
                    the table shows that powder gas expanding to this extent from a density equal to
                    that of water can perform work amounting to 92 ’ 4 foot-tons per lb. Since,
                    however, the charge burns up in and has to fill (425 × 34) 14,450 cubic inches
                    before doing work, the energy due to this extent of expansion (D227) is lost,
                    and 17 ’ 7 foot-tons per ft&gt; must be deducted, leaving (92 ’ 4- 17 7) 74'7
                    foot-tons perK&gt; as the total work the charge is capable of performing under
                    these conditions. It is known from the preliminary tests of the powder that in
                    the 80-ton gun between 92 and 95 per cent of the total work will be realized.
                    Hence the energy of the projectile will lie between 29,210 and 30,155 foot-tons,
                    and its muzzle velocity between 1581 and 1600 f. s. A reference to the table on
                    p. 292 will show that the result actually arrived at lies nearly midway between
                    these limits. In this manner the charge required to impart the necessary energy
                    to a shot of given weight in a given length of bore, and, conversely, the length
                    of bore which will contain the requisite number of expansions of a given charge,
                    are easily found; hence the charge required to produce the necessary energy is
                    readily found; the air-space and the dimensions of the powder chamber follow,
                    and the inside of the gun is settled. The gun designer now has to put walls
                    round his bore. Guided by the knowledge previously mentioned as derived from the
                    crusher gauge and the chronoscope, he lays down the pressures at each point of
                    the interior, and calculates the amount and strength of the metal to be used,
                    according to the special system of construction employed, and thus the exterior
                    of the gun is settled. To give another instance :—let it be required to
                    construct the most powerful howitzer that can be made for the siege train. The
                    conditions are given thus :—recoil (of piece only) must not exceed 20 feet per
                    second; weight of piece must not exceed 70 cwt.; limiting purposes are to breach
                    at 1500 yards, with not more than 5° elevation, and to bombard at 5000 yards,
                    with not more than 35° elevation. A piece weighing 70 cwt. and running back at
                    20 f. s. velocity gives 156,800 units of momentum (in pounds and foot-seconds);
                    the initial momentum of the gun in recoiling is practically equal to the
                    momentum of the shot on leaving the muzzle. Hence the shell must have 156,800
                    units of momentum, which may be composed of high velocity and light weight, or
                    low velocity and heavy weight. For breaching purposes, accuracy and penetration
                    are essential qualities; a shell varying in length from two and a half to three
                    times its diameter will be suitable for the purpose. We have now a neat problem
                    in ballistics, viz., To find the calibre of a shell of the proper length, of
                    such a weight that, with the muzzle velocity required to give a range of 1500
                    yards at 5° elevation, the muzzle momentum shall be 156,800 units. This problem
                    is readily solved by the methods indicated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gunnery,</hi> and it is found that a shell 8Ό in. in diameter, weighing 170 lb,
                    and having a muzzle velocity of 940 f. s., will be slightly on the safe side of
                    the limits. Proceeding in a similar manner, a shell 8 ’ 0 in. in diameter,
                    weighing 230 lb, starting with a velocity of 675 f. s., satisfies the conditions
                    of bombardment. The calibre being thus settled, the proportions of the piece
                    remain to be worked out. As there is no difficulty in obtaining a velocity so
                    low as 940 f. s. with a small charge and low pressure, the length of the bore
                    and the disposition of the metal can be adjusted to suit, not only the strain of
                    discharge, but the conditions of service. In the gun now under consideration,
                    the bore is made as long as possible, and the weight of metal thrown as far
                    forward as possible consistently with preserving due strength at the breech. The
                    reasons for this are threefold :—first, the longer <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n307/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0307-0294"/> the bore the less is the breech pressure required
                    to produce a given muzzle velocity, and the less is the maximum strain thrown
                    upon the studs, gas check, or other rotating agent; next, the more forward the
                    general disposition of the metal, the farther from the breech end will be the
                    centre of gravity, and consequently the trunnions,—a position which favours
                    steady shooting and absence of jump; thirdly, a siege howitzer, being always
                    fired under cover, is little exposed except near the muzzle, which should
                    therefore be made as strong as possible to avoid injury from anything less than
                    a direct hit by unburst shell.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rifling.—</hi> Spherical projectiles fired from smooth-bored
                    guns seldom or never pursue the mean trajectory. The centre of the ball’s figure
                    will rarely coincide exactly with the centre of gravity, and the pressure of the
                    air during flight will then act with unequal effect on different parts of the
                    surface. This inequality will be increased by accidental imperfections or
                    roughness. The difference between the diameter of the bore and that of the
                    projectile is termed “windage when this is considerable, it is a principal cause
                    of error in shooting, as the ball rebounds from side to side against the walls
                    of the piece as it is driven along, its actual direction of departure depending
                    on the effect of the last bump before it leaves the muzzle. Accuracy of
                    manufacture may greatly mitigate these errors, but will never entirely remove
                    them; it is therefore found necessary to cause the projectile to rotate rapidly
                    round an axis coincident with the axis of the gun; by this means the
                    inequalities in the action of the pressure of the air, due to the imperfections
                    above mentioned, take effect in all directions in turn as the projectile
                    rotates, and hence neutralize eaffi other. Extending this principle, the
                    stability imparted to a shot by its moment of rotation is such that elongated
                    projectiles can be employed and driven point first .at high speed through the
                    air. The course of the projectile from the time of its leaving the muzzle to the
                    end of its flight belongs to <hi rend="smallcaps">Gunnery</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{q.vf.</hi> Here we have to consider the modes in which the interior of the gun
                    is made to impart rotation to the projectile. Rotation is usually expressed in
                    angular velocity; a shot is said, in popular language, to make so many turns per
                    second. Mathematically, the unit of angular velocity consists of rotation
                    through the unit of circular measure in one second; the unit of circular measure
                    is the angle subtended by an arc equal to radius, viz., 57° 17' 44" 48'". If we
                    call this angle ω, a complete rotation will be expressed by 2π∙ω. In considering
                    the energy stored up in a shot’s rotation, or, what is the same thing, the work
                    done in producing that rotation, the weight of the projectile W, and its radius
                    of gyration p, must be taken into account. The energy of a travelling W·» <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> body is —; the weight of a rotating one is supposed
                    to be concentrated at the end of the radius of gyration; then if Ω be the
                    angular velocity, the velocity of a travelling body will correspond with pΩ in a
                    rotating one, and the energy W</p>
                <p>of rotation will be expressed by ^p <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> Ω <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. The proportions of service projectiles differ for
                    different guns, the thicknesses of sides and base and the shape of head varying;
                    but roughly for common shell the value of p may be taken as 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 40&lt;∕ <hi rend="italic">(fl</hi> = diameter), for
                    Palliser projectiles as 0 ’ 38&lt;∕, and for shrapnel as 0∙36&lt;∕. For
                    artillery purposes a projectile is said to turn once in so many calibres, that
                    is, to make one complete revolution in travelling a distance equal to so many
                    times the diameter of the bore. Supposing a given length of groove in the bore
                    to make a known angle with a line parallel to the axis of the gun, determining
                    the arc through which the surface of the shot must turn while advancing the
                    length of the groove, it is evident that the angular velocity attained by the
                    shot will entirely depend on the velocity of translation or forward movement.
                    Again, the greater the diameter of the bore the less will be the proportion
                    borne by the arc turned through to the whole circumference; consequently the
                    bigger the gun the less the angular velocity of the projectile, if the angle of
                    rifling and the velocity of translation remain constant; the velocity of
                    rotation of a point on the surface will, under these conditions, always be
                    uniform. It is generally considered that with studded muzzle-loading service
                    projectiles, having a length equal to about 2⅜ to 3 times their diameter, the
                    velocity of rotation of a surface point of about 110 f. s. is sufficient to keep
                    them steady, allowing for loss of spin by atmospheric friction up to any
                    probable range. Supposing the interior of the gun to be opened out and laid
                    flat, the groove (of a uniform twist) will be straight, and since the shot
                    guided by it makes a complete revolution in <hi rend="italic">n</hi> calibres,
                    the angle made by the groove with a line parallel to the gun’s axis may be
                    expressed by tan In designing the piece, the muzzle velocity is determined on,
                    and also the velocity of rotation to be communicated to the projectile; the
                    combination of the two fixes the final angle of the groove. Now it is easy to
                    see that the spin of the shot on leaving the bore depends only on the conditions
                    immediately preceding. The rate at which the work of giving rotation is done
                    during the travel of the projectile from breech to muzzle is an entirely
                    different question. If a shot be rotating, its tendency is, putting friction
                    aside for the moment, to continue to rotate with the same velocity. No work is
                    done in keeping up-this rate of rotation, but work would be done in accelerating
                    or retarding it. Thus in apportioning the work done on the shot in giving
                    rotation at different parts of the bore, we have to consider, not the actual
                    angular velocity, but the increments of angular velocity. The work then can be
                    distributed at pleasure over the whole length of the groove, by varying the
                    angle it makes with a line parallel to the gun’s axis, as it runs along the
                    bore. Supposing, as before, the interior surface of the gun to be opened out and
                    laid flat, then OU (fig 47) will represent a groove having a uniform twist, that
                    is making a constant angle with a line OM parallel to the axis of the piece. 0
                    denotes the commencement of the rifling at the breech end of the bore, UPM the
                    muzzle. Guns are rifled with any number of grooves exceeding two, but it is not
                    necessary to consider more than one. With the groove OU, every increment of
                    angular velocity imparted to the shot is due to an increment in the velocity of
                    translation; and therefore the pressure between the sides of the grooves, and
                    the studs, gas check, lead coating, or whatever fitting on the shot is employed
                    for the purpose, bears a constant relation to the pressure of the powder gas on
                    the base of the shot driving it forward. The table given below shows the result
                    of this with great clearness. In order to mitigate the unevenness of strain,
                    recourse was had to the increasing twist; and a curved groove was employed
                    which, when developed as in fig. 47, forms the parabola OP, beginning at the
                    point O, parallel to OM, and terminating at P, parallel to OU. The equation to
                    OU is <hi rend="italic">x=py</hi>; that to OP is <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">≈ ρy.</hi> Since OP is a
                    parabola having its vertex at O, and since the tangent at P is parallel to OU
                    therefore <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n308/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0308-0295"/> UP = PM, which shows that the shot, though
                    rotating in either case with equal angular velocity on leaving the muzzle, has,
                    up to that moment, with the parabolic twist turned through an angle half as
                    great as would be the case with the uniform twist. The table below exemplifies
                    the principle on which curves of rifling are, or should be, constructed. The
                    first three columns speak for themselves; the fourth is arrived at by
                    multiplying the area of the shot’s base by the gas pressure per square inch
                    recorded on the gauges, and given in the 5th column. Columns 6 and 7 are worked
                    out from formulae due to Captain Noble of Elswick; in column 6 the pressures due
                    to a uniform twist are given. It will be seen that they bear a constant
                    proportion to the pressures of the gas recorded in columns 4 and 5, and that the
                    maximum rises to a considerable height soon after the shot has begun to move,
                    while at the muzzle little work is done. In column 7 the calculations are made
                    to suit a curve consisting of a portion of a parabola, starting from the vertex
                    where the groove is parallel to the axis of the piece, and rising to the
                    required twist at one foot from the muzzle, thence proceeding uniformly. In this
                    curve the maximum strain is greatly reduced, the pressure gradually <hi

                    worked out by Captain Noble. Column 8 shows the pressures required to give the
                    necessary rotation when the curve of groove is a semicubical parabola, having

                    derived from a calculation worked out on the principle devised by Captain Noble.
                    Here the maximum is yet further reduced, and some approach to uniformity of

                <p>A radical difference exists between the rifling of muzzle-loaders and that
                    usually employed for breech-loaders. When the projectile has to be pushed down
                    the gun from the front, it must be smaller than the bore; when it is thrust home
                    from behind, it may be rather larger than the bore. Hence the earlier
                    muzzle-loading shells were provided with ribs or studs which fitted in the
                    grooves, and guided the projectile in its rotatory course; while the earlier
                    breech-loading shells were coated with lead, into which the lands of the bore
                    bit sharply as the powder gas forced the projectile between them. All rifled
                    ordnance were formerly rifled with a uniform twist; indeed, it is clear that
                    where ribs are cast or fixed on the projectile, or where they are formed in the
                    soft envelope by the first action of the grooves, no alteration in the angle of
                    rifling is possible, since the ribs can only make a constant angle with a line
                    parallel to the axis of the piece, and cannot fit a groove making a varying
                    angle with it. The smaller and earlier muzzle-loading rifled projectiles were
                    fitted with two rows of studs, front and rear, and equal in size, so that a
                    front and rear stud travelled in each groove, and practically constituted the
                    ends of a rib. As the guns grew, it was found that the great strain of giving
                    rotation at starting frequently forced the bronze studs out of the recesses
                    machined for them in the sides of the shells, and scooped away the driving edges
                    of the grooves even when the gun lining was of steel. The shell might have been
                    cast with ribs on them, but certain difficulties of manufacture stood in the
                    way, and the excessive strain would still have existed though its effects might
                    have been mitigated. The increasing twist was therefore devised, and the rows of
                    studs increased in number from two to three in the larger natures of
                    projectiles. Three studs are allotted to each <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n309/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0309-0296"/><hi rend="italic">groove</hi>; the rear one is the
                    largest, the front one the smallest. They are so placed that the line of their
                    loading sides is parallel to the angle made by the groove at the breach, while
                    the line of their driving edges is parallel to the angle made by the groove at
                    the muzzle. In Plate IV. fig. 1 shows their position when the shell is home, and
                    also when about to leave the bore. Thus, theoretically, the middle and leading
                    stud should never come into play till the last moment, and the rear stud should
                    do all the work of rotation. Practically, however, the rear stud, being of
                    bronze, wears down against the edge of the hard groove; the centre stud obtains
                    a bearing; the wear continues, and the leading stud takes up its share of duty;
                    so that all three really act during the passage of the projectile through the
                    bore. This method of employing the increasing twist necessitates wide grooves,
                    and is unsuitable for small guns. A different plan therefore was devised to meet
                    their case. Two rows of studs, front and rear, were so arranged that each ran in
                    a groove of its own. The curve of the grooves belonging to the rear stud began
                    at 0°, and reached the final angle at a distance from the muzzle equal to the
                    distance between the front and rear rows, after which it proceeded in a straight
                    line. The curve of the grooves belonging to the front studs began at 0°, at a
                    distance in front of the commencement of the other grooves equal to the distance
                    between the rows, and reached its final angle at the muzzle. Thus the two curves
                    were alike, but one was always a constant distance in front of the other, and
                    every stud acted through the entire length. Fig. 2 in Plate IV. shows the
                    position of the studs when the shot is home, and also when it is about to leave
                    the bore.</p>
                <p>Muzzle-loading rifling had reached this stage of progress at a time when the
                    great wear caused by the rush of gas over the shot necessitated the adoption of
                    some method of sealing the escape. After many trials, it was found that a
                    flanged copper disc fitted on to the base of the projectile would expand under
                    the first pressure of the gas, and cut off the windage completely. This saved
                    the wear of the guns, and added to their power. It was found, moreover, that the
                    flanges of these “gas checks” expanded in the grooves, and being firmly attached
                    to the shell afforded an additional means of giving rotation. The next step was
                    to remove the studs altogether, using a smooth projectile, and substituting many
                    small grooves for few large ones. This method of giving rotation has been
                    adopted in all recently-designed pieces, and appears likely to give entire
                    satisfaction. When muzzle-loading guns were first rifled, many attempts were
                    made to give rotation by expanding projectiles, but they proved unsuccessful,
                    because at that time the increasing twist was not known, and the action of a
                    violent powder and the uniform twist was that the rotator had to expand into the
                    grooves, and at the same instant to communicate a rapid spin to the shell. It
                    was unable to combine these operations, and the projections driven out by the
                    gas could never settle to their work, being constantly cut down by the edges of
                    the grooves. The result was that the shell “stripped,” and left the bore without
                    regular rotation. In the case of the twist which begins at 0°, the projections
                    hive time to expand comfortably, and adapt themselves to the shape of the
                    grooves before they are called on to perform the work of rotation. On the other
                    hand, since the gas presses out the flanges against the bore and into the
                    grooves, and affords them support in this position, it is desirable that it3
                    pressure should correspond with their pressure on the driving edges of the
                    grooves. This would be exactly met by the uniform twist, but that is
                    inadmissible for the reason just given. The parabola, on the other hand, throws
                    the principal rotating strain forward towards the muzzle, where the gas pressure
                    is least (Plate IV. ). The case is practically met by the semicubical parabola,
                    which is the curve adopted in the 80-ton gun. While progress was thu3 being made
                    in the rifling of muzzle-loaders, the rival system had not remained inactive;
                    the use of lead coating had been found to involve a loss of power in the
                    projectile as regarded both the amount of bursting charge or bullets carried,
                    and the penetration into armour, on to the surface of which the lead flew
                    forward in a splash, when the shell struck. Moreover, the lead envelope would
                    not lend itself to the exigencies of the increasing twist. To meet these
                    difficulties, two undercut rings were machined round the smooth projectile, one
                    near the base, the other near the shoulder. Into these slots were pressed stout
                    copper wires, the rear one bringing up the diameter of the shell beyond that of
                    the bore, so <hi rend="smallcaps">rs</hi> to take the rifling when forced
                    through the piece on discharge, the front one just fitting the lands, but not
                    entering the grooves, so as to rotate irrespective of them, and thus keep the
                    fore part of the shot steady. Projectiles thus fitted are more effective than
                    the lead-coated ones, and are adapted to any twist of rifling. The latest
                    breech-loaders made by the Elswick Company use the new arrangement described
                    above for muzzle-loaders— the smooth shell with a gas check on the base. This
                    appears to be the best form of projectile, and has the advantage of suiting
                    either system. A few words on the section of groove best suited to various
                    purposes will conclude the subject of rifling. The rotation is impressed on the
                    projectile by a force acting tangentially to the surface. This principle would
                    be represented in its extreme form by making the section of the shell to
                    resemble a cog-wheel, the grooves and lands of the gun being bored to fit. With
                    muzzle-loading systems where windage has been necessary, the sides of the
                    projections on the projectile, and of the grooves in the bore, have been sloped
                    to enable the projections to run up the sides of the grooves, and so distribute
                    the windage equally all round. The extreme form of this principle is Lancaster’s
                    oval bore, the section of which departs but slightly from a circle. All attempts
                    at “centring” the projectile by sloping the bearings tend to convert it into a
                    wedge, which expends that part of the force resolved radially in a crushing
                    action on the shell, and a rending action on the gun. The slope may, however, be
                    made of such a degree as to cause the projectile to centre fairly without
                    exercising any important effect on the bore. In breech-loading systems, where
                    the lands bite into the rotator, the driving edge strikes the projectile in, or
                    nearly in, the prolongation of the radius, care being taken that the points of
                    action are as many as possible consistently with leaving enough material between
                    to stand the wear and the strain. Where gas checks expand in the grooves, these
                    should be broad and flat, so that a complete fit and a strong projection should
                    result. The driving edges should here also form a prolongation of the radius of
                    the projectile.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Conclusion.—</hi> What may be the future of firearms it is
                    impossible to predict, but it seems probable that the limit of power will be
                    found to lie in the recoil. F&lt;'r shoulder guns, methods of withstanding
                    increased velocities may be devised, but the weight of springs, pads, &lt;fcc.,
                    will prevent the soldier or the sportsman from carrying this principle very far.
                    For ordnance, the field artillery appear even now to be very near the limit of
                    what power can be gained consistently with high mobility. Siege and heavy guns
                    will no doubt gain by the increased application of hydraulics; but it is
                    difficult to see how progress can go much further except in the matter of size,
                    to which there appears to be practically no limit. Accuracy may be improved by
                    more perfect methods of range finding, but, as regards the actual shooting of
                    the guns, it is already in advance of the difficulties of atmospheric
                    irregularity, which affects the smaller projectiles greatly. The reader who
                    wishes to study the subject closely and technically is referred to the list of
