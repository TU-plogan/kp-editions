                    his undergraduate career, he undertook a literary tour which, apart from the
                    advantages of stimulative contact with many of the most distinguished scholars
                    of England, France, and Holland, as well as of his own country, was of great
                    utility to him in providing him with materials for the great work of his
                    subsequent life. On his return to Halle, he acted for some time as
                    “privat-docent,” but in 1773 was appointed to a professorial chair; in 1775 he
                    was translated to Jena, where the remainder of his life was spent in
                    ever-increasing usefulness and honour, and where he died 24th March 1812.</p>
                <p>Griesbach’s critical edition of the New Testament first appeared at Halle, in
                    three volumes, in 1774-75. The first volume contained the first three gospels,
                    synoptically arranged; the second, the fourth gospel and the Acts of the
                    Apostles. All the historical books were reprinted in one volume in 1777, the
                    synoptical arrangement of the gospels having been abandoned as inconvenient. Of
                    the second edition, very considerably enlarged and improved, the first volume
                    appeared in 1796 and the second in 1806 (Halle and London). Of a third edition,
                    edited by Schulz, only the first volume, containing the four gospels, has
                    appeared (1827).</p>
                <p>For the construction of his critical text Griesbach took as his <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0206-0195"/> basis the Elzevir edition, from which he departed
                    only when valid reasons seemed to require it. In all such cases he placed the
                    Elzevir reading on the inner margin along with such other readings as he thought
                    worthy of special consideration (these last, however, being printed in smaller
                    type). To all the readings on this margin he attached special marks indicating
                    the precise degree of probability in his opinion attaching to each. In weighing
                    these probabilities he proceeded upon a particular theory which in its leading
                    features he had derived from Bengel and Semler, dividing all the MSS. into
                    three, great families or recensions—the Alexandrian, the Western, and the
                    Byzantine. The Alexandrian recension had (as the name implied) originated in
                    Alexandria, and thence had spread over Egypt and the East; it is characterized
                    by a general tendency to tone down all Hebraisms, inelegancies, and
                    inaccuracies. The Western on the other hand had retained the Hebraisms
                    unimpaired, but had incorporated many glosses, as well as interpolations from
                    parallel passages, with the purpose of making the text more intelligible
                    (Grammaticum egit Alexandrinus censor, interpretem occidentalis). The Byzantine
                    he regarded as much later, and as combining and exaggerating the peculiarities
                    of both the others. A reading that was supported by only one recension he
                    considered as having only one witness in its favour; those readings on the other
                    hand which were supported by all the three recensions, or even by two of them,
                    especially if these two were the Alexandrian and the Western, he uuhesitatingly
                    accepts as genuine. Only when each of the three recensions gives a different
                    reading does he proceed to discuss the question on other grounds. See his <hi
