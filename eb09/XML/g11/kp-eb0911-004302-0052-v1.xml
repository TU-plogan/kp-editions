                    history of a man who entirely represents one section, fortunately a small
                    section, of the society of his day. Of good family, rich, a gallant soldier,
                    endowed with every kind of cleverness<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0911-0053-0044"/>, the Count de Graιnont endeavoured to live
                    the life of unrestrained enjoyment. In this he so far succeeded that, although
                    the following century furnished more numerous examples of his kind, he may be
                    taken as the most finished specimen. His ideal man was a being without
                    conscience, without principle, without religion, without a soul. At the court of
                    Charles II. he found companions like himself, —women without virtue, men without
                    honour, yet disguised and adorned with courtly manners and that external
                    refinement which did duty for principle; and had it not been that his
                    brother-in-law, Hamilton, conceived the design of writing the memoirs which have
                    made him famous, Gramont would have been as entirely forgotten as most of his
                    friends, save for a brief mention by St Evremond and another by Bussy Rabutin in
                    that little-visited gallery of portraits, the <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                        Amoureuse.</hi> His grandfather had the distinction of being husband to
                    Diane d’Andouins, <hi rend="italic">la belle Corisande,</hi> one of the
                    mistresses of Henry IV. The grandson always regretted that the king had not
                    acknowledged his father for his own son, lamenting even in the presence of Louis
                    XIV. that his family had-missed the chance of becoming, in this illegitimate
                    fashion, a branch of the royal line. The anecdote is entirely characteristic. It
                    was at first proposed to enter him in the church, but he speedily perceived that
                    his vocation was not ecclesiastical, and joined the army, in which he saw a
                    great deal of active service, and was rewarded with the governorship of the Pays
                    d’Aunis, and with other small posts. He crossed over to England during the
                    protectorate of Cromwell. In the year 1662, two years after the restoration of
                    Charles II., he was exiled from the French court and again repaired to Loudon,
                    where he found such a welcome as was due to his manners, his gaiety, his
                    extraordinary good spirits, and his love of gambling, intrigue, gallantry, and
                    pleasure. It is the period of his residence at the English court which forms the
                    greater part of Hamilton’s memoirs. He is described by Bussy Rabutin as having
                    “laughing eyes, a well formed nose, a pretty mouth, a little dimple in the chin
                    which gave an agreeable effect to the whole face, a certain finesse in his
                    countenance, and a fairly good stature but for a stoop.” In the whole English
                    court there was no one more full of wit, more avid of pleasure, more devoid of
                    all moral restraint, not even Rochester himself, than the Count de Gramont.
                    Naturally, the court being what it was, there was no one more popular. In a
                    court where the women vied with each other for the king’s favour, where the men
                    habitually cheated at play, seduced their friends’ wives, and corrupted their
                    friends’ daughters, that man would be most popular in whom the absence of
                    principle became, by reason of his grace, <hi rend="italic">esprit,</hi> and
                    elegance, in itself a recommendation. Gramont was as purely a sensualist as any
                    Roman of the later empire.</p>
                <p>He married, in London, but on compulsion, the sister of his future biographer,
                    Miss Hamilton, who, her brother tells us in the memoirs, was able to fix his
                    affections. The statement must be received with some qualifications. The count,
                    it is true, was by no means young when he married. At the same time, he
                    “galantisait” for many years afterwards, and, in fact, to the very end of a long
                    life. He was the only old man, says Ninon de ΓEnclos, who could.affect the
                    follies of youth without being ridiculous. In fact, Gramont, like La Fontaine,
                    was a spoiled child, to whom everything was allowed, and who repaid indulgence
                    by perpetual high spirits, and a continual flow of wit and <hi rend="italic"
                        >bans mots.</hi> At the age of seventy-five he had a dangerous illness,
                    during which he became reconciled, in his way, to the church, but on recovery
                    relapsed into his old habits. At eighty he either dictated or revised his own
                    memoirs, written by his brother-in-law Antony Hamiltcn. When they were finished
                    he sold the manuscript for 1500 franc3 and kept most of the money himself.
                    Fontenelle, then censor of the press, refused to license the work, from
                    considerations of respect to the old man who had so strangely exposed in its
                    pages the whole of his character. These scruples were overcome by the count
                    himself, who had the pleasure of seeing his biography appear in his own
                    lifetime, and of laughing with the rest of the world at his own rogueries at
                    cards, his amorous adventures, and his secret intrigues.</p>
                <p>He died at the great age of eighty-six. His biographer Hamilton died thirteen
                    years later at the age of seventy-four. The memoirs of the Count de Gramont are
                    not to be recommended for general reading; yet they have the merit of being
                    true; in no other work is the reality of that profligate society of St James’s
                    so vividly expressed; in no other contemporary memoirs is there so much wit,
                    such grace of style, such skill in portraiture. Numerous editions and
                    translations have been issued of this work, whose popularity seems destined to
                    continue and grow.</p>
