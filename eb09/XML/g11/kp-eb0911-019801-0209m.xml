                    (1785-1863), was born on the 4th of January 1785 at Hanau, in Hesse-Cassel. His
                    father, who was a lawyer, died while he was still a child, and the mother was
                    left with very small means; but her sister, who was lady of the chamber to the
                    landgravine of Hesse, helped to support and educate her numerous family. Jacob
                    with his younger brother Wilhelm (born on the 24th of February 1786) was sent in
                    1798 to the public school at Cassel. In 1802 he proceeded to the university of
                    Marburg, where he applied himself to the study of law, a profession for which he
                    had always been destined by his father, and which seemed to offer the best
                    prospect of speedy independence. His brother joined him at Marburg a year later,
                    having just recovered from a long and severe illness, and likewise began the
                    study of law. Up to this time Grimm had been actuated only by a general thirst
                    for knowledge and the instinct of intellectual activity, and his energies had
                    not found any aim beyond the practical one of making himself a position in life.
                    The first definite impulse came from the lectures of Savigny, the celebrated
                    investigator of Roman law, who, as Grimm himself says (in the preface to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Deutsche Grammatilc),</hi> first taught him to realize what it
                    meant to study any science, whether that of law or any other. Savigny’s lectures
                    at the same time awakened in him that love for historical and antiquarian
                    investigation which forms the basis of all his work. Then followed personal
                    acquaintance, and it was in Savigny’s well-provided library that Grimm first
                    turned over the leaves of Bodmer’s edition of the Old German minnesingers and
                    other early texts, and felt an eager desire to penetrate further into the
                    obscurities and half-revealed mysteries of their language. In the beginning of
                    1805 he received an invitation from Savigny, who had removed to Paris to
                    continue his researches among the libraries there, to join him and help him in
                    his literary work. This offer was joyfully accepted by young Grimm, who passed a
                    very happy time in Paris, enjoying the society of Savigny, and strengthening his
                    taste for the literatures of the Middle Ages by his studies in the Paris
                    libraries. Towards the close of the year he returned to Cassel, where his mother
                    and Wilhelm had settled, the latter having finished his studies. The next year
                    he obtained a situation in the war office with the very small salary of 100
                    thalers. One of his grievances was, as he himself tells us in his autobiography,
                    that he had to exchange his stylish Paris suit for a stiff uniform and pigtail.
                    But he had full leisure for the prosecution of his studies. In 1808, soon after
                    the death of his mother, he was appointed superintendent of the private library
                    of Jerome Buonaparte, king of Westphalia, into which Hesse-Cassel had been
                    incorporated by Napoleon. He was treated with marked favour by the king, who
                    appointed him an auditor to the state council, while he still retained his other
                    post. His salary was increased in a short interval from 2000 to 4000 francs,
                    which removed all anxiety as to the means of subsistence, and his official
                    duties were hardly more than nominal. After the expulsion of Jerome and the
                    reinstalment of an elector, Grimm was appointed in 1813 secretary of legation,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n210/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0210-0199"/> to accompany the Hessian minister to the
                    headquarters of the allied army. In 1814 he was sent to Paris to demand
                    restitution of the books carried off by the French, and in 1814-15 he attended
                    the congress of Vienna as secretary of legation. On his return he was again sent
                    to Paris on the same errand as before. Meanwhile Wilhelm had received an
                    appointment in the Cassel library, and in 1816 Jacob was made second librarian
                    under Völkel. On the death of Völkel in 1828 the brothers expected to be
                    advanced to the first and second librarianships respectively, and were much
                    dissatisfied when the first place was given to Rommel, keeper of the archives.
                    So they removed next year to Göttingen, where Jacob received the appointment of
                    professor and librarian, Wilhelm that of under-librarian. Jacob Grimm lectured
                    on legal antiquities, historical grammar, literary history, and diplomatics,
                    explained Old German poems, and commented on the <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi>
                    of Tacitus. At this period he is described as small and lively in figure, with a
                    harsh voice, speaking a broad Hessian dialect. His powerful memory enabled him
                    to dispense with the “heft” which most German professors rely on, and he spoke
                    extempore, referring only occasionally to a few names and dates written on a
                    slip of paper. He himself regretted that he had begun the work of teaching so
                    late in life, and as a lecturer he was not successful; he had no idea of
                    digesting his facts and suiting them to the comprehension of his hearers; and
                    even the brilliant, terse, and eloquent passages which abound in his writings
                    lost much of their effect when jerked out in the midst of a long array of dry
                    facts. In 1837, being one of the seven professors who signed a protest again 81
                    the king of Hanover’s abrogation of the constitution which had been established
                    some years before, he was dismissed from his professorship, and banished from
                    the kingdom of Hanover. He returned to his native Cassel together with his
                    brother, who had also signed the protest, and remained there till, in 1840, they
                    accepted an invitation from the king of Prussia to remove to Berlin, where they
                    both received professorships, and were elected members of the Academy of
                    Sciences. Not being under any obligation to lecture, Jacob very seldom did so,
                    but together with his brother worked at the great dictionary, the plan of which
                    had already been partly developed. During their stay at Cassel Jacob regularly
                    attended the meetings of the academy, where he read papers on the most varied
                    subjects. The best known of these are those on Lachmann, Schiller, and his
                    brother Wilhelm (who died in 1859), on old age, and on the origin of language.
                    He also described his impressions of Italian and Scandinavian travel,
                    interspersing his more general observations with linguistic details, as is the
                    case in all his works. He died in 1863, working up to the last.</p>
                <p>Grimm’s physical constitution was an excellent one. He possessed in the highest
                    degee that Teutonic energy and endurance which are as essential to the sedentary
                    student as to the pioneer in other regions of human activity. He was never ill,
                    and worked on all day, without haste and without pause. He himself (in his
                    biography) βpeaks of his “iron industry.” He was not at all impatient of
                    interruption, but seemed rather to be refreshed by it, returning to his work
                    without effort. He wrote for press with great rapidity, and hardly ever made
                    corrections. He never revised what he had written, remarking with a certain
                    wonder of his brother, “Wilhelm reads his manuscripts over again before sending
                    them to press !” He often started on a journey which he had determined upon only
                    the day before. His temperament was uniformly cheerful, and he was easily
                    amused. He.took a keen interest in politics, and when the newspapers arrived, he
                    would often read them through at once, breaking off his work for the purpose.
                    Outside his own special work he had a marked taste for botany, and always liked
                    to have flowers about him while working, a taste which was shared by his
                    brother. The spirit which animated his work is best described by himself at the
                    end of his autobiography. “Nearly all my labours have been devoted, either
                    directly or indirectly, to the investigation of our earlier language, poetry,
                    and laws. These studies may have appeared to many, and may still appear,
                    useless; to me they have always seemed a noble and earnest task, definitely and
                    inseparably connected with our common fatherland, and calculated to foster the
                    love of it. My principle has always been in these investigations to undervalue
                    nothing, but to utilize the small for the illustration of the great, the popular
                    tradition for the elucidation of the written monuments.” We may, in fact, sum up
                    Grimm’s tendencies by saying that he was inspired by an intense enthusiasm for
                    research, guided into definite channels by a not less enthusiastic love and
                    veneration for everything German,—this word including, in its widest sense, all
                    the great brotherhood of the Teutonic nations,—and limited by his decided
                    predilection for history and antiquities. It will be observed that, whenever he
                    refers to living dialects or traditions, it is in order to throw light on the
                    past, not the reverse. Even 4n his great German dictionary the historical
                    tendency strongly predominates.</p>
                <p>The purely scientific side of Grimm’s character developed itself but slowly, and
                    it was long before he applied to the study of etymology and inflexions the
                    system and method Savigny had taught him to develop in legal history. He seems
                    to have felt the want of definite principles of etymology without being able to
                    discover them, and indeed even in the first edition of his grammar (1819) he
                    seems to be often groping in the dark, and to have but a vague idea of the
                    necessity of rigorous principles of letter-comparison. As early as 1815 we find
                    A. W. Schlegel reviewing the <hi rend="italic">Altdeutsche</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Walder</hi> (a periodical published by the two brothers) very severely,
                    condemning the lawless etymological combinations it contained, and insisting on
                    the necessity of strict philological method and a fundamental investigation of
                    the laws of language, especially in the correspondence of sounds. This criticism
                    is said to have had a considerable influence on the direction of Grimm’s
                    studies.</p>
                <p>The first work he published, <hi rend="italic">Ueber</hi><hi rend="italic">den
                    altdeutschen Meistergesang</hi> (1811), was of a purely literary character. But
                    even here we see the difference between the more passive contemplation of the
                    aesthetic literary critic and the activity of the investigator who is always
                    seeking definite results and definite laws. In this essay Grimm showed that <hi
                    rend="italic">Minnesang</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Meistersang</hi> were really
                    one form of poetry, of which they merely represented different stages of
                    development, and also announced his important discovery of the invariable
                    division of the <hi rend="italic">Lied</hi> into three strophic parts.</p>
                <p>His text-editions were mostly prepared in common with his brother. In 1812 they
                    published the two ancient fragments of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hildebrandslied</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Weissenbrunner Gebet,</hi> Jacob
                    having discovered what till then had never been suspected—the alliteration in
                    these poems. However, Jacob had but little taste for text-editing, and, as he
                    himself confessed, the evolving of a critical text gave him little pleasure. He
                    therefore left this department to others, especially Lachmann, who soon turned
                    his brilliant critical genius, trained in the severe school of classical
                    philology, to Old and Middle High German poetry and metre. Both brothers were
                    attracted from the beginning by all national poetry, whether in the form of
                    epics, ballads, or popular tales. They published in 1816—18 an analysis and
                    critical sifting of the oldest epic traditions of the Germanic races under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Deutsche Sagen.</hi> At the same time they collected
                    all the popular tales they could find, partly from <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0211-0200"/> the mouths of the people, partly from manuscripts
                    and book?, aud published in 1812-15 the first edition of those <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kinder-</hi><hi rend="italic">und Haus-Märchen</hi> which have carried the name
                    of the brothers Grimm into every household of the civilized world, and founded
                    the science of what is now called folklore. The closely allied subject of the
                    satirical beast epic of the Middle Ages also had a great charm for Jacob Grimm,
                    and he published an edition of the <hi rend="italic">Reinhart Fuchs</hi> in
                    1834. His first contribution to mythology was the first volume of an edition of
                    the Eddaic songs, undertaken conjointly with his brother, published in 1815,
                    which, however, was not followed by any more. The first edition of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic">Mythologie</hi> appeared in 1835.
                    This great work covers the whole range of the subject, tracing the mythology and
                    superstitions of the old Teutons back to the very dawn of direct evidence, and
                    following their decay and loss down to the popular traditions, tales, and
                    expressions in which they still linger.</p>
                <p>Although by the introduction of the Code Napoléon into Westphalia Grimm’s legal
                    studies were made practically barren, he never lost his interest in the
                    scientific study of law and national institutions, as the truest exponents of
                    the life and character of a people. By the publication (in 1828) of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Rechtsalterthamer</hi> he laid the foundations of that historical
                    study of the old Teutonic laws and constitutions which has been continued with
                    brilliant success by Maurer and others. In this work Grimm showed the importance
                    of a linguistic study of the old laws, and the light that can be thrown on many
                    a dark passage in them by a comparison of the corresponding words and
                    expressions in the other old cognate dialects. He also knew how—and this is
                    perhaps the most original and valuable part of his work—to trace the spirit of
                    the laws in countless allusions and sayings which occur in the old poems and
                    sagas, or even survive in modern colloquialisms.</p>
                <p>Of all his more general works the boldest and most far-reaching is unquestionably
                    his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der deutschen Sprache,</hi> where at the same
                    time the linguistic element is most distinctly brought forward. The subject of
                    the work is, indeed, nothing less than the history which lies hidden in the
                    words of the German language—the oldest national history of the Teutonic tribes
                    determined by means of language. For this purpose he laboriously collects the
                    scattered words and allusions to be found in classical writers, and endeavours
                    to determine the relations in which the German language stood to those of the
                    Getae, Thracians, Scythians, and many other nations whose languages are known to
                    us only by doubtfully identified, often extremely corrupted remains preserved by
                    Greek and Latin authors. It need hardly be said that Grimm’s results have been
                    greatly modified by the wider range of comparison and improved methods of
                    investigation which now characterize linguistic science, while, on the other
                    hand, many of the questions raised by him will probably for ever remain obscure;
                    but his book will always be one of the most fruitful and suggestive that have
                    been ever written.</p>
                <p>We now come to his purely philological work, of which lι is famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic">Grammatik</hi> was the outcome. We
                    have already seen how slowly and with what difficulty he attained a sound method
                    of etymological and grammatical investigation. Nevertheless the time was a
                    favourable one for his work. The persevering labours of past generations —from
                    the humanists onwards—had collected an enormous mass of materials in the shape
                    of text-editions, dictionaries, and grammars, although most of it was uncritical
                    and often untrustworthy. Something had even been done in the way of comparison
                    and the determination of general laws, and the conception of a comparative
                    Teutonic grammar had been clearly grasped by the illustrious Englishman Hickes,
                    at the beginning of the last century, and partly carried out by him in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Thesaurus.</hi> Ten Kate in Holland Ind afterwards made valuable
                    contributions to the history and comparison of the Teutonic languages. Even
                    Grimm himself did not at first intend to include all the languages in his
                    grammar; but he soon found that Old High German postulated Gothic, that the
                    later stages of German could not be understood without the help of the Low
                    German dialects, including English, and that the rich literature of Scandinavia
                    could as little be ignored. The first edition of the first part of the <hi

                    treated of the inflexions of all these languages, together with a general
                    introduction, in which he vindicated the importance of a historical study of the
                    German language against the <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> quasi-philosophical
                    methods then in vogue.</p>
                <p>In 1822 this volume appeared in a second edition— really a totally new work, for,
                    as Grimm himself says in the preface, it cost him little reflexion to mow down
                    the first crop to the ground. The wide distance between the two stages of
                    Grimm’s development in these two editions is significantly shown by the fact
                    that while the first edition gives only the inflexions, in the second volume
                    phonology takes up no less than 600 pages, more than half of the whole volume.
                    Grimm had, at last, awakened to the full conviction that all sound philology
                    must be based on rigorous adhesion to the laws of sound-change, and he never
                    afterwards swerved from this principle, which gave to all his investigations,
                    even in their boldest flights, that iron-bound consistency, and that force of
                    conviction which distinguishes science from dilettanteism; up to Grimm’s time
                    philology was—as it still is in England—nothing but a more or less laborious and
                    conscientious dilettanteism, with occasional flashes of scientific inspiration;
                    lie made it into a science. His advance must be attributed mainly to the
                    influence of his contemporary Rask. Rask was born two years later than Grimm,
                    but his remarkable precocity gave him somewhat the start. Even in his first
                    edition Grimm’s Icelandic paradigms are based entirely on Rask’s grammar, and in
                    his second edition he has relied almost entirely on Rask for Old English. His
                    debt to Rask can only be estimated at its true value by comparing his treatment
                    of Old English in the two editions; the difference is very great. Thus in the
                    first edition he declines <hi rend="italic">dceg, deeges,</hi> plural <hi
                    rend="italic">dcegas,</hi> not having observed the law of vowelchange pointed
                    out by Rask. There can be little doubt that the appearance of Rask’s Old English
                    grammar was a main inducement for him to recast his work from the beginning. To
                    Rask also belongs the merit of having first distinctly formulated the laws of
                    sound-correspondence in the different languages, especially in the vowels, those
                    more fleeting elements of speech which had hitherto been ignored by
                    etymologists.</p>
                <p>This leads us to a question which has been the subject of much controversy,—Who
                    discovered Grimm’s law? The law of the correspondence of consonants in the older
                    Indogermanic, Low, and High German languages respectively was first fully stated
                    by Grimm in the second edition of the first part of his grammar. The
                    correspondence of single consonants had been more or less clearly recognized by
                    several of his predecessors; but the one who came nearest to the discovery of
                    the complete law was the Swede Ihre, who established a considerable number of
                    “literarum permutationes,” such as <hi rend="italic">b</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">f,</hi> with the examples <hi rend="italic">b&lt;xra =</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ferre,</hi><hi rend="italic">befwer =fiber.</hi> Rask, in his
                    essay on the origin of the Icelandic language, gives the same comparisons, with
                    a few additions and corrections, and even the very same examples in most cases.
                    As Grimm in the preface to his first edition expressly mentions this essay of
                    Rask, there is every probability that it gave the first impulse to his own
                    investigations. But there is a wide difference between the isolated <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n212/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0212-0201"/> permutations of his predecessors and the
                    comprehensive generalizations under which he himself ranged them. The extension
                    of the law to High German is also entirely his own. The only fact that can be
                    adduced in support of the assertion that Grimm wished to deprive Rask of his
                    claims to priority is that he does not expressly mention Rask’s results in his
                    second edition. But thie is part of the plan of his work, made absolutely
                    necessary by its enormous extent, viz., to refrain from all controversy or
                    reference to the works of Others, leaving his readers to assign to each
                    investigator his due. In his first edition he expressly calls attention to
                    Rask’s essay, and praises it most ungrudgingly. Rask himself refers as little to
                    Ihre, merely alluding in a general way to Ihre’s permutations, although his own
                    debt to Ihre is infinitely greater than that of Grimm to Rask or any one else. .
                    It is true that a certain bitterness of feeling afterwards sprang up between
                    Grimm and Rask, but this was the fault of the latter, who, impatient of
                    contradiction and irritable in controversy, refused to acknowledge the value of
                    Grimm’s views when they involved modification of his own. The importance of
                    Grimm’s generalization in the hietory of philology cannot be overestimated, and
                    even the mystic completeness and symmetry of its formulation, although it has
                    proved a hindrance to the correct explanation of the causes of the changes, was
                    well calculated to strike the popular mind, and give it a vivid idea of the
                    paramount importance of law, and the necessity of disregarding mere superficial
                    resemblance. Even the lawless English etymologist bows down to the authority of
                    Grimm’s law, though it must be confessed he honours it almost as much in the
                    breach as in the observance.</p>
                <p>The grammar was continued in three volumes, treating principally of derivation,
                    composition, and syntax, which last was left unfinished. Grimm then began a
                    third edition, of which only one part, comprising the vowels, appeared in 1840,
                    his time being afterwards taken up mainly by the dictionary. Of the grammar as a
                    whole we can only say that it stands quite alone in the anuals of science for
                    comprehensiveness, method, and fulness of detail. Every law, every letter, every
                    syllable of inflexion in the different languages, is illustrated by an almost
                    exhaustive mass of material, drawn from every period and every dialect. It has
                    served as a model for all succeeding investigators. Diez’s grammar of the
                    Romance languages is founded entirely on its methods, which have also exerted a
                    profound influence on the wider study of the Indo-Germanic languages in
                    general.</p>
                <p>In the great German dictionary Grimm undertook a task for which he was hardly
                    suited. His exclusively historical tendencies made it impossible for him to do
                    justice to the individuality of a living language; and the disconnected
                    statement of the facts of language in an ordinary alphabetical dictionary
                    fatally mars its scientific character. It was also undertaken on so large a
                    scale as to make it impossible for him and his brother to complete it
                    themselves. We may describe the dictionary, as far as it was worked out by Grimm
                    himself, as a collection of disconnected antiquarian essays of, it need hardly
                    be remarked, high value.</p>
                <p>In summing up Grimm’s scientific character we are struck by its combination of
                    breadth arid unity. He was as far removed from the narrowness of the specialist
                    who has no ideas, no sympathies beyond some one author, period, or narrow corner
                    of science, as from the shallow dabbler who feverishly attempts to master the
                    details of half a dozen discordant pursuits, which have no central point of
                    interest round which to rally. Even within his own special studies there is the
                    same wise concentration; no Mezzofanti-like parrot display of useless
                    polyglottism. The very foundations of his nature were harmonious; his patriotism
                    and love of historical investigation received their fullest satisfaction in the
                    study of the language, traditions, mythology, laws, and literature of his own
                    countrymen and their nearest kindred. But from this centre his investigations
                    were pursued in every direction as far as his unerring instinct of healthy
                    limitation would allow. He was equally fortunate in the harmony that subsisted
                    between his intellectual and moral nature. He made cheerfully the heavy
                    sacrifices that science demands from its disciples, without· feeling any of that
                    envy and bitterness which often torment weaker natures; and although he lived
                    apart from his fellow men, he was full of human sympathies, and no man has ever
                    exercised a profounder influence on the destinies of mankind than he has—an
                    influence which is still only in its infancy. His was the very ideal of the
                    noblest type of German character.</p>
                <p>The following is a complete list of his separately published works, those which
                    he published in common with bis brother being marked with a star. For a list of
