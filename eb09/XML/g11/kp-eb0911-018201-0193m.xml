                    John Gregory of Drumoak, Aberdeenshire, was born in 1628. For some time he was
                    connected with a mercantile house in Holland, but on succeeding to the family
                    estate of Kinardie he returned to Scotland, and occupied most of his time in
                    scientific pursuits, freely giving his poorer neighbours the benefit of his
                    medical skill. He is said to have been the first possessor of a barometer in the
                    north of Scotland; and on account of his success by means of it in predicting
                    changes in the weather, he was accused of witchcraft before the presbytery of
                    Aberdeen, but he succeeded in convincing that body of his innocence. He diedin
                    1720.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">James Gregory</hi> (1638-1675), the author of important
                    discoveries in mathematics and optics, younger brother of the preceding, was
                    born in 1638. He was educated at the grammar school of Aberdeen and at Marischal
                    College of that city. At an early period he manifested a strong inclination and
                    capacity for mathematics and kindred sciences; and before completing his
                    twenty-third year he published his famous treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >Optica</hi><hi rend="italic">Promota,</hi> in which he made known his great
                    invention the Gregorian reflecting telescope. About 1665 he went to the
                    university of Padua, where he studied for some years, and in 1667 published <hi
                    rend="italic">Vera</hi><hi rend="italic">Circuli</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">Hyperbolae</hi><hi rend="italic">Quadratura,</hi> in
                    which he propounded his method of an infinitely converging series for the areas
                    of the circle and hyperbola. In the following year he published also at Padua
                    <hi rend="italic">Geometriae</hi><hi rend="italic">Pars Universalis,</hi> in
                    which he laid down a series of rules for the transmutation of curves and the
                    measurement of their solids of revolution. On his return to England in this year
                    he was elected a member of the Royal Society; in the following year he became
                    professor of mathematics in the university of St Andrews; and in 1674 he was
                    transferred to the chair of mathematics in Edinburgh. In October 1675, while
                    showing the satellites of the planet Jupiter to some of his students through one
                    of his telescopes, he was suddenly struck with blindness; and he died a few days
                    afterwards at the early age of thirty-seven.</p>
                <p>Besides the works already mentioned Gregory is the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exercitationes Geometricas,</hi> 1668, and, it is alleged, of a satirical tract
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">The Great and New Art of Weighing Vanity,</hi>
                    intended to ridicule certain fallacies of a contemporary writer on hydraulics,
                    and published at Glasgow in 1672, professedly by “Patrick Mathers, archbeadle of
                    the university of St Andrews.”</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">David Gregory</hi> (1661-1708), nephew of the preceding
                    and son of the David Gregory above mentioned, was born in Aberdeen in 1661. He
                    was educated partly in his native city and partly in Edinburgh, where at the age
                    of twenty-three he became professor of mathematics. In 1691 he was appointed
                    Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford, an office which he held till his
                    death in 1708. His principal works are <hi rend="italic">Exercitatio
                    Geometrica</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">dimensione
                    figurarum</hi> (1684), <hi rend="italic">Catoptricoe et Dioptricae
                    Sphoericae</hi><hi rend="italic">Elementa</hi> (1695), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Astronomiae</hi><hi rend="italic">Physicoe</hi><hi rend="italic">et Geometricae
                    Elementa</hi> (1702),—the last a work highly esteemed by Newton, of whose system
                    it is an illustration and a defence. A <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Practical
                    Geometry</hi> which he left in manuscript was translated from the Latin and
                    published in 1745. He was succeeded in the chair of mathematics in Edinburgh by
                    his brother James; another brother, Charles, was in 1707 appointed professor of
                    mathematics in the university of St Andrews; and his eldest son, David, became
                    professor of modern history at Oxford, and canon and latterly dean of Christ
                    Church.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">John Gregory</hi> (1724-1773), professor of medicine in
                    the university of Edinburgh, grandson of James Gregory, the inventor of the
                    Gregorian telescope, and youngest son of Dr James Gregory, professor of medicine
                    in King’s College^ Aberdeen, was born at Aberdeen, June 3, 1724. After studying
                    at the grammar school of Aberdeen, and completing his literary course at King’s
                    College in that city, he attended the medical classes at Edinburgh university.
                    In 1745 he went to Leyden to complete his medical studies, and during his stay
                    there he received without solicitation the degree of doctor of medicine from
                    King’s College, Aberdeen. On his return from Holland he was elected professor of
                    philosophy at King’s College, but in 1749 he resigned his professorship on
                    account of its duties interfering too much with his practice as a physician. In
                    1754 he proceeded to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n194/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0194-0183"/> London, where he made the acquaintance of many
                    persons of distinction, and the same year was chosen fellow of the Royal
                    Society. On the death in November 1755 of his brother Dr James Gregory, who had
                    succeeded his father as professor of medicine in King’s College, Aberdeen, he
                    was appointed to that office. In 1764 he removed to Edinburgh in the hope of
                    obtaining a more extended field of practice as a physician, and in 1766 he was
                    appointed professor of the practice of physic in the university of Edinburgh, to
                    whose eminence as a medical school he largely contributed. From his eighteenth
                    year Dr Gregory had been subject at irregular intervals to attacks of gout, and
                    on the morning of February 10th, 1773, he was found dead in bed apparently from
                    the results of this disease.</p>
                <p>He is the author of <hi rend="italic">A Comparative View of the State and
                    Faculties of Man with those of the Animal World,</hi> 1765; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations on the Duties, Offices, and Qualifications of a Physician,</hi>
                    1772; <hi rend="italic">Elements of the Practice of Physic,</hi> 1772; and <hi
                    rend="italic">A Father s Legacy to his Daughters,</hi> 1774. His <hi

                    Woodhouselee), were published at Edinburgh in 1788.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="smallcaps">James Gregory</hi> (1753-1821), professor of the practice
                    of medicine in the university of Edinburgh, eldest son of the preceding, was
                    born at Aberdeen in 1753, and received there the rudiments of his education. He
                    accompanied his father to Edinburgh in 1764, and after going through the usual
                    course of literary studies at that university, he was for a short time a student
                    at Christ Church, Oxford. It was there probably that he acquired that taste for
                    classical learning which afterwards distinguished him. He then entered on the
                    study of medicine at Edinburgh, and, after graduating doctor of medicine in
                    1774, spent the greater part of the next two years in Holland, France, and
                    Italy. Shortly after his return to Scotland he was appointed in 1776 to the
                    chair his father had formerly held, and in the following year he also entered on
                    the duties of teacher of clinical medicine in the Royal Infirmary. On the
                    illness of Dr Cullen in 1790 he was appointed joint-professor of the practice of
                    medicine; he became sole professor on the death of Dr Cullen in the same year;
                    and he continued to deliver lectures on that subject, to audiences almost
                    regularly increasing, until his last illness in 1821. He died on the 2d April of
                    that year. As a medical practitioner Dr Gregory was for the last ten years of
                    his life decidedly at the head of the profession in Scotland; and as a professor
                    his quickness and commanding energy of intellect, his power of perspicuous and
                    elegant exposition, and his genuine sense of humour gave him a remarkable
                    ascendency over the minds of his pupils.</p>
                <p>Besides his <hi rend="italic">Conspectus</hi><hi rend="italic">Mcdicinae
                    Thcoreticae,</hi> published in 1788 as a text-book for his lectures on the
                    institutes, Dr Gregory was the author of “A Theory of the Moods of Verbs,”
                    published in the ∙E ’ &lt;‰. <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1787, and of
                    <hi rend="italic">Literary and Philosophical Essays,</hi> published in two
                    volumes in 1792.</p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="smallcaps">William Gregory</hi> (1803-1858), son of the preceding,
                    was born 25th December 1803. In 1837 he became professor of chemistry at the
                    Andersonian Institution, Glasgow, in 1839 at King’s College, Aberdeen, and in
                    1844 at Edinburgh University. He died April 24, 1858. Gregory was one of the
                    first in England to advocate the theories of Liebig, and translated several of
                    his works. He is also the author of <hi rend="italic">Outlines of
                    Chemistry,</hi> 1845, and an <hi rend="italic">Elementary Treatise on
                    Chemistry</hi> reprinted from the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia
                    Britannica,</hi> 1855.</p>
                <p>VII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Duncan Farquharson Gregory</hi> (1813-1844), brother of
                    the preceding, was born 13th April 1813. After studying at the university of
                    Edinburgh he in 1833 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was for a time
                    assistant professor of chemistry, and was one of the founders of the chemical
                    society. He latterly devoted his chief attention to mathematics, in which he
                    made some important discoveries. He died 23d February 1844.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Mathematical Journal</hi> was originated, and for
                    some time edited, by Gregory; and he also published a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Collection of Examples of Processes in the Differential and Integral
