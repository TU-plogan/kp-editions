                    (1803-1840), an Irish novelist and dramatic writer, was descended from a family
                    of good position, and was born at Limerick 12th December 1803. He was the
                    youngest of nine sons. After attending for some time the school of an eccentric
                    preceptor in Limerick, he, on the removal of the family in 1810 to Fairy Lawn, a
                    country place on the banks of the Shannon, was placed under the instruction of a
                    private tutor, but in 1814 he returned to Limerick to attend a classical school.
                    In his youth his devotion seems to have been pretty equally divided between
                    books and out-door recreations with the rod and gun. His parents and a portion
                    of the family emigrated in 1820 to America, but he and some others were left
                    with an elder brother who was settled as a medical practitioner at Adar⅛ near
                    Limerick, and under his direction Gerald made some progress in medical studies
                    with the view of adopting that profession. It would appear, however, that very
                    soon his intentions underwent a change, for, besides devoting a large part of
                    his time to literary composition, he as early as his eighteenth year undertook
                    for a short time the editorship of a newspaper in Limerick. Having completed a
                    tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Aguire,</hi> which was highly lauded by his friends,
                    he finally in 1823 set out for London with the purpose of “revolutionizing the
                    dramatic taste of the time by writing for the stage.” Notwithstanding, however,
                    the efforts and recommendations of the novelist Banim, who showed him great
                    kindness, he found no manager willing to accept any of his plays; and for a
                    considerable period he had such a hard and wearisome struggle with poverty and
                    disappointment as permanently to injure his health. For some time he barely
                    supported himself by reporting trials for the newspapers and by various kinds of
                    hack work; but his prospects began to brighten a little when he obtained
                    occupation as a parliamentary reporter, and gradually the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Literary Gazette,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Hews of Literature,</hi> and other
                    periodicals of standing began to look upon his contributions with favour. Some
                    of his dramatic pieces were accepted also by one of the theatres: and the
                    publication in 1827 of a series of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n207/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0207-0196"/> tales under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Holland Tide</hi> was so successful that he at once set about the preparation
                    of a similar series, which appeared the same year in two volumes under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Tales of the Munster Festivals,</hi> and were still more
                    popular. In 1828 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Collegians,</hi> afterwards so
                    successfully adapted for the stage under the title of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >CοUeen Bawn.</hi> It is said to have been the favourite novel of O’Connell;
                    and, besides exhibiting that masterly delineation of both the pathetic and the
                    humorous features of Irish character already shown in his other works, it was
                    written with a verve and a dramatic intensity and realism far surpassing all his
                    previous or subsequent efforts. His principal other works are <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Invasion, The Rivals, Tracey’s Ambition,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Tales of Five Senses.</hi> He is also the author of a number of lyrics which are
                    generally pervaded by a tender and sad cast of sentiment. When Griffin appeared
                    to have achieved the literary success for which he had had such a hard struggle,
                    he began to feel a growing distaste for his profession. He became doubtful as to
                    the moral influence of his writings, and as to whether on that account he had
                    not been “misspending his time;” and ultimately he came to the conclusion that
                    his true sphere of duty was to be found within the walls of a monastery,—a
                    resolve doubtless partly attributable to the state of his health. He was
                    admitted into a Dublin monastery in September 1838 under the name of Brother
                    Joseph, and in the following summer he removed to Cork, where he died of typhus
                    fever 12th June 1840. Previous to adopting the monastic habit he burned all his
                    manuscripts; but <hi rend="italic">Gisippus,</hi> a tragedy which he had
                    composed in his twenty-fifth year, accidentally escaped destruction, and in 1842
                    was put on the Drury Lane stage by Mr Macready, and acted with great success.
                    The collected works of Gerald Griffin were published in 1843 in eight volumes,
                    with a memoir by his brother. See also <hi rend="italic">Dublin University
                    Magazine</hi> for February 1844.</p>
