                    for antiquarian research received additional impulse, and where he commenced his
                    work on British topography, which was published in 1768. After leaving Cambridge
                    in 1756, he began a series of antiquarian excursions in various parts of Great
                    Britain, the fruit of which was seen in the volumes which he subsequently
                    published. In 1773 he began to prepare an edition in English of Camden’s <hi

                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n12/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0012-0003"/> the work did not appear till 1789. Meantime he
                    published, in 1786, the first volume of his splendid work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sepulchral Monuments of Great Britain, applied to illustrate the history of
                    families, manners, habits, and arts at the different periods from the Norman
                    Conquest to the Seventeenth Century.</hi> This volume, which contained the first
                    four centuries, was followed in 1796 by a second volume containing the 15th
                    century, and an introduction to the second volume appeared in 1799. Gough was
                    chosen a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1767, and from 1771
                    to 1791 he was its director. He was elected F.R.S. in 1775. He died at his
                    residence at Enfield, 20th February 1809. His books and manuscripts relating to
                    Anglo-Saxon and northern literature, all his collections in the department of
                    British topography, and a large number of his drawings and engravings of other
                    archaeological remains, were bequeathed to the university of Oxford.</p>
