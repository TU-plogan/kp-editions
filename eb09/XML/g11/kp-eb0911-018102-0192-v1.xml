                    Christian families in the country; at his baptism he received the name of
                    George, that of Gregory not having been assumed until his consecration at least
                    thirty years afterwards. He received his education under the superintendence of
                    his uncle Gallus, at that time bishop of Clermont, and afterwards under Avitus,
                    who succeeded to that see. Having been ordained a deacon on attaining the
                    canonical age, the youthful Georgius Florentius for a time attended in some
                    ecclesiastical capacity the court of Sigebert of Austrasia; and when in 573 a
                    vacancy occurred in the see of Tours, which had been occupied by many of his
                    kindred, his reputation for piety and wisdom led to his being immediately
                    designated as a suitable successor to that bishopric. Circumstances soon
                    occurred which brought into great prominence his peculiar fitness for this post;
                    first in 575, when Guntran had taken refuge from Chilperic in the sanctuary of
                    St Martin, and afterwards in 577, when Pretextatus of Rouen had been unjustly
                    condemned by the rest of his brethren. The firmness and courage which he showed
                    on these and other occasions brought upon him the bitter hostility of the
                    strong-minded Queen Fredegond, who caused him to be summoned before a council at
                    Braine on a charge of treason, of which, however, he was acquitted. In 581 he
                    took a leading part in adjusting that arrangement between Chilperic and
                    Childebert which gave peace to France for many years. During the later years of
                    his life he used his political influence and prestige, which were now immense,
                    with singular unselfishness and judgment in the interest alike of his diocese
                    and of the whole country. He died at Tours on the 17th of November 591, and
                    subsequently attained the honours of beatification and canonization, his day in
                    the calendar (semiduplex) being November 17th.</p>
                <p>Of his writings, besides the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Francorum</hi> in ten books, we possess a treatise <hi rend="italic"
                        >Be</hi><hi rend="italic">Miraculis</hi> in seven books, containing the
                    miracles of Christ and his apostles, those of Julian, of Martin, and also of
                    others. Other treatises which he mentions have perished. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Miraculis</hi> appears to have occupied him at
                    intervals durin» the whole of his prelacy; of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Francorum</hi> he is supposed to have
                    written as far as to about the middle of the fifth book by 577; the eighth book
                    was completed before 585, and the tenth about 591, the epilogue being of still
                    later date. This work, which gives Gregory of Tours a just title to be called
                    the father of French history, has no pretensions to elegance or even grammatical
                    accuracy of style, it is wholly uncritical, and betrays in every page the
                    prejudice and ignorance of the age to which it belongs. But it is honestly and
                    truthfully written from the point of view of one whose avowed intention was to
                    trace ‘ ‘ the wars of kings with hostile nations, of martyrs with pagans, of
                    churches with heretics;” and as an original source for the period of 174 years
                    which it covers it is still, notwithstanding the unfavourable judgment which
                    Gibbon has expressed, invaluable.</p>
                <p>The edition of the works of Gregory of Tours, which appeared at Paris in 1511-12,
                    has been entirely superseded by that of Ruinart (Paris, 1699). It includes the
                    not very valuable life of the saint by Odo. The 71st volume of Migne’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Patrology</hi> adds to a reprint of Ruinart an <hi
                        rend="italic">Historia Septem Dormientium</hi> which is sometimes (but
                    improperly) attributed to Gregory. Translations by Bonnet, Guizot, and others
                    into French have been frequently reprinted; a German version appeared at
                    Würzburg in 1847-49; it was followed by Giesebrecht’s in 1851. See Kries, <hi
