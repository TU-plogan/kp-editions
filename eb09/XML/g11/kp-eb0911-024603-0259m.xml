                    (1774-1833), French painter, was born at Paris, May 13,1774. The artistic ideal
                    of the first empire found complete expression in his work, the most famous
                    examples of which show a peculiar combination of the dry pseudo-classic style,
                    then popular, with stage pathos of a highly exaggerated character; yet from his
                    atelier went forth, as if in necessary protest against the defects of their
                    master, the leaders of the Romantic and Realistic movements,—Delacroix and
                    Géricault. The first teacher of Guérin was Nicolas Brenet, whom he left to place
                    himself under Jean Baptiste Régnault, the representative, as contrasted with
                    David, of a distinct form of the classic reaction modified by a tincture of
                    Italian tradition. Guérin became the most distinguished of his pupils, and
                    carried off one of the three “grands prix” offered in 1796, in consequence of
                    the competition not having taken place since 1793. The <hi rend="italic"

                    him prominently before the public. This work, Marcus Sextus (Louvre), exhibited
                    at tho Salon of 1799, excited wild enthusiasm, partly due to the subject—a
                    victim of Sulla’s proscription returning to Rome to find his wife dead and his
                    house in mourning—in which an allusion was found to the actual situation of the
                    <hi rend="italic">émigrés.</hi> Guérin on this occasion was publicly crowned by
                    the president of the Institute, and before his departure for Rome (on the
                    re-establishment of the École under Suvée) a banquet was given to him by the
                    most distinguished artists of Paris. In 1800, unable to remain in Rome on
                    account of his health, he went to Naples, where he painted the Grave of Amyntas.
                    In 1802 Guérin produced Phaedra and Hippolytus (Louvre); in 1810, after his
                    return to Paris, he again achieved a great success with Andromache and Pyrrhus
                    (Louvre); and in the same year also exhibited Cephalus and Aurora (Collection
                    Sommariva) and Bonaparte and the Rebels of Cairo (Versailles). The Restoration
                    brought to Guérin fresh honours; he had received from the first consul in 1803
                    the cross of the legion of honour, and in 1815 Louis XVIII. named him
                    Academician. The success of Guérin’s Hippolytus, of Andromache, of Phaedra, and
                    of Clytaemnestra (Louvre) had been ensured by the skilful selection of highly
                    melodramatic situations, treated with the strained and pompous dignity proper to
                    the art of the first empire; in Aeneas relating to Dido the disasters of Troy
                    (Louvre), which appeared side by side with Clytaemnestra at the Salon of 1817,
                    the influence of the Restoration is plainly to be traced. In this work Guérin
                    sought to captivate the public by an appeal to those sensuous charms which he
                    had previously rejected, and by the introduction of picturesque elements of
                    interest which, even now, distract attention from the artificial mannerism too
                    painfully apparent in his treatment of tragic subject. But with this work
                    Guérin’s public successes came to a close. He was, indeed, commissioned to paint
                    for the Madeleine a scene from the history of St Louis, but his health prevented
                    him from accomplishing what he had begun, and in 1822 he accepted the post of
                    director of the École de Rome, which in 1816 he had refused. On returning to
                    Paris in 1828, Guérin, who had previously been made chevalier of the order of St
                    Michel, was ennobled. He now attempted to complete Pyrrhus and Priam, a work
                    which he had begun at Rome, but in vain; his health had finally broken down, and
                    in the hope of improvement he returned to Italy with Horace Vernet. Shortly
                    after his arrival at Rome Baron Guérin died, on July 6,1833, and was buried in
                    the church of La Trinità de’ Monti by the side of Claude Lorraine. A careful
                    analysis and criticism of his principal works will be found in Meyer’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Geschichte der Französischen Malerei,</hi> but his life has not
                    yet been made the subject of special treatment.</p>
