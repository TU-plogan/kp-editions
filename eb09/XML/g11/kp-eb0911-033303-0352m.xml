                    and the first king of Sweden who played a great rôle in European history, was
                    the grandson of Gustavus Vasa, and the son of Charles IX. He was born at
                    Stockholm in 1594, and received an excellent education. As we learn from his
                    friend and chancellor Oxenstierna, he gained in his youth “a complete and ready
                    knowledge of many foreign languages, so that he spoke Latin, German, Dutch,
                    French, and Italian as purely as a native, and besides had some foretaste of the
                    Russian and Polish tongue.” Even during his busier years, after ascending the
                    throne, it is said that he was fond of reading the great work of Grotius, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Jure Belli</hi><hi rend="italic">et Pacis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> also that he knew Greek, preferring Xenophon as a military historian to
                    any other. He was introduced to the business of government at an early age; when
                    he was only ten, his father required his presence at meetings of council and at
                    the audiences given to foreign ambassadors. This early experience was needed;
                    for, his father dying in 1611, he ascended the throne of Sweden in his
                    eighteenth year. His position was a difficult one; after fifty years of civil
                    strife, Sweden had lost the strong and compact organization which it had
                    received from Gustavus Vasa; the finances were exhausted, the nobles were
                    discontented, and the spirit of the people had declined. Abroad, Sweden was
                    surrounded with enemies, Denmark, Russia, and Poland being in a state of chronic
                    hostility with it.</p>
                <p>To the difficult task before him the young king applied himself with equal skill
                    and resolution. He attached the nobles to himself by his respect for their
                    privileges and his genial manner, showed them a more honourable field of
                    activity in a patriotic war, and even induced them to bear their due share of
                    its financial burdens. The administration was reformed in all its branches,
                    industry encouraged, and education greatly improved. In this way the national
                    spirit was wonderfully raised; and Sweden was gradually prepared to play for the
                    first time a great part in Europe,—a part which seemed so disproportionate to
                    her natural resources. At his accession Gustavus was engaged in a difficult war
                    with Denmark, which, besides its supremacy over Norway, occupied what is now
                    southern Sweden. The peace of 1613 left their respective frontiers very much as
                    they had been before the war. The war with Russia ended much more advantageously
                    for Gustavus in the peace of Stolbova (1617), by which Sweden was confirmed in
                    the possession <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n353/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0353-0334"/> of the Baltic provinces stretching from Finland
                    to Livonia. Gustavus clearly foresaw the advantage to Russia and the danger to
                    Sweden if the former power were allowed to plant itself on the Baltic coast; and
                    he now congratulated his country on a peace which assured her against such a
                    risk. In 1620 Gustavus married a sister of the elector of Brandenburg, with whom
                    he lived happily till his death. After being for many years engaged in an
                    intermittent war with Poland, Sweden (1621) entered upon a more active conflict
                    with that power. With some interruptions the struggle lasted till 1629, and
                    proved an excellent training for Gustavus. Sigismund, king of Poland, wιs his
                    cousin, and had at one time been king of Sweden, but had been forced to resign
                    owing to his Catholic opinions. He still laid claim to the crown of Sweden. In
                    this war Gustavus took Riga, and made many other conquests in Livonia as well as
                    in Courland and Prussia, part of which he retained, by the peace of Altmark,
                    concluded under the mediation of Richelieu.</p>
                <p>That great statesman wished to get Gustavus’s hands free for a more important
                    conflict, in which the king himself had long been eager to engage. While
                    Gustavus had been involved in his Baltic war, the Catholic house .of Austria had
                    been swiftly raising itself on the ruins of German Protestantism to a position
                    of absolute supremacy. In this early period of the Thirty Years’ War which dates
                    from 1618, the armies of Protestantism hadbeen everywhere overthrown by Tilly
                    and Wallenstein. The latter, raising a host at his own cost and bearing
                    desolation wherever he went, garrisoned Brandenburg and Pomerania, occupied
                    Mecklenburg, and overran the continental dominions of Denmark. The only town
                    that successfully resisted the imperial general was Stralsund; the king of
                    Denmark was obliged to make peace. Such a colossus, with its gigantic force of
                    oppression and devastation and its invincible armies, Gustavus now ventured to
                    attack. It seemed a foolhardy undertaking which excited the laughter of his
                    enemies, when in midsummer 1630 he landed on the coast of Pomerania with his
                    little army of 15,000 men. Yet there were many things in his favour,—the despair
                    of the Protestant princes, who saw a great part of their lands threatened by the
                    Edict of Restitution; the disunion of the Catholics, who forced the emperor to
                    dismiss Wallenstein shortly after the landing of Gustavus; the help of
                    Richelieu, who now inaugurated the French policy of weakening Germany by
                    dividing it. This help was formally assured him by the treaty of Bärwalde
                    (January 1631). Yet the German princes showed no haste to join Gustavus; the
                    dukeBoguslav reluctantly consented to receive the Swedish army into his
                    capital—Stettin. But the marvellous discipline of the Swedes, so different from
                    the wild barbarism of the imperial army, soon gained the confidence of the
                    German people; robbery and licence were unknown; morning and evening the
                    soldiers assembled for. prayer round their regimental chaplains; such an army
                    had never been seen in Europe. It was not less distinguished for its hardy
                    bravery in war; keeping the field in winter as well as summer, it soon drove the
                    imperialists out of Pomerania and the lower basin of the Oder, and stormed
                    Frankfort-on-the-Oder. In the midst of those successes, Gustavus was greatly
                    moved by the sack of Magdeburg (May 1631). Fearful of being cut off from his
                    basis of operations, he could not advance to the relief of the city without the
                    cooperation or consent of the electors of Brandenburg and Saxony. During the
                    delay thus caused, Magdeburg was taken by Tilly, and became a scene of the most
                    fearful atrocities. Too late Gustavus forced the elector of Brandenburg to hand
                    over to him the fortresses required; a desolating invasion of Saxony by Tilly
                    compelled even the Saxon elector to seek the aid of Sweden. The union of the
                    Swedish and Saxon forces was followed by the battle of Breitenfeld (near
                    Leipsic), in which Tilly was completely overthrown, and the supremacy of
                    Catholic Austria shattered at a single blow (September 1631). While the Saxons
                    overran Bohemia, Gustavus, now hailed as the liberator of Protestantism, marched
                    westwards towards the Rhine, gathering round him the friendly Germans, and
                    driving out the imperial garrisons. Würtzburg and Frankfort were occupied; at
                    Oppenheim he forced the passage of the Rhine against the Spaniards; he spent
                    Christmas in the ecclesiastical city of Mainz. Early next spring he advanced
                    into Bavaria, forcing the passage cf the Lech in the face of Tilly (who was
                    mortally wounded). Munich had to pay a war contribution to the Swede.</p>
                <p>In this overwhelming reverse of fortune, the emperor Ferdinand was obliged to
                    invoke the aid of Wallenstein, who soon changed the course of the war. He
                    gathered a mighty host, cleared the Saxons out of Bohemia, and marching
                    westwards threatened the wealthy city of Nuremberg. Afraid of a repetition of
                    the horrors of Magdeburg, Gustavus hastened northwards and threw himself into
                    the city with a small force. In the neighbourhood Wallenstein threw up a
                    fortified camp resolving to starve his rival out; and here the great captains
                    watched each other for several weeks. After drawing his scattered forces
                    together, Gustavus offered battle to the enemy, and when that was declined
                    assaulted his intrenched position, but without effect. Leaving a sufficient
                    garrison to defend the exhausted city, he advanced a second time into Bavaria,
                    where he hoped to draw Wallenstein after him, and thus transfer the seat of war
                    to the enemy’s country. But Wallenstein made a desolating march through
                    Thuringia into Saxony, which he resolved to make his winter quarters; and again
                    Gustavus was obliged to leave his Bavarian conquests to save his ally from such
                    a cruel guest. On a misty November day (1632) he attacked the army of
                    Wallenstein at Lützen (near Leipsic). The numbers engaged were not great:
                    according to Ranke, the Swedes were 14,000, the imperialists only 12,000 at the
                    beginning of the conflict; but the battle was one of the fiercest recorded in
                    history. The Swedes had carried the strong positions of the enemy and turned his
                    own cannon against him, when the cavalry of Pappenheim, which had left the main
                    army shortly before the battle, appeared on the field. The Swedes were hurled
                    back; and the king, too eagerly hurrying forward to re-form the battle; was
                    separated from his guards and shot. Wild with rage and sorrow the Swedes renewed
                    the attack, overthrew the enemy, and won his artillery again. Without making any
                    effort to recover it, Wallenstein retreated into Bohemia, while the Swedes
                    carried the disfigured body of their king from the battlefield. It was laid to
                    rest in the Riddarholm church at Stockholm.</p>
                <p>Gustavus Adolphus is justly regarded as one of the noblest and greatest figures
                    in history. Even in the art of war he made an epoch. To the huge and unwieldy
                    masses of Tilly he opposed a light and flexible formation of three deep, which
                    he manoeuvred with unwonted rapidity. The activity of his movements was equalled
                    by the dexterity with which his artillery and muskets were handled; at Leipsic
                    his guns fired three shots for the enemy’s one. The political plans which
                    Gustavus entertained have been the subject of some discussion. That he aimed at
                    founding a Swedish empire of the Baltic, and succeeded in doing so, is certain;
                    he meant also to unite under his protection the <hi rend="italic">corpus
                    evangelicum</hi> of Germany. Probably too he aspired to become a candidate for
                    the empire; and if so, he had only one disqualification, that he was a
                    foreigner. Even with this drawback it would have been the best course available
                    for Germany; to have enjoyed for a generation the rule of such a man would have
                    been an unspeakable blessing, at any rate infinitely better <pb break="no"

                    desolation and disunion which actually took place. In any case his premature
                    death at the age of thirty-eight was an irreparable loss for German
                    Protestantism. The Thirty Years’ War, which for two years had been rendered
                    heroic by his presence, degenerated again into a scene of the wildest barbarism,
                    by which Germany was reduced to a wilderness, and flung back at least a century
                    in the march of civilization.</p>
