                    nitroglycerin, and was frequently accessory to gunpowder for many years after
                    its invention. But combustible mineral substances were employed in war much
                    earlier than the Middle Ages. Greek fire has borne the names wildfire, maritime
                    fire, wet fire, fire-rain; called by the French <hi rend="italic">feu</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">grégeois,</hi> by the Germans <hi rend="italic"
                    >griechisches</hi><hi rend="italic">Feuer,</hi> it was “the oil of cruel fire”
                    of the Chinese, the <hi rend="italic">oleum incendiarum</hi> of the Romans, and
                    the 7∏)p υγρόν, liquid fire, of the Greeks. Procopius designates it “Medea’s
                    oil.” Cinnamus (12th century) describes it as <hi rend="italic">πvρ</hi>
                    Μηδικόν, Median fire, the black clays of Media and Persia supplying the
                    principal constituent. Used chiefly at sieges and in naval engagements, it was
                    poured from cauldrons and ladles on the besiegers and their engines, or vomited
                    through long copper tubes from the mouths of hideous figures set in the prows of
                    ships. Sometimes flax was twisted and saturated with the liquid, then fired, and
                    projected on arrows, lances, and javelins. At sea it was often flung in pots and
                    phials. The heavy ballista and other military engines were pressed into the
                    service in early times for scattering this destructive compound in large
                    quantities, often in barrels. Owing to the viscid nature of Greek fire it
                    adhered to whatever it touched. It is described as producing a thick smoke, a
                    loud explosion, and a fierce flame, and as being quickened by the element of
                    water. Sea-water is specially mentioned as intensifying its inflammability; and
                    whenever it fell among ignitible materials terrible havoc was occasioned. The
                    sight and sound of the engine discharging the torrent of fire carried dismay
                    into many a warrior’s breast. The devastating consequences pictured by early
                    writers are probably overdrawn, but there can be no doubt that they were
                    formidable. Liquid fire has been used in warfare from very remote times, as may
                    be seen in the Assyrian bas-reliefs in the British Museum. Greek fire, properly
                    so called, is said to have been employed for the first time against the Saracens
                    in the siege of Constantinople, 673-679, the inventor being a Syrian named
                    Callinicus. The art of compounding Greek fire was concealed at Constantinople
                    with the most jealous care; indeed it was to Greek fire, while the secret of its
                    manufacture was kept, t∙hat the city owed in great measure its safety. In 1755
                    two Frenchmen, Gaubert and Dupré, are reported to have rediscovered the art so
                    carefully concealed by the Byzantine Greeks; but they were prohibited from
                    making it known. Various projects for the use of this or <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0171-0160"/> similar preparations have been advocated in
                    recent times. The ingredients and relative proportions of the composition are
                    not exactly known, the secret having been very successfully preserved. The
                    Syrian historian Michael applies the name naphtha to the “newly invented” Greek
                    fire; and this probably was the destructive agent of the Assyrians, Persians,
                    and other Eastern nations, springs of naphtha abounding in their territories.
                    According to the author of <hi rend="italic">H Esprit des Croissades,</hi> Greek
                    fire was compounded of the gum of the pine and other resinous trees reduced to
                    powder, with the addition of brimstone, naphtha, and other bitumens. Fanciful
                    substances were included, such as the water of a particular fountain in the
                    East, duck’s grease, &amp;c. Friar Bacon mentions two of the ingredients,
                    saltpetre and sulphur, but conceals the rest. Giambattista Porta states that
                    Greek fire is made by boiling together willow charcoal, salt, ardent aqua vitae,
                    sulphur, pitch, frankincense, threads of soft Ethiopian wool, and camphor. In a
                    Spanish MS. of the 13th century in the Bodleian library a different receipt is
                    given; and others will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">groecum,</hi> &amp;c. From all that has been said it appears that
                    naphtha—otherwise petroleum, rock oil, or Rangoon tar—and sulphur, and sometimes
                    nitre, were the principal constituents; and the use of these, or two of them, in
                    varying quantities, with the charcoal mentioned by Porta, no doubt gave birth to
                    gunpowder. An invention by Niepce comprised benzol and potassium, in the
                    proportion of 600 to 1, placed in a glass vessel; and Disney’s is believed to
                    have included a solation of phosphorus in sulphide of carbon or chloride of
                    sulphur. But of all the spontaneously combustible liquids, Bunsen’s kakodyl, <hi

                    of the old Greek fire as a destroyer of life. A combustible used at the siege of
                    Charleston, U.S., in 1863 consisted of (1) saltpetre, sulphur, and lampblack,
                    pressed into small tubes, and (2) coal tar naphtha, placed in shells or pumped
                    through hose. The be3t military authorities appear now to agree that Greek fire
                    is unsuitable for purposes of war, and comparatively little use has been made of
                    it in recent times.</p>
