                    distinguished sculptor produced by France during the 16th century. Although some
                    evidence has been offered in favour of the date 1520 <hi rend="italic">(Archives
                    de</hi><hi rend="italic">l’Art français,</hi> vol. iii. p. 350), the time and
                    place of his birth are still uncertain. The first mention of his name occurs in
                    the accounts of the church of St Maclou at Rouen in the year 1540, and in the
                    following year he was employed at the cathedral of the same town, where he added
                    to the tomb of Cardinal d’Amboise a statue of his nephew Georges, afterwards
                    removed. The tomb of Louis de Brezé, executed some time after 1545, has also
                    been attributed to Goujon, but there is no evidence in point, nor even any
                    tradition, of the fact. On leaving Rouen, Goujon was employed by Pierre Lescot,
                    the celebrated architect of the Louvre, on the restorations of St Germain
                    l’Auxerrois; the building accounts—some of which for the years 1542- 44 were
                    discovered by M. de Laborde on a piece of parchment binding—specify as his work,
                    not only the carvings of the pulpit (Louvre), but also a Notre Dame de Piété,
                    now lost. In 1547 appeared Martin’s French translation of Vitruvius, the
                    illustrations of which were due, the translator tells us in his “Dedication to
                    the King” to Goujon, “naguères architecte de Monseigneur le Connétable, et
                    maintenant un des vôtres.” We learn from this statement, not only that Goujon
                    had been taken into the royal service on the accession of Henry II., but also
                    that he had been previously employed under Bullant on the chateau of Éeouen. At
                    the Louvre, Goujon, under the direction of Lescot, executed the carvings of the
                    south-west angle of the court, the reliefs of the Escalier Henri II., and the
                    Tribune des Cariatides. About a year before the execution of the Caryatides, for
                    which Goujon received 737 livres on September 5, 1550, he produced, according to
                    unbroken tradition, the reliefs of the Fontaine des Innocents (Louvre, and <hi
                    rend="italic">in situ);</hi> after which he is supposed to have been occupied in
                    work destined for the decoration of the chateau of Anet, then building for Diana
                    of Poitiers. Unfortunately the building accounts of Anet have disappeared, but
                    tradition not only ascribes to Goujon the <hi rend="italic">chef d’oeuvre</hi>
                    of French sculpture, the Diane Chasseresse now in the Louvre, but asserts that
                    he also executed a vast number of other works of equal importance, destroyed or
                    lost since 1792. In 1555 his name appears again in the Louvre accounts, and
                    continues to do so every succeeding year up to 1561, when all trace of him is
                    lost. In the course of this year an attempt was made to turn out of the royal
                    employment all those who were suspected of Huguenot tendencies. Goujon has
                    always been claimed as a Reformer; it is consequently possible that he was one
                    of the victims of this attack. We should therefore probably ascribe the work
                    attributed to him in the Hôtel Carnavalet <hi rend="italic">(in situ),</hi>
                    together with much else executed in various parts of Paris—but now dispersed or
                    destroyed—to a period intervening between the date of his dismissal from the
                    Louvre and his death (of which there is no evidence), which is said to have
                    taken place during the St Bartholomew massacre in 1572. Goujon’s work is
                    remarkable—as may be observed in the sculpture of the Louvre—for its perfect
                    harmony with the architectural lines which it was intended to enrich or
                    accompany, and is distinguished in a supreme degree by that elegance which was
                    the leading characteristic of the school of which he was the chief
                    representative. His treatment of the nude (Diane Chasseresse), both in style of
                    line and choice of forms, attains a degree of accomplished perfection which, in
                    its complete fulfilment of the proposed—though very different—ideal, comes
                    nearer to the character of tranquil achievement, which marks all classic art,
                    than any other work of modern times.</p>
