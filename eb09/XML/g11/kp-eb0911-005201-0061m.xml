                    afterwards became chancellor of the empire under Charles V., was at that time
                    engaged in practice as a junior at the provincial bar. On the completion of his
                    studies in law at Padua and in divinity at Louvain, he for a short time held a
                    canonry at Besançon, but his talents had already marked him for a higher sphere,
                    and he was promoted to the bishopric of Arras when barely twenty-three (1540).
                    In his episcopal capacity he attended several diets of the empire, as well as
                    the opening meetings of the council of Trent; and the influence of his father,
                    now become chancellor, led to his being entrusted with many difficult and
                    delicate pieces of public business, in the execution of which he developed a
                    rare native talent for diplomacy, and at the same time acquired an intimate
                    acquaintance with most of the currents of European politics. One of his
                    specially noteworthy performances was the settlement of the terms of peace after
                    the defeat of the Smalkaldic league at Mühlberg in 1547, a settlement in which,
                    to say the least, some particularly sharp practice was exhibited. In 1550 he
                    succeeded his father in the offices of secretary of state and chancellor of the
                    empire; in this capacity he attended Charles in the war with Maurice,
                    accompanied him in the flight from Innsbruck, and afterwards drew up the treaty
                    of Passau (August 1552). In the following year he conducted the negotiations for
                    the marriage of Mary of England and Philip of Spain, to whom in 1555, on the
                    abdication of the emperor, he transferred his services. In April 1559 Granvella
                    was one ofthe Spanish commissioners who arranged the peace of Cateau Cambresis,
                    and on Philip’s withdrawal from the Netherlands in August of the same year he
                    was appointed prime minister to the regent, Margaret of Parma. The policy of
                    repression which in this capacity he pursued during the next five years secured
                    for him many tangible rewards; in 1560 he was elevated to the archiépiscopal see
                    of Malines, and in 1561 he received the cardinal’s hat; but the growing
                    hostility of a people whose moral and religious convictions he had studiously
                    set himself to trample under foot, ultimately made it impossible for him to
                    continue in the Low Countries; and by the advice of his royal master he in 1564
                    retired to Franche Comté. Nominally this withdrawal was only of a temporary
                    character, but it proved to be final. The following six years were spent in
                    comparative quiet, which was devoted chiefly to study and to the society of
                    learned men; but in 1570 Granvella, at the call of Philip, resumed public life
                    by accepting a mission to Rome as representative of the interests of Spain in
                    framing the proposed treaty of alliance with Venice and the papal see against
                    the Turks. In the same year he was advanced to the viceroyalty of Naples, a post
                    of some difficulty and danger, which for five years he occupied with ability and
                    success. Summoned to Madrid in 1575, to be president of the supreme council of
                    Italy and afterwards of that of Castile, he still continued to find ample scope
                    for his rare aptitudes. Among the more delicate negotiations of his later years
                    were those of 1580, which had for their object the ultimate union of the crowns
                    of Spain and Portugal, and those of 1584, which resulted in a check to France by
                    the marriage of the Spanish infanta to Duke Philip of Savoy. In the same year he
                    was made archbishop of Besançon, but meanwhile a lingering disease had laid an
                    unrelenting grasp upon his iron frame; he never was enthroned, but died at
                    Madrid, 21st September 1586. His body was removed to Besançon, where his father
                    had been buried before him.</p>
