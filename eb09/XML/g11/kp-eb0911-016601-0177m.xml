                <p><label type="entry">GREENLAND, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Grönland</hi></label>, is
                    the name applied to a large continental island, the greater portion of which
                    lies within the Arctic Circle, and all of which is arctic in character (see voL
                    i., Plate X.). It is entirely unconnected with any portion of Europe or America,
                    though in the extreme north only separated from the latter by the narrow strait
                    which lies between it and the outlying portion of America known as Grinnell
                    Land. From Europe it is divided by the North and Greenland Seas,—the Faroe
                    Isles, Jan Mayen Island, Iceland, and part of Shetland being the only lands
                    between it and Norway. Denmark Strait is the sea between it and Iceland, and it
                    is more than probable that Spitzbergen is the only great group of islands lying
                    to the east of its northern portion. On the west, Davis Strait and Baffin’s Bay
                    separate it from the opposite shore. The latter sea narrows to the north into
                    the gulf generally known as Smith Sound, though, in reality, Kane Sea, Kennedy
                    Channel, Hall Basin, and Robeson Channel are the names which have been
                    successively applied in the progress of exploration to the northern
                    continuations of the sound so named more than two hundred years ago by William
                    Baffin. The exact northern termination of Greenland is not known, the country
                    never having been doubled on the north; but we know enough from the explorations
                    of Markham, Beaumont, and other officers of Nares’s expedition, to lead to the
                    conclusion that the ice-encumbered Polar Ocean circles around the headlands of
                    the broken country which forms its supposed limits in about 83° N. lat.</p>
                <p>From Cape Farewell, or Kangersuak,—an island lying about 18 miles from
                    Pamiagdluk, the most southern Danish post on the west,—to Cape Britannia, is
                    about 1380 milee; and the greatest breadth of Greenland is about 77° 30' N. lat.
                    —690 miles from the one coast to the other. The shore-line is fully 3400 miles
                    long; but so little is the country known with accuracy, and so broken is it by
                    fjords and coast-lying islands, that any accurate estimate of its area is
                    impossible. Thus Dr Rink, who has been connected with the government in various
                    capacities for upwards of thirty years, estimates its area at 512,000 square
                    miles. This estimate allows 192,000 square miles for what has been called the
                    outskirts—or islands uncovered by ice—with their fjords, and 320,000 for the
                    interior, believed to be almost entirely covered by a glacier ice-cap.</p>
                <p>On the east coast, Cape Bismarck, in 76° 47' N. lat., marks the limits of
                    exploration; though as early as 1670 Lambert is said to have sighted land
                    several degrees further north. From Cape Bismarck south to Cape Farewell (59°
                    35' N. lat.) the coast is very imperfectly known, whole stretches being entirely
                    uncharted, even .in the rudest fashion. This arises from the Spitzbergen
                    ice-stream continually pouring down that shore, rendering it possible to
                    approach within sight of it only on rare occasions, and to land still more
                    rarely. Yet, from the explorations of Hall and Lindenow in early times, and

                    general features. These are—high beetling cliffs, great glaciers creeping down
                    to the sea, and deep inlets, like Scoresby Sound and Franz Josef Fjord,
                    penetrating the land for distances which cannot as yet be definitely stated. A
                    number of islands also are dotted over the chart here; but there are few “ice
                    fjords,” the slope of the inland ice being evidently chiefly towards the west
                    coast. The west coast is of much the same character,— only, on this side, the
                    fjords with which it is intersected have been nearly all followed to their
                    heads. Many of them stretch several miles into the interior, and the greater
                    number are ended by glacier prolongations of the “inland ice,” which discharge
                    icebergs; these are known as “ice fjords.” The Greenland fjords, like those of
                    Norway, British Columbia, and other countries with a western ιx-posure, bear
                    every mark of having been at one time the beds of glaciers, when the climate and
                    physical geography of the country were different from what they are at present.
                    The country cannot be said to be mountainous, yet heights of from 3000 to 4000
                    feet are common, and the aspèct which the coast presents is that of high
                    cliffs,—black when steep, white where the snow can lie; snow for eight or nine
                    months in the year on even the lower lands; icebergs and broken floe-ice
                    floating off the coast; an “ice-foot” attached to the shore early in the spring;
                    and glaciers peeping down through the valleys between the cliffs and fjelds.
                    There are one or two still higher points, such as Petermann’s Peak—near the
                    shores of Franz Josef Fjord on the east coast (11,000 feet)', Payer’s Peak,
                    Sukkertoppen, and the familiar Sanderson’s Hope. With the exception of Disco,
                    there are no large islands; but the bays, fjords, straits, and peninsulas of
                    this extremely broken coast are so numerous that it is needless mentioning them
                    by name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Interior Ice-covering.—</hi> The Danes divide Greenland
                    into two physical divisions—the “outskirts” and the “inland ice.” The first
                    comprises the coast-lying land, the latter the interior. If we ascend any
                    considerable eminence on the west coast, and look eastward, we do not find
                    mountains and valleys as in most other countries, but only one huge, seemingly
                    endless, expanse of glacier ice gradually rising towards the east, until the
                    view is bounded by a white horizon. If we cross the coast-lying land, which
                    varies in breadth from a few miles to twenty, or in a few cases much more, we
                    come to this “inland ice, * generally in the form of a glacier offshoot of it
                    which has crept down into a fjord, or is making its way to the sea in one of the
                    mossy valleys lying between two high cliffs, noisy with mollemokes or with the
                    weird scream of cormorants, which at various sheltered places have colonies in
                    these “skarvefjelde.” In the former case the glacier usually presents a steep
                    wall facing the sea, from which great fragments of ice are continually breaking
                    off, or the icebergs being detached by the force of the sea; then it is “sermik
                    soak ”—the “great ice wall ”—of the Eskimo. In the latter case, it presents a
                    slope on which the explorer <pb break="no"

                    inland ice, of which it is a prolongation. A little way eastward, the covering
                    is found to be hard glacier ice, rising by a gentle slope,—covered in the winter
                    and spring with a thick coating of snow, which partially melts during the
                    summer, forming considerable lakelets on the surface of the ice, or courses over
                    it in the shape of streams that thunder down the deep <hi rend="italic"
                    >crevasses</hi> which divide it here and there as in ordinary glaciers. No sign
                    of living thing is seen on it, save patches here and there of a low order of
                    plants identical with or allied to the “red snow” <hi rend="italic">{Ancylonema

                    powder-like mineral “kryokonite” is to be considered an exception. The few
                    explorers who have ever attempted to penetrate this terrible waste all give the

                    white, earthless, moraineless, lifeless—is seen, until, in the far distance, the
                    view is bounded by a dim, misty horizon of ice, which, at a distance of about 30
                    miles inland^ rises to a height of 2000 feet above the sea. North is ice; south
                    is ice; and behind are seen the “outskirts,” or ice-bare islands. The only
                    exception to this general statement is to be found in the fact that here and
                    there the ice has licked in and surrounded, but not yet covered, bits of high
                    land near the coast, which stand out black amid the surrounding icy whiteness.
                    Such an island in the ice is known to the Greenlanders as a “nunatak.” A noted
                    one has long been known to exist some 50 miles east of the westward edge of the
                    inland ice north of Frederikshaab. It was long supposed to be merely the east
                    coast mountains, the country being narrow at this point; but the explorations of
                    Lieut. Jensen, R.D.N., in July and August 1878, prove it to be a peak 5000 feet
                    high,— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> about 3000 feet above the surrounding
                    ice,—entirely isolated. On the other side of this mountain ridge the glacier
                    field was observed stretching without interruption as far as the eye could see,
                    the plateau apparently rising higher and higher to the east,<note

                    account for the fact that the German explorers did not notice the inland ice in
                    their explorations of Franz Josef Fjord. The high peak only proves that, though
                    in the course of ages the winter snow, unmelted by the summer heats, has got
                    compressed into the glacier sheet which has covered the interior, and is
                    partially discharging its surplus in the form of icebergs on the coast, it has
                    not yet accumulated to such depths as to overwhelm these elevated places. It
                    may, however, do so iu time; for, though it is clear that at one time the
                    climate of Greenland was very different from what it is now, it is equally
                    evident that at no very distant date the ice overspread much of the now
                    uncovered outskirts. The so-called “glaciers” which reach the sea are long or
                    short, broad or narrow, according to the character of the valley through which
                    they creep seaward. Thus a coast “glacier,” so called, may be 40 miles broad,
                    like the Great Glacier of Humboldt, or only a few yards, like most of the others
                    in Greenland. When the glacier reaches the sea it ploughs along the bottom,
                    until, by the force of the water, its end is buoyed up and finally broken off in
                    the shape of an iceberg, which is carried by the winds and currents out to sea
                    to be in time again melted and absorbed into the ocean whence it originally
                    sprang. If, on the contrary, the sea is shallow, the glacier will protrude for a
                    considerable distance, as in the case of the Isblink, a little north of the
                    fishing-station of Avigait (62° 32' N. lat.), which is a low sandy beach
                    projecting about 8 miles in front of the inland ice, and forming a breakwater
                    against the force of the waves. From under the Arctic glacier pours, as in the
                    Alpine ones, a muddy stream, which silts up some of the fjords, and forms
                    deposits identical with the laminated glacial clays of Britain. Such, in brief,
                    is the inland ice of Greenland, which has been known since the days of

                    rocks of Disco Island, Noursoak Peninsula, and the Oolites of Pendulum Island in
                    East Greenland. It is possible that some of these rocks are also of Huronian
                    age, but it is doubtful whether the rocks so designated by the geologists of the
                    “Alert” and “Discovery” expedition are really the rocks so known in Canada, or
                    are a continuous portion of the fundamental or oldest gneiss of the north-west

                    Measures above these, if they occur, we know nothing at present. Capt. Feilden
                    notes as suggestive that, though the explorers have not met with this formation
                    on the northern shores of Greenland, yet it was observed that a continuation of
                    the direction of the known strike of the limestones of Feilden peninsula,
                    carried over the polar area, passes through the neighbourhood of Spitzbergen,
                    where the formation occurs, and contains certain species identical with those of
                    the Grinnell Land rocks of this horizon. The facies of the fossils is, according
                    to Mr Etheridge, North American and Canadian, though many of the species are
                    British. The corals are few in number, but the <hi rend="italic">Molluscoida

                    Kome strata” of Nordenskjold, being the oldest. They reach 1000 feet in
                    thickness, occupying undulating hollows in the underlying gneiss, and dip
                    towards the Noursoak Peninsula at 20°, when the overlying Atanakerdluk strata
                    come in. Both these series contain numerous plant remains, evergreen oaks,
                    magnolias, aralias, &amp;c., and seams of lignite (coal), which is burnt; but in
                    neither occur the marine beds of the United States. Still, the presence of

                <p>(7.) <hi rend="italic">Miocene.—</hi> This formation, one of the most widely
                    spread in polar lands, though the most iocal in Greenland, is also the best
                    known feature in its geology. It is limited to Disco Island, and perhaps to a
                    small part of the Noursoak Peninsula, and the neighbouring country, and consists
                    of numerous thin beds of sandstone, shale, and coal,—the sideritic shale
                    containing immense quantities of leaves, stems, fruit, &amp;c., as well as some
                    insects, and the coal pieces of retinite. The study of these plant and insect
                    remains shows that forests containing a vegetation very similar to that of
                    California and the southern United States, in some instances even the species of
                    trees being all but identical, flourished in 70° N. lat. during geological
                    periods comparatively recent. These beds, as well as the Cretaceous series, from
                    which they are as yet only imperfectly distinguished, are associated with sheets
                    of basalt, which penetrate them in great dykes, and in some places, owing to the
                    wearing away of the softer sedimentary rocks, stand out in long walls running
                    across the beds. These Miocene strata have not been found further north on the
                    Greenland shore than the region mentioned; but in Lady Franklin Bay, on the
                    Grinnell Land side of Smith Sound, they again appear, so that the chances are
                    they will be found on the opposite coast, though doubtless the great
                    disintegration Greenland has undergone ana is undergoing has destroyed many of
                    the softer beds of fossiliferous rocks. On the east coast, more particularly in
                    Hochstetter Foreland, the Miocene beds again appear, and we may add that there
                    are traces of them even on the west coast, between Sonntag Bay and Foulke Fjord,
                    at the entrance to Smith Sound. It thus appears that since early Tertiary times
                    there has been a great change in the climate of Greenland.</p>
                <p>(8.) <hi rend="italic">Post-Tertiary Beds.—</hi> These consist of raised
                    sea-beaches found along the whole coast of Greenland, containing <hi
                    rend="italic">Mollusca</hi> and other organic remains, identical with those
                    living in the neighbouring sea. These terraces are very marked on the shores of
                    Smith Sound, and are believed to be proof of the gradual elevation of the land
                    in that quarter, such elevation being known to be going on all round the polar
                    basin. Within the Danish possessions, however, the coast is falling,—places, the
                    site of hamlets within the memory of man, being no longer habitable, and other
                    localities which, when the Danes first came to the country a century and a half
                    ago, were bare being now covered at the lowest tides.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mines.—</hi> In addition to the formations named, there are
                    numerous other rocks—primitive or metamorphic—which it is impossible to classify
                    accurately, in which are found numerous minerals, either in veins or scattered.
                    Few of these are of economic importance. <hi rend="italic">Graphite</hi> is
                    found in great abundance, particularly on an island off Upernivik, but the
                    mining of it has proved unprofitable. <hi rend="italic">Cryolite</hi> is found
                    in quantity in Greenland only, and is at present the only mineral mined there
                    for the European and American markets (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Cryolite).</hi>
                    It is found only in one spot, Ivigtut, on the shore of Arsut Fjord in 61° 10' N.
                    lat., traversing a granitic-like gneiss in veins, associated with argentiferous
                    lead, copper, zinc, tin, tantalite, molybdenite, zircon, fluor spar, &amp;c.;
                    but none of the metallic ores have been found profitable to work. The number of
                    labourers employed usually amounts to 100 in summer and 30 in winter, in
                    addition to the officials and their families. In the nine years succeeding 1857,
                    when a licence was granted to a private company to work the cryolite, 14,000
                    tons were exported, and during the next nine years 70,000 tons, or, on an
                    average, 26 ship-loads per annum. <hi rend="italic">Steatite</hi> or soap-stone
                    has been long used by the natives for the manufacture of their lamps and other
                    vessels. Native <hi rend="italic">iron</hi> is found in various places; the most
                    remarkable of these finds were the great nodules of Uvifak on Disco Island,—the
                    weight of the largest of which was calculated at 46,200 lb.—at one time believed
                    to be areolites, but now known to be simply native iron of the same quality as
                    that scattered in the gneiss on which the masses were found superimposed. <hi
                    rend="italic">Copper</hi> has been found in several places, but only in nodules
                    and laminae of very limited extent. Coal of poor quality, associated with the
                    Cretaceous and Miocene beds, is found in the districts about Disco Bay and
                    Umenak Fjord, but it is only mined to the extent of 40 or 50 tons per annum, for
                    use in the houses of the Danish officers, unless when an exploring ship refills
                    with it. The coal of Kuhn island is Jurassic.<note anchored="true"

                    southern part has a climate much the same as the northern shores of Norway and
                    Iceland; further north the temperature decreases with the increase of latitude,
                    while the severity of the winter season is intensified by the country being
                    shrouded for several months in the year in darkness,—in the far north seldom
                    even relieved by the rare displays of the aurora, though the starlight and
                    moonlight are brilliant beyond what the inhabitants of lower latitudes are
                    accustomed to. Again, during the summer there is an equally long continuance of
                    the sun above the horizon. Spring and autumn are disagreeable, rain, sleet, and
                    snow being frequent, while, the sea not being frozen over, travelling becomes
                    difficult. In North Greenland sledging along thé ice-covered coast is pleasant
                    during the winter, but in the south the sea is not continuously congealed; hence
                    no dogs are kept, and the winter exercise of the sometimes scurvied residents is
                    confined to within a few yards of the houses, when the great depth of snow will
                    admit even of this. The climate is very uncertain—the weather changing suddenly
                    from bright sunshine, with swarms of mosquitos enjoying their brief holiday, to
                    dense fog, driving in clouds around the headlands, and even heavy falls of snow
                    accompanied by icy cold winds. At Julianehaab the mean annual temperature is
                    about 33° Fahr., and at Upernivik, 13°. In January, at Van Rensselaer harbour,
                    Kane experienced as low a temperature as -66 5° Fahr. At Sabine Island, on the
                    east coast, the temperature is much the same at the same periods as on the
                    opposite west coast, except in the month of December. Again, at Upernivik the
                    mean temperature of the three summer months is 38°; at Julianehaab it is 48°;
                    and for the three winter months respectively - 7° and 20°. The winter at
                    Julianehaab is not much colder than that of Norway and Sweden in the same
                    latitude, but its mean temperature for the whole year is like that of Norway 600
                    miles further north. In other words, its winter is not severe but its summer is
                    arctic, and, so far as the summer goes, the same generalization may be made
                    regarding all Greenland. In the most northern settlements a temperature of 52°
                    is oppressive, but until the thermometer falls to —28° no one complains of
                    extreme cold. At Upernivik (72° 48' N. lat.) the highest temperature that has
                    been noted is 59°. At Julianehaab 68° has once been recorded, perhaps the
                    highest <hi rend="italic">known</hi> Greenland heat. Often in January and
                    February a peculiar warm wind or “föhn” begins to blow, raising the temperature
                    to 42°. On the other hand, at Upernivik, in July a day was observed with a mean
                    temperature below 32°, and a single observation in the same month has shown 27⅜°
                    Fahr. The prevailing winds—the “föhn,’’<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    south with snow and rain, and from the north clearing the sky, or in summer

                    auroral displays are common. There is less snow in the north than in the south.
                    At Julianehaab it once snowed in June continuously for thirtv-six hours, and in
                    64° N. lat. not a single drop of rain fell from September 27, 1862, to May 20,
                    1863, on which day the snow had obtained a depth between the houses of from 8 to

                    rend="italic">Lagenorhynchιιs,</hi> and the sword-fish. Of these the ermine,
                    lemming, and musk ox are not found as far south as the Danish possessions. They
                    inhabit the shores of Smith Sound and East Greenland in about the same latitude,
                    but do not stretch farther south, so that the probabilities are that they have
                    migrated round the northern end of the country, and are kept from spreading
                    southward by the glaciers. The mouse, goat, sheep, and ox have been introduced,
                    and the cat is domesticated as far north as Danish women have wandered. Goats,
                    sheep, and oxen live only in the little greenish valleys of the extreme south;
                    in the north there are none. A few pigs are kept at Ivigtut. The right whale is
                    now rarely killed off the coast of Greenland, the whalers merely passing up the
                    coast to the fishing grounds further north and west. The Eskimo at Holstensborg
                    still occasionally harpoon one or two, but the industry is a mere shadow of what
                    it once was. The humpback, one of the fin-whales, is now and then killed, but
                    the narwhal and white whale form the staple “fishery” of the Greenlanders. Of
                    seals it has been calculated that there are annually captured 51,000 of the
                    floe-rat <hi rend="italic">(Phoca hispida),</hi> between 1000 and 2000 of the

                    walruses, 600 white whales, 100 narwhals, a few porpoises, on an average one
                    rightwhale (in the season from Decembeι ’ to March, when it goes as near the
                    coast as the ice will permit in the south), and two or three humpbacks <hi
                    rend="italic">(Magaptera longimana),</hi> are killed. The other whales are rare,
                    and are captured only under peculiar circumstances. The average catch of the
                    Greenlanders thus amounts to 89,000 seals, 700 white whales and narwhals, and 2
                    or 3 large whales. Of these seals it may be stated that 38,000 have been caught
                    with harpoons and bladders, 38,000 killed by fire-arms, and 13,000 caught in
                    nets. The polar bear is almost extinct,—about 50 being annually killed in the
                    north, or in the south when they have floated from the east coast on the
                    Spitzbergen heavy ice which doubles Cape Farewell and impinges on the coast
                    south of 69° N. lat., or occasionally in the intervening space where a wandering
                    bear has been earned south on a broken-up floe. The reindeer, once killed in
                    enormous quantities, is sharing the' fate of the bear. Between 1845 and 1849
                    about 25,000 were shot annually, and 16,000 skins were exported. In 1872 there
                    were not more than 1000 killed, and only 6 skins exported. It is now rarely seen
                    in Mid Greenland. The number of foxes trapped averages 1500 per annum; in 1874
                    5000 were caught, chiefly between 60° and 61° N. lat. About 1000 white hares are
                    killed. The true bird denizens of Greenland cannot be given at higher than 63,
                    while 62 others are reported as stragglers. Of the denizens 5 belong to the Old
                    World, 11 to the New World, 45 are common to both worlds, and 2 are
                    doubtful.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Newton, <hi

                    round; the rest are migratory. The ptarmigan is killed for food to the extent of
                    about 12,000 per annum, while the number of cider ducks destroyed is so enormous
                    that the export of eider down has fallen within the last twenty years from 5600
                    to 2000 lb. Bink estimates the number killed annually at 20,000, and that of
                    auks and smaller sea-fowl at 50,000. The eggs taken yearly, chiefly those of
                    eider ducks, has been estimated at 50,000. Of the 79 or 80 fishes described from
                    Greenland very few are peculiar to it; of these the shark <hi rend="italic"

                    annum. The cod is a migratory fish, and is caught on the banks to the extent of
                    200,000 per annum, chiefly by the natives. A few salmon trout <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic">carpio)</hi> are caught in the little lakes and

                <p>The vegetation in the height of summer is, in favourable situations, profuse in
                    individual plants, but scanty in species. The plants are of the usual arctic
                    type, and identical with or allied to those found in Lapland or on the summits
                    of the highest British hills. Forest there is none in all the country. In the
                    north, where the lichen-covered or ice-shaven rocks do not protrude, the ground
                    is covered with a carpet of mosses, creeping dwarf willows, crowberries,
                    bilberries, and similar plants, while the flowers most common are the andromeda,
                    the yellow poppy, pedicularis, pyrola, the Alpine rose (rhododendron),
                    saxifrages (12 species), drabas, dryas, &amp;c.; but in South Greenland there is
                    something in the shaj5e of bush,—the dwarf birches even rising a few feet in
                    very sheltered places, and the vegetation is less arctic and more abundant.
                    Altogether, 361 flowering plants, ferns, horse-tails, quillworts, and club
                    mosses have been described, while the lists of cryptogamie plants, though very
                    imperfect, show a profuse vegetation of the lowlier orders.<note anchored="true"

                    cultivated in Greenland, but at Godthaab attempts have been made to grow
                    turnips, radishes, lettuce, and chervil in little gardens made with earth
                    brought from the site of old Eskimo houses. Potatoes never grow larger than
                    small marbles, while pease only produce seeds barely recognizable. At Nanortalik
                    strawberries have been produced in a forcing frame, carrots matured tolerably
                    well, and turnips have been grown weighing half a pound. Rhubarb grew
                    vigorously, but could not be raised from seed, while cabbage leaves, under the
                    most favourable circumstances, were poor and. flavourless. In the north,
                    radishes represent the highest triumph which horticulture has achieved. Flowers,
                    owing to the long sunlight, grow very well indoors, but require great care,
                    otherwise they soon die.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi> Excluding the extreme northern parts of
                    Greenland, and the north-east coast,—which may be claimed by the English,
                    American, and Germans “by right of discovery,”—the trade of Greenland is a
                    strict monopoly of the Danish crown, dating from 1774, and is at present
                    administered in Copenhagen by a Government board,—the “Kongelige Grönlandske
                    Handel,”—and in the country by various officials in Government pay. In order to
                    meet the double purposes of government and trade, the west coast, up to nearly
                    74° N. lat., is divided into two inspectorates, —the southern extending to 67°
                    10' N. lat., the northern comprising the rest of the country,—their respective
                    seats of government being at Godthaab and Godhavn. These inspectorates are ruled
                    by two superior officials or governors responsible to the director of the board
                    in Copenhagen. Each of the “inspectorates” is divided into “districts,” each
                    district having, in addition to the capital or “coloni” (a hamlet containing
                    three or four Danish dwellings, a storehouse, blubber-boiling house, in a few
                    cases a Lutheran “missionair” or clergyman, a teacher, and a physician), several
                    outlying posts and Eskimo hunting stations, each presided over by an “udligger,”
                    who is responsible to the “colonibestyrer” or superintendent of the district.
                    These trading settlements, which dot the coast for a distance of 1000 miles, are
                    about 60 in number, and collect the products from 176 inhabited places. From
                    these Eskimo hunting and fishing stations blubber-is the chief article received,
                    in parcels weighing from 50 to 100 lb, and forwarded in casks to the “coloni,”
                    where it is boiled into oil, and prepared for being despatched to Copenhagen by
                    means of the Government sailing ships, which arrive and leave between May and
                    November. For the rest of the year all navigation is stopped, though the winter
                    months form the busy seal-killing season. The principle which the Government
                    acts upon is to give the natives low prices for their produce, but to sell them
                    European articles of necessity at prime cost, and other stores, such as bread,
                    at prices which will scarcely pay for the purchase and freight, while no
                    merchandize is charged, on an average, more than 20 per cent, over the cost
                    price in Denmark. In addition, the Greenland people are allowed to order goods
                    from private <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n181/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0181-0170"/> dealers, on paying freight for them at the rate
                    of 2∣d. per 10 fl⅛, or Is. 6d. per cubic foot. The prices to be paid for
                    European articles are fixed every year, the prices current in Danish and Eskimo
                    being printed and distributed by the Government. According to a calculation,
                    founded on the average of the last few years, about 22 per cent, of the value in
                    the European market is paid for the products in Greenland. Out of the payment
                    five-sixths are given to tlft sellers, and one-sixth devoted to the
                    Greenlander’s public fund, spent in “public works,” in charity, and on other
                    unforeseen contingencies. The object of the monopoly is solely for the good of
                    the Greenlanders,—to prevent spirits being sold to them, and the vice, disease,
                    and misery, which usually attend the collision between civilization of the
                    trader’s type and barbarism, being introduced into the primitive arctic
                    community. The inspectors are, in addition to being trade superintendents,
                    magistrates, but serious crime is practically unknown; while the cases of theft
                    which have occurred within a decade are so few that they are held in
                    recollection as historical events. The “vices of civilization” are few, and its
                    diseases unknown. The Daniell officials are mostly men of considerable
                    intelligence, and all of good character, though their pay is small. The
                    inspector receives £328 and a residence; the average salaries of the 11
                    “colonibestyrere” are £250, of the 18 clerks—“assistants” or “volunteers”—£106,
                    besides residence, fuel, and attendance. In addition there are about 182
                    “ulliggers,” seamen, mechanics, &lt;fcc., each receiving an average of £25 a
                    year, besides, in the case of the outpost traders, a percentage on their trade.
                    Though the officials are all-powerful, yet, owing to the exertions of Dr Rink,
                    local councils or “parsissaet” were organized in 1857 in every district. To
                    these parish parliaments delegates are sent from every station,—shrewd men, wise
                    in council, and well acquainted with the wants of the Greenlanders. These
                    “parsissoks ”—elected at the rate of about one representative to 120 voters—wear
                    a cap with a badge (a bear rampant), and aid the European members of the council
                    in distributing the surplus profit apportioned to each district, and generally
                    in advising as to the welfare of that part of Greenland under their partial
                    control. In 1873 there were deposited, in a savings bank established in
                    Greenland, £200 as contributions for the support of illegitimate children; £199,
                    10s., sums gained by inheritance or by other unforeseen circumstances; £791,
                    savings from wages, chiefly those of the Europeans; and £121, savings of the
                    Eskimo, or half-bloods. But thrift is the least prominent feature in the Eskimo
                    character. The “municipal council” has the disposal of 20 per cent, of the
                    annual profits made on produce purchased within the confines of each district.
                    It holds two sessions every year, and the discussions are entirely in the Eskimo
                    language. In addition to their functions as guardians of the poor, the parish
                    M.P.’s have to investigate crimes and punish misdemeanours, settle litigations
                    and divide inheritances. They can impose fines for small offences not worth
                    sending before the inspector, and, in cases of high misdemeanour, have the power
                    of inflicting corporal punishment. During the first ten or twelve years the
                    following causes were submitted to trial :—one single case of having in passion
                    occasioned the death of a person, and another of openly threatening; five or six
                    instances of grosser theft or cheating, and as many of concealment of birth and
                    crimes relating to matrimony; every year a few petty thefts, and instances of
                    making use of the tools of others without permission, or of like disorders; and
                    several trifling litigations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trade.—</hi> The trade of Greenland is entirely confined to
                    that part sf the coast colonized by the Danes,—the rude natives of Smith Sound
                    and the east coast contributing nothing to the world’s riches. Neither do the
                    civilized people of any other nation trade on the zoast, the English “Greenland
                    seal and whale fishery” being a misnomer, for the ‘ ’ fisheries” are pursued on
                    the west coast of Davis Strait and Baffin’s Bay, and in the sea between Jan
                    Mayen and Spitzbergen, and occasionally within sight of the east coast of
                    Greenland. Taking the Greenland trade as confined to the west coast, we find,
                    according to the calculations of Rink, that the earnings of the 1877 families of
                    Eskimo under the Danish crown are on an average £15,016 per annum,—giving each
                    family an average annual income of £8 from the produce of the hunt sold to the
                    royal officials. These payments are made in paper notes used as a currency in
                    Greenland. During the twenty years 1853 72, excluding cryolite, the average
                    annual exports consisted of 1185 tuns of oil, 35,439 seal-skins, 1436 fox-skins,
                    41 bear-skins, 811 waterproof jackets, 1003 waterproof trousers, 3533 lb raw
                    eider down, 6900 lb feathers, 2300 lb whalebone, 550 lb narwhal ivory, 87 lb
                    walrus ivory, 1817 reindeer hides. During the period 1870-74 the mean annual
                    value of the products received from Greenland was £45,600; that of the cargoes
                    sent thither, £23,844; and the mean expenditure on the ships and crews, £8897.
                    Not including the royalty paid by the company which exports the cryolite (from
                    1853 to 1874 equal to £58,924), the average profit of the Greenland trade was,
                    for the 211 years between 1853 and 1874, about £6600 yearly. The capital sunk in
                    the “royal trade” is calculated at £64,426; and, taking the whole amount of net
                    revenues from the present trade during the period between 1790 to 1875, the
                    interest on the capital as well as the income from the cryolite royalty being
                    subtracted, the present ‘ ‘ direkter” of the Kongelige Gronlandske Handel
                    considers that £160,000 has been earned.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trading Districts and Census.—</hi> A Danish “coloni” in
                    Greenland is not at the best of times a cheerful place, though, in the long days
                    of summer, some of those in the fjords of South Greenland are comparatively
                    pleasant. The houses are almost invariably built of wood, pitched over, and
                    built more for warmth than for appearance. In addition to the three or four
                    Danish houses—the usual number at the chief settlement—there are from 20 or 30
                    to 300 or 400 Eskimo at the place. They usually live in huts built of turf and
                    stone, each entered by a short tunnel, which in most respects are an improvement
                    over the primitive dwellings of the race elsewhere (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Eskimo).</hi> In South Greenland there are seven trading districts; in North
                    Greenland five. From Cape Farewell northward these are as follows. <hi
                    rend="italic">Julianehaab</hi> had in 1870 2570 inhabitants, and 8 trading
                    stations. Of the inhabitants, 1056 belonged in 1872 to the Moravian mission
                    settlements, which do not extend much farther north, the other clergy being
                    members of the Danish Church, between whom and the “Herrnhutians” something of
                    the <hi rend="italic">odium</hi><hi rend="italic">theologicum</hi> exists. In
                    this district also are the remains of the old Norse settlements of Red Erik, his
                    contemporaries, and his successors. <hi rend="italic">Frederikshaab</hi> has six
                    trading stations, which collect about 68 tuns of oil and 1000 seal skins
                    annually. The population in 1870 was 821; at Ivigtut, in this district, are the
                    cryolite mines. <hi rend="italic">Godthaab</hi> has 999 people, 6 stations, and
                    a trade return of 74 tuns of oil and 1000 seal-skins annually. It is the most
                    southern station for eider down, and formerly also for reindeer skins. Cod-fish
                    were also once caught here in great abundance, but this business is now almost
                    abandoned. Godthaab “coloni” is the chief settlement in Greenland. “Besides the
                    usual trade officials, one or two Danish missionaries who manage the seminary,
                    and two or three Moravian missionaries [at Ny Herrnhut], the royal inspector of
                    South Greenland, and the physician for the northern part of it reside in this
                    place. In addition to the seminary, Godthaab.has a church, of rather imposing
                    appearance for Greenland, but too large for the community, and built of bricks,
                    a material very little suited to the country. The houses of the natives, almost
                    all with sloping roofs of boards, look very pretty, but at Ny Herrnhut they
                    offer a sad appearance. The latter station has a two-storied building,
                    containing accommodation for the missionaries, schoolroom, and church or
                    ‘meeting hall’ as it is called.” At Lichtenfels is another Moravian settlement,
                    but the community has within the last thirty years decreased to one-half, and,
                    owing chiefly to the indiscreet asceticism demanded from their flock by these
                    unworldly men and women, is perhaps the most destitute of material comfort of
                    any in Greenland. In this district are also found Norse ruins, part of the
                    region having been the Vester Bygd of the Icelanders, just as that further south
                    was their Oster Bygd. <hi rend="italic">Sukkertoppen</hi> is one of the loftiest
                    and most picturesque districts. It yields about 92 tuns of oil and 1000
                    seal-skins, also some cod-fish, a few reindeer, and most of the eider down of
                    the country. It has six trading posts and 765 people. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Holstenborg</hi> has four trading posts, and now yields about 60 tuns of oil
                    and 400 seal-skins, besides whalebone and eider down. There are 545 inhabitants.
                    In 67° 40' N. lat. Nagsutok or North Strom Fjord forms the boundary between
                    South and North Greenland; the settlements which follow are therefore in the
                    latter inspectorate. <hi rend="italic">Egedcsminde</hi> is in a state of
                    decadence, the present production being about 74 tuns of oil and 3400 seal-skins
                    collected annually by six stations. In 1870 the population was 1008, the greater
                    number living at the chief settlement of the same name. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Christianshaab</hi> has four trading posts, which collect from 481 inhabitants
                    110 tuns of oil and 1700 seal-skins. Christianshaab is one of the pleasantest

                    side of the harbour from the “coloni” abounding with crowberries and bilberries,
                    and bright in July with the blue and yellow arctic flowers. Claushavn is the
                    chief post, and derives its support from the seals killed among the enormous
                    crop of icebergs poured out by the great Jakobshavn ice fjord. Many of the bergs
                    ground here until they are lifted by spring tides and carried by the wind out
                    into Baffin’s Bay. <hi rend="italic">Jakobshavn</hi> has eight stations,
                    collecting 104 tuns of oil and 900 seal-skins from 424 people. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Godhavn,</hi> on Disco Island, was at one time a seat of the whale trade, in
                    1798 no less than 20 whales having been caught there; but this industry has now
                    entirely ceased, the last whale caught by the Government officials being in
                    1851. Its chief importance is in the fact that Godhavn (or Lievely) is the seat
                    of the Government of North Greenland, and the place at which exploring and
                    whaling vessels often call. Its trade is insignificant, the district returning
                    on an average only about 30 tuns of oil and 400 seal-skins; the settlement has
                    for many years been actually a loss to the Government. There are in the district
                    245 people, who are perhaps the least industrious and self-reliant of all the
                    Greenlanders. <hi rend="italic">Ritenbenk</hi> has five stations, returning 116
                    tuns of oil and 3500 seal-skins, collected by 447 people. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Umanak</hi> is one of the most profitable districts,—the “coloni’’ with its six
                    outposts returning to the “royal trade” about 180 tuns of oil and 8300
                    seal-skins, collected from 798 people. <hi rend="italic">Upernivik</hi> is the
                    most northern district, its limits being those of the natives belonging to the
                    Danish settlements. It is very profitable,—-its average return being 148 tuns of
                    oil and 6500 seal-skins, besides eider down and bearskins, with formerly a
                    considerable quantity of reindeer-skins. In 1870 there were 702 people in the
                    district, the chief of the outposts being Proven (“the experiment”), and
                    Tasiusak (73° 24' N. lat.), the most northern Danish trading post, and the most
                    northern permanent abode of civilized men or women, for the trader has a Danish
                    wife with him. “To a European female,” writes the director of the Royal
                    Greenland Board of Trade, “this indeed seems to be one of the most melaneholy
                    places of residence that can be found.” In the service of the Danish mission
                    there were in 1870 53 appointed teachers, besides several other teachers classed
                    as seal hunters or fishers. In the service of the royal trade were 12 outpost
                    traders, 15 head men and “boatswains,” 14 carpenters and smiths, 19 coopers, 15
                    cooks, 54 sailors and labourers, besides 10 pensioners and 33 midwives; 5
                    officers were enumerated as natives, but 3 of them are more properly Europeans.
                    In the same year the Europeans numbered 237, of whom 95 were engaged in the
                    trade, 8 were Danish and 11 Moravian missionaries, and 38 lived at the cryolite
                    mine; the rest were women and children.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Altogether there were in 1870 9825 people in Danish Greenland (including 9408
                    natives), and in 1878 9800. The details of the latter census are not published,
                    but they do not in any material manner alter those just given. The inhabitants
                    of the east coast are not believed to exceed 800 if so many, and yearly this
                    number is being lessened by immigration to the Danish settlements on the west
                    coast. The natives of the shores of Smith Sound, north of Melville Bay, number
                    about 200; and it is satisfactory to learn that of late these <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Greenland was first landed on about the year 986
                    by Erikr Rauthi or Red Erik, a banished Icelandic jarl, though some time
                    previously the country had been sighted by Ulf Kraku, another Icelander. Erik
                    and his house early settled at Brattelid,—the present Eskimo station of
                    Igaliko,—situated on an isthmus between two fjords, believed to be the Erik’s
                    and Einar’s Fjords of the old sagas, where to this day can be traced the walls
                    of about seventeen dwellings, one of which bears evidence of having been Erik’s
                    house. Other settlers followed, and among these was Bjarni, son of Herjulf, one
                    of Erik’s companions, whose home was probably at Herjulf’s Ness, opposite the
                    Moravian settlement of Frederiksdal, where have been found tombs containing
                    wooden coffins, with skeletons wrapped in coarse hairy cloth, and both pagan and
                    Christian tombstones with runic inscriptions. This Bjarni, in his wanderings,
                    discovered the continent of America (Vinland), and, among these who were
                    attracted hither was Leif, who went ashore near where the town of Taunton now
                    stands. After this there is said to have been a considerable trade between
                    Norway and America, and between both countries and the Greenland colonists. The
                    latter even penetrated to 73° N. lat. as early as the year 1235, and left a
                    small runic stone recording the event.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Christianity was introduced, and Arnold appointed the first bishop, in 1126; and
                    Greenland, like Iceland, had a republican organization up to the year 1261, when
                    Hakon Hakonsen, king of Norway, induced the Greenlanders to swear allegiance to
                    him. Henceforth they were Norwegian subjects, and their country one of the
                    queen’s domains. From that day may be dated the beginning of their decay and
                    final disappearance as colonists, though the black death, foreign enemies, and
                    the attacks of the Eskimo, who about this period burst upon the colonies from
                    the north, had something to do with it. These settlements were called
                    respectively the Easter Bygd or Building and the Wester Bygd, both being now
                    known to be on the west coast, though for long the view was persistently held
                    that the first was on the east coast, and numerous expeditions have been sent in
                    search of these “lost colonies” and their imaginary survivors. The last bishop
                    appointed to Greenland died in 1540, but long before that date those appointed
                    had never reached their sees. The country had also been visited by a hostile
                    fleet (believed to be English), and about the end of the 15th century it would
                    appear that all colonization had ceased. When in 1585 John Davis visited it
                    there was no sign of any people save the Eskimo, among whose traditions are one
                    or two relating to the old Norsemen. For more than 200 years Greenland seems to
                    have been neglected—almost forgotten. It was visited by whalers, chiefly Dutch,
                    but nothing in the form of permanent settlements was established until the year
                    1721, when the first missionary, Hans Egede, landed. Amid many hardships and
                    discouragements he persevered;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the remnant of the native race is civilized and Christianized, instead of wild
                    and pagan, as they were when he arrived among them. The colonists of the· 18th
                    century were, many of them, convicts and other offenders; and the trade was a
                    monopoly in the hands of private individuals. In 1733-34 there was a dreadful
                    epidemic of small-pox which destroyed an immense number of the people. In 1774
                    the trade ceased to be profitable as a private monopoly, and to prevent it being
                    abandoned the Government took it over. In 1807-14, owing to the war,
                    communication was cut off with Denmark; but since that date the country has been
                    prospering in a languid fashion, though, if the Government ceased its fostering
                    care, the Eskimo, and with them what trade is carried on, must become
                    extinct.</p>
