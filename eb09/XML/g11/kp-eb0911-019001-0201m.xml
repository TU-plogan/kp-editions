                    political career of his son, covered nearly half a century. Before the latter
                    was born, General Grey had served on the staff of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick
                    in the Seven Years’ War, and had been wounded at Minden. While the son was
                    making verses at Eton, the father was serving against the revolted colonists in
                    Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and while the young member for Northumberland was
                    denouncing Pitt’s war against the Convention, the veteran soldier was destroying
                    the remnant of the French colonial empire by the capture of Martinique and
                    Guadaloupe. When Napoleon threatened an invasion, General Grey took the command
                    of the southern district, and at the peace of Amiens he was rewarded with a
                    peerage. His elder brother, Sir Henry Grey of Howick, the head of the family,
                    had supported the Government in parliament. But the political career of young
                    Grey, who was heir-presumptive to the family estates, took a different
                    complexion, which needs to be explained by the circumstances in which it
                    began.</p>
                <p>Young Grey expected to reoccupy the seat which had been his uncle’s; and his
                    early years were spent in preparation for a parliamentary career. He was sent to
                    Eton, and proceeded thence to Cambridge. William Pitt, a youth five years older,
                    was then in residence as a master of arts, studiously paying court to the Whigs
                    of the university; and at the general election of 1780 he came forward as a
                    candidate for the academical seat. His name stood last on the poll, but he was
                    brought in elsewhere, and his first speech proved him a man of the first mark.
                    The unparalleled successes which followed portended grave changes. Pitt’s
                    elevation to the premiership, his brilliant and hard-fought battle in the house,
                    and his complete rout of the Whig party at the general election of 1784, when he
                    came in for Cambridge at the head of the poll, threatened the great territorial
                    interest with nothing less than extinction. It was to this interest that Grey
                    belonged; and hence, when at length returned for Northumberland in 1786, he at
                    once came forward as a vigorous assailant of the Government of Pitt. He was
                    hailed by the opposition, and associated with Fox, Burke, and Sheridan as a
                    manager in the Hastings impeachment. During the nineteen years which remained of
                    the career of Fox, he followed the great Whig statesman with absolute fidelity,
                    and succeeded him as leader of the party. The shortcomings of Fox’s
                    statesmanship were inherited by Grey. Both were equally devoid of political
                    originality, shunned the severer labours of the politician, and instinctively
                    feared auy deviation from the traditions of their party. Such men cannot save a
                    party in its decadence, and the history of Fox and Grey has been aptly termed
                    the history of the decline and fall of Whiggism.</p>
                <p>The stunning blow of 1784 was the first incident in this history. Its full
                    significance was not at once perceived. An opposition, however weak in the
                    beginning, generally has a tendency to revive, and Grey’s early successes in the
                    house helped to revive the Foxites. The European situation became favourable to
                    this revival. The struggle in France for popular rights, culminating in the
                    great Revolution, was watched by Fox with interested sympathy. He affected to
                    regard the domination of Pitt as the domination of the crown, and as leading
                    logically to absolutism, and saw in that popular sympathy for the French
                    Revolution which naturally arose in England an instrument which might be
                    employed to overthrow this domination.</p>
                <p>But Pitt gathered the fruits of the windfall. The spread of “Jacobinism,” or
                    “French principles,” became the pretext on which the stronger half of the
                    opposition went over to the Government. Burke led the movement in the Commons,
                    the duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam in the Lords, and with this second
                    incident in the Whig decline began the difficulties of Grey’s career. The
                    domination of the premier had already stirred the keenest resentment in the
                    younger and more ambitious members of the Whig party. Freed from t⅛e restraint
                    of the steadier politicians under Burke and Portland, the residuum under Fox
                    fell into a series of grave mistakes. Of this residuum Grey became the moving
                    spirit, for though Fox did not check their activity, he disclaimed the
                    responsibility of their policy. Fox had refused to condemn “French principles,”
                    and denounced the war with France; but he would take no part in exciting
                    agitation in England. It was otherwise with the restless spirits among whom Grey
                    was found. Enraged by the attitude of Pitt, which was grounded on the support of
                    the constituencies as they then stood, the residuum plotted an ill-timed
                    agitation for parliamentary reform.</p>
                <p>The demand for parliamentary reform was as yet in a rudimentary stage. Forty
                    years later it had become the demand of an unenfranchised nation, disabused by a
                    sudden spread of political and economical knowledge. It was as yet but the
                    occasional instrument of the scheming politician. Chatham had employed the cry
                    in this sense. The Middlesex agitators had done the same; even the premier of
                    the time, after his accession to power, had sought to strengthen his hands in
                    the same way. But Pitt’s hands were now strengthened abundantly; whereas the
                    opposition had nothing to lose and much to gain by such a measure. The cry for
                    reform thus became their natural expedient. Powerless to carry reform in the
                    House, they sought to overawe parliament by external agitation, and formed the
                    Society of the Friends of the People, destined to unite the forces of all the
                    “patriotic” societies which already existed in the country, and to pour their
                    violence irresistibly on a terrified parliament. Grey and his friends were
                    enrolled in this portentous association, and presented in parliament its
                    menacing petitions. Such petitions, which were in fact violent impeachments of
                    parliament itself, proceeding from voluntary associations having no corporate
                    existence, had been hitherto unknown in the English parliament. They had been
                    well-known in the French assembly. They had heralded and furthered the victory
                    of the Jacobins, the dissolution of the constitution, the calling of the
                    Convention, and the fall of the monarchy.</p>
                <p>The Society of the Friends of the People was originally an after-dinner folly,
                    extemporized at the house of a man who afterwards gained an earldom by
                    denouncing it as seditious. Fox discountenanced it, though he did not directly
                    condemn it; but Grey was overborne by the fierce Jacobinism of Lauderdale, and
                    avowed himself the parliamentary mouthpiece of this dangerous agitation. But
                    Pitt, strong in his position, cut the ground from under Grey’s feet by
                    suppressing the agitation with a strong hand. The suspension of the Habeas
                    Corpus Act, the Gagging Acts, and the state prosecutions form a painful
                    historical episode. But the discredit belongs as much to Grey and Lauderdale as
                    to Pitt. Grey always spoke regretfully of his share in the movement. “One word
                    from Fox,” he said, “would have kept me out of all the mess of the Friends of
                    the People. But he never spoke it.”</p>
                <p>It was Grey who moved the impeachment of Pitt, and he next promoted the equally
                    föolish “Secession.” Since the parliament did not properly represent the nation,
                    and refused to reform itself or to impeach the minister, nothing remained but to
                    disown it; and the opposition announced <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n202/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0202-0191"/> their intention of “seceding,” or systematically
                    absenting themselves from their places in parliament. This futile movement was
                    originated by Grey, Lauderdale, and the duke of Bedford, It obtained a somewhat
                    wider support. It suited the languor of some dispirited politicians, like Fox,
                    and the avarice of some lawyers in large practice, like Erskine; but sensible
                    politicians at once condemned it. It directly ignored parliamentary government,
                    and amounted to nothing but a pettish threat of revolution. “Secession,” said
                    Lord Lansdowne, with characteristic shrewdness, “either means rebellion, or it
                    is nonsense.” Pitt easily dashed this feeble weapon from the hands of his
                    opponents. He roused jealousy in the absent by praising the parts and the
                    patriotism of the rest, and thus gradually brought them back. Grey himself
                    reappeared to protest against the union with Ireland.</p>
                <p>When Pitt died in 1806, nothing could prevent the reunited opposition from coming
                    into power, and thus the Broad-bottom ministry was formed under Fox. On his
                    death, Grenville became premier, and Grey, now Lord Howick, Foreign Secretary,
                    and leader of the House of Commons. Disunion, always the bane of English
                    Liberalism, lurked in the coalition, and the Foxites and Grenvillites were only
                    ostensibly at one. Grey opposed the war policy of Grenville; and this policy was
                    not more successful than it had been in the hands of Pitt. And the change from
                    the leadership of Fox to that of Grenville was only too perceptible. Both in
                    court and country Grenville affected the role of Pitt, and assumed a stiff and
                    peremptory attitude which ill became him. An ill-advised dissolution weakened
                    their majority; they lost ground by the “delicate investigation” into the
                    conduct of the Princess of Wales; Lord Henry Petty’s budget was too specious to
                    command confidence; and the king, fully aware of their weak situation, resolved
                    to get rid of them. When they proposed to concede a portion of the Catholic
                    claims, George refused, and demanded of them an undertaking never to propose
                    such a measure again. This was refused, and the Grenville-Grey cabinet retired
                    in March 1807. In the same year Grey’s father died, and Grey went to the Upper
                    House. Opposition united Grey and Grenville for a time, but the parties finally
                    split on the old war question. When Napoleon returned from Elba in 1815, and
                    once more seized the government of France, the same question arose which had
                    arisen in 1792, Was England to go to war for the restoration of the Bourbons Î
                    Grenville followed the traditions of Pitt, and supported the ministry in at once
                    renewing hostilities. Grey followed those of Fox, and maintained the right of
                    France to choose her own governors, and the impossibility of checking the
                    reaction in the emperor’s favour. The victory of Waterloo put an end to the
                    dispute, but the disruption became permanent. The termination of the war, and
                    the cessation of all action in common, reduced the power of the opposition to
                    nothing. Grenville retired from public life, and his adherents reinforced the
                    ministry. Little remained for the Whigs to do. But the scandalous persecution of
                    the queen afforded an opportunity of showing that the ministry were not
                    omnipotent; and the part taken on that occasion by Grey won him at once the
                    increased respect of the nation and the undying aversion of George IV. It sealed
                    the exclusion of himself and his few friends from office during the king’s life;
                    and when in 1827 Grey came forth to denounce the ministry of Canning, he
                    declared that he stood alone in the political world. His words were soon
                    justified, for when Lord Goderich resigned, the remnant which had hitherto
                    supported Grey hastened to support the ministry of the duke of Wellington. Thus
                    was the original Whig party dissolved, after a series of struggles which had
                    begun with the longest reign upon record, and had outlasted it.</p>
                <p>We now reach the principal episode in Grey’s career. In 1827 he seemed to stand
                    forth the solitary and powerless relic of an extinct party. In 1832 we find that
                    party restored to its old numbers and activity, supreme in parliament, popular
                    in the nation, and Lord Grey at its head. The duke of Wellington’s foolish
                    declaration against parliar mentary reform, made in a season of great popular
                    excitement, suddenly deprived him of the confidence of the country, and a
                    coalition of the Whigs and Canningites became inevitable. The Whigs had in 1827
                    supported the Canningites; the latter now supported the Whigs, of whom Grey
                    remained the traditional head. George IV. was dead, and no obstacle existed to
                    Grey’s elevation. Grey was sent for by William IV. in November 1830, and formed
                    a coalition cabinet, pledged to carry on the work in which the duke of
                    Wellington had faltered. But Grey himself was the mere instrument of the times.
                    An old-fashioDed Whig, he had little personal sympathy with the popular cause,
                    though he had sometimes indicated a certain measure of reform as necessary. When
                    lie took office, he guessed neither the extent to which the Reform Act would go,
                    nor the means by which it would be carried. That he procured for the country a
                    measure of constitutional reform for which he had agitated in his youth was
                    little more than a coincidence. In his youth he had put himself at the head of a
                    frantic agitation against parliament, because he there found himself powerless.
                    In his old age the case was reversed. Suddenly raised to a position of authority
                    in the country, he boldly stood between parliament, as then constituted, and the
                    formidable agitation which now threatened it, and by a forced reform saved it
                    from revolution. In his youth he had assailed Pitt’s administration because
                    Pitt’s administration threatened with extinction the political monopoly of that
                    landed interest to which he belonged. In his old age, on the contrary, unable to
                    check the progress of the wave, he swam with it, and headed the movement which
                    compelled that landed interest to surrender its monopoly;</p>
                <p>The second reading of the first Reform Bill was carried in the Commons by a
                    majority of one. This was equivalent to a defeat, and further failures
                    precipitated a dissolution. The confidence which the bold action of the ministry
                    had won was soon plainly proved, for the second reading was carried in the new
                    parliament by a majority of 136. When the bill had at length passed the Commons
                    after months of debate, it was Grey’s task to introduce it to the Lords. It was
                    rejected by a majority of 4L The safety of the country now depended on the
                    prudence and courage of the ministry. The resignation of Grey and his colleagues
                    was dreaded even by the opposition, and they remained in office with the
                    intention of introducing a third Reform Bill in the next session. The last
                    months of 1831 were the beginning of a political crisis such as England had not
                    seen since 1688. The two extreme parties, the UltraRadicals and the
                    Ultra-Tories, were ready for civil war. Between them stood the ministry and the
                    majority of intelligent peace-loving Englishmen; and their course of action was
                    soon decided. The bill must be passed, and there were but two ways of passing
                    it. One was to declare the consent of the House of Lords unnecessary to the
                    measure, the other to create, if necessary, new peers in sufficient number to
                    outvote the opposition. These two expedients did not in reality differ. To swamp
                    the house in the way proposed would have been to destroy it. The question
                    whether the ministry should demand the king’s consent to such a creation, if
                    necessary, was debated in the cabinet in September. Brougham proposed it, and
                    gradually a majority of the cabinet were won over. Grey had at first refused to
                    employ even the threat of so unconstitutional a device as a means to the
                    proposed end. But his continued refusal would have broken up the ministry, and
                    the breaking <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n203/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0203-0192"/> up of the ministry must now have been the signal
                    for revolution. The second reading in the Commons was passed in December by a
                    majority of 162, and on New-Year’s Day 1832 the majority of the cabinet resolved
                    on demanding power to carry it in the Lords by a creation of peers. Grey carried
                    the resolution to the king. Some time still remained before the bill could be
                    committed and read a third time. It was not until the 9th of April that Grey
                    moved the second reading in the Lords. A sufficient number of the opposition
                    temporized; and the second reading was allowed to pass by a majority of nine.
                    Their intention was to mutilate the bill in committee. The Ultra-Tories, headed
                    by the duke of Wellington, had entered a protest against the second reading, but
                    they were now politically powerless. The struggle had become a struggle on the
                    one hand for the whole bill, to be carried by a creation of peers, and on the
                    other for some mutilated measure. Grey’s instinct divined that the crisis was
                    approaching. Either the king must consent to swamp the House, or the ministry
                    must cease to stand in the breach between the peers ancl the country. The king,
                    a weak and inexperienced politician, had in the meantime been wrought upon by
                    the temporizing leaders in the Lords. He was induced to believe that if the
                    Commons should reject the mutilated bill when it was returned to them, and the
                    ministry should consequently retire, the mutilated bill might be reintroduced
                    and passed by a Tory ministry. He was deaf to all representations of the state
                    of public opinion; and to the surprise of the ministry, and the terror and
                    indignation of every man of sense in the country, he rejected their proposal,
                    and accepted their resignation, May 9, 1832. The duke of Wellington undertook
                    the hoρeles3 task of constructing a ministry which should pass a restricted or
                    sham Reform Bill. The only man who could have made the success of such a
                    ministry even probable was Peel, and Peel’s conscience and good sense forbade
                    the attempt. He refused, and after a week of the profoundest agitation
                    throughout the country, the king, beaten and mortified, was forced to send for
                    Grey and Brougham. On being told that his consent to the creation of peers was
                    the only condition on which they could undertake the Government, he angrily and
                    reluctantly yielded. The chancellor, with cool forethought, demanded this
                    consent in writing. Grey thought such a demand harsh and unnecessary. “I
                    wonder,” he said to Brougham, when the interview was over, “you could have had
                    the heart to press it.” But Brougham was inexorable, and the king signed the
                    following paper :—“The king grants permission to Earl Grey, and to his
                    Chancellor, Lord Brougham, to create such a number of peers as will be
                    sufficient to ensure the passing of the Reform Bill, first calling up peers’
                    eldest sons.— <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi> R., Windsor, May 17, 1832.” This
                    brief paper may be called the Magna Charta of responsible government. It
                    established the right of a ministry to break down, by some convenient means, a
                    factious opposition in the Lords; and this right has never since been
                    practically disputed.</p>
                <p>Grey had now won the game. There was no danger that he would have to resort to
                    the expedient which he was authorized to employ. The introduction of sixty new
                    peers would have destroyed the opposition, but it would have been equivalent to
                    the abolition of the House. The king’s consent made known, a sufficient number
                    of peers were sure to withdraw to enable the bill to pass, and thus the dignity
                    of both king and peerage would be saved. The duke of Wellington headed this
                    movement on the part of the opposition; and the third reading of the bill was
                    carried in the Lords by a majority of 84.</p>
                <p>It is well known that in after years both Grey and Brougham disclaimed any
                    intention of executing their threat. If this were so, they must have merely
                    pretended to brave a danger which they secretly feared to face, and intended to
                    avoid; and the credit of rescuing the country would belong to the duke of
                    Wellington and the peers who seceded with him. To argue such cowardice in them
                    from statements made when the crisis was long pnst, and when they were naturally
                    willing to palliate the rough policy which they were forced to adopt, would be
                    to set up a needless and unjustifiable paradox. Nothing else in the career of
                    either Grey or Brougham leads us to suppose them capable of the moral baseness
                    of yielding up the helm of state, in an hour of darkness and peril, to reckless
                    and unskilled hands. Such would have been the result if they had lacked the
                    determination to carry out their programme to the end. The influence of every
                    statesman in the country would then have been extinguished, and the United
                    Kingdom would have been absolutely in the hands of O’Connell and Orator
                    Hunt.</p>
                <p>Grey took but little part in directing the legislation of the reformed
                    parliament. Never anxious for power, he had executed the arduous task of 1831-2
                    rather as a matter of duty than of inclination, and wished for an opportunity of
                    retiring. Such an opportunity very shortly presented itself. The Irish policy of
                    the ministry had not conciliated the Irish people, and O’Connell denounced them
                    with the greatest bitterness. On the renewal of the customary Coercion Bill, the
                    ministry was divided on the question whether to continue to the lord-lieutenant
                    the power of suppressing public meetings. Mr Littleton, the Irish secretary, was
                    for abolishing it; and with the view of conciliating O’Connell, he informed him
                    that the ministry intended to abandon it. But the result proved him to have been
                    mistaken, and O’Connell, with some reason supposing himself to have been duped,
                    called on Mr Littleton to resign his secretaryship. It had also transpired in
                    the discussion that Lord Althorp, the leader of the House of Commons, was
                    privately opposed to retaining those clauses which it was his duty to push
                    through the house. Lord Althorp therefore resigned, and Grey, who had lately
                    passed his seventieth year, took the opportunity of resigning also. It was his
                    opinion, it appeared, which had overborne the cabinet in favour of the public
                    meeting clauses; and his voluntary withdrawal enabled Lord Althorp to return to
                    his post, and to proceed with the bill in its milder form. Grey was succeeded by
                    Lord Melbourne; but no other change was made in the cabinet. Grey took no
                    further part in politics. During most of his remaining years he continued to
                    live in retirement at Howick, where he died on the 17th of July 1845, in his
                    eighty-second year. By his wife Mary Elizabeth, only daughter of the first Lord
                    Ponsonby, whom he married November 18, 1794, he became the father of ten sons
                    and five daughters, of whom eight sons and four daughters survived him.</p>
                <p>In public life, Grey could always be upon occasion bold, strenuous, and
                    self-sacrificing; but lie was little disposed for the active work of the
                    politician. He was not one of those who took the statesman’s duty “as a pleasure
                    he was to enjoy.” A certain stiffness and reserve ever seemed in the popular eye
                    to hedge him in; nor was his oratory of the kind which stirs enthusiasm and
                    delight. A tall, stately figure, fine voice, and calm aristocratic bearing
                    reminded the listener of Pitt rather than of Fox, and his speeches were
                    constructed on the Attic rather than the Asiatic model. Though simple and
                    straightforward, they never lack either point or dignity; and they were
                    admirably adapted to the audience to which they were addressed. The scrupulous
                    uprightness of Grey’s political and private character completed the ascendency
                    which he gained; and no politician could be named who, without being a statesman
                    of the highest class, has left a name more enviably placed in English history.
