                <p><label type="entry">GOZZOLI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Benozzo</hi></label>, an
                    eminent painter, was born in Florence in 1424, or perhaps 1420, and in the early
                    part of his career assisted Fra Angelico, whom he followed to Rome, and worked
                    with at Orvieto. While in Rome, he executed, in the Cappella at Araceli, a
                    fresco of St Anthony and Two Angels. In 1449 he left Angelico, and went to
                    Montefalco, near Foligno in Umbria. In S. Fortunato, near Montefalco, he painted
                    a Madonna and Child with Saints and Angels, and three other works. One of these,
                    the altar-piece representing St Thomas receiving the Girdle of the Virgin, is
                    now in the Lateran Museum, and shows the affinity of Gozzoli’s early style to
                    Angelico’s. He next painted in the monastery of St Francis, Montefalco, filling
                    the choir with a triple course of subjects from the life of the saint, with
                    various accessories, including heads of Dante, Petrarch, and Giotto. This work
                    was completed in 1452, and is still marked by the style of Angelico, crossed
                    here and there with a more distinctly Giottesque influence. In the same church,
                    in the chapel of St Jerome, is a fresco by Gozzoli of the Virgin and Saints, the
                    Crucifixion, and other subjects. He remained at Montefalco probably till 1456,
                    employing Mesastris as assistant. Thence he went to Perugia, and painted in a
                    church a Virgin and Saints, now in the local academy, and soon afterwards to his
                    native Florence, the headquarters of art. By the end of 1459 he had nearly
                    finished his important labour in the chapel of the Palazzo Riccardi, the Journey
                    of the Magi to Bethlehem, and, in the tribune of this chapel, a composition of
                    Angels <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n34/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0911-0034-0025"/> in a Paradise. His picture in the London
                    National Gallery, a Virgin and Child with Saints, 1461, belongs also to the
                    period of his Florentine sojourn. Another small picture in the same gallery, the
                    Rape of Helen, is of dubious authenticity. In 1464 Gozzoli left Florence for S.
                    Gemignano, where he executed some extensive works; in the church of St
                    Augustine, a composition of St Sebastian protecting the City from the Plague of
                    this same year, 1464; over the entire choir of the church, a triple course of
                    scenes from the legends of St Augustine, from the time of his entering the
                    school of Tegaste on to his burial, seventeen chief subjects, with some
                    accessories; in the Pieve di S. Gemignano, the Martyrdom of Sebastian, and other
                    subjects, and some further works in the city and its vicinity. Here his style
                    combined something of Lippo Lippi with its original elements, and he received
                    co-operation from Giusto d’Andrea. He stayed in this city till 1467, and then
                    began, in the Campo Santo of Pisa, from 1469, the vast series of mural paintings
                    with which his name is specially identified. These are twenty-four subjects from
                    the Old Testament, from the Invention of Wine by Noah to the Visit of the Queen
                    of Sheba to Solomon. He contracted to paint three subjects per year, for about
                    ten ducats each—a sum which maybe regarded as equivalent to £100 at the present
                    day. It appears, however, that this contract was not strictly adhered to, for
                    the actual rate of painting was only three pictures in two years. Perhaps the
                    great multitude of figures and accessories was accepted as a set-off against the
                    slower rate of production. By January 1470 he had executed the fresco of Noah
                    and his Family,—followed by the Curse of Ham, the Building of the Tower of Babel
                    (which contains portraits of Cosmo de’ Medici, the young Lorenzo, Poliziano, and
                    others), the Destruction of Sodom, the Victory of Abraham, the Marriages of
                    Rebecca and of Rachel, the Life of Moses, &lt;fcc, In the Cappella Ammannati,
                    facing a gate of the Campo Santo, he painted also an Adoration of the Magi,
                    wherein appears a portrait of himself. All this enormous mass of work, in which
                    Gozzoli was probably assisted by Zanobi Macchia velli, was performed, in
                    addition to several other pictures during his stay in Pisa (we need only specify
                    the Glory of St Thomas Aquinas, now in the Louvre), in sixteen years, lasting up
                    to 1485. This is the latest date which can with certainty be assigned to any
                    work from his hand, although he is known to have been alive up to 1496, if not
                    afterwards. In 1478 the Pisan authorities had given him, as a token of their
                    regard, a tomb in the Campo Santo. He had likewise a house of his own in Pisa,
                    and houses and land in Florence. In rectitude of life he is said to have been
                    worthy of his first master, Fra Angelico.</p>
                <p>The art of Gozzoli does not rival that of his greatest contemporaries either in
                    elevation or in strength, but is preeminently attractive by its sense of what is
                    rich, winning, lively, and abundant, in the aspects of men and things. His
                    landscapes, thronged with birds and quadrupeds, especially dogs, are more
                    varied, circumstantial, and alluring than those of any predecessor; his
                    compositions are crowded with figures, more characteristically true when happily
                    and gracefully occupied than when the demands of the subject require tragic or
                    dramatic intensity, or turmoil of action; his colour is bright, vivacious, and
                    festive. Gozzoli’s genius was, on the whole, more versatile and assimilative
                    than vigorously original; his drawing not free from considerable imperfections,
                    especially in the extremities and articulations, and in the perspective of his
                    gorgeously-schemed buildings. In fresco-painting he used the methods of tempera,
                    and the decay of his works has been severe in proportion. Of his untiring
                    industry the recital of his labours, and the number of works produced, are the
                    most forcible attestation.</p>
