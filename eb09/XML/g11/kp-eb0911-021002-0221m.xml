                    time and on its literature, was born of humble parents at Stradbrook in Suffolk
                    about the year 1175. All that is known of his early years is (from his own
                    account) that he studied the characters of the best men in the Scriptures, and
                    endeavoured to conform his actions to theirs. He was sent by his friends to
                    Oxford, where he studied law and medicine, and seems to have finished his
                    education at Paris, where he probably laid the foundation of his knowledge of
                    Greek and Hebrew. His first patron was William de Vere, bishop of Hereford, to
                    whom he was introduced by Giraldus Cambrensis, but who died in 1199, and thus
                    had little opportunity of assisting the young scholar. From Paris he returned to
                    Oxford, graduated in divinity, and became master of the schools <hi
                    rend="italic">(rector scolarunι)</hi> or chancellor. He also became the first
                    rector of the Franciscans at Oxford. Here he probably wrote his commentaries on
                    Aristotle, and laid the foundations of his fame as a preacher. His earliest
                    preferment of which we can speak with certainty was the archdeaconry of Wilts,
                    which he held in 1214 and 1220; he was archdeacon of Northampton in 1221,
                    holding at the same time the prebend of Empingham, which belonged to the
                    archdeaconry. This he exchanged for the archdeaconry of Leicester, which he
                    probably held till 1232. In May 1225 he was collated by Hugh de Wells, bishop of
                    Lincoln, to the church of Abbotsley, Hunts, and at one time he held the rectory
                    of St Margaret’s, Leicester. In 1231 he probably wrote his treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Cessatione Legalium</hi> with the view of
                    converting the Jews, for whose benefit the <hi rend="italic">Domus
                    conversorum</hi> was established in London this year. A fever in November 1232
                    induced him to resign all his preferments excepting his Lincoln prebend, and the
                    leisure he thus obtained was spent at Oxford, and probably employed in writing
                    his mathematical treatises and his theological <hi rend="italic">Dicta.</hi> On
                    the death of Bishop Hugh de Wells in February 1235, the chapter of Lincoln
                    elected Grosseteste to the see; the election took place on March 27, and he was
                    consecrated at Reading on June 17. His administration of his diocese <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi> then the most extensive in the country, was
                    characterized by great vigour. Within a year of his consecration he visited the
                    monasteries, removing seven abbots and four priors; and in 1238 he issued his
                    constitutions, embodying the points discussed at the great council of the Church
                    of England held in London in 1237, concerning which he had already written to
                    his archdeacons; at the same time, as diocesan of Oxford, he exercised a
                    watchful supervision over the university, protecting the scholars who were in
                    trouble for their attack on the legate Otho in 1238, and even entering into such
                    matters of detail as the place where the university chest should be kept. His
                    energy in his visitations did not pass without opposition; an attempt on his
                    life by poison was made in 1237, from which he recovered with difficulty through
                    the help of John de S. Giles; and in 1239 began the quarrel with the chapter of
                    Lincoln, which lasted six years, and was only quieted by the decision of the
                    pope himself. They claimed exemption from episcopal visitation, and spoke of the
                    bishop’s demanding what had never from the earliest times been the custom. He
                    would not tolerate an <hi rend="italic">imperium in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >imperio,</hi> a body of men joined by common interests, who declined to submit
                    to his jurisdiction, and who might be in need of visitation and correction as
                    much as any others. Full details are given in the bishop’s letters of the
                    progress of the quarrel; appeals to Canterbury and the Roman court were followed
                    by excommunications on both sides, the chapter even condescending to exhibit a
                    forged paper as to the history of the church and see of Lincoln. The question
                    was at length settled by a personal appeal to Pope Innocent IV. at Lyons. Tn a
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n222/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0222-0211"/> bull of August 25, 1245, he decided almost all
                    the points at issue in favour of the bishop, who lost no time in putting his
                    powers into execution. Of his own view of the matter a very curious
                    exemplification is given in the letter or pamphlet sent to the chapter (epist.
                    127), where his right to visit them is proved by all kinds of mystical arguments
                    and scriptural examples. In 1242, with the help of one Nicholas, a Greek, clerk
                    of the abbey of St Alban’s, he translated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Testamenta</hi><hi rend="italic">XII</hi><hi rend="italic">Patriarcharum,</hi>
                    which had been brought from Athens by John of Basingstoke. In 1243 occurred the
                    serious quarrel with the chapter of Canterbury (the see being practically
                    vacant, as Boniface was not yet consecrated) respecting the abbey of Bardney,
                    —the bishop deposing the abbot in spite of his appeal to Canterbury, and the
                    monks in an especially solemn manner excommunicating the bishop. On receiving
                    the letters from the convent, he threw them on the ground, in spite of the seal
                    containing the effigy of St Thomas, and paid no attention whatever to the
                    sentence. Both parties appealed to the pope, and an arrangement was made between
                    them. In 1244, being one of a committee of twelve chosen to determine what
                    answer should be given to the king’s demand of a subsidy, his influence kept the
                    members from being separately won over by the king’s endeavours to make parties
                    among them; and the council broke up without giving way to the royal demands.
                    The same year his examination of Robert Passelew, who through the king’s
                    influence had been elected bishop of Chichester, though utterly unfit, caused
                    the election to be annulled. On returning from Lyons we find Grosseteste
                    executing various commissions with which he was entrusted by the pope; urging on
                    the archbishop of York the claims of the bishop of Cervia; endorsing and sending
                    round the papal letter allowing Archbishop Boniface the revenues of all
                    benefices in his province that should fall vacant within the next seven years
                    till 10,000 marks should be collected, in order to free the see from its debts;
                    and insisting on the bishops paying the subsidy demanded by the pope, in spite
                    of the king’s opposition. In thi3 year (1245) he obtained a bull to prevent any
                    of the Oxford scholars graduating in arts without passing through the usual
                    examinations <hi rend="italic">secundum</hi><hi rend="italic">morem</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pamsieηsem,</hi> and without having been approved by the bishop
                    himself or one appointed by him. In 1247 he delivered an address vindicating the
                    genuineness of the relic (a portion of our Lord’s blood) presented by the king
                    to Westminster. His visitation of his diocese, especially of the monasteries in
                    it, and his superintendence of the studies of Oxford, which went on without
                    interruption during these years, while inducing others of the bishops to follow
                    his example, were not accomplished without serious troubles, embroiling him even
                    with the king. Thus, in 1250, his visitation having proved that many of the
                    religious houses had converted to their own uses certain possessions which
                    belonged to the parishes, which were thus impoverished and left without resident
                    priests, he procured a papal letter authorizing him to revoke what they had thus
                    obtained, citing all the beneficed monks in his diocese to hear the letter.
                    Those who had exemptions appealed to the pope, and Grosseteste again crossed the
                    sea to lay the case before him. But the gold of the religious orders had been at
                    Lyons before him, and the pope sent him away from his presence in confusion,
                    hopelessly exclaiming against the power of money at the Roman court. He was not,
                    however, downhearted, but busied himself in other affairs, and delivered before
                    the pope and certain cardinals his celebrated sermon on the abuses of the papal
                    court. Here he stayed till the end of September, and then returned in sad plight
                    to England, almost thinking of resigning his see in despair. But he soon
                    recovered from this, and pursued his visitation of the monasteries with still
                    greater vigour, so as to be accused by Matthew Paris of tyranny such as to make
                    him be thought, “not severe, but rather austere and inhuman.” In 1251 he was
                    suspended by the pope in consequence of his refusing to admit an Italian
                    ignorant of English to a rich benefice in his diocese. The suspension was short,
                    as he officiated at Hales this year, on the dedication of the church founded by
                    Richard of Cornwall, his position among the bishops being shown by his
                    celebrating mass at the high altar. In 1252 he obtained a papal letter
                    authorizing the appointment of vicars, and their payment out of the revenues of
                    their livings; and in the same year his influence kept the bishops together in
                    their resistance to the royal demands of a tenth of church revenues for three
                    years granted by the pope, nominally for the king’s necessities on his intended
                    crusade. He had also this year a calculation made of the revenues of the
                    foreigners in England, which amounted to more than 70,000 marks. In 1253 the
                    pope ordered him to induct by provision his nephew Frederick di Lavagna into a
                    canonry at Lincoln; the bishop’s answer to the requisition sent to the papal
                    commissioners (the archdeacon of Canterbury, and Innocent, the pope’s notary),
                    though of less importance than many of his other letters, has done more to make
                    his fame popular and permanent than any of his works. He is very decided in
                    refusing to institute the candidate from his unfitness, at the same time that he
                    expresses the utmost reverence for the pope and the Roman see. The letter made
                    the pope very angry, and he was only quieted by the advice of the cardinals, who
                    spoke in the highest terms of the bishop’s character and position. Grosseteste
                    was present at the parliament in May, when the violators of Magna Charta were
                    again excommunicated; not content with this, he had the sentence read in every
                    parish in the diocese of Lincoln. In October he fell ill at his manor of
                    Buckden, where he died on October 9th. He was buried on October 13th in Lincoln
                    Cathedral, the archbishop performing the service and many other bishops
                    assisting. Bells were said to have been heard in the air on the night of his
                    death, and miracles to have taken place at his tomb. The pope is said to have
                    expressed joy at his death, and to have desired to have his bones cast out of
                    the church. The story of the pope’s dream, that the bishop appeared to him and
                    struck him in such a manner as to cause his death, shows what the popular
                    estimation of the two was. It is perhaps not to be wondered at that the attempt
                    to procure the canonization of the bishop in 1307 failed.</p>
                <p>How great the personal influence of Bishop Grosseteste was may be chiefly learnt
                    from his letters: he was the instructor of the king <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.y.,</hi> in one of his letters on the value of the royal anointing), the
                    friend of the queen, the tutor of Simon de Montfort’s sons, his warner and
                    consoler at different times, the correspondent of Adam de Marisco, the referee
                    of many as to spiritual difficulties. Of those who speak of him, one is
                    especially struck by his courage, another by his universal knowledge, a third by
                    his subtlety in interpreting scripture, a fourth by his frequent preaching. Even
                    Matthew Paris, no favourable judge, warms into admiration in speaking of his
                    character <hi rend="italic">(Chrom</hi><hi rend="italic">Maj.</hi> V. p. 408).
                    The popularity of Grosseteste as an author is proved by the number of
                    manuscripts remaining of his works, and from the fact that very few writers for
                    the two centurie≡ following his death do not contain quotations from <hi
                    rend="italic">Lincolniensis.</hi> His determination to root out all abuses is
                    seen in his opposition to unjust demands of the king or the archbishop, to unfit
                    nominees of the pope, indeed to the whole system of papal provisions. That he
                    was of a hasty temper, and harsh and severe at times, is true; but no one ever
                    more thoroughly tried to do his duty, probably few have effected more.</p>
