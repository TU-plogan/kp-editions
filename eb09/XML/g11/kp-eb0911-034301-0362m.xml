                    mechanics. On leaving college at the age of sixteen he became a law student in
                    the university of Dijon, and after three years he was sent to Paris to acquire a
                    knowledge of practice at the bar. He obtained in his twenty-fourth year the
                    office of advocate-general in the parliament of Dijon, of which he fulfilled the
                    duties till 1782. Before long, piqued by a slighting remark of Dr Chardenon of
                    Dijon, made in reply to a criticism at the close of a lecture on chemistry, De
                    Morveau set himself to acquire a thorough knowledge of that science. With
                    “practice for his master, and melted crucibles and retorts for tutors,” as he
                    once observed to Baumé, he speedily obtained such a mastery over his subject as
                    to draw from Chardenon the public acknowledgment that he was “born to be an
                    honour to chemistry.” In 1772 he published at Dijon the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Digressions</hi><hi rend="italic">Academiques,</hi> in which were set forth his
                    views with respect to phlogiston and the phenomena of crystallization; and in
                    1773 he discovered the efficacy of hydrochloric acid gas as an atmospheric
                    disinfectant. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> He was the means, in 1774, of
                    founding in Dijon courses of public lectures on mineralogy, materia medica, and
                    chemistry, the last of which he himself during thirteen years gratuitously
                    delivered. It would appear that his fellow-citizens were as yet far from holding
                    exalted views with regard to the prerogatives of science. Accusing him of
                    “presumptuously disarming the hand of the Supreme Being,” they about this time
                    sought to destroy his lightning conductors at the house of the academy, and were
                    restrained from carrying out their intentions only by the assurance of M. Maret,
                    the secretary of that institution, “that the astonishing virtue of the apparatus
                    resided in the gilded point, which had purposely been sent from Rome by the Holy
                    Father.” In 1777-78 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Piemens</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">Chymie</hi><hi rend="italic">Théorique et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pratique</hi> (3 vols. 12mo) of De Morveau, Maret, and Durande, a
                    work highly appreciated by their contemporaries. The chemical articles in vol.
                    i. of the section “Chymie, Pharmacie, et Metallurgie” of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopédie Méthodique</hi> (1786), as also some few of those of vol. ii.
                    (1792), were from the pen of De Morveau. Of these the longest is a masterly
                    exposition of the facts and conclusions that had up to that time been arrived at
                    by chemists on the subject of acids.</p>
                <p>De Morveau’s first essay on a new chemical nomenclature, the origin of the
                    present system, was published in the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Physique</hi>
                    for May 1782, and was the subject of much adverse criticism. Repairing to Paris,
                    the author successfully met the objections of his opponents; and in 1787, in
                    conjunction with Lavoisier, Berthollet, and Fourcroy, he published <hi
                    rend="italic">Méthode d'une</hi><hi rend="italic">Nomenclature</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Chimique,</hi> the principles of which were speedily adopted by
                    chemists throughout Europe. Constantly in communication with the leaders of the
                    Lavoisierian school of chemistry in Paris, which he frequently visited, De
                    Morveau soon became convinced of the untenableness of the old phlogistic
                    doctrines, his reasons for renouncing which are stated in his volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopédie Méthodique,</hi> p. 625, <hi rend="italic">sqq.</hi>
                    With Lavoisier, Laplace, Monge, Berthollet, and</p>
                <p>Fourcroy, he in 1788 produced a French translation of Kirwan’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay on Phlogiston,</hi> with annotations effectually disposing of the
                    author’s arguments against the new chemistry. The first manufactory of carbonate
                    of soda in France was established by De Morveau in 1783. In 1791 he represented
                    the department of Côte d ’ Or in the Legislative Assembly, and next year in the
                    National Convention, of which he was re-elected a member in 1795. Having already
                    become famous for aeronautical experiments at Dijon in 1783-84, he was appointed
                    in 1794 to superintend the construction of balloons for military purposes (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Aeronautics,</hi> vol. i. p. 199). About the same time he
                    rendered important service to his country by perfecting the processes for the
                    manufacture of gunpowder and saltpetre. In 1796 De Morveau was made a member of
                    the Institute. He retired from political life in 1797, and in 1798 became
                    provisional director of the Polytechnic School, in the foundation of which he
                    had been actively concerned. He held during 1800-14 the appointment of master of
                    the mint, received in 1803 the cross of the legion of honour, and was made in
                    1805 an officer of the same order, and in 1811 a baron of the French empire. He
                    died January 2, 1816.</p>
