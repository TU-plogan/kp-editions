                    return to Paris in 1784, he never definitely adopted the profession of a
                    painter. In 1792 he was chosen a captain in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chasseurs</hi><hi rend="italic">républicains,</hi> and served on the staff of
                    General Custine. His promotion rapidly followed, and in the course of two years
                    he had become a general of division. In 1796 he commanded the centre division of
                    Moreau’s army in the campaign of the Rhine, and by coolness and sagacity greatly
                    aided him in his brilliant defence against superior numbers, and in his
                    subsequent celebrated retreat. In 1798 he was appointed to the command of the
                    army of Italy, the officers of which had revolted against their general Massena,
                    and he was speedily successful in obtaining the complete reestablishment of
                    discipline. In the following year he commanded the left wing of Jourdan’s army
                    in Germany; but when Jourdan was succeeded by Massena, he joined the army of
                    Moreau in Italy, where, in face of great difficulties, he was not only
                    completely successful in his defensive tactics, but gained, on the 13th
                    December, an important victory at Albano. When Moreau, in 1800, was appointed to
                    the command of the army of the Rhine, Gouvion St Cyr was named his first
                    lieutenant, and on the 9th May gained a victory over General Kray at Biberach.
                    In 1801 he was sent to Spain to command the army intended for the invasion of
                    Portugal, and was named grand officer of the legion of honour. When a treaty of
                    peace was shortly afterwards concluded with Portugal, he succeeded Lucien
                    Bonaparte as ambassador at Madrid. In 1803 he was appointed to the command of an
                    army corps in Italy, and he gained in 1805 a victory over the Austrians at
                    Castel Franco. He took part in the Prussian and Polish campaigns of 1807, and in
                    1808 he commanded an army corps with some success in Catalonia; but, not wishing
                    to comply with certain orders he received from Paris, he resigned his command,
                    and remained in disgrace till 1811. On the opening of the Russian campaign he
                    received command of the 6th army corps, and on the 7th August 1812 obtained a
                    victory over the Russians at Polosk, in recognition of which he was created a
                    marshal of France. He distinguished himself at the battle of Dresden, 26th and
                    27th August 1813, but, after a stubborn resistance, capitulated there to the
                    allies on the 11th November following, and remained for some time a prisoner in
                    Hungary. On the restoration of the Bourbons he was created a peer of France, and
                    in July 1815 was appointed war minister, but resigned his office in the November
                    following. In June 1817 he was appointed minister of marine, and in September
                    following again resumed<pb break="no"

                    discharge till November 1819. He died 17th March 1830. Gouvion St Cyr was a
                    prudent and cautious rather than a brilliant general, but he would doubtless
                    have obtained better opportunities of acquiring distinction had he shown himself
                    more blindly devoted to the interests of Napoleon.</p>
