                    Sea-bird, the <hi rend="italic">Colymbus</hi><hi rend="italic">troile</hi> of
                    Linnaeus and the <hi rend="italic">Uria troile</hi> of Latham, which nowadays it
                    seems seldom if ever to bear among those who, from their vocation, are most
                    conversant with it, though, according to Willughby and Ray his translator, it
                    was°in their time so called “by those of Northumberland and Durham.” Around the
                    coasts of Britain it is variously known as the Frowl, Kiddaw or Skiddaw, Langy
                    <hi rend="italic">(ef.</hi> Icelandic, <hi rend="italic">Langula),</hi> Lavy,
                    Marrock, Murre, Scout (cf. <hi rend="smallcaps">Coot,</hi> vol. vi. p. 341),
                    Scuttock, Strany, Tinker or Tinkershire, and Willock. The number of local names
                    testifies to the abundance of this bird, at least of old time, in different
                    places, but it should be observed that in certain districts some of them are the
                    common property of this species and the Razor-bill. In former days the Guillemot
                    yearly frequented the cliffs on many parts of the British coasts in countless
                    multitudes, and this is still the case in the northern parts of the United
                    Kingdom; but more to the southward nearly all its smaller settlements have been
                    rendered utterly desolate by the wanton and cruel destruction of their tenants
                    during the breeding season, and even the inhabitants of those which were more
                    crowded had become so thinned that, but for the intervention of the Sea Birds
                    Preservation Act (32 and 33 Vict. cap. 17), which provided under penalty for the
                    safety of this and certain other species at the time of year when they were most
                    exposed to danger, they would unquestionably by this time have been exterminated
                    so far as England is concerned. The slaughter, which, before the passing of that
                    Act, took place annually on the cliffs of the Isle of Wight, near Flamborough
                    Head, and at such other stations frequented by this species and its allies the
                    Razor-bill and Puffin, and the Kittiwake-Gull, as could be easily reached by
                    excursionists from London and the large manufacturing towns, was in the highest
                    degree brutal. No use whatever could be made of the bodies of the victims, which
                    indeed those who indulged in their massacre were rarely at the trouble to pick
                    out of the water; the birds shot were all engaged in breeding; and most of them
                    had young, which of course starved to death through the destruction of their
                    parents, intercepted in the performance of the most sacred duty of nature, and
                    butchered to gratify the murderous lust of those who sheltered themselves under
                    the name of “sportsmen.”</p>
                <p>Part of the Guillemot’s history is still little understood. We know that it
                    arrives at its wonted breeding stations on its accustomed day in spring, that it
                    remains there till, towards the end of summer, its young are hatched and able,
                    as they soon are, to encounter the perils of a seafaring life, when away go all,
                    parents and progeny. After that time it commonly happens that a few examples are
                    occasionally met with in bays and shallow waters. Tempestuous weather will drive
                    ashore a large number in a state of utter destitution—many of them indeed are
                    not unfrequently washed up dead—but what becomes of the bulk of the birds, not
                    merely the comparatively few thousands that are natives of Britain, but the tens
                    and hundreds of thousands, not to say millions, that are in summer denizens of
                    more northern latitudes, no one can yet say. This mystery is not peculiar to the
                    Guillemot, but is shared by all the <hi rend="italic">Alcidae</hi> that inhabit
                    the Atlantic Ocean. Examples stray every season across the Bay of Biscay, are
                    found off the coasts of Spain and Portugal, enter the Mediterranean and <pb

                    may even touch the Madeiras, Canaries, or Azores; but these bear no proportion
                    whatever to the mighty hosts of whom they are literally the “scouts,” and whose
                    position and movements they no more reveal than do the vedettes of a
                    well-appointed army. The common Guillemot of both sides of the Atlantic is
                    replaced further northward by a species with a stouter bill, the <hi
                    rend="italic">U. arra</hi> or <hi rend="italic">U. bruennichi</hi> of
                    ornithologists, and on the west coast of North America by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >U. californica.</hi> The habits of all these are essentially the same, and the
                    structural resemblance between all of them and the Auks is so great that of late
                    several systematists have relegated them to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alea,</hi> confining the genus <hi rend="italic">Uria</hi> to the Guillemots of
                    another group, of which the type is the <hi rend="italic">U. grylla,</hi> the
                    Black Guillemot of British authors, the Dovekey or Greenland Dove of sailors,
                    the Tysty of Shetlanders. This bird assumes in summer an entirely black plumage
                    with the exception of a white patch on each wing, while in winter it is
                    beautifully marbled with white and black. Allied to it as species or
                    geographical races are the <hi rend="italic">U. maηdti,</hi><hi rend="italic">U.
                    columba,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">U. carbo.</hi> All these differ from the
                    larger Guillemots by laying two or three eggs, which are generally placed in
                    some secure niche, while the members of the other group lay but a single egg,
                    which is invariably exposed on a bare ledge. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.
