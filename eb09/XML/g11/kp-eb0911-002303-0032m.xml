                    novelist and play writer, wa3 born at Marseilles in 1803, and died in 1866. When
                    he was still a boy, his father, who had made a large fortune as a ship-broker,
                    met with adverse circumstances, and Léon, before completing his education, had
                    to go to sea in order to earn a living. He went several trading voyages to
                    Algiers <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n33/mode/1up"

                    profit. In the meantime his literary tastes gradually developed, and he
                    abandoned mercantile pursuits for the modest employment of a teacher in
                    Marseilles. He, however, did not remain long there, and in 1828 we find him in
                    Paris, determined to run the risks of literary life. His townsman, Joseph Méry,
                    who was then making himself famous by his political satires, smoothed his way,
                    and introduced him to several newspapers. But Gozlan did not sacrifice
                    literature to politics. Though he contributed many essays to the reviews, it is
                    as a fertile and ingenious author of novels and plays that he is best known. His
                    first novel was <hi rend="italic">Les Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">Tun</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Apothicaire</hi> (1828), and this was followed by numberless
                    others, among which may be mentioned <hi rend="italic">Le Notaire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Chantilly, Aristide Froissart</hi> (one of the most curious and
                    celebrated of his productions), <hi rend="italic">Les Nuits</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du</hi><hi rend="italic">Père-Lachaise, Le</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    principal works for the theatre are— <hi rend="italic">La Goutte de Lait, La
                    Pluie et le beau temps, Le Lion empaille, Pied-de-Fer, Louise de Nanteuil, Le

                    adaptations of several of his own novels to the stage. Gozlan also wrote a
                    romantic and picturesque description of the old manors and mansions of his
                    country, entitled <hi rend="italic">Les</hi><hi rend="italic">Châteaux</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de France,</hi> 4 vols. (1844), and a biographical essay on the
                    great novelist Balzac (1861). He was made a member of the legion of honour in
                    1846, and in 1859 an officer of that order. Louis Huart has published a sketch
                    of his life.</p>
                <p>Of the many novels which uninterruptedly dropped, as it were, from Gozlan’s pen
                    during a period of thirty-eight years, very few have the qualities which commend
                    a work of fiction to posterity; but nearly all are pleasant to read, and some
                    will no doubt survive as an interesting and lively picture of French manners
                    during the first half of this century. He holds an honourable place in the
                    second rank of French novelists.</p>
