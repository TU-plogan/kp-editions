                    >Guatimala</hi></label>, was formerly a captain-generalcy of Spanish America,
                    which included the fifteen provinces of Chiapas, Suchitepeques, Escuintla,
                    Sonsonate, San Salvador, Vera Paz and Peten, Chiquimula, Honduras, Nicaragua,
                    Costa Rica, Totonicapan, Quesaltenango, Solola, Chimaltenango, and
                    Sacatepeques,— or, in other words, the whole of Central America and part of the
                    present territory of Mexico. The name is now restricted to a small part of the
                    area which constitutes an independent republic.</p>
                <p>The republic of Guatemala is situated between 13° 42' and 18° N. lat., and
                    between 88° and 93° 5" W. long. Conterminous on the N. with Mexico and Yucatan,
                    it is bounded towards the E. and S.E. by Belize or British Honduras, the Gulf of
                    Honduras, and the republics of Honduras and San Salvador; and towards the S.W.
                    it is washed by the Pacific. The Yucatan frontier is only partially fixed, and
                    though the Mexican frontier was nominally determined as early as 1772, the
                    interpretation of the terms of the agreement is still open to much debate.<note

                    length in <hi rend="italic">Bοletin de lα Sociedad de Geografia Mexicana,</hi>
                    1875.</p></note> Towards British Honduras the boundary is fixed by the treaty of
                    April 30, 1858, according to which it runs up the mid-channel of the river
                    Sarstoon to the Gracias a Dios Falls, thence in a right line to Garbutt’s Falls
                    on the river Belize, and thence again in a right line due north to the Mexican
                    frontier. The area of Guatemala is estimated at from 40,000 to over 50,000
                    square miles; an accurate statement is impossible, not only on account of the
                    dubiety of frontier, but from the fact that the surveys are very imperfect. All
                    the maps of the country contain a great deal of hypothetical material,
                    especially in the filling up of the orographical details.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mountains.—</hi> A large proportion of Guatemala may be
                    generally described as mountainous. The main or central chain, which is usually
                    considered a continuation of the Andes, runs in a wavy line from south-east to
                    north-west, keeping on the whole parallel with the Pacific coast at a distance
                    of 40 or 45 miles. Its mean elevation is about 7000 feet, but none of its
                    summits attain to 14,000. Though it forms the main watershed of the country
                    between the Pacific and the Atlantic versant or slope, it is pierced in one or
                    two places by rivers. In the neighbourhood of the capital it bears the name of
                    Sierra de las Nubes; in the north-west it is known as the Sierra Madre; and it
                    enters the Mexican (ex-Guatemalian) state of Chiapas as the mountains of
                    Istatan. A range called the Sierra de Chama, which, however, changes its name
                    frequently from place to place, strikes eastward from the Sierra Madre towards
                    Belize, where it is known as the Cockscomb; another similar range, the Sierra de
                    Santa Cruz, continues east to Cape Cocoli between the Rio Dulce and the
                    Sarstoon; and a third, the Sierra de las Minas or in its eastern portion Sierra
                    del Mico stretches between the Rio Dulce and the Rio Motagua. Between Honduras
                    and Guatemala the frontier is formed by the Sierra de Copan. There are no real
                    plateaus in Guatemala such as give its character to the Mexican region, the
                    so-called plateaus of Quesaltenango, Pacicia, Guatemala, &amp;c., being merely
                    broad valleys amid the mountains; but the general relief of the country is of
                    the most varied description, the mountains <pb break="no"

                    underfalls. The number of volcanic summits is very great: Bernouilli gives a
                    list of 14 or 15, and Foledo makes the number no less than 31. The following are
                    those that are decidedly active :—Pacaya, in 14° 21' 30" N. lat. and 90° 44' 34"
                    E. long., on the southern shores of lake Amatitlan, withits cone on the southern
                    slope; Volcan de Fuego, 12,821 feet in height, in 14° 27' 25" N. lat. and 90°
                    53' 30" E. long., near Old Guatemala; Atitlan, 11,849 feet in height, in 14° 36'
                    N. lat. and 91° 14' E. long.; Quesaltenango, 9358 feet in height, in 14° 53' 30"
                    N. lat. and 91° 53' 30" E. long.; and Tajumulco, in 15° 9' 58" N. lat. and 92°
                    6' 7" E. long. The last was observed in eruption by Bernouilli on occasion of
                    the great earthquake of 1863. Like Quesaltenango, which is surrounded by an
                    extensive <hi rend="italic">malpais</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> it
                    furnishes great supplies of sulphur. More famous, however, than any of these is
                    the Volcan de Agua or Water Volcano, so called because in 1541 it destroyed the
                    city of Old Guatemala by a deluge of water. It is situated in 14° 26' 48" N.
                    lat. and 90° 53' 30" E. long. The statement of Humboldt that it rises above the
                    snow-line is a mistake, for that would be a height of about 14,500 feet, whereas
                    the actual height of the mountain, according to Poggendorffs revision of Captain
                    Hall’s trigonometrical measurement, is only 13,108 feet. When Dr Scherzer and Dr
                    Wagner ascended the mountain on August 4, 1854, they found no traces of snow or
                    ice, and though three weeks later a thin coating of snow appeared on the outer
                    slopes of the crater, it was gone again in four days. The source of the great
                    flood of water was probably a crateral lake.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    richly watered. On the western side of the sierras the versant is short, and the
                    streams, while very numerous, are consequently small and rapid; but on the
                    eastern side a number of the rivers attain a very considerable development. The
                    Motagua, whose principal head stream is called the Rio Grande, has a course of
                    about 250 miles, and is navigable to within 90 miles of the capital, which is
                    situated on one of its confluents the Rio de las Vacas. It forms a delta on the
                    south of the Gulf of Honduras. Of similar importance is the Polochic, which is
                    about 180 miles in length, and navigable about 20 miles above the river-port of
                    Telemân. Before reaching the Golfo Amatico it passes through the Izabal Lake and
                    the Golfete Dulce. A vast number of streams, among which are the Chisoy, the
                    Guadalupe, the Rio de la Pasion, unite to form the Usumacinta, whose noble
                    current passes along the Mexican frontier, and flowing on through Chiapas and
                    Tabasco, falls into the bay of Campeachy. The Chiapas follows a similar
                    course.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lakes.—</hi> There are several extensive lakes in Guatemala.
                    The Lake of Peten or Laguna de Flores, in the centre of the department of Peten,
                    is an irregular basin about 27 miles long, with an extreme breadth of 13. In an
                    island in the western portion stands Flores the capital of the department, well
                    known to American antiquaries for the number of ancient idols which have been
                    recovered from its soil. On the shore of the lake is the stalactite cave of
                    Jobitsinal, of great local celebrity; and in its depths, according to the
                    popular legend, may still be discerned the stone image of a horse that belonged
                    to Cortes. The Lake of Izabal, already mentioned as the terminus of the Polochic
                    river, is about 36 miles long, and would be of considerable value as a harbour
                    if the bar at the mouth of the Rio Dulce did not prevent the upward passage of
                    seafaring vessels. As a contrast the Lake of Atitlan is a land-locked basin
                    encompassed with lofty mountains and possessing no visible outlet for its
                    waters, which are replenished by numerous streams. It is about 18 miles long,
                    with a maximum breadth of 9 or 10 miles, and it lies about 5300 feet above the
                    sea-level. “On its banks,” says Mr Boddam Whetham, “stand eleven villages, whose
                    situations are so varied that their climates and productions are those of the
                    cold, the temperate, and the tropical regions, and whose inhabitants speak
                    different dialects.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    <hi rend="italic">Across Central America,</hi> 1877, p. 103.</p></note> About 8
                    or 9 miles south of the capital lies the Lake of Amatitlan, with the town of the
                    same name at its western extremity. It lies about 3980 feet above the sea, and
                    has a length of 9 miles and a breadth of about 3. On the borders of San Salvador
                    and Guatemala there is the lake of Guija, about 20 miles long and 12 broad, at a
                    height of 2100 feet above the sea. It is connected by the river Ostuma with the
                    Lake of Ayarza which lies about 1000 feet higher at the foot of the Andes. The
                    large lakes, according to Doll fus, are not of crateral origin.</p>

                    account of the geology of the country is given by Dollfus and Montserrat,<note

                    exploration of the Mexican region. According to these savants, who, however,
                    confess that their studies are only provisional, the basis rock is the granite
                    which, along with trachytes and porphyries of very various character,
                    intermingled with and overlaid by directly volcanic products, constitutes the
                    great band of the Sierra Madre. From the main ridge towards the Atlantic there
                    is a rich development of mica schists and calcareous formations of sedimentary
                    origin and probably Jurassic age, while the versant of the Pacific is almost
                    covered with modern alluvium washed down along the rapid slopes. Mastodont and
                    elephant remains have been discovered in the tuffs. The country as a whole may
                    be said to owe its shape to the porphyries. Though some of the strata are
                    essentially metal liferous, Guatemala possesses few mines of importance. During
                    the Spanish rule about 40 million pesos of silver were obtained at Alotepeque in
                    Chiquimula; and the works are still carried on, though with poorer results. Lead
                    is found extensively in Huehuetenango and Verapaz; beds of excellent coal exist
                    in Izabal; marble is quarried at San Juan in Guatemala, and on the Rio Hondo in
                    Zacapa; and lithographic stone is met with in the last-mentioned department.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> Except in the marshy lagoons along the Pacific,
                    which are inhabited by groups of fishers and salt-gatherers, the climate of
                    Guatemala is considered a healthy one. The peculiar relief of the country gives
                    rise to a large amount of local differences in the matter of heat and cold; but
                    the whole may be rudely divided into a tropical or low-lying region, a temperate
                    or middle region, and a cold or elevated region. The tropical region, or <hi
                    rend="italic">tierra cal·iente,</hi> extends from the level of the sea to an
                    elevation of about 1300 feet; the temperate, or <hi rend="italic">tierra
                    templada,</hi> from 1300 to 4900 feet; and the cold, or <hi rend="italic">tierra
                    fria,</hi> from 4900 to 8200 feet. Fortunately for the future of Guatemala the
                    templada is by far the most extensive. In the caliente the rainy season lasts
                    four months. During that period the south-west wind prevails, and is often
                    tempestuous like the Cordonazo de San Francisco, or “flagellation of St
                    Francis,” on the coast of Mexico; during the dry season the north wind is the
                    most usual. The rainy season lengthens as we ascend to the templada: the Boca
                    Costa district indeed has a rainy season of seven months, from May to November,
                    and the dry season is not completely dry. Higher still, in the tierra fria, the
                    rain lasts five months, from May to October, and the dry season is quite worthy
                    of the name. At Guatemala, the only place where meteorological observations have
                    been made through a long series of years, the minimum thermometer readings
                    varied from 41° to 45° Fahr, in the five years 1859 to 1863, and the maximum
                    from 84° to 87°.</p>

                <p>The hottest months are April and May. In the summer, or rainy season, the morning
                    has usually a clear sky; about 2 or 3 o’clock in the afternoon the clouds begin
                    to gather in great cumulus masses; suddenly the lightning flashes out and the
                    rain crashes down; and by evening the sky is clear and starry. In the middle of
                    the rainy season there is often a pause of two or three weeks. At Guatemala the
                    mean annual rainfall for the five years 1859 to 1863 was 54 inches; at Boca
                    Costa it is upwards of 78 inches.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    numerous that villages have sometimes had to be left to their undisputed
                    occupancy. For the bird collector there is a rich harvest in Guatemala. As the
                    seasons change it is visited by a great variety of birds of passage, and it
                    possesses a great many resident species besides. In the city of Coban there are
                    several families which live by preparing bird-skins for sale and expoιt
                    (Bernouilli). From forty to fifty species of birds of prey are already known;
                    among which it is sufficient to mention <hi rend="italic">Corogyps</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">atratus,</hi> the commonest of the vultures, which acts as a

                    continent nor the great eagles of the northern are known in Guatemala. Of the
                    great passerine order there are upwards of 400 species, including 36 species of
                    humming-birds, 13 of woodpeckers, and 8 of the trogons. One of this last genus,
                    the quetzal, quijal, or quesal <hi rend="italic">(Trogon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >resplendens)</hi> is of special note, not only from the fact that its yellow
                    tail-feathers, 2 feet long, were formerly worn as insignia by the Indian
                    princes, but because it has been adopted as the emblematical figure on the
                    national arms of Guatemala. The gallinaceous order is well represented, and
                    comprises several peculiar species, as the pavo de cacho, and the Peten turkey
                    <hi rend="italic">(Meleagris ocellata),</hi> which has a bronze sheen on its
                    plumage; and the palmipeds, it is almost needless to add, are unusually numerous
                    in a country so richly furnished with lagoons and rivers and lakes.</p>
                <p>There are two species of alligator, one in the Pacific and the other in the
                    Atlantic versant. Snakes are met with in great variety, but only about a fourth
                    of the species are venomous, and even the bite of the rattlesnake is said to be
                    less deadly than in the north. The <hi rend="italic">Crotalus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">horridus</hi> is one of the most common. Five species of
                    salamanders are known, 9 of the frogs, and 5 of the toads. Fourteen species of
                    fish have been found in Lake Peten, 7 in Lake Amatitlan, 13 in the river
                    Motagua, 10 in the Polochic, and 13 in the (Jsumacinta.</p>

                    Ants are common, and may sometimes be seen marching in a column 3 or 4 miles
                    long. Mosquitoes unfortunately are in several districts equally abundant.</p>
                <p>Most of the domestic animals of Guatemala—the horse, the ox, the goat, the sheep,
                    the pig, the dog, the rabbit, the common fowl, the peacock, and the pigeon—are
                    of European origin, and are popularly grouped together as <hi rend="italic"

                    excellent. Cattle are largely imported from Soconuseo and Honduras. The
                    favourite swine is the black. Singing-birds are commonly kept in the Guatemalian
                    houses, and the species most sought after are the sensontle, the guarda-barranco
                    <hi rend="italic">(Myiadestes</hi><hi rend="italic">obscurus),</hi> the
                    pitureal, and the caraban. The last of these is as good as a watch-dog, as “no

                    most for Guatemalian exploration are Sahin, Morelet, Sumichrast, Bocourt, Salle,

                    judged from the description of the configuration of the country and its climate
                    the natural productions of Guatemala are sufficiently varied. Foledo gives a
                    list of upwards of 100 kinds of timber trees. Maize and haricot beans (frijol),
                    which form the main sustenance of the people, are grown in all the departments,
                    and in some places there are two harvests a year. Rice and wheat are less
                    extensively distributed. For the foreign trade the coffee plant is the most
                    important product. While in 1859 the whole export was only 390 cwt., by 1876 it
                    had increased to upwards of 185,200 cwt. Meanwhile the cultivation of indigo
                    (aħil or jiquilite) and cochineal, which were forjnerly the principal sources of
                    wealth, is losing ground. Cocoa is most cultivated in the north-west; the nibs
                    are used as small change throughout the country. Good tobacco is grown, but the
                    quantity is small. Sugar is rising into favour. Vanilla, chile, aloes, agave,
                    rhubarb, ipecacuanha, castor oil, scammony, and colocynth are all obtained in
                    the country. The absence of capitalists is one of the chief hindrances to the
                    development of industry and trade.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The constitution of Guatemala is
                    republican and representative. The council of state consists of 24 members
                    elected by the house of representatives, which consists of 52 members elected by
                    the people. The parliamentary period, and the term of office for the president,
                    who is the head of the executive, is four years. The revenue, which in 1874
                    amounted to 2,601,000 dollars or £520,000, is mainly derived from import duties,
                    domains, and monopolies; a large part of the expenditure, 2,542,600 dollars or
                    £508,520, is occasioned by the army, which has a nominal strength of 3000,
                    besides a militia of 13,000. The public debt, including the English loan of
                    £500,000 raised in 1859, amounted in 1875 to 4,363,227 dollars or £872,645.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion and Education.—</hi> The national religion is the
                    Roman Catholic, but there is absolute toleration of other creeds. The Government
                    pays a regular subvention to the church. In the 17 vicariates into which the
                    countιy is divided there are 111 parishes. Since the rise of the liberal
                    government great progress has been made in educational matters. In 1871 there
                    were 253 schools, with 6130 male and 1944 female pupils; by 1874 the schools had
                    increased to 541, the male pupils to 14,216, and the female to 6312.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> Out of the total population of 1,200,000 it
                    is calculated that about 720,000 are Indians, 300,000 Ladinos, and 180,000
                    whites. According to Foledo (1874) the foreigners did not exceed 829,—of whom
                    191 were Mexicans, 164 Spaniards, 103 Frenchmen, 71 Italians, 64 Germans, and 50
                    Englishmen. The native population is naturally of a quiet and inoffensive
                    disposition. Crimes of violence are rare. A certain easy fatalism is the
                    prevailing mood; but during political excitement it gives way to fanatical
                    outbursts. “Viva la relijion, y mueran los estranjeros” ⅛ then the cry. Cock
                    fighting and bull baiting are the favourite amusements.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roads.—</hi> The means of communication between one part of the
                    country and another are very poor. In the whole republic it was calculated that
                    in 1874 there were 1365 miles of carriageable roads, and the number of bridges
                    was stated at 432. But a great proportion of the roads, while hardly passable in
                    the dry season, become little better than mitigated swamps in the rainy season;
                    and many <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n254/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0254-0241"/><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the bridges are of the
                    slightest construction and in a pitiable state of repair. Nearly a week is the
                    time taken by the ordinary waggons to accomplish the journey from San José to
                    Escuintla, a distance of about 90 miles. According to the terms of a contract
                    with the Government, a railroad between San José and Escuintla was begun in
                    1875, but it is still uncompleted. The telegraph has been more extensively
                    introduced. In 1874 there were in all ten lines, with 398 miles in operation and
                    511 in course of construction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Harbours.—</hi> The country is poorly furnished with
                    ports,—Izabal, Santo Tomas, Livingston, Gualan, and Panzos exhausting the list
                    on the Atlantic; and San José, Barra de los Esclavos, Tecojale, San Geronimo,
                    San Luis, and Champerico that on the Pacific. Izabal, situated in 15° 24' N.
                    lat. and 89° 9' W. long., is of little use, as it is separated from the sea by
                    the bar of the Rio Dulce. Santo Tomas, in 15° 38' 3" N. lat. and 88° 36' 6" W.
                    long., has a fine position at the southern extremity of the Golfo Amatico, which
                    is at once spacious and well protected. Livingston is at the mouth of the Rio
                    Dulce, in 15° 48' N. lat. and 88° 46' W. long. Gualan is a river port in the
                    Motagua, and Panzos lies below Teleman on the Polochic. Of the Pacific ports San
                    José is the most noteworthy as the usual landing-place for strangers on their
                    way to the capital. It is situated in 13° 56' N. lat. and 90° 42' W. long. A
                    fine pier was built in 1868, but vessels have usually to anchor about a mile
                    out, and the roadstead is not very secure. Champerico, opened to foreign trade
                    in 1870, is also a simple roadstead. It is situated in the department of
                    Suchitepequez, in 14° 17' N. lat. and 91° 57' W. long. Istapa, formerly the
                    principal port on the north coast, has been almost abandoned since 1853.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities.—</hi> Though it has no ancient remains so
                    remarkable as those of Copan in Honduras, or Palenque in Chiapas, Guatemala
                    preserves many traces of its earlier inhabitants. A careful summary of what is
                    known in regard to them is given in Bancroft’s <hi rend="italic">Native Races of
                    the</hi><hi rend="italic">Pacifie</hi><hi rend="italic">States of North
                    America,</hi> vol. iv. On the left bank of the Montagua are the ruins of an
                    ancient city visited in 1840 by Mr Catherwood and in 1854 by Dr Scherzer. They
                    resemble the ruins of Copan, and contain mounds, terraces, colossal heads,
                    idols, pillars, and altars. Ruins are also to be seen at Chapuleo and Chinamita
                    in the same valley, at Cinaca Mecallo, and at the hacienda of Carrizal about 20
                    miles north of Guatemala. A few leagues to the west are the ruins of Mexico with
                    a vast cave divided into chambers. An ancient aqueduct is mentioned at Rosario,
                    8 or 10 miles south of Lake Amatitlan and another at the foot of the Volcan de
                    Fuego. Sololâ is said to occupy the site of Tecpan Atitlan; and in the
                    neighbourhood of Tecpan Guatemala are the substructions and debris of Patmamit,
                    the old Cakchiquel capital. Utatlan, the Quiche capital has left near Santa Cruz
                    del Quiehé sufficient to confirm the early Spanish accounts of its greatness.
                    The absence of sculptures is a striking feature. Rude mounds mark the site of
                    Zakuleu, the chief town of the Mams, near Huehuetenango. At thejunctionof
                    thePacalah with the ChisoyBrasseur deBourbourg in 1856 found pyramidal mounds
                    and long lines of fortifications. The half-explored country of Peten.is reputed
                    to conceal many evidences of its former civilization, and about 40 miles
                    north-east of the lake about a league is occupied by the ruins of Tikal.<note

                    >History.—</hi> In 1820 Guatemala began to shake off the Spanish yoke, and in
                    1822-23 it supported the Mexican patriot Iturbide. A confederation of the
                    Central American states was effected in 1824, slavery was abolished, and a
                    democratic constitution was established. On the assassination of the
                    vice-president Flores in 1827 the San-Salvadorians marched against the city of
                    Guatemala; and though they were repulsed then they returned in 1829, and after a
                    severe battle established their general Morazan as president. Guatemala
                    recovered its independence under Carrera, who in 1851 defeated the Hondurians
                    and Salvadorians at La Arada. near Chiquimula, and was recognized as the
                    pacificator of the republic. In 1851 the new constitution still in force was
                    promulgated, and Carrera was appointed president till 1856, a dignity which was
                    afterwards in 1854 bestowed upon him for life. His rivalry with Barrios,
                    president of Salvador, resulted in open war in 1863. In the battle of Coateρeque
                    the Guatemalians suffered a severe defeat, which was followed by a truce.
                    Honduras now joined with San Salvador, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica with
                    Guatemala. The contest was finally settled in favour of Carrera, who besieged
                    and occupied the San Salvador capital, and made himself dominant also in
                    Honduras and Nicaragua. During the rest of his rule, which lasted till his death
                    in April 1865, he continued to act in concert with the clerical party, and
                    endeavoured to maintain friendly relations with the European Governments.
                    Carrera’s successor was General Cerna, who had been recommended by him for
                    election. In the struggle between Spain and Chili Guatemala maintained a strict
                    neutrality. The liberal party began to rise in influence about 1870, and in May
                    1871 Cerna was deposed by Granados. The archbishop of Guatemala and the Jesuits
                    were driven into exile as intriguers in the interests of the clerical party; and
                    General Barrios having been chosen president in 1872 the order was declared
                    extinct and its property confiscated. All cities except those on the frontier of
                    Chiapas, San Salvador, and Honduras, were opened to foreign commerce. An
                    alliance was formed with San Salvador for offence and defence. In 1876 Barrios
                    invited representatives from the other Central American republics to meet at
                    Guatemala to deliberate on their amalgamation; but the commission separated amid
                    a clash of arms, and war was soon raging between Guatemala, San Salvador, and
                    Honduras. Guatemala was enabled by her superior resources to come forth
                    victorious from the conflict.</p>

                    republic. It is situated at a height of 5270 feet above the sea in a fertile
                    meseta or plateau, which is crossed by the valley of the Rio de las Vacas or Cow
                    River, so called from the first specimens of the bovine race introduced by the
                    Spaniards. On almost all sides it is surrounded by barrancas or ravines. The
                    latitude is stated as either 14° 3G' or 14° 37' N., and the longitude as 90° 24'
                    or 90° 30' W. of Greenwich. Like most Spanish American towns it is laid out in
                    wide and regular streets, and it has extensive suburbs. The houses, though
                    usually of only one story, are solidly and comfortably constructed, and many of
                    them are furnished with large gardens and courts. Among the open spaces the
                    chief are the Plaza Major, which contains the cathedral, erected in 1730, the
                    archiépiscopal palace, the Government buildings, the mint, aud other public
                    offices, and the Plaza de la Concordia, recently laid out by the Ministerio de
                    Fomento, and now the favourite resort of the inhabitants. The theatre, founded
                    in 1858, which is one of the best of Central America, is situated in the middle
                    of another square. Besides the cathedral, the most important churches are those
                    of San Francisco, La Recoleccion or church of the La Recollets, La Merces, with
                    a black image of the Virgin, greatly reverenced by the Indians, and Santo
                    Domingo, the oldest church in the town. The educational and benevolent
                    institutions comprise the university, the normal school, the national school for
                    girls founded in 1875, the polytechnic school, the general hospital, the
                    orphanage, the hospicio, the maternity hospital, and the Colegio de Belen for
                    the education of girls. The military college is located in the old convent of
                    the Recollets. An excellent museum, founded in 1831, is maintained by the
                    Sociedad Economica, which in various ways has done great service to the city and
                    the country. There are two fortresses in the city, the Castello Matamoros, built
                    by Carrera, and the Castello de San José, used as a state prison. Water is
                    brought from a distance of about 8 miles by two old aqueducts. The general
                    prosperity of Guatemala has procured it the name of the Paris of Central
                    America. Though it has neither railway nor river communication with either
                    coast, it carries on a busy trade; and it also possesses cigar factories, wool
                    and cotton factories, breweries, and other industrial establishments. The
                    population is stated at from 30,000 to 45,000. It is only since 1775 that New
                    Guatemala has been in existence.</p>
                <p>Old Guatemala, frequently called merely Antigua, was destroyed by the Volcan de
                    Agua in 1774, but still remains the chief town of the department of
                    Sacatepequez. It is situated in a beautiful valley in 14° 32' 58" N. lat. and
                    90° 44' 5" W. long. Till the fatal outbreak of the volcanic <pb break="no"

                    beautiful cities of Spanish America, possessing about 100 churches and convents
                    and more than 60,000 inhabitants. The ruins are still almost majestic, and many
                    of the buildings appear as if they had been fortresses. Among those best
                    preserved are the ancient residence of the Spanish governors, now occupied by
                    the administration, and the university building, now the national college. Great
                    damage was done to the place by the earthquake of September 1874. The population
                    is about 20,000. An older Guatemala was situated at Ciudad Vieja or Almalonga,
                    but seventeen years after it was founded by Alvaredo it was carried away by the
                    great inundation to which the Volcan de Agua owes its name.</p>
