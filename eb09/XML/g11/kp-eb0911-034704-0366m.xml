                    outer garments <hi rend="italic">(γυμνοί)</hi>; hence arose the name gymnasium.
                    Afterwards the habit of exercising naked became universal. In the continuance of
                    their history the Greeks grew more attached to such sports; their free active
                    life, spent to a great extent in the open air, fostered the liking almost into a
                    passion. The victor in any athletic contest, though he gained no money prize,
                    was rewarded with the honour and respect of his fellowcitizens; and a victory in
                    the great religious festivals was counted an, honour for the whole state. In
                    these circumstances the training of competitors for the greater games became a
                    public concern; special buildings and officials were provided for the purpose by
                    the state. But, as gymnastics became more and more an institution of social
                    life, the gymnasia were applied to other uses even more important. The most
                    interesting points are the connexion with education on the one hand, with
                    medicine on the other. Due training of the body and maintenance of the health
                    and strength of children were the chief part of earlier education. Except the
                    time devoted to letters and music, the education of boys was conducted in the
                    gymnasia, where their moral training was as carefully attended to by special
                    officers as their physical exercises. As they grew older conversation and social
                    intercourse took the place of the more systematic discipline. Philosophers and
                    sophists assembled to talk and to lecture in the gymnasia, which became places
                    of general resort for the purpose of all less systematic intellectual pursuits,
                    as well as for physical exercises. Plato, when treating of education, devotes
                    much consideration to gymnastics (see especially <hi rend="italic">Rep.</hi>
                    iii. and various parts of <hi rend="italic">Leges).</hi> Gymnastic exercises
                    proper were designed, not merely as in Sparta, to foster the taste for war and
                    the activity and strength needed for using weapons, but also to <pb break="no"

                    body. According to Plato, the sophist Prodicus first pointed out the connexion
                    between gymnastics and health. Having found such exercises beneficial to his own
                    weak health, he formulated a method which was adopted generally, and which
                    Hippocrates improved on. Galen lays the greatest stress on the proper use of
                    gymnastics, and throughout ancient medical writers we find that special
                    exercises are prescribed as the cure for special diseases. The regulation of the
                    gymnasium at Athens is attributed by Pausanias (i. 39, 3) to Theseus; Solon made
                    several laws on the subject; but, according to Galen, it was reduced to a system
                    in the time of Clisthenes. Ten gymnasiarchs, one from each tribe, were appointed
                    annually. These performed in rotation the duties of their office, which were to
                    maintain and pay the persons that were training for public contests, to conduct
                    the games at the great Athenian festivals, to exercise general supervision over
                    the morals of the youths (they could, for example, remove any philosopher whose
                    teaching they thought injurious), and to adorn and keep up the gymnasium. This
                    office was one of the ordinary <hi rend="italic">λειτουργία!.,</hi> and great
                    expense was entailed on the holders. Under them were ten sophronistae, with a
                    salary of a drachma per day. Their duty was to watch the conduct of the youths
                    at all times, and especially to be present at all their game3. The practical
                    teaching and selecting of the suitable exercises for each youth were in the
                    hands of the paedotribae and gymnastae. The latter also superintended the effect
                    on the constitution of the pupils, and prescribed for them when they were
                    unwell. Aliptae oiled and rubbed dust on the bodies of the youths, acted as
                    surgeons, and administered the drugs prescribed.</p>
                <p>The gymnasia built to suit these various purposes were large buildings which
                    contained, not merely places for each kind of exercise, but also a stadium,
                    baths, covered porticos for practice in bad weather, and outer porticos where
                    the philosophers and men of letters read public lectures and held disputations.
                    In Athens there were three great public gymnasia,—Academy, Lyceum, and
                    Cynosarges,—and every Greek city of consequence seems to have possessed one.
                    Ruins of them exist at Pergamus, Ephesus, Alexandria in Troas, &amp;c., from
                    which, and from the accounts ofVitruvius (v. 11), it would appear that all were
                    constructed on much the same plan. The details will be found most clearly given
                    in Rich’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Greek and Homan Antiquities.</hi></p>
                <p>Much of the healthy buoyant elasticity of mind for which the Greek race is
                    remarkable, as well as the active and beautiful physical development which no
                    other race has ever equalled, is due to the love of gymnastics. The plastic art
                    also owes its perfection in the treatment of the human form to the constant
                    opportunity which artists had of observing the nude body in various attitudes.
                    But abuses were liable to occur. The careful provisions made by Solon and later
                    legislators to keep up the moral character of the gymnasia did not prevent them
                    from fostering the vice which appears so much in Greek life. Though introduced
                    in Rome, where Nero built the first public gymnasium, gymnastics did not suit
                    Italian habits, and never became popular.</p>
                <p>Gymnasium, in its modern use, generally signifies a school for gymnastic
                    exercises, but it is sometimes used also to denote a higher school intended to
                    give immediate preparation for the universities. The latter application of the
                    term is specially prevalent in Germany.</p>
