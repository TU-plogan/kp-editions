                    Irish statesman and orator, was born 3d July 1746. His father, a Protestant, was
                    for many years recorder of the city of Dublin, and from 1761 to 1766 its
                    representative in the Irish parliament; and his mother was a daughter of Thomas
                    Marlay, chief justice of Ireland. Both at school and at Trinity College, Dublin,
                    which he entered in 1763, young Grattan greatly distinguished himself,
                    especially in the study of the classics; and several well-authenticated
                    anecdotes indicate also that the more prominent moral characteristics displayed
                    in his public career had begun to assert their strength at a very early period.
                    While still attending the university he discarded the Tory principles of his
                    father, who, dying in 1766 before his irritation had time to moderate, testified
                    his resentment by depriving him of the paternal mansion, and of all property not
                    secured by settlement. Having inherited, however, a small inalienable patrimony
                    he resolved to study for the bar, and in 1767 he entered the Middle Temple,
                    London. He was called to the Irish bar in 1772, but never obtained a large
                    practice; and indeed from the time that he left the university he seems to have
                    concentrated his attention chiefly on politics and the study of popular oratory.
                    He early acquired a passionate admiration of the great orators of Greece and
                    Rome, and while in London he spent the most of his evenings in the galleries of
                    the House of Commons or at the bar of the Lords, anxious to profit by every
                    opportunity of obtaining an insight into the art of eloquence, his enthusiasm
                    for which had received additional stimulus from the genius of Lord Chatham. Of
                    the eloquence of Chatham he has given a detailed and graphic description in one
                    of his letters, and he also wrote an admirable portraiture of his character,
                    which was inserted as a note in the political publication <hi rend="italic"
                    >Barataria</hi> conducted by Sir Hercules Langrishe. The knowledge obtained from
                    the study of the best specimens of ancient and modern oratory, and that gained
                    from witnessing the debates in the English parliament, Grattan began sedulously
                    to apply to the purposes of his own discipline. By the constant practice of
                    recitation to imaginary audiences, and by taking part frequently in private
                    theatricals, he succeeded in overcoming to a remarkable extent his great
                    physical defects, so as to acquire a clear and rounded articulation, an emphasis
                    in some respects admirably consonant with his meaning, and a certain ease in a
                    style of elocution which was effective partly by reason of its very singularity.
                    At the same time, by practising the habit of writing out the principal passages
                    of his speeches, and subjecting them to a constant mental revision, he attained
                    to the possession of a diction which for clearness, epigrammatic vigour,
                    polished beauty of phrase, and the power of illuminating a whole subject by
                    sudden flashes of meaning conveyed in a single sentence, is unsurpassed in
                    modern oratory. He was equally diligent also in perfecting his political
                    knowledge by a careful study of the history and political constitution both of
                    ancient and modern nations; and the minor accomplishment of proficiency as a
                    pistol shot, at that time essential to every Irish politician who would be
                    prepared for all emergencies, was cultivated by him with the same dogged
                    perseverance which he displayed in other matters.</p>
                <p>When therefore, under the auspices of Lord Charlemont, Grattan in 1775 entered
                    the Irish parliament, he had already all his powers under full command, and had
                    so trained and disciplined his natural genius that it was able to exert its
                    influence with untrammelled freedom. The period at which he began public life
                    was one of the most critical in his country’s history; and it is within the
                    limits of strict truth to affirm that he inaugurated a new era in her political
                    condition, and that, whether for good or for evil, and whether by the direct
                    success of his efforts or by the modifying or opposing influences they called
                    into exercise, he has had a greater share than any other individual in
                    determining her present relation to the United Kingdom. Through the writings of
                    Molyneux and Swift, the beginnings of a true national sentiment had been
                    previously awakened; and the first step in the path of constitutional reform had
                    been taken, when by the advocacy of Flood the Octennial Bill of 1768 was passed,
                    which limited the duration of parliaments to eight years, instead of as formerly
                    making their continuance depend upon the life of the sovereign; but Flood
                    himself—whose friendship and influence were a powerful element in determining
                    Grattan to adopt a political career—had, like less formidable agitators,
                    succumbed to the intrigues of the “castle,” and, although possessed of a private
                    fortune which placed him beyond the suspicion of being governed chiefly by
                    mercenary considerations, had consented to hamper his political action by
                    accepting a sinecure office; and it seemed as if the germs of a better future
                    had already begun to rot in a soil of such political corruption. The difficulty
                    of the task which Grattan had set before him was also increased by a peculiarity
                    in the case of Ireland which requires to be emphasized. Her political
                    constitution, and, with the exception of the restrictions which paralysed her
                    trade, the laws which were inflicting upon her such moral and physical misery,
                    did not nominally differ to any great extent from those of the country by which
                    she was in reality governed. She possessed intact her separate nationality; she
                    was blessed with the boon of a national parliament; she had a legal
                    administration of her own, including the right of trial by jury; and she enjoyed
                    something resembling the privileges of municipal government. She possessed these
                    things, however, scarcely more than in form; and she possessed them in such a
                    form that, instead of being the guarantees of hθr liberty, they increased her
                    sense of bondage, and directly fostered discontent and chronic mutiny. Though
                    the Test Act and the penal laws were actually enforced with less rigour than in
                    England, yet from the numbers who came within their sweep their disastrous
                    influence was incalculably increased. They excluded four-fifths of her otherwise
                    eligible population from the jury box and from municipal and parliamentary
                    suffrage; they had produced confiscations on almost a national scale with all
                    the evils consequent on absenteeism; and from their operation there had resulted
                    an ignorance, a poverty, a violation of the rights of conscience, not confined
                    to a few thousands, helplessly dispersed throughout the kingdom, but afflicting
                    the great mass of the people, and both by their direct and their reflex action
                    poisoning the springs of the whole national life. Her judges besides were liable
                    to dismissal at pleasure, and her parliament had no independent authority, and
                    by its very constitution was subject to corrupt influences far exceeding those
                    in operation in the English parliament, and such as virtually to deprive it of
                    independence of vote, almost as completely as it had been deprived of the power
                    of legislation. Still that parliament constituted a kind of centre for political
                    discussion and for the propagation and diffusion of political ideas, and it was
                    by means of it that Grattan and his associates determined to work out the
                    political and social regeneration of their country. Almost as soon as he entered
                    parliament, Grattan became the acknowledged leader of the opposition, not only
                    from the influence exerted by his oratory within the House, but from its power
                    to kindle the enthusiasm of the people, and to create out of the chaos of
                    shapeless and discordant elements the united sympathy and purpose of a true <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0071-0062"/> national life. In thia he received an assistance
                    from external events which was embarrassing as well as helpful;— from the
                    American rebellion, which was the result of a struggle for rights similar to
                    those he was contending for; from the war with France, which led to the creation
                    of a volunteer army in Ireland that became a kind of political convention; and
                    ultimately from the French Revolution, which in Ireland, more than in any other
                    country of Europe, aroused wild desires after political freedom.</p>
                <p>In Febιuary 1778 Grattan moved an address to the crown, to the effect that the
                    condition of Ireland was no longer endurable, and although the motiou was
                    supported by only a small minority, the discussion bore fruit in the same year
                    by the concession of free export of all produce except woollens, and by the
                    modification of the penal laws to the extent of allowing the Catholics to hold
                    leases for 999 years. In the following year the volunteers by their determined
                    attitude crowned with success his efforts, along with Flood and Burgh, to effect
                    the total repeal of the restriction Acts, and the same year saw also the repeal
                    of the Test Act. With a view to increase and take advantage of the rising tide
                    of national sentiment, Grattan on April 19th 1780 moved his famous resolutions
                    that the “king with the consent of the parliament of Ireland was alone competent
                    to enact laws to bind Ireland, and that Great Britain and Ireland were
                    indissolubly united, but only under a common sovereign;” but so satisfied was he
                    with the tone of the debate that, unwilling needlessly to irritate or embarrass
                    the English Government, he did not press his motion to a division. An agitation
                    was, however, begun in the following year against Poyning’s Act and the Mutiny
                    Act, and Grattan besides supported the introduction of a bill permitting the
                    Catholics to inherit and hold property on the same terms as other subjects. In
                    order also to bring pressure to bear on the English Government, Grattan, Flood,
                    and Charlemont met privately in the beginning of 1782, and drew up for the
                    consideration of the volunteers’ delegates two resolutions in reference to
                    independence; and to these Grattan, on his own responsibility and without the
                    knowledge of Flood and Charlemont, added a third in favour of the measure for
                    the relaxation of the penal laws against the Catholics. All these resolutions
                    were adopted by the delegates unanimously, and Grattan, strong in armed support,
                    repeated his motion for a declaration of independence, which, although it was
                    lost, aroused such general enthusiasm that, when on the 16th April he rose to
                    move a Declaration of Rights, he in a brilliant oration congratulated his
                    hearers and his country on the triumphant issue of the struggle, his first words
                    being—“I am now about to address a free people.” So completely did his eloquence
                    rise to what was deemed the greatness of the occasion that its effect has seldom
                    been equalled in the annals of oratory; and in the state of high-wrought
                    excitement that prevailed, the Government, then doubtful as to the result of the
                    siege of Gibraltar by the French and Spaniards, did not dare to refuse the boon
                    which had already been in reality appropriated without their permission, and on
                    the 17th May resolutions were passed unanimously, pledging the English
                    parliament to redress the grievances complained of. In recognition of Grattan’s
                    services the Irish parliament was prepared to have voted him a grant of
                    .£100,000; but he was with difficulty persuaded to accept half that sum, and
                    only agreed to do so from the consideration that, by relieving him from the
                    necessity of practising at the bar, it would enable him to devote the whole of
                    his energies to politics. He determined, however, that this gift should not in
                    any way bias his political action, and when Flood, supported by the volunteer
                    convention, brought forward his motion for repeal, he at the expense of his
                    popularity moved its rejection—a procedure which also gave rise to an
                    extraordinary scene of mutual recrimination between the two orators. For the
                    next ten years Grattan carried on the struggle for the reform of Irish abuses
                    with almost no success; and his Place and Pension Bill, and bills to make the
                    great officers of government responsible for their proceedings, to prevent
                    revenue officers from voting at elections, and to abolish ecclesiastical tithes,
                    were all rejected. Pitt, at one time disposed to promote emancipation, became
                    lukewarm in his zeal after the rejection in 1785 of Mr Orde’s bill for the
                    removal of trade restrictions, which, on account of a clause binding the
                    parliament to re-enact England’s navigation laws, was opposed by Grattan as
                    involving a principle that implied a revocation of the constitution; nor did the
                    action of the Irish parliament in the regency dispute of 1789 tend to smooth the
                    relations between the two countries. At last in 1793 parliamentary suffrage was
                    conceded to the Catholics as a sop to the fury of the United Irishmen; but the
                    concession served only to whet the appetite for further redress, and when the
                    hope of obtaining this, after reaching the verge of certainty by the appointment
                    of Fitzwilliam as lord-lieutenant, was suddenly dashed by his recall, the spirit
                    of brooding discontent increased until ultimately,it resulted in the bloody
                    rebellion of 1798. Previous to its occurrence Grattan had withdrawn from
                    parliament. It has been surmised by Mr Froude that in urging on the question of
                    emancipation Grattan wished to effect a complete separation from England, and
                    perhaps calculated, though a Protestant, on obtaining as the reward of his
                    services the first place in the new commonwealth; but besides that the
                    conjecture is unnecessary, since it was quite a possible supposition that
                    emancipation might have proved the best method of confirming the loyalty of the
                    Catholics,—-and it was most certainly a better method than union without
                    emancipation,—it is without a shadow of proof to support it, and would also have
                    implied treachery on his part of the blackest kind, while treachery of any kind
                    is belied by the whole course of his political life. In 1800 Grattan, though in
                    feeble health, entered the Irish parliament as member for Wicklow, specially to
                    oppose the motion for union, a measure whose bitterness was not rendered less
                    distasteful to him from the time, manner, and means employed for its
                    accomplishment. He regarded its success as almost the nullification of Ireland’s
                    partial freedom, and the indefinite postponement of the attempt to remedy her
                    wrongs. Though knowing from the beginning that to contend against the influence
                    of the Government was hopeless, he exerted all his eloquence in condemnation of
                    the measure; and his last words in the Irish Parliament were—“I will remain
                    anchored here with fidelity to the fortunes of my country, faithful to her
                    freedom, faithful to her fall·” In the course of these debates Grattan was three
                    times virulently attacked by Mr Corry, chancellor of the exchequer, but at last
                    retaliated with overwhelming effect. In the duel which followed Corry was
                    wounded.</p>
                <p>After the Union Grattan withdrew for a time from public life, but, in order to
                    lend his assistance to the passing of the Catholic Relief Bill, he in 1805
                    entered the English parliament as member for Malton; and in the following year
                    he was returned by Dublin, which he had formerly represented in the Irish
                    parliament. Although his speeches in the new arena did not detract from his
                    fame, the union had effected so great a change in his political standpoint that
                    the inspiration which had formerly given to his eloquence such a glow of
                    confident ardour, and had braced his powers to such supreme efforts, was no
                    longer present. He refused to take office in the Fox ministry, but he
                    nevertheless gave the Whigs his support on all important occasions; and by
                    voting with the Government on the Irish Insurrection Bill of 1807, he showed
                    that his regard for the general welfare of the empire was <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0072-0063"/> unaffected by the great political disappointment
                    of his life. After the rejection of the Catholic Relief Bill of 1813, which was
                    accompanied by a clause reserving to the English sovereign the power of veto in
                    the election of Catholic bishops, the Catholic board repudiated the proposed
                    compromise and declined to entrust Grattan further with their cause. He,
                    however, gave it the same energetic support as formerly, and after 1815 he never
                    spoke in the English parliament on any other subject. In 1819 his motion was
                    defeated by the small majority of two; and on the reassembling of parliament in
                    the following May, he undertook, contrary to the advice of his physician, a
                    journey to London in order again to bring forward the subject, but died a few
                    days after his arrival, 4th June 1820. He received the honour of a public
                    funeral and a grave in Westminster Abbey, where he lies near the tombs of Pitt
                    and Fox.</p>
                <p>Lord Byron, who had heard Grattan only in the English House of Commons, says that
                    he would have come near to his ideal of a perfect orator but for his harlequiu
                    manner; and he also states that Curran was in the habit of taking him off by
                    bowing to the very ground and thanking God that he had no peculiarities of
                    gesture or appearance. His features were large and plain, and he was low in
                    stature and so awkwardly formed that probably he never could have acquired a
                    very graceful gesture; but the gravity and impressiveness of his bearing
                    banished all sense of the ridiculous, and perhaps even the oddness and violence
                    of his attitudes assisted to dissipate the feeling in his hearers of his
                    personal insignificance. His voice, though not harsh, was deficient both in
                    mellowness and volume, and when not elevated by emotion into shrillness had a
                    low drawling accent. He succeeded, however, by virtue of appropriate emphasis
                    and of concentrated energy, in bringing home to his hearers all the various
                    shades of the passion and purpose of his discourse, and this perhaps with
                    greater vividness than if it had been accomplished by means of an elocution
                    which, if less faulty, would not have expressed so well his own peculiar
                    individuality. In private life he was simple, genial, and courteous, and the
                    felicity of his language, flavoured by an enunciation and manner that were all
                    his own, lent to his conversation a rare and peculiar charm.</p>
                <p>His speeches suffer much from imperfect reporting, but their leading
                    characteristics can be determined with considerable accuracy. Great labour,
                    direct and indirect, was bestowed on their preparation, and few speeches show so
                    many traces of art; but it is art transfused and palpitating with enthusiasm,
                    and therefore, though defective in ease and simplicity, they cannot be charged
                    with artificiality or affectation. In regard to the chief fault of his
                    style,—the excessive use of epigram,—it must be remembered that he made it
                    supply the place both of wit and of direct argument; and that it never wearied
                    his audience by a monotony of stilted smartness, but, by its incisive vigour and
                    its startling originality, rendered his speeches perhaps unequalled for
                    sustained brilliancy and interest. His oratorical triumphs were won, not by the
                    stately marshalling of arguments and illustrations towards a climax, but by
                    sudden surprises from so many directions, and so closely following each other
                    that resistance to his attacks soon became impossible. In regard to
                    subject-matter his speeches do not suffer from comparison even with those of
                    Burke. His favourite method of enforcing his arguments was by illustrations
                    either of similarity or of contrast drawn from history or from contemporary
                    events; and while in this way he exhibited in every possible light the
                    plausibility of his contentions, he gave dignity and elevation to his theme by
                    removing it from the narrow sphere of party politics, and connecting it with
                    principles of universal and permanent consequence. Much of the effect of his
                    eloquence was due to the boldness of his statements and of his allusions and
                    imagery, a boldness which, though often amounting to hardihood, never
                    overstepped the boundaries between the sublime and the ridiculous. In remarkable
                    contrast to other Irish orators, and especially to his great contemporary
                    Curran, he possessed neither wit nor humour, and this no doubt accounts for the
                    sustained and pitiless vehemence of his invectives against opponents who had
                    thoroughly roused his anger. These attacks were rendered the more formidable
                    from his power of delineating character by epithets, the graphic force of which
                    had an almost electrical effect. This power he exercised, however, more
                    frequently for purposes of laudation than censure, and perhaps the finest
                    examples of it in his speeches are two short incidental allusions to Fox and
                    Burke. A remarkable union of boldness with moderation and restraint
                    characterized bis statesmanship as it did his oratory, for while he embraced
                    within his scheme of reform the whole circle of Ireland’s wrongs and
                    disabilities, and was prepared to face the consequences of all constitutional
                    changes, however great, which justice seemed to demand, his unswerving aim, in
                    the face both of strong provocation from the Government and of the powerful
                    assaults of popular clamour, was not to loosen but to cement the ties which
                    bound Ireland to Great Britain. That his political conduct was governed too much
                    by abstractions, and had too little regard to expediency, is a conclusion which
                    has been both affirmed and denied, but in any case it will be admitted by most
                    that his beneficial influence on Irish politics has been less felt by the direct
                    accomplishment of his aims than through the moral effect of his enlightened and
                    incorruptible patriotism, and the gradual change which has taken place in the
                    mental attitude of English statesmen towards his country.</p>
