                    is suggestive of a German extraction; but of his remoter ancestry nothing is
                    recorded. Hie youth was passed at Rome in the monastery of St Mary on the
                    Aventine, where a relative was at that time prior; here the archpriest Johannes
                    Gratianus (afterwards Gregory VI.) was one of his instructors, and the youthful
                    scholar early attracted the attention of such visitors as Laurentius of Amalfi
                    and Odilon of Clugny. There is some reason to believe that, after passing his
                    novitiate in Rome, Hildebrand removed for some years to the great Burgundian
                    cloister, at that time under the charge of the last-named ecclesiastic; but all
                    the earlier years of his life are involved in considerable obscurity. In 1046 he
                    became one of the chaplains of the newly elected pope, Gregory VI., whom he
                    shortly afterwards accompanied into his German exile; and on the death of that
                    pontiff, some two years later, he retired to Clugny, where his learning and
                    sanctity made a deep impression, and where, according to some accounts, he was
                    ultimately promoted to the office of prior. As a monk of Clugny he appears to
                    have oftener than once visited the imperial court for the transaction of
                    ecclesiastical business; and in 1049 he is said in a very special way to have
                    come under the notice of Bruno, bishop of Toul, then on his way to Rome to take
                    possession of the chair of St Peter, which be occupied fur some years under the
                    title of Leo IX. It was at Hildebrand’s instance that Bruno, who had been
                    nominated by the emperor merely, consented to refrain from assuming the
                    pontifical vestments, and to present himself to the Romans in the garb of a
                    simple pilgrim, until he should have been elected in a more regular manner. The
                    ascendency which Hildebrand had thus acquired over this pope he never afterwards
                    lost; in 1050 he became cardinal subdeacon, and in following years he was
                    entrusted with various missions of great importance, taking also a prominent
                    part in the important synods of Rheims and Mainz, as well as in those of Rome.
                    On the death of Leo IX. in 1054 the Roman people had signified a desire that the
                    subdeacon should succeed him; this honour and responsibility however Hildebrand
                    declined; but he was one of three legates who went to Germany to consult with
                    the emperor about the choice of a successor. The negotiations, which lasted
                    eleven months, ultimately issued in the election of Gebhard of Eichstädt, a
                    relative of the emperor, who up to that time had followed a distinctly antipapal
                    policy, but who, immediately after his reception and consecration at Rome as
                    Victor II. (13th April 1055), became as entirely a tool in the hand of
                    Hildebrand as Leo had been. It was during this pontificate that Hildebrand, as
                    papal legate, attended the French synods held for the purpose of repressing the
                    heresy of Berengarius. On the election of Pope Stephen IX. (X. ), Hildebrand was
                    again sent to Germany to defend the choice before the empress Agnes; in this
                    mission, which was ultimately successful, several months were spent. Again, in
                    1058, he succeeded in defeating the hostile party of Benedict X. and in securing
                    the tiara for Nicholas II.; and once more, in 1061, he successfully laboured for
                    the election of Alexander II. to the papal <pb break="no"

                    Alexander, Hildebrand was himself as it were compelled by the tumultuous demands
                    of the mob to accept the vacant tiara (22d April); but he refused to receive
                    consecration until the sanction of the emperor had been obtained. This did not
                    arrive for more than a month, although meanwhile he had been practically
                    exercising many of the papal functions; finally, however, he was ordained to the
                    priesthood, and some days afterwards (30th June) solemnly consecrated pope by
                    the title of Gregory VIL, a name which he chose in testimony of his veneration
                    for the memory and character of his earliest patron, Gregory VI.<note

                    historical associations connected with the name of Gregory, its etymology (from

                    probably something to do with its selection by this and so many other
                    popes.</p></note> Once firmly established on the papal throne, Gregory lost no
                    time in giving the utmost possible practical effect to the two leading ideas of
                    his life, the establishment of the supremacy of the papacy within the church,
                    and the effective assertion of the supremacy of the church over the state. In
                    March 1074 a synod was held in Rome which condemned the simony that had grown so
                    prevalent throughout the church, and also enacted the old stringent laws of
                    celibacy which had become almost a dead letter, especially in Germany and in the
                    north of Italy; simoniacal or married priests were declared to be deposed and
                    their priestly functions invalid. The resistance of the clergy to these decrees
                    w⅛ utterly in vain; papal legates visited every country, and, supported by the
                    popular voice, compelled submission. At a second synod held in Rome in February
                    1075 the decrees of the first were confirmed, and the first blow was struck
                    which afterwards resulted in the long protracted wars of investitures. At that
                    synod it was determined that any ecclesiastic who in future should accept office
                    from the hands of a layman incurred the penalty of deposition, while the secular
                    lord who bestowed investiture wa3 to be excommunicated. The decree was aimed
                    immediately at certain German bishops, Henry’s personal advisers, but hardly
                    less directly at Henry himself. The emperor, finding his hands at the moment
                    fully occupied with the suppression of a revolt among the Saxons, was politic
                    enough to conceal his resentment for the time, and to dismiss his advisers; but
                    as soon as the war had been brought to a close, his defiance found ample
                    expression. Meanwhile Gregory was not unopposed even in Italy, and during the
                    Christmas festivities of 1075 a revolt in Rome itself was organized by Cencius,
                    who had placed himself at the head of those nobles who were opposed to reform;
                    the pope, however, had the popular enthusiasm on his side, and ultimately the
                    insurgents were compelled to fly. A papal embassy was next sent, early in 1076,
                    to Henry at Goslar, citing him to appear personally at Rome at a council to be
                    held in the second week of Lent, and there answer for his simony, sacrilege, and
                    oppression. Henry’s rage at this knew no bounds; he dismissed the legates with
                    insult, and at a diet held at Worms (24th January 1076) replied by declaring
                    Gregory deposed on charges of tyranny, magic, and adultery, by sending
                    notification of this fact to the Roman clergy, and by taking steps for
                    appointing a successor to the dethroned pontiff. Gregory now lost no time in
                    excommunicating all the bishops who had attended the diet of Worms, in solemnly
                    deposing and excommunicating the emperor, and in absolving his subjects from
                    their oath of allegiance (22d February 1076). This counter action produced a
                    powerful effect upon the German princes and people, many of whom had had good
                    cause to resent Henry’s tyrannies; one by one the bisαops who had announced
                    their withdrawal from Gregory’s obedience now signified their contrition, and at
                    a diet held at Γribur (September 1076) the election of a new emperor began to be
                    discussed. Resistance being in the meantime impossible, Henry resolved upon
                    humbling himself to the utmost; in the dead of winter he set out to make his
                    submission; Gregory was in waiting for him at Canossa, where (25th to 27th
                    January 1077) that famous penance which Europe has not yet forgotten was imposed
                    (see vol. x. p. 488). Absolved only on condition of his not assuming the royal
                    dignity till his case had been investigated and decided, Henry had no sooner
                    left the papal presence than he began to plot his revenge. Throwing himself upon
                    the generosity of his Lombard vassals, he took courage to face the papal
                    excommunication which was renewed in November 1078; and in the wars which ensued
                    his arms were finally successful. Rudolf of Swabia having died soon after the
                    battle of Merseburg in 1080, the emperor proceeded with a powerful army to
                    escort into Italy Guibert of Ravenna, who had been chosen at Brixen (June 1080)
                    as Gregory’s successor. In three successive summers the attack on Rome was
                    renewed, but it was not until 1084 (March 21) that the treachery of some of the
                    nobles of the city opened the gate to the invader. Gregory was now at last
                    compelled to take refuge in the castle of St Angelo, while Guibert was
                    established on the pontifical throne as his successor with the title of Clement
                    III. After receiving coronation from Clement, Henry determined to return at once
                    to Germany, especially as Robert Guiscard was known to be approaching. Released
                    accordingly by the arrival of the Norman duke, Gregory excommunicated once more
                    both Henry and Clement; but not deeming himself secure at Rome, where he had
                    reason to know that his power was no longer what it once had been, he in May
                    1084 placed himself under Robert’s protection at Salerno, where he died, May 25,
                    1085, after a comparatively brief pontificate of not much more than ten years.
                    His last words are reported to have been, “I have loved righteousness and hated
                    iniquity, and therefore I die in exile.” His festival (duplex) is observed
                    throughout the Roman Church on the anniversary of his death. His successor was
                    Victor III.</p>
                <p>The lifework of Hildebrand may be thus summed up in the words of Sir James
                    Stephen :—“He found the papacy dependent on the empire; he sustained her by
                    alliances almost commensurate with the Italian peninsula. He found the papacy
                    electoral by the Roman people and clergy; he left it electoral by a college of
                    papal nomination. He found the emperor the virtual patron of the holy see; he
                    wrested that power from his hands. He found the secular clergy the allies and
                    dependants of the secular power; he converted them into the inalienable
                    auxiliaries of his own. Ho found the higher ecclesiastics in servitude to the
                    temporal sovereigns; he delivered them from that yoke to subjugate them to the
                    Roman tiara. He found the patronage of the church the mere desecrated spoil and
                    merchandize of princes; he reduced it within the dominion of the supreme
                    pontiff. He is celebrated as the reformer of the impure and profane abuses of
                    his age; he is more justly entitled to the praise of having left the impress of
                    his own gigantic character on the history of all the ages which have succeeded
                    him.”</p>
                <p>Unlike Gregory the Great, Hildebrand was no author; his literary remains are all
                    comprised in eleven books or “Registers” of letters, which have often been
                    printed. The <hi rend="italic">XXVII</hi><hi rend="italic">dictatus</hi> often
                    attributed to him are not now regarded as genuine. Among the numerous earlier

                    of Aragon, and Cardinal Bruno; among later monographs the most important are
