                    following century furnished more numerous examples of his kind, he may be taken
                    as the most finished specimen. His ideal man was a being without conscience,
                    without principle, without religion, without a soul. At the court of Charles II.
                    he found companions like himself, —women without virtue, men without honour, yet
                    disguised and adorned with courtly manners and that external refinement which
                    did duty for principle; and had it not been that his brother-in-law, Hamilton,
                    conceived the design of writing the memoirs which have made him famous, Gramont
                    would have been as entirely forgotten as most of his friends, save for a brief
                    mention by St Evremond and another by Bussy Rabutin in that little-visited
                    gallery of portraits, the <hi rend="italic">Histoire Amoureuse.</hi> His
                    grandfather had the distinction of being husband to Diane d’Andouins, <hi
                    rend="italic">la belle Corisande,</hi> one of the mistresses of Henry IV. The
                    grandson always regretted that the king had not acknowledged his father for his
                    own son, lamenting even in the presence of Louis XIV. that his family had-missed
                    the chance of becoming, in this illegitimate fashion, a branch of the royal
                    line. The anecdote is entirely characteristic. It was at first proposed to enter
                    him in the church, but he speedily perceived that his vocation was not
                    ecclesiastical, and joined the army, in which he saw a great deal of active
                    service, and was rewarded with the governorship of the Pays d’Aunis, and with
                    other small posts. He crossed over to England during the protectorate of
                    Cromwell. In the year 1662, two years after the restoration of Charles II., he
                    was exiled from the French court and again repaired to Loudon, where he found
                    such a welcome as was due to his manners, his gaiety, his extraordinary good
                    spirits, and his love of gambling, intrigue, gallantry, and pleasure. It is the
                    period of his residence at the English court which forms the greater part of
                    Hamilton’s memoirs. He is described by Bussy Rabutin as having “laughing eyes, a
                    well formed nose, a pretty mouth, a little dimple in the chin which gave an
                    agreeable effect to the whole face, a certain finesse in his countenance, and a
                    fairly good stature but for a stoop.” In the whole English court there was no
                    one more full of wit, more avid of pleasure, more devoid of all moral restraint,
                    not even Rochester himself, than the Count de Gramont. Naturally, the court
                    being what it was, there was no one more popular. In a court where the women
                    vied with each other for the king’s favour, where the men habitually cheated at
                    play, seduced their friends’ wives, and corrupted their friends’ daughters, that
                    man would be most popular in whom the absence of principle became, by reason of
                    his grace, <hi rend="italic">esprit,</hi> and elegance, in itself a
                    recommendation. Gramont was as purely a sensualist as any Roman of the later
                    empire.</p>
                <p>He married, in London, but on compulsion, the sister of his future biographer,
                    Miss Hamilton, who, her brother tells us in the memoirs, was able to fix his
                    affections. The statement must be received with some qualifications. The count,
                    it is true, was by no means young when he married. At the same time, he
                    “galantisait” for many years afterwards, and, in fact, to the very end of a long
                    life. He was the only old man, says Ninon de ΓEnclos, who could.affect the
                    follies of youth without being ridiculous. In fact, Gramont, like La Fontaine,
                    was a spoiled child, to whom everything was allowed, and who repaid indulgence
                    by perpetual high spirits, and a continual flow of wit and <hi rend="italic"
                    >bans mots.</hi> At the age of seventy-five he had a dangerous illness, during
                    which he became reconciled, in his way, to the church, but on recovery relapsed
                    into his old habits. At eighty he either dictated or revised his own memoirs,
                    written by his brother-in-law Antony Hamiltcn. When they were finished he sold
                    the manuscript for 1500 franc3 and kept most of the money himself. Fontenelle,
                    then censor of the press, refused to license the work, from considerations of
                    respect to the old man who had so strangely exposed in its pages the whole of
                    his character. These scruples were overcome by the count himself, who had the
                    pleasure of seeing his biography appear in his own lifetime, and of laughing
                    with the rest of the world at his own rogueries at cards, his amorous
                    adventures, and his secret intrigues.</p>
                <p>He died at the great age of eighty-six. His biographer Hamilton died thirteen
                    years later at the age of seventy-four. The memoirs of the Count de Gramont are
                    not to be recommended for general reading; yet they have the merit of being
                    true; in no other work is the reality of that profligate society of St James’s
                    so vividly expressed; in no other contemporary memoirs is there so much wit,
                    such grace of style, such skill in portraiture. Numerous editions and
                    translations have been issued of this work, whose popularity seems destined to
                    continue and grow.</p>
