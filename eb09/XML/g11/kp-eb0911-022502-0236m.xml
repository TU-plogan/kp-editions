                    university life he made Icelandic his special study, until in 1805 he took the
                    position of tutor in a house on the island of Langeland. The next three years
                    were spent in the study of Shakespeare, Schiller, and Fichte. His cousin, the
                    philosopher Henrik Steffens, had returned to Copenhagen in 1802 full of the
                    teaching of Schelling, and his lectures and the early poetry of Oehlenschlager
                    opened the eyβ3 of Grund tvig to the new era in literature that was commencing.
                    The latter began to essay writing himself, but hi3 first work, <hi rend="italic"
                    >On the Songs in the Edda,</hi> attracted no attention. Returning to Copenhagen
                    in 1808, he achieved a greater success with his <hi rend="italic">Northern
                    Mythology,</hi> and in 1809 with his <hi rend="italic">Decline of the Heroic
                    Life in the North.</hi> The boldness of his theological views having provoked
                    opposition, he retired to a country parsonage for a while, but soon returned to
                    pursue a literary career with extraordinary earnestness. From 1812 to 1817 he
                    published five or six works, of which the <hi rend="italic">Rhyme
                    ofRoeskilde</hi> is the most remarkable. From 1816 to 1819 he was editor of a
                    polemical journal entitled <hi rend="italic">Dannevirke,</hi> and in 1818 to
                    1822 appeared his Danish paraphrases of Saxo Grammaticus and Snorre. During
                    these years he was preaching to an enthusiastic congregation in Copenhagen, but
                    he accepted in 1821 the country living of Praesto, only to return to the
                    metropolis the year after. His theological career was, however, presently
                    stopped, for, having in 1825 published a brochure, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Church’s Reply,</hi> against the popular Dr Clausen, he was publicly prosecuted
                    and fined. For seven years he was forbidden to preach, years which he spent in
                    publishing a collection of fiis theological works, in paying two visits to
                    England, and in studying Anglo-Saxon. In 1832 he obtained permission to preach
                    again, and in 1839 he became priest of the workhouse church of Vartou Hospital,
                    a post he continued to hold until his death. In 1837 he published <hi
                    rend="italic">Songs for the Danish Church,</hi> a rich collection of spiritual
                    poems; in 1838 he brought out a selection of early Scandinavian verse; in 1840
                    he edited the Anglo-Saxon poem of the <hi rend="italic">Phoenix,</hi> with a
                    Danish translation. He visited England a third time in 1843. From 1844 until
                    after the first German war Grundtvig took a very prominent part in politics. In
                    1861 he received the titular rank of bishop, but without a see. He went on
                    writing σccasional poems till 1866, and preached in the Vartou every Sunday
                    until a month before his death. He was married thrice, the last time in his
                    seventy-sixth year, and left children by each marriage. He died September 2,
                    1872. Grundtvig holds a unique position in the literature of his country; he has
                    been styled the Danish Carlyle. He was above all things a man of action, not an
                    artist; and the formless vehemence of his writings, which have had a great
                    influence over his own countrymen, is hardly agreeable or intelligible to a
                    foreigner. His spiritual poems are among the best that the North has produced,
                    but they are apt to be too long. The writings of Grundtvig have not yet been
                    collected in a permanent form, but the best of his poetical works were published
                    in a selection by his eldest son, Svend Grundtvig, the eminent comparative
                    mythologist, in 1869, with a critical memoir by the poet Hostrup, who belongs to
                    the religious body denominated Grundtvigians.</p>
