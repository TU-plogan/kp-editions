                    Revolution. It consists of two upright posts surmounted by a cross beam, and
                    grooved so as to guide an oblique-edged knife, the back of which is heavily
                    weighted to make it fall swiftly and with force when the cord by which it is
                    held aloft is let go. Some ascribe the invention of the machine to the Persians;
                    and previous to the period when it obtained notoriety under its present name it
                    had been in use in Scotland, England, and various parts of the Continent. There
                    is still preserved in the Antiquarian Museum of Edinburgh the rude guillotine
                    called the “maiden” by which the regent Morton was decapitated in 1581. The last
                    persons decapitated by the Scotch “maiden” were the marquis of Argyll in 1661
                    and his son the earl of Argyll in 1685. It would appear that no similar machine
                    was ever in general use in England; but until 1650 there existed in the forest
                    of Hardwick, which was coextensive with the parish of Halifax, West Riding,
                    Yorkshire, a mode of trial and execution called the gibbet law, by which a felon
                    convicted of theft within the liberty was sentenced to be decapitated by a
                    machine called the Halifax gibbet. A print of it is contained in a small book
                    called <hi rend="italic">Halifax and its Gibbet Law</hi> (1708), and in Gibson’s
                    edition of Camden’s -Sn⅛ατmiα (1722). In Germany the machine was in general use
                    during the Middle Ages, under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Diele,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Hobel,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Dolabra.</hi> Two old
                    German engravings, the one by George Penez, who died in 1550, and the other by
                    Heinrich Aldegrever, with the date 1553, represent the death of a son of Titus
                    Manlius by a similar instrument, and its employment for the execution of a
                    Spartan is the subject of the engraving of the eighteenth symbol in the volume
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Symbolicoe Quoestiones</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">Universo Genere,</hi> by Achilles Bocchi (1555). From
                    the 13th century it was used in Italy under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mannaia,</hi> for the execution of criminals of noble birth. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronique</hi><hi rend="italic">de Jean d'Anton,</hi> first
                    published in 1835, gives minute details of an execution in which it was employed
                    at Genoa in 1507; and it is elaborately described by Père Labat in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Voyage</hi><hi rend="italic">en Espagne et en Italie en</hi> 1730.
                    It is mentioned by Puységur in his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> as in use in
                    the south of France, and he describes the execution by it of Marshal Montmorency
                    at Toulouse in 1632. For about a century it had, however, fallen into general
                    disuse on the Continent; and Dr Guillotine, who first suggested its use in
                    modern times, is said to have obtained his information regarding it from the
                    description of an execution that took place at Milan in 1702, contained in an
                    anonymous work entitled <hi rend="italic">Voyage</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Historique et</hi><hi rend="italic">Politique de Suisse,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d'Italie, et T Allemagne.</hi></p>
                <p>Guillotine, who was born at Saintes, May 28, 1738, and elected to the Constituent
                    Assembly in 1789, brought forward on the 1st December of that year two
                    propositions regarding capital punishment, the second of which was that, “in all
                    cases of capital punishment it shall be of the same kind—that is,
                    decapitation—and it shall be executed by means of a machine.” The reasons urged
                    in support of this proposition were that in cases of capital punishment the
                    privilege of execution by decapitation should no longer be confined to the
                    nobles, and that it was desirable to render the process of execution as swift
                    and painless as possible. The debate was brought to a sudden termination in
                    peals of laughter caused by an indiscreet reference of Dr Guillotine to his
                    machine,, but his ideas seem gradually to have leavened the minds, of the
                    assembly, and after various debates decapitation was adopted as the method of
                    execution in the penal code which became law on the 6th October 1791. At first
                    it was intended that decapitation should be by the sword, but on account of a
                    memorandum by M. Sanson, the executioner, pointing out the expense and certain
                    other inconveniences attending that method, the assembly referred the question
                    to a committee, at whose request Dr Antoine Louis, secretary to the academy of
                    surgeons, prepared a memorandum on the subject. Without mentioning the name of
                    Guillotine, it recommended the adoption of an instrument similar to that which
                    was formerly suggested by him. The assembly decided in favour of the report, and
                    the contract was offered to the person who usually provided the instruments of
                    justice; but,as his terms were considered exorbitant, an agreement was
                    ultimately come to with a German of the name of Schmidt, who, under the
                    direction of M. Louis, furnished a machine for each of the French departments.
                    After satisfactory experiments had been made with the machine on several dead
                    bodies in the hospital of Bicêtre, it was erected on the Place de Grève for the
                    execution of the highwayman Pelletier on the 25th April 1792. While the
                    experiments regarding the machine were being carried on, it received the name
                    <hi rend="italic">Louisette</hi> or <hi rend="italic">La Petite Louison,</hi>
                    but the mind of the nation seems soon to have reverted to Guillotine, who first
                    suggested its use; and in the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Revolutions de
                    Paris</hi> for 28th April 1792, it is mentioned as <hi rend="italic">la
                    guillotine,</hi> a name which it thenceforth bore both popularly and officially.
                    In 1795 the question was much debated as to whether or not death by the
                    guillotine was instantaneous, and in support of the negative side the case of
                    Charlotte Corday was adduced whose countenance, it is said, blushed as if with
                    indignation when the executioner, holding up the head to the public gaze, struck
                    it with his fist. The connexion of the instrument with the horrors of the
                    Revolution has hindered its introduction into other countries, but in 1853 it
                    was adopted under the name of <hi rend="italic">Fallschwert</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Fallbeil</hi> by the kingdom of Saxony, and it has been
                    subsequently introduced into several other German states. It has often been
                    stated that Dr Guillotine perished by the instrument which bears his name, but
                    it is beyond question, that he survived the Revolution, and died a natural death
                    in 1814.</p>
