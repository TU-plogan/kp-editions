                    Arsacides, being the son of a certain Prince Anak, who assassinated Chosroes of
                    Armenia, and thus brought ruin on himself and his family. His mother’s name was
                    Okohe, and the Armenian biographers tell how the first Christian influence he
                    received was at the time of his conception, which took place near the monument
                    raised to the memory of the holy apostle Thaddeus. Educated by a Christian
                    nobleman, Euthalius, in Caesarea in Cappadocia, Gregory sought, when he came to
                    man’s estate, to introduce the Christian doctrine into his native land. At that
                    time Tiridates I., a son of Chosroes, sat on the throne, and, influenced partly
                    it may be by the fact that Gregory was the son of his father’s enemy, he
                    subjected him to much cruel usage, and imprisoned him for fourteen years. It
                    would he useless to relate the various forms of torture which the orthodox
                    accounts represent the saint to have endured without permanent hurt; almost any
                    one of his twelve trials would have been certain death to an ordinary mortal.
                    But vengeance and madness fell on the king, and at length Gregory was called
                    forth from his pit to restore his royal persecutor to reason by virtue of his
                    saintly intercession. The cause of Christianity was now secured; king and
                    princes and people vied with each other in obedience to Gregory’s instruction,
                    and convents, churches, and schools were established. Gregory in 302 received
                    consecration as patriarch of Armenia from Leontius of Caesarea, and in 318 he
                    appointed his son Aristax to be his successor. About 331 he withdrew to a cave
                    in the mountain Sebuh in the province of Daranalia in Upper Armenia, and there
                    he died a few years afterwards unattended and unobserved. When it was discovered
                    that he was dead his corpse was removed to the village of Thordanum or Thortan.
                    The remains of the saint were scattered far and near in the reign of Zeno. His
                    head is said to be now in Italy, his right hand at Etchmiadzin, and his left at
                    Sis. It is almost impossible to get at Gregory’s real personality through the
                    tangled growth of ecclesiastical legend; but he would appear to have possessed
                    some of that consideration for expediency which is so frequently of service to
                    the reformer. While he did his best to undermine their system, he left the pagan
                    priests in enjoyment of their accustomed revenues.</p>
                <p>A number of homffies, possibly spurious, several prayers, and about thirty of the
                    canons of the Armenian Church are ascribed te Gregory. The homilies appeared for
                    the first time in a work called <hi rend="italic">Hαsehαehαpαdαm</hi> at
                    Constantinople in 1737; a century afterwards a Greek translation was published

                    Μ. Schmid (Ratisbon, 1872). The original authorities for Gregory’s life are
