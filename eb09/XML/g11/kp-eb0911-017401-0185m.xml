                    of Embermesnil and professor at the college of Pont-à-Mousson. In 1783 he was
                    crowned by the academy of Nancy for his <hi rend="italic">Éloge</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la</hi><hi rend="italic">Poesie,</hi> and in 1788 by that of
                    Metz for an <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic">la
                    regeneration</hi><hi rend="italic">physique et morale des Juifs.</hi> He was
                    chosen in 1789 by the clergy of the district of Nancy to represent them in the
                    states-general, where he took a leading part in the deliberations, and gave
                    energetic support to the republicans. Along with four other curés he abandoned
                    his order and joined that of the <hi rend="italic">tiers etat</hi>; he presided
                    at the permanent sitting of sixty-two hours while the Bastile was being attacked
                    by the people, and made a vehement speech against the enemies of the republic;
                    and he subsequently took a prominent share in abolishing the privileges of birth
                    and religion. Under the new constitution of the clergy he was chosen bishop by
                    the department of Loir-et-Cher, taking the title of bishop of Blois. As a member
                    of the national assembly he proposed the motion for the abolition of the kingly
                    office, which was carried by acclamation. During the trial of Louis XVI., being
                    absent with other three colleagues on a mission for the union of Saxony to
                    France, he along with them wrote a letter urging the condemnation of the king,
                    but omitting the words <hi rend="italic">à mort</hi>; and he endeavoured to save
                    the life of the king by proposing in the assembly that the penalty of death be
                    suspended. His subsequent action was very influential in moderating extreme
                    republican views: he opposed the national renunciation of Christianity, and was
                    the first to advocate the reopening of the churches; exerted himself to get
                    measures put in execution for restraining the vandalistιc fury against the
                    monuments of art; extended his protection to artists and men of letters, and
                    obtained for them pecuniary encouragement from the state; and devoted much of
                    his attention to the reorganization of the public libraries, the establishment
                    of botanic gardens, and the improvement of technical education. He also took a
                    great interest in negro emancipation, and on his motion men of colour in the
                    French colonies were admitted to the same rights as whites. On the establishment
                    of the new constitution, Grégoire was elected to the council of 500, and after
                    the 18th Brumaire he became a member of the new legislative assembly. In this
                    capacity he voted in the minority of five against the proclamation of the
                    empire, and opposed the creation of the new nobility and the divorce of Napoleon
                    from Josephine; but notwithstanding this he was subsequently created a count of
                    the empire and officer of the legion of honour. During the later years of
                    Napoleon’s reign he travelled in England and Germany, but in 1814 he had
                    returned to France and was one of the chief instigators of the action that was
                    taken against the empire. After the second restoration he was excluded from the
                    Institute, and when in 1819 he was elected to the assembly by the department of
                    Isère, his election was annulled. From that time, therefore, he lived in
                    retirement, occupying himself in literary pursuits and conducting a voluminous
                    correspondence with most of the eminent savants of Europe; but as he had been
                    deprived of his bishopric and of his pension as a senator, he was compelled to
                    sell his library to obtain the means of support. He died at Paris, May 20, 1831.
                    As he had remained steadfast to his republican principles the ecclesiastical
                    authorities refused him the last offices of religion, and the rites of Christian
                    sepulture, but through the intervention of the civil power mass was said over
                    his body in the church of the Abbaye aux Bois by a proscribed priest; and after
                    the hearse set out from the church the populace unyoked the horses and
                    themselves drew it to the cemetery of Mont Parnasse. Grégoire forms a striking
                    exception to most of the French <pb break="no"

                    republicanism with a moderation which sought to check every form of licence, and
                    with a steadfast adherence to the religion of which he was a priest; and it was
                    further a remarkable feature of his character that, though a sincere Roman
                    Catholic, he was thoroughly tolerant of the religious views of others.</p>
