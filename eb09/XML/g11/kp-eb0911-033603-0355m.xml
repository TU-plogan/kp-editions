                    Forfarshire, on July 12, 1803. He entered the university of Edinburgh at the

                    preacher in connexion with the Church of Scotland; but it was not till 1830 that
                    he was inducted to his first charge, Arbirlot, in Forfarshire, where he laboured
                    for seven years. In 1837 he became the colleague of the Rev. John Sym in the
                    pastorate of Old Greyfriars, Edinburgh, and at once attracted notice as a great
                    pulpit orator. Towards the close of 1840 Guthrie was chosen minister of St
                    John’s Church, Victoria Street, Edinburgh. His increasing popularity brought him
                    flattering invitations both from London and from India; but these he firmly
                    declined. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the movement which led to the
                    Disruption of 1843; and his name is thenceforth associated with the Free Church.
                    In 1847 he began the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0356-0337"/> greatest work of his life by the publication of
                    his first <hi rend="italic">Plea for Ragged Schools.</hi> This pamphlet, amid a
                    multitude of other encomiums, elicited a beautiful and sympathetic letter from
                    Lord Jeffrey. A ragged school was opened on the Castle Hill, which has been the
                    parent of many similar institutions elsewhere. Guthrie insisted on bringing up
                    all the children in his school as Protestants; and he thus made his ragged
                    schools not only educational but proselytizing institutions. This interference
                    with religious liberty led to some controversy; and ultimately those who
                    differed from Guthrie founded the United Industrial School, which is managed on
                    the principle of combined secular and separate religious instruction. In April
                    1847 the degree of D.D. was conferred on Guthrie by the university of Edinburgh;
                    and in 1850 Dr Hanna, the biographer of Dr Chalmers, was inducted as his
                    colleague in Free St John’s Church.</p>
                <p>In 1850 Guthrie published <hi rend="italic">A Plea on behalf of Drunkards and
                    against Drunkenness,</hi> which was followed by <hi rend="italic">The Gospel in
                    Ezekiel</hi> (1855); <hi rend="italic">The City, its Sins and Sorrows</hi>
                    (1857); <hi rend="italic">Christ and the Inheritance of the Saints</hi> (1858);
                    <hi rend="italic">Seedtime and Harvest of Ragged Schools</hi> (1860), consisting
                    of his three <hi rend="italic">Pleas for Ragged Schools·,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Way to Life</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Speaking to the
                    Heart</hi> (1862). These works had an enormous sale, and carried his fame to
                    distant parts of the world. Portions of them were translated into French and
                    Dutch. In 1862 he was moderator of the Free Church General Assembly; but he
                    seldom took a prominent part in the business of the Church courts. In connexion
                    with the total abstinence movement he often appeared on the platform, where his
                    oratorical talents, rich humour, genuine pathos, and inimitable power of
                    storytelling eminently qualified him to shine. He was also greatly interested in
                    the work of the Evangelical Alliance, of which he was one of the
                    vice-presidents. In 1864, his health being seriously impaired, he resigned
                    public work as pastor of Free St John’s (May 17), although his nominal connexion
                    with the congregation ceased only with his death. Guthrie had occasionally
                    contributed papers to <hi rend="italic">Good Words,</hi> and, about the time of
                    his retirement from the ministry, he became editor of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sunday Magazine,</hi> himself contributing several series of papers which were
                    afterwards published separately. In 1865 he was presented with &lt;£5000 as a
                    mark of appreciation from the public. His closing years were spent mostly in
                    retirement; and after an illness of several months’ duration he died at St
                    Leonard’s-on-Sea, February 24, 1873.</p>
                <p>Dr Guthrie's fame rests on his labours as a social reformer and his extraordinary
                    oratorical power as a preacher and platform speaker. He will always be
                    remembered as one of the most successful and warm-hearted of Christian
                    philanthropists; and his influence over the masses of his countrymen was very
                    great. His theology was the moderate Calvinism generally accepted by the
                    Evangelical school. His style is distinguished by great graphic power /nd
                    richness of illustration; but, although admirably adapted for effect on a
                    popular audience, it is far too florid and Asiatic in its rhetoric to please a
                    sound literary critic.</p>
