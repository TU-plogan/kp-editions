                    travellers, in September 1799, to a cave near Caripé (at that time a monastery
                    of Aragonese Capuchins) in the Venezuelan province of Cumanâ on the northern
                    coast of South America. A few years later it was discovered, says Latham <hi

                    by the receipt of specimens procured at Sarayacu in Ecuador, Caxamarca in the

                    much greater than had been supposed. The singularity of its structure, its
                    curious habits, and its peculiar economical value have naturally attracted no
                    little attention, and it has formed the subject of investigation by a
                    considerable number of zoologists both British and foreign. First referring it
                    to the genus <hi rend="italic">Caprimulgus,</hi> its original describer soon saw
                    that it was no true Goatsucker. It was subsequently separated as forming a
                    Subfamily, and has at last been regarded as the type of a distinct Family, <hi

                    >—</hi> a view which, though not put forth till 1870 <hi rend="italic">(Zook
                    Record,</hi> vi. p. 67), seems now to be generally deemed correct. Its
                    systematic position, however, can scarcely be considered settled, for though on
                    the whole its predominat ing alliance may be with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cajnjmulgidoe,</hi> nearly as much affinity may be traced to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Strigidoe,</hi> while it possesses some characters in which it
                    differs from both <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1873, pp.
                    526-535). About as big as a Crow, its plumage exhibits the blended tints of
                    chocolate-colour and grey, barred and pencilled with dark brown or black, and
                    spotted in places with white, that prevail in the two families just named. The
                    beak is hard, strong, and deeply notched, the nostrils are prominent, and the
                    gape is furnished with twelve long hairs on each side. The legs and toe3 are
                    comparatively feeble, but the wings are large. In habits the Guacharo is wholly
                    nocturnal, slumbering by day in deep and dark caverns which it frequents in vast
                    numbers. Towards evening it arouses itself, and, with croaking and clattering
                    which has been likened to that of castanets, it approaches the exit of its
                    retreat, whence at nightfall it issues in search of its food, which, so far as
                    is known, consists entirely of oily nuts or fruits, belonging especially to the
                    genera <hi rend="italic">Achras, Aiphanas,</hi><hi rend="italic">Loeurus,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Psichotma,</hi> some of them sought, it would seem, at a
                    very great distance, for M. Funck <hi rend="italic">(BuU. Acad. Sc.
                    Bruxelles,</hi> xi. pt. 2, pp. 371 — 377) states that in the stomach of one he
                    obtained at Caripé he found the seed of a tree which he believed did not grow
                    nearer than 80 leagues. The bard, indigestible seeds swallowed by the Guacharo
                    are found in quantities on the floor and the ledges of the caverns it frequents,
                    where many of them for a time vegetate, the plants thus growing being etiolated
                    from want of light, and, according to travellers, forming a singular feature of
                    the gloomy scene which these places present. The Guacharo is said to build a
                    bowl-like nest of clay, in which it lays from two to four white eggs, with a
                    smooth but lustreless surface, resembling those of some Owls. The young soon
                    after they are hatched become a perfect mas3 of fat, and while yet in the nest
                    are sought by the Indians, who at Caripé, and perhaps elsewhere, make a special
                    business of taking them and extracting the oil they contain. This is done about
                    midsummer, when by the aid of torches and long poles many thousands of the young
                    birds are slaughtered, while their parents in alarm and rage hover over the
                    destroyers’ heads, uttering harsh and deafening cries. The grease is melted over
                    fires kindled at the cavern’s mouth, run into earthen pots, and preserved for
                    use in cooking as well as for the lighting of lamps. It is said to be pure and
                    limpid, free from any disagreeable taste or smell, and capable of being kept for
                    a year without turning rancid. In Trinidad the young are esteemed a great
                    delicacy for the table by many, though some persons object to their peculiar
                    scent, which, says Léotaud <hi rend="italic">(Ois.</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    la</hi><hi rend="italic">Trinidad,</hi> p. 68) resembles that of a Cockroach <hi

                    also, according to Mr E. C. Taylor <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1864, p. 90)
                    have a strong Crow-like odour. But one species of the genus <hi rend="italic"
