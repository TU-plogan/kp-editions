                <p>HORACE GREELEY, an eminent American editor, was born at Amherst, New Hampshire,
                    February 3, 1811. His parents were of Scotch-Irish descent, but the ancestors of
                    both had been in New England for several generations. He was the third of seven
                    children. His father, Zaccheus Greeley, owned a farm of 50 acres of stony,
                    sterile land, from which a bare support was wrung. Horace was a feeble and
                    precocious lad, taking little interest in the ordinary sports of childhood,
                    learning to read before he was able to talk plainly, and being the prodigy of
                    the neighbourhood for accurate spelling. Before he was ten years old his father,
                    through bad management and endorsing for his neighbours, became bankrupt, and
                    his home wa3 sold by the sheriff, while Zaccheus Greeley himself fled the State
                    to escape arrest for debt. The family soon removed to West Haven, Vermont,
                    where, all working together, they made a scanty living as day labourers. Horace
                    Greeley from childhood desired to be a printer, and, when barely eleven years
                    old, tried to be taken as an apprentice in a village office, but was rejected on
                    account of his youth. After three years more with the family as a day labourer
                    at West Haven, he succeeded, with his father’s consent, in being apprenticed in
                    the office of <hi rend="italic">The Northern Spectator,</hi> at East Poultney,
                    Vermont. Here he soon became a good workman, developed a passion for politics,
                    and especially for political statistics, came to be depended upon for more or
                    less of the editing of the paper, and was a figure in the village debating
                    society. He received only $40 a year, but he spent almost nothing himself, and
                    sent most of his money to his father. In his twentieth year <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Northern Spectator</hi> was suspended. Meantime his father had removed to a
                    small tract of wild land in the dense forests of Western Pennsylvania, 30 miles
                    from Erie. The released apprentice now visited his parents, and worked for a
                    little time with them on the farm, meanwhile seeking employment in various
                    printing offices, and, when he got it, giving nearly his whole earnings to his
                    father. At last, with no further prospect of work nearer home, he started for
                    New York. He travelled on foot and by canal-boat, entering New York in August
                    1831, with all his clothes in a bundle carried over his back with a stick, and
                    with but $10 in his pocket. More than half of this sum was exhausted while he
                    made vain efforts to find employment. Many refused, in the belief that he was a
                    runaway apprentice, and his poor, ill-fitting apparel and rustic look were
                    everywhere greatly against him. At last he found work on a 32mo New Testament,
                    set in agate, double columns, with a middle column of notes in pearl. It was so
                    difficult and so poorly paid that other printers had all abandoned it. He barely
                    succeeded in making enough to pay his board bill, but he finished the task, and
                    thus found subsequent employment easier to get.</p>
                <p>In January 1833 Greeley formed a partnership with Francis V. Story, a
                    fellow-workman. Their combined capital amounted to $150. Procuring their type on
                    credit, they opened a small office, an&lt;l undertook the printing of the first
                    cheap paper published in New York. Its projector, Dr H. D. Sheppard, meant to
                    sell it for one cent, but under the arguments of Greeley lie was persuaded to
                    fix the price at two cents. The paper failed in three weeks, the printers only
                    losing $50 or $60 by the experiment. They still had a “Bank Note Reporter” to
                    print, and soon got some lottery printing. Within six months Story was drowned,
                    but his brother-in-law, James Winchester, took his place in the firm. Greeley
                    waβ now asked by James Gordon Bennett to go into partnership with him in
                    starting <hi rend="italic">The Herald.</hi> He declined the venture, but
                    recommended the partner whom Bennett subsequently took. On the 22d of March
                    1834, Greeley and Winchester issued the first number of <hi rend="italic">The
                    New Yorker,</hi> a weekly literary and news paper, the firm then supposing
                    itself to be worth about $3000. Of the first number they sold about 100 copies;
                    of the second, nearly 200. There was an average increase for the next month of
                    about 100 copies per week. The second volume began with a circulation of about
                    4550 copies, and with a loss on the first year’s publication of $3000. The
                    second year ended with 7000 subscribers, and a further loss of $2000. By the end
                    of the third year <hi rend="italic">The New Yorker</hi> had reached a
                    circulation of 9500 copies, and a total loss of $7000. It was published nearly
                    seven years and was never profitable, but it was widely popular, and it gave
                    Greeley, who was its sole editor, much prominence. On the 5th of July 1836
                    Greeley married Miss Mary Y. Cheney, a Connecticut school teacher, whom he had
                    met in a Grahamite (vegetarian) boarding-house in New York.</p>
                <p>During the publication of <hi rend="italic">The New Yorker</hi> he added to the
                    scanty income which the job printing brought him by supplying editorials to <hi
                    rend="italic">The Daily Whig</hi> and various other publications. 1 n 1838 he
                    had gained such standing as a writer that he was selected by Thurlow Weed,
                    William H. Seward, and other leaders of the Whig party, for the editorship of a
                    campaign paper entitled <hi rend="italic">The Jeffersonian,</hi> published at
                    Albany. He continued <hi rend="italic">The New Yorker,</hi> and travelled
                    between Albany and New York each week to edit the two papers. <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Jeffersonian</hi> was a quiet and instructive τather than a vehement
                    campaign sheet, and the Whigs believed that it had a great effect upon the
                    elections of the next year. When, on the 2d of May 1840, some time after the
                    nomination by the Whig party of William Henry Harrison for the Presidency,
                    Greeley began <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n172/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0172-0161"/> the publication of a new weekly campaign paper,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Log Cabin,</hi> it sprang at once into a great
                    circulation; 48,000 copies of the first number were sold, and it finally rose to
                    90,000. It was considered a brilliant political success, but it was not
                    profitable. On April 3, 1841, Greeley announced that on the following Saturday
                    he would begin the publication of a daily newspaper of the same general
                    principles, to be called <hi rend="italic">The Tribune.</hi> He was now entirely
                    without money. From a personal friend, Mr James Coggeshall, he borrowed $1000,
                    on which capital and the editor’s reputation <hi rend="italic">The Tribune</hi>
                    was founded. It began with 600 subscribers. The first week’s expenses were $525
                    and the receipts $92. By the end of the fourth week it had run up a circulation
                    of 6000, and by the seventh reached 11,000, which was then the full capacity of
                    its press. It was alert, cheerful, and aggressive, was greatly helped by the
                    attacks of rival papers, and promised success almost from the start.</p>
                <p>From this time Greeley was popularly identified with <hi rend="italic">The
                    Tribune,</hi> and its share in the public discussion of the time is his history.
                    It soon became moderately prosperous, and his assured income should have placed
                    him beyond pecuniary worry. In a period of twenty-four years <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Tribune</hi> divided between its owners the sum of $1,240,000, besides a
                    surplus of $381,939 earned and invested in real estate and improved machinery.
                    The average annual dividend on each share (representing <hi rend="subscript">
                    τ</hi> ⅞- <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>- of the property) was $516.66. Greeley’s
                    income was long above $15,000 per year, frequently as much as $35,000 or more.
                    But (he lacked business thrift, inherited a disposition to endorse for his
                    friends, and was often unable to distinguish between deserving applicants for
                    aid and adventurers. He was thus frequently straitened, and, as his necessities
                    pressed, he sold successive interests in his newspaper. At the outset he owned
                    the whole of it. When it was already clearly established, he took in Thomas M ’
                    Elrath as an equal partner, upon the contribution of $2000 to the common fund.
                    By the 1st of January 1849 he had reduced his interest to 31 ⅜ shares out of
                    100; by July 2, 1860, to 15 shares; in 1868 he owned only 9; and in 1872, only
                    6. In 1867 the stock sold for $6500 per share, and his last sale was for $9600.
                    He bought wild lands, took stock in mining companies, desiccated egg companies,
                    patent looms, photo-lithographic companies, gave away profusely, lent to
                    plausible rascals, and was the ready prey of every new inventor who chanced to
                    find him with money or with property that he could readily convert into
                    money.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of 1851 Greeley merged his weekly papers, <hi rend="italic">The Log
                    Cabin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The New Yorker,</hi> into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Weekly Tribune,</hi> which soon attained as wide circulation as its
                    predecessors, and was much more profitable. It rose in a time of great political
                    excitement to a total circulation of a quarter of a million, and it sometimes
                    had for successive years 140,000 to 150,000. For several years it was rarely
                    much below 100,000. Its subscribers were found throughout all quarters of the
                    northern half of the Union from Maine to Oregon, large packages going to remote
                    rural districts beyond the Mississippi or Missouri, whose only connexion with
                    the outside world was through a weekly or semi-weekly mail. The readers of this
                    weekly paper acquired a personal affection for Its editor, and he was thus for
                    many years the American writer most widely known and most popular among the
                    rural classes. The circulation of <hi rend="italic">The Daily Tribune</hi> was
                    never proportionately great— its advocacy of a protective tariff, prohibitory
                    liquor legislation, and other peculiarities, repelling a large support which it
                    might otherwise have commanded in New York. It rose within a short time after
                    its establishment to a circulation of 20,000, reached 50,000 and 60,000 during
                    the war for the Union, and thereafter ranged at from 30,000 to 45,000. A
                    semi-weekly edition was also planted, which ultimately reached a steady
                    circulation of from 15,000 to 25,000.</p>
                <p>From the outset it was a cardinal principle with Greeley to hear all sides, and
                    to extend a special hospitality to new ideas. In <hi rend="italic">The
                    Tribune's</hi> first year it began to give one column daily to a discussion of
                    the doctrines of Charles Fourier, contributed by Albert Brisbane. Gradually
                    Greeley came to advocate some of these doctrines editorially. In 1846 he had a
                    sharp discussion upon them with a former subordinate, Henry J. Raymond, then
                    employed upon a rival journal. It continued through twelve articles on each
                    side, and was subsequently published in book form. Greeley became personally
                    interested in one of the Fourierite associations, the American Phalanx, at Red
                    Bank, N. J. (1843-50), while the influence of his discussions doubtless led to
                    other socialistic experiments. One of these was that at Brook Farm, which
                    embraced Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne among its members. When
                    this was abandoned, its president, George Ripley, with one or two other members,
                    sought employment from Greeley upon <hi rend="italic">The Tribune.</hi> Greeley
                    dissented from many of Fourier’s propositions, and in later years was careful to
                    explain that the principle of association for the common good of working men and
                    the elevation of labour was the chief feature which attracted him. Co-operation
                    among working men he continued to urge throughout his life. In 1848 the Fox
                    Sisters, on his wife’s invitation, spent some time at his house. His attitude
                    toward their “rappings” and “spiritual manifestations” was one of observation
                    and inquiry; and, while he never pronounced all the manifestations fraudulent,
                    he distrusted most of them, and declared that as yet he saw no good in them, and
                    nothing specially requiring the attention of intelligent men. From boyhood he
                    had believed in a protective tariff, and throughout his active life he was its
                    most trenchant advocate and propagandist. Besides constantly urging it in the
                    columns of <hi rend="italic">The Tribune,</hi> he appeared as early as 1843 in a
                    public debate on “The Grounds of Protection,” with Samuel J. Tilden and Parke
                    Godwin as his opponents. A series of popular essays on the subject were
                    published over his own signature in <hi rend="italic">The Tribune</hi> in 1869,
                    and subsequently republished in book form, with a title-page describing
                    protection to home industry as a system of national co-operation for the
                    elevation of labour. He opposed woman suffrage on the ground that the majority
                    of women did not want it and never would, but aided practical efforts for
                    extending the sphere of woman’s employments. He opposed the theatres, and for a
                    time refused to publish their advertisements. He held the most rigid views on
                    the sanctity of marriage and against easy divorce, and vehemently defended them
                    in controversies with Robert Dale Owen and others. He practised and
                    pertinaciously advocated total abstinence from spirituous liquors, but did not
                    regard prohibitory laws as always wise. He denounced the repudiation of State
                    debts oι <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> the failure to pay interest on them. He
                    was zealous for Irish repeal, once held a place in the “Directory of the Friends
                    of Ireland,” and contributed liberally to its support. He used the occasion of
                    Dickens’s first visit to America to urge international copyright, and was one of
                    the few editors to avoid alike the flunkeyism with which Dickens was first
                    received, and the ferocity with which he was assailed after the publication of
                    his <hi rend="italic">American Notes.</hi> On the occasion of Dickens’s second
                    visit to America Greeley presided at the great banquet given him by the press of
                    the country’. He made the first elaborate reports of popular scientific lectures
                    by Agassiz and other authorities. He gave ample hearing to the advocates of
                    phonography and of phonetic spelling. He was one of the most conspicuous
                    advocates of the Pacific railroads, and of many other internal improvements.</p>
                <p>But it is as an anti-slavery leader, and as perhaps the chief agency in educating
                    the mass of the Northern people to that opposition through legal forms to the
                    extension of slavery which culminated in the election of Abraham Lincoln and the
                    War of the Rebellion, that Greeley’s main work was done. Incidents in it were
                    his vehement opposition to the Mexican war as a scheme for more slave territory,
                    the assault made upon him in Washington by Congressman Albert Rust of Arkansas
                    in 1856, an indictment in Virginia in the same year for circulating incendiary
                    documents, perpetual denunciation of him in Southern newspapers and speeches,
                    and the hostility of the Abolitionists, who regarded his course as too
                    conservative. His anti-slavery work culminated in his appeal to President
                    Lincoln, entitled “The Prayer of Twenty Millions,” in which he urged “that all
                    attempts to put down the rebellion and at the same time uphold its inciting
                    cause” were “preposterous and futile,” and that “every hour of deference to
                    slavery” was “an hour of added and deepened peril to the Union.” President
                    Lincoln in his reply said :—“My paramount object is to save the Union, and not
                    either to save or destroy slavery. . . . What I do about slavery and the
                    coloured race, I do because I believe it helps to save this Union; and what I
                    forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union
                    I</p>
                <p>have here stated my purpose according to my views of official duty; and I intend
                    no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could
                    be free.” Precisely’ one month after the date of this reply the Emancipation
                    Proclamation was issued.</p>
                <p>Greeley’s political activity, first as a Whig, and then as one of the founders of
                    the Republican party, was incessant; but he held few offices. In 1848-9 he
                    served a three months’ term in Congress, filling a vacancy. He introduced the
                    first bill for giving small tracts of Government land free to actual settlers,
                    and published an exposure of abuses in the allowance of mileage to members,
                    which corrected the evil but brought him much personal obloquy. In the National
                    Republican Convention in 1860, not being sent by the Republicans of his own
                    State on account of his opposition to Governor Seward as a candidate, he was
                    made a delegate for Oregon. His active hostility to Seward did much to prevent
                    the success of that statesman, and to bring about instead the nomination of
                    Abraham Lincoln. This was attributed by his opponents to personal motives, and a
                    letter from Greeley to Seward, the publication of which he challenged, was
                    produced, to show that in his struggling days he had been wounded at Seward’s
                    failure to offer him office. In 1861 he was a candidate for United States
                    Senator, his principal opponent being William Μ. Evarts. When it was clear that
                    Mr Evarts could not be elected, his supporters threw their votes for a third
                    candidate, Ira Harris, who was thus chosen over Greeley by a small majority. At
                    the outbreak of the war he favoured allowing the Southern States to secede,
                    provided a majority of their people at a fair election should so decide,
                    declaring ‘ ‘ that <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0173-0162"/> he hoped never to live in a Republic whereof one
                    section was pinned to the other by bayonets.” When the war began he urged the
                    most vigorous prosecution of it. The “On to Richmond” appeal, which appeared day
                    after day in <hi rend="italic">The Tribune,</hi> was incorrectly attributed to
                    him, and it did not wholly meet his approval; but after the defeat at Bull Run
                    he was widely blamed for it. In 1864 he urged negotiations for peace with
                    representatives of the Southern Confederacy in Canada, and was seDt by President
                    Lincoln to confer with them. They were found to have no sufficient authority. In
                    1864 he was one of the Lincoln Presidential electors for New York. At the close
                    of the war, contrary to the general feeling of his party, he urged universal
                    amnesty and impartial suffrage as the basis of reconstruction. In 1867 his
                    friends again wished to elect him to the Senate of the United States, and the
                    indications were all in his favour. But he refused to be elected under any
                    misapprehension of his attitude, and with what his friends thought unnecessary
                    candour restated his obnoxious views on universal amnesty at length, just before
                    the time for the election, with the certainty that this would prevent his
                    success. Some months later he signed the bail bond of Jefferson Davis, and this
                    provoked a torrent of public indignation. He had written a popular history of
                    the late war, the first volume having an immense sale and bringing him unusually
                    large profits. The second was just issued, and the subscribers, in their anger,
                    refused by thousands to receive it. The Union League Club, of New York, gave him
                    notice, through its President, John Jay, of a special meeting called to consider
                    his conduct. In an indignant letter he refused to attend the meeting, and
                    challenged the club to a direct issue. “Your attempt,” he wrote, “to base a
                    great, enduring party on the hate and wrath necessarily engendered by a bloody
                    civil war is as though you should plant a colony on an iceberg which had somehow
                    drifted into a tropical ocean. I tell you here that, out of a life earnestly
                    devoted to the good of human kind, your children will select my going to
                    Richmond and signing that bail bond as the wisest act. .... All I care for is
                    that you make this a square, stand-up fight, and record your judgment by yeas
                    and nays. I care not how few vote with me, nor how many vote against me; for I
                    know that the latter will repent it in dust and ashes before three years have
                    passed.”</p>
                <p>The effort to expel him failed. In 1867 he was elected delegate at large to the
                    Convention for the revision of the State constitution. In 1869 he was the
                    Republican candidate for State Controller. There was no hope that any one on the
                    ticket that year could be elected, but he received more votes than most of his
                    associates. In 1870 he was nominated for Congress in a Democratic district. His
                    illness prevented his making any canvass, but his nomination reduced the
                    Democratic majority from 2700 two years before to about 1000, and he ran 300
                    ahead of the Republican candidate for Governor.</p>
                <p>He was dissatisfied with the conduct of General Grant’s administration, and
                    became its sharp critic. The discontent which he did much to develop ended in
                    the organization of the “Liberal Republican” party, which held its National
                    Convention at Cincinnati in 1872, and was confidently expected to nominate
                    Charles Francis Adams for the presidency. Greeley, however, had unexpected
                    strength, especially among the Southern delegates, and on the sixth ballot
                    received 332 votes against 324 for Adams,—immediate changes reducing the Adams
                    vote still further, so that as the ballot was recorded it stood—Greeley, 482;
                    Adams, 187. For a time the tide of feeling ran strongly in his favour. It was
                    first checked by the action of his life-long opponents, the Democrats, who also
                    nominated him at their National Convention. He expected their support, on
                    account of his attitude towards the South and hostility to Grant, but he thought
                    it a mistake to give him their formal nomination. The event proved his wisdom.
                    Many Republicans who had sympathized with his criticisms of the administration,
                    and with the declaration of principles adopted at the first convention, were
                    repelled by the coalition. This feeling grew stronger until the election. His
                    old party associates regarded him as a renegade, and the Democrats gave him a
                    half-hearted support. The tone of the canvass was one of unusual bitterness,
                    amounting sometimes to actual ferocity. In August, on representations of the
                    alarming state of the contest, he took the field in person, and made a series of
                    αampaign speeches, beginning in New England and extending throughout
                    Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, which aroused great enthusiasm, and were
                    regarded at the time by both friends and opponents as the most brilliant
                    continuous exhibition of varied intellectual power ever made by a candidate in a
                    presidential canvass. General Grant received in the election 3,597,070 votes,
                    Greeley 2,834,079. The only States Greeley carried were Georgia, Kentucky,
                    Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas.</p>
                <p>He had resigned his editorship of <hi rend="italic">The Tribune</hi> immediately
                    after the nomination; he now resumed it cheerfully; but it was soon apparent
                    that his powers had been overstrained. For years he had suffered greatly from
                    sleeplessness. During the intense excitement of the campaign the difficulty was
                    increased. Returning from his campaign tour, he went immediately to the bedside
                    of his dying wife, and for some weeks had practically no sleep at all. This
                    resulted in an inflammation of the upper membrane of the brain, delirium, and.
                    death. He expired on the 29th of November 1872. His funeral was a simple but
                    impressive public pageant. The body lay in state in the City Hall, where it was
                    surrounded by crowds of many thousands. The ceremonies were attended by the
                    president and vice-president of the United States, the chief-justice of the
                    supreme court, and a large number of eminent public men of both parties, who
                    followed the hearse in a solemn procession, preceded by the mayor and other
                    civic authorities, down Broadway. He had been the target of constant attack
                    during his life, and his personal foibles, careless dress, and mental
                    eccentricities were the theme of endless ridicule. But his death revealed the
                    high regard in which he was generally held as a leader of opinion and faithful
                    public servant. “Our later Franklin” Whittier called him, and it is in some such
                    light his countrymen remember him.</p>
                <p>In 1851 Greeley visited Europe for the first time, serving as a juryman at the
                    Crystal Palace Exhibition, appearing before a committee of the House of Commons
                    on newspaper taxes, and urging the repeal of the stamp duty on advertisements.
                    In 1855 he made a second trip to Europe. In Paris he was arrested on the suit of
                    a sculptor, whose statue had been injured in the New York World’s Fair (of which
                    he had been a director), and spent two days in Clichy, of which he gave an
                    amusing account. In 1859 he visited California by the overland route, and had
                    numerous public receptions. In 1871 he visited Texas, and his trip through the
                    southern country, where he had once been so odious, was an ovation. About 1852
                    he purchased a farm at Chappaqua, New York, where he afterwards habitually spent
                    his Saturdays, and experimented in agriculture. He was in constant demand as a
                    lecturer from 1843, when he made his first appearance on the platform, always
                    drew large audiences, and, in spite of his bad management in money matters,
                    received considerable sums, sometimes $6000 or $7000 for a single winter’s
                    lecturing. He was also much sought for as a contributor, over his own signature,
                    to the weekly newspapers, and was sometimes largely paid for these articles. In
                    religious faith he was from boyhood a Uni versahst, and for many years a
                    conspicuous member of the leading Universalist church in New York.</p>
