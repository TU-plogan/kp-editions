                    (properly <hi rend="smallcaps">Kairawan),</hi> the Mecca of northern Africa, is
                    a city of the regency of Tunis, 30 miles inland from Susa, and about 80 miles
                    due south from the capital. It is built in an open plain a little to the west of
                    a stream which flows south to the Sidi el Heni lake. Of the luxuriant gardens
                    and olive groves which form so prominent a feature in the early Arabic accounts
                    of the place hardly a remnant has been left. The total circuit of the walls,
                    according to Edward Rae, is about 3500 yards; and the population is variously
                    estimated from 10,000 to 15,000. A little modification of the eastern wall would
                    make the plan an irregular hexagon. K air wan is emphatically a religious city:
                    no Jew is permitted to enter within its gates, and it is only at rare intervals
                    that access has been obtained by Christian travellers, though for them in
                    ordinary circumstances the real danger is reduced to a minimum. The more
                    important mosques are only s⅛ in number, but the variety of the lesser religious
                    structures is exceedingly great, and several parts of the city are crowded with
                    the tombs of saints and warriors of the Mahometan faith. In the northern quarter
                    stands the great mosque founded by Okba ibn Nâfi' el Fehri, and containing
                    within its sacred precincts the shrine of this great defender of the faith and
                    the tombs of the kings of Tunis. It has a length of 140 yards, and the
                    south-east and northeast ends measure respectively 85 and 75 yards. To the
                    outside it presents a heavy buttressed wall, with little of either grandeur or
                    grace, but in the interior, in spite of whitewash and paint, it has that
                    magnificence of marble columns which fitted it to be the prototype of the mosque
                    of Cordova. As no European footstep has traversed its arcades, the number of the
                    columns has not been ascertained, but there are at least upwards of 400 of
                    them—a mingled spoil from the Roman ruins of the surrounding country. To the
                    Mahometan mind the crowning distinction of the building is that through Divine
                    inspiration the founder was enabled to set it absolutely true to Mecca. In the
                    central aisle are two pillars between which the people believe that no person
                    with the guilt of mortal sin upon him can by any possibility pass. A unique
                    collection of ancient armour is preserved in one of the chambers. Of greater
                    external beauty than the great mosque is the mosque of the Three Gates. The
                    shrine of Sidi Ibn Tsâ is worthy of note for the peculiar conjuring performances
                    carried on every Friday by the followers of its founder; and that of <pb

                    Kairwan is now known in northern Africa rather for copper vessels, articles in
                    morocco leather, potash, and saltpetre. In almost every respect it has greatly

                <p>The Arabic historians relate the foundation of Kairwan by ’ Okba with miraculous
                    circumstances (Tabary, ii. 63; Yâkùt, iv. 213). The date is variously given (see

                        >sq.)</hi>; according to Tabary it must have been before 670.</p>
