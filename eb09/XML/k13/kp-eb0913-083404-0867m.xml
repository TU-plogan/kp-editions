                    52' and 15° 31' N. lat., and between 74° 10' and 75° 7' E. long., bounded on the
                    N. by Belgaum, E. by Dhârwâr and Mysore, S. by South Kânara, W. by the Arabian
                    sea and N. W. by the Portuguese territory of Goa, with an area of 4235 square
                    miles. The chief town is Kârwâr. The main feature in the physical geography of
                    the district is the Sahyâdri range of the Western Ghâts, which, running from
                    north to south, divides it into two parts, a lowland or coast strip (Payanghât),
                    and an upland plateau (Bâlâghât). The coast-line is only broken by the Kârwâr
                    headland in the north, and by the estuaries of four rivers and the mouths of
                    many smaller streams, through which the salt water finds an entrance into
                    numerous lagoons winding several miles inland. The breadth of the lowlands
                    varies from 5 to 15 miles. From this narrow belt rise a few smooth, flat-backed
                    hills, from 200 to 300 feet high; and at places it is crossed by lofty, rugged,
                    densely wooded spurs, which, starting from the main range of the Sahyâdri hills,
                    maintain almost to the coast a height of not less than 1000 feet. Among these
                    hills lie well-tilled valleys of garden and rice land. The plateau of the
                    Bâlâghât is irregular, varying from 1500 to 2000 feet in height. In some parts
                    the country rises into well-wooded knolls, in others it is studded by small,
                    isolated, steep hills. Except on the banks of streams and in the more open
                    glades, the whole is one broad waste of woodland and forest. The open spaces are
                    dotted with hamlets or parcelled out into rice clearings.</p>
                <p>Of the rivers flowing eastward from the watershed of the Sahyâdri hills the only
                    one of importance is the Wardha, a tributary of the Tungabhadra. Of those that
                    flow westwards, the four principal ones, proceeding from north to south, are the
                    Kâli, Gungawâli, Tadri, and Sharavati. The last of these, plunging over a cliff
                    825 feet in height, about 35 miles from Honâwar town, forms the famous Gersoppa
                    falls. The mineral products of the district consist of iron, limestone, and
                    building stone. Extensive forests clothe the Sahyâdri hills, and are conserved
                    under the rules of the forest department. During the ten years 1866-76 they
                    yielded an average annual revenue of £39,307 to the state. Tigers, leopards,
                    bears, deer, and wild hogs are numerous, and small game is plentiful. North
                    Kânara formed part of Madras till 1861, when it was transferred to Bombay
                    presidency.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 returned a population of 398,406 (206,417 males and 191,989
                    females), 94 to the square mile. The Hindus numbered 364,402; Mahometans,
                    21,755; Pârsis, 25; Christians, 12,189; and Jews, 34. The most noteworthy class
                    among the Hindus are the Havik Brahmans, who make their livelihood from spice
                    and areca nut gardens. Besides the regular Mahometan population
                    (de-scenιlants<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n868/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0868-0835"/> from Hindu converts to Islam), there are two
                    special classes of foreign Mahometans,—the Navâyâtas or seamen, representatives
                    of early colonies of Arab merchants, and the Sidis or descendants of African
                    slaves formerly owned by the Portuguese. The Christians are nearly all Roman
                    Catholics, a few families of whom are of Portuguese extraction, though much
                    mixed by intermarriage with the natives; the remainder consist of local converts
                    or their descendants.</p>
                <p>The area under cultivation is returned at 333,175 acres, or about 12 per cent, of
                    the total area. Rice forms the staple crop, but <hi rend="italic">rdgi,</hi>
                    sugar-cane, and safflower are also grown to a considerable extent; and
                    cocoa-nuts, areca-nuts, cardamoms, and pepper are produced in gardens in large
                    quantities for home consumption and for export. Cochineal is largely exported.
                    Coffee is grown only to a small extent. Kârwâr, Kumpta, Ankola, Bhatkal, and
                    Honâwar are the most important seaports. The total value of the trade at these
                    in 1876 was £1,841,173, viz., £1,199,077 exports and £642,096 imports. Carving
                    in sandal wood and ebony forms an important industrial art. Salt is largely
                    manufactured under Government supervision. The total revenue of the district in
                    1876-77 was £165,597, of which the land tax yielded £82,862, and forests
                    £34,281. There were, in 1875-76, 83 schools, attended by 4425 pupils. Fever of a
                    severe type is the prevalent disease, and occasionally rages in an epidemic
                    form. The average annual rainfall on the coast varies from 100 inches at Kârwâr
                    to 163 at Kumpta;. in the uplands it averages about 72 inches.</p>
