                    During the Chow, Suy, and T’ang dynasties (557-907) it was known as P’een-chow.
                    During the Woo-tai, or five dynasties (907-960), it was the Tung king, or
                    eastern capital. Under the Sung and Kin dynasties (960-1260) it was called
                    P’een-king. By the Yuen or Mongol dynasty (1260-1368), its name was again
                    changed to P’een-leang, and on the return of the Chinese to power with the
                    establishment of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), it was rechristened by its
                    original name of K’ai-fung. The city is situated at the point where the last
                    spur of the Kwan-lun mountain system melts away in the eastern plain, and a few
                    miles south of the Yellow river. Its position, therefore, lays it open to the
                    destructive influences of the Hwang-ho. In 1642 it was totally destroyed by a
                    flood caused by the dykes of that river bursting, and on several prior and
                    subsequent occasions it has suffered injury from the same cause. The city is
                    large and imposing-looking, with broad streets and handsome edifices, the most
                    noticeable of which are a twelve-storied pagoda 600 féet high, and a watch tower
                    from which, at a height of 200 feet, the inhabitants are able to observe the
                    approach of the yellow waters of the river in times of flood. The city wall
                    forms a substantial protection, and is pierced by five gates. The whole
                    neighbourhood, which is the site of one of the earliest settlements of the
                    Chinese in China, is full of historical associations, and it was in this city
                    that the Jews who entered China in the reign of Ming-te (58-75 A.D.) first
                    established a colony. For many centuries these people held themselves aloof from
                    the natives, and practised the rites of their religion in a temple built and
                    supported <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n857/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0857-0824"/> by themselves. Of late years, however, they have
                    fallen upon evil times, and in 1851, out of the seventy families which
                    constituted the original colony, only seven remained. For fifty years no rabbi
                    had ministered to the wants of this remnant. Their temple was in ruins, and the
                    people themselves were reduced to the lowest extreme of poverty. In 1853 the
                    city was attacked by the Tai-ping rebels, and, though at the first assault its
                    defenders successfully resisted the enemy, it was subsequently taken. With the
                    ruthlessness common to the Tai-pings the captors looted and partially destroyed
                    the town, which still retains traces of this its latest misfortune. Of the
                    population, which is probably not far short of 100,000, it is estimated that
                    two-thirds of the tradesmen, tavern keepers, educated classes, and attendants at
                    the Government offices are Mahometans. The city, which is situated in 34° 52' N.
                    lat., and 114° 33' E. long., forms also the district city of Seang-foo.</p>
