                    Hassan,—all Mysore districts; on the W. the Western Ghâts separate it from the
                    Bombay district of South Kânara.</p>
                <p>The larger portion of the district consists of the Malnâd or hill country, which
                    contains some of the wildest mountain scenery in southern India. The western
                    frontier is formed by the chain of the Ghâts, of which the highest peaks are the
                    Kuduremukh (6215 feet) and the Meruti Gudda (5451 feet). The centre of the
                    district is occupied by the horseshoe range of the Bâba Budans, containing the
                    loftiest mountain in Mysore, Mulaingiri, 6317 feet. The Maidân or plain country
                    lying beneath the amphitheatre formed by the Bâba Budan hills is the most
                    fertile portion of the district, well watered, and with the famous “black cotton
                    soil.” The principal rivers are the Tunga and Bhadra, which rise near each other
                    in the Ghâts, and unite to form the Tungabhadra, a tributary of the Kistna. The
                    eastern portion of the district is watered by the Vedavati. At the point where
                    this river leaves the Bâba Budan hills, it is embanked to form two extensive
                    tanks, which irrigate the lower valley. From all the rivers water is drawn off
                    into irrigation channels by means of anicuts or weirs. The chief natural wealth
                    of Kâdur is in its forests, which contain inexhaustible supplies of the finest
                    timber, especially teak, and also furnish shelter for the coffee plantations.
                    Iron is found and smelted at the foot of the hills, and corundum exists in
                    certain localities. Wild beasts and game are numerous, and fish are
                    abundant.</p>
                <p>The census of 1871 returned the population of the district at 332,381 (Hindus,
                    318,480; Mahometans, 12,017; Jains, 1316; Christians, 568). Only one town,
                    Tarikere, contains over 5000 inhabitants, the population in 1871 being 5302.
                    Chikmâgalûr, the headquarters of the district, has only 2027 inhabitants, and
                    Kâdûr, the old civil station, only 2733. The staple crop of the district is
                    rice, chiefly grown on the hill slopes, where the natural rainfall is
                    sufficient, or in the river valleys, where the fields -can be irrigated from
                    tanks and artificial canals. The principal unirrigated crop is <hi rend="italic"
                    >rdgi (Cynosurus coracanus),</hi> which is preferred as food by the natives to
                    rice, as affording more sustenance. The principal agricultural industry,
                    however, is coffee cultivation. The berry is stated to have been first
                    introduced by a Mahometan saint, Baba Budan, about two centuries ago, on his
                    return from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> pilgrimage to Mecca. European capital was
                    not attracted to the enterprise till about 1840, but there are now 60,000 acres
                    under coffee. The cocoa-nut and areca-nut palms flourish in the moist and
                    sheltered valleys in the west. A Government cinchona plantation has also been
                    established on the Baba Budan hills. The local manufactures include the
                    production of cotton cloth, rough blankets, and sugar, as well as oil-pressing,
                    spirit-distilling, and iron-smelting. The annual value of the district exportsis
                    estimated at £297,000, and the imports at £217,000. The revenue of the district
                    in 1873-74, excluding forests, education, and public works, was £94,316.
                    Government aided and inspected schools numbered 176 in 1874, attended by 3027
                    pupils; unaided schools, 121, with 1235 pupils. The mean annual temperature at
                    Chikmâgalûr, is about 78° F. During 1873 and 1874 the maximum recorded was 93°,
                    and the lowest 69°. In the Malnâd the temperature falls much lower, and the cold
                    at night in December and January is very sharp. The average rainfall at
                    Chikmâgalûr during the four years ending 1874 was only 36 inches; while on
                    certain coffee plantations on the Malnâd from 100 to 170 inches have been
                    registered. Jungle or malarious fevers are prevalent in the Malnâd at certain
                    seasons of the year, from which neither natives nor Europeans are exempt.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> As containing the hallowed sources of the
                    Tungabhadra, Kâdûr district abounds with scenes associated with the legends of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ràmdyana.</hi> Sringeri or Rishya-sringa-giri, on the
                    Tunga river, takes precedence of all other places in its claims to mythical
                    antiquity. Here, in historical times, was the home of Sankara Acharya, the great
                    Sivaite reformer of the 8th century; and here at the present day resides the <hi
                    rend="italic">jagat-gunι</hi> or supreme high priest of the Smarfa'Brâhmans. The
                    most ancient sites connected with local history* are the ruins of Ratnâpuri and
                    of Sak-rây-patnâ, both of which are described as the capitals of powerful kings
                    before the rise of the Ballâla dynasty. On the overthrow of the Ballâlas by the
                    Mahometans, the Vijayanagar empire established itself over southern India; but
                    the feudatory chiefs were practically independent. Subsequently the greater part
                    of the district was overrun by the Ikkeri or Bednur <hi rend="italic"
                    >pdlegdr</hi> from the neighbouring district of Hassan, who was in his turn
                    defeated in 1694 by the conquering Hindu râjâs of Mysore. It was not until 1763
                    that Hyder Ali finally incorporated the whole country in the Mysore dominions.
                    In 1799, after the death of Tipû, Kâdûr was restored to the Hindu kingdom then
                    set up by the marquis of Wellesley. But in 1831 a general insurrection broke
                    out, which overpowered the Mysore <pb break="no"

                    troops before it was suppressed. The inquiry that followed led to the assumption
                    of the direct administration of the entire state of Mysore by the British. This
                    administration was continued till March 1881, when the state was again handed
                    over to its native rulers, on the representative of the ruling family attaining
                    his majority.</p>
