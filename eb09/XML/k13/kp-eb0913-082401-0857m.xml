                    the river Mahi, and on the W. by Ahmadâbâd district and the state of Cambay,
                    with an area of 1561 square miles. Except a small corner of hilly ground near
                    its northern boundary, and in the south-east and south where the land along the
                    Mahi is furrowed into deep ravines, Kaira district forms one unbroken plain,
                    sloping gently towards the southwest. The north and north-east portions are
                    dotted with patches of rich rice land, broken by untilled tracts of low
                    brushwood. The centre of the district is very fertile and highly cultivated; the
                    luxuriant fields are surrounded by high growing hedges, and the whole country is
                    clothed with clusters of large, shapely trees. To the west this belt of rich
                    vegetation passes into a bare though well-cultivated tract of rice land, growing
                    more barren and open till it reaches the maritime belt, whitened by a salt-like
                    crust, along the Gulf of Cambay. The chief rivers are the Mahi on the south-east
                    and south, and the Sâbarmati on the western boundary. The former, owing to its
                    deeply cut bed and sandbanks, is impracticable for either navigation or
                    irrigation; but the waters of the Sâbarmati are largely utilized for the latter
                    purpose. A smaller stream, the Khâri, also waters a considerable area by means
                    of canals and sluices.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 returned the population at 782,733 (419,142 males and 363,591
                    females). Hindus numbered 711,619; Musulmans, 70,741; Parsis, 68; and Christians
                    305, of whom 2&lt;3 are natives. Among the Hindus the most important classes are
                    the Lewa and Kadwa Kumbis, numbering 144,639; they are the best cultivators in
                    the district, sober, peaceful, and industrious. The Rajputs, with the exception
                    of a few who with the title of thâkur still retain landed estates, have sunk
                    into the mass of ordinary peasant proprietors. The Kolis number 281,252; idle
                    and turbulent under native rule, they are now quiet, hard-working, and
                    prosperous. Among the Hindu low castes, numbering 61,834, the Dhersare
                    distinguished for industry and good behaviour. They formerly lived in comfort by
                    weaving coarse cotton cloth, but the competition of the Bombay and local steam
                    mills is now shutting them out of the market. Of the Musalman population, about
                    one-third represent the foreign conquerors of Guzerat; the remainder are the
                    descendants of converted Hindus. The first class, employed chiefly as
                    cultivators, or in Government service as police and. messengers, are for the
                    most part poor; the second class, who are artisans, chiefly weavers and
                    oilpressers, are hard-working and well-to-do. Thirteen towns contain more than
                    5000 inhabitants each. Agriculture forms the support of upwards of two-thirds of
                    the population. In 1876-77, 362,221 acres, or 75 per cent, of the Government
                    cultivable land, were under tillage, and 20,753 acres fallow or under grass.
                    Food grains comprise upwards of 88 per cent, of the crops; pulses, 8 per cent.;
                    oilseeds, 1 per cent.; fibres, 1 per cent.; the remainder being taken up by
                    miscellaneous crops, chiefly tobacco, which has the reputation of being the
                    finest in western India. The manufactures comprise soapmaking, glassmaking,
                    calico printing, and handloom weaving of coarse cloth. A steam spinning and
                    weaving mill has been recently established. The exports are grain, tobacco,
                    butter, oil, and the petals of the <hi rend="italic">mahuΛ</hi> tree; the
                    imports, piece-goods, groceries, •molasses, and dye-stuffs. About 40 miles of
                    the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway pass through the district.</p>
                <p>The revenue administration of the district is conducted by a collector-magistrate
                    and three assistants; for judicial purposes Kaira is included within the
                    jurisdiction of the judge of Ahmadabad. The total imperial, local, and municipal
                    revenue in 1875-76 was £249,314, of which £195,184 was derived from the land.
                    Education was afforded in 1876-77 by 189 schools, attended by 14,720 pupils.
                    Kaira possesses a public library, and in 1876 published three vernacular
                    newspapers. The prevailing diseases consist of fevers of a malarious type. The
                    average rainfall during the five years ending 1876 was 30 inches.</p>
                <p>Kaira district has no independent history of its own. It is made up partly of
                    lands acquired from the peshwa in 1802, and partly of territory acquired from
                    the gaekwâr oi Baroda in 1803 and 1817.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Kaira,</hi> chief town and headquarters of the above
                    district, situated 5 miles south-west of Mehmadâbâd railway station, in 22° 44'
                    30" N. lat., and 72° 44' 30" E. long. It is a very ancient city, having a
                    legendary connexion with the <hi rend="italic">Mahabhärata,</hi> and is proved
                    by the evidence of copperplate grants to have been known as early as the 5th
                    century. Early in the 18th century it passed to the Babi family, with whom it
                    remained till 1763, when it was taken by the Marhattâs; it was finally handed
                    over to the British in 1803. It was a large military station till 1820, when the
                    cantonment was removed to Deesa. Population (1872), 12,681.</p>
