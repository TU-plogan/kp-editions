                    institutions and from the part they will probably play in the development of the
                    French colony, and to the ethnologist as the best known branch of the great
                    Berber race. In 1864 it was estimated that they amounted to 2,200,000. The
                    country which they inhabit is usually regarded as consisting of two
                    divisions—Great Kabylia and Lesser Kabylia—the former being also known as the
                    Kabylia of the Jurjura (also called Adrar Budfel, “Mountain of Snow”). It is
                    admitted on all hands that the Berbers form the main aboriginal element in the
                    population of northern Africa, that at one time or other they have occupied the
                    whole tract of country from Egypt in the east to the Canary Islands in the west,
                    and that they are still represented not only by the Tuâreg (Amashir, &amp;c.),
                    who retain their native speech, but by many tribes that have become altogether
                    Arab in language. In regard to their real ethnic relations, however, there has
                    been much discussion and theory: Kaltbrunner includes the Berbers in the
                    Mediterranean race in which Haeckel places the Semites, Iberians, &amp;c. M. G.

                    Kabyles are a Berber stock, and more particularly correspond to that part of the
                    race which was known to the Romans as Numidians. Physically they do not present
                    any very prominent contrast to the Arabs of Algeria. Both Kabyle and Arab are
                    white at birth, but rapidly grow brown through exposure to air and sunshine.
                    Both have in’ general brown eyes and wavy hair of coarse quality, varying from
                    dark brown to jet black. In stature there is perhaps a little difference in
                    favour of the Kabyle, and he appears also to have a stouter trunk and bulkier
                    muscles. Both are clearly dolichocephalic. Among the Kabyles, it is worthy of
                    particular notice, there exists a varying proportion of individuals with fair
                    skins, ruddy complexions, and blue or grey eyes. As to the ethnic origin of this
                    peculiar element many conjectures have been hazarded,— one theorist seeing in
                    them the Vandals, another the Gallic mercenaries of Rome, another an aboriginal
                    fair-skinned race, another the dolmen-building people from Europe. In the whole
                    domain of life and character the contrasts between Arab and Kabyle are of the
                    most radical and striking kind. The Kabyle lives in a house of stone or clay,
                    forming part of a fixed village or hamlet; the Arab’s tent is moved from place
                    to place. The Kabyle enjoys the individual proprietorship of his garden and his
                    orchards; with the Arab the ownership of the soil is an attribute of the tribe.
                    While cereals alone are cultivated by the Arab, the Kabyle has his fig trees,
                    olives, and vines, vegetables and tobacco. Active, energetic, and enterprising,
                    the Kabyle is to be found far from home—as a soldier in the French army, as a
                    workman in the towns, as a field labourer, or as a pedler or trader earning by
                    steady effort the means of purchasing his bit of ground in his native village.
                    Nor, however insignificant they may appear when measured by a high European
                    standard, are the native industries to be despised. Not only do they comprise
                    the making of lime, tiles, woodwork for the houses, domestic utensils, and
                    agricultural implements, but also the weaving and dyeing of several kinds of
                    cloth, the tanning and dressing of leather, and the manufacture of oil and soap.
                    Without the assistance of the wheel, the women turn out a variety of earthenware
                    articles; before it became a sort of proscribed industry the production of
                    gunpowder was <pb break="no"

                    excellent ornaments in silver, coral, and enamel; in some places wood carving
                    has been brought to considerable perfection; and native artists know how to
                    engrave on metal both by etching and the burin. Like the Arabs of Algeria, the
                    Kabyles are Mahometans of the Sunnite branch and the Malekite rite, looking to
                    Morpcco as the nearer centre of their religion; but, whereas the Arabs are
                    fatalistic and superstitious, the Kabyles show a more independent and
                    rationalistic turn of mind. In spite of the Koran and its administrators the
                    Kabyles are essentially democratic. In the words of Renan,<note anchored="true"

                    for everything; government, police, administration of justice, cost nothing to
                    the community. It is the ideal of democracy, the direct government of the people
                    by the people.” The political unit is the village or commune <hi rend="italic">;

                    tribes again are combined in the Kabaïla or confederation. The governing
                    authority in the commune is the Jemâ'a or general gathering of the citizens,—
                    every man old enough to keep the fast of the Ramadhan having a right to take
                    part in its proceedings. Its chief executive officer, the <hi rend="italic"

                    and withdraws from his functions as soon as he loses the confidence of the
                    electorate. Some of the Kabyles retain their vernacular speech, while others
                    have more or less completely adopted Arabic. The best known dialect is that of
                    the Igaouaouen, or Zouaoua,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
