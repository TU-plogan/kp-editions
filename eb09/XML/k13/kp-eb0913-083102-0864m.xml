                    continuation first in the Kurile Islands (of which Shunshu is only 7 miles
                    distant from the terminal Cape Lopatka) and then in the larger islands of the
                    empire of Japan. The area is estimated at 237,266 square miles. The range of
                    mountains which forms the backbone of the peninsula opens up towards the middle
                    into two distinct branches, and gives the whole the general outline of an oval
                    leaf. The western branch is the higher of the two. Southwards from 57° N. lat.

                    volcanoes are as follows :—Klyutchevskaya Sopka (15,040 feet in height),

                    Tchaokhtch. The eruptions of Klyutchevskaya are not unworthy of being compared
                    with those of Mount Etna; the most notable chronicled by European observers are
                    those of 1727-1731 (lasting four years), 1737, and 1854. More than twenty hot
                    springs are known. The basis rocks are granite and porphyry, with metamorphic
                    schists, basalts, trachytes, and other volcanic rocks. The sedimentary rocks are
                    mainly of Tertiary and more particularly Eocene origin; those of the Quaternary
                    period have a limited area. Native copper, magnetic iron, lignite, amber, mica,
                    and sulphur are the chief minerals. Of the rivers the largest bears the same
                    name as the peninsula; rising in the highest part of the central range, it flows
                    north for about 310 miles, and falls into the Behring Sea. The valley of the
                    Kamchatka forms the most fertile and most populous portion of the peninsula. For

                    as 1844. In January the mean temperature appears to be 19 <hi rend="superscript"

                    Petropavlovsk, and - 5 ’ 8° at the northern extremity. The western coast is very
                    considerably colder in winter than the east, but the snowfall is much heavier in
                    the east than in the west. Towards the south especially snow often lies so thick
                    that the natives cannot keep reindeer. During summer the weather is very
                    uncertain, with frequent rains and fogs; but in the centre of the peninsula
                    especially there is a large amount of warmth. Vegetation, especially on soils of
                    volcanic origin, is remarkably luxuriant; the grass grows nearly 5 feet high,
                    and may be cut three times. In the woods berries, mushrooms, and the Martagon
                    lily abound, the bulbs of the last also furnishing food to the natives. Beyond
                    the forests appear <hi rend="italic">Rhododendron Kamtschaticum, Salix
                    arctica,</hi> and other plants of an alpine type. The Kamchatkan nettle—with
                    richly variegated foliage—is a familiar object in English greenhouses. Besides
                    the Kamchadales proper there are Koryak and Lamut tribes within the limits of
                    the peninsula. By themselves the Kamchadales are called Itelm,—the name by which
                    they are usually known being a corruption of Konchal, their Koryak appellation.
                    There are not in all more than 2000 Kamchadales, and the process of
                    Russification is going on rapidly. They are a strong hardy people, inured to the
                    severities of the climate, capable of any amount of toil in the way of walking.
                    To their women they are affectionate, and even submissive. In winter they live
                    in pits covered in with earth and turf, the interior being reached by means of a
                    ladder. In the summer they occupy slight wooden sheds <hi rend="italic"
                    >{bologanf)</hi> raised on high props or stilts. The skill they display in the
                    training of their sledge-dogs is not surpassed by any other people who practice
                    the same art. With their sledges (narts)—which measure from 5 to 10 feet in
                    length—they travel 4 to 8 miles an hour. The Kamchadale language cannot be
                    assigned to any known group; its vocabulary is extremely poor. The purity of the
                    tongue is best preserved by the people of the Penzhinsk district On the west
                    coast; many of the inhabitants of the Kamchatka valley speak a broken Russian.
                    Mr Kennan compares the sound of the language to that of water running out of a
                    narrow-mouthed jug. The total population of the peninsula were 7331 in 1853, and
                    5846 in 1870.</p>
                <p>The Russians made their first settlements in Kamchatka in the end of the 17th
                    century; in 1696 Vladimir Atlasoff from Ana-duirsk founded Nizhne-Kamchatsk, and
                    in 1704 Kobeleff founded Bolsheryetsk. About twelve years later the Russians
                    came for the first time by sea from Okhotsk. In 1720 a survey of thepeninsula
                    was undertaken; in 1725-30 it was visited by Behring’s expedition; and from
                    1733-45 it was the scene of the labours of the Krasheninnikoff and Steller
                    expedition. Disturbance among the natives in 1731 led to the building of a fort
                    at Tigilsk. The seat of the government is at Petropavlovsk. In 1855 the country
                    was incorporated with the Maritime Province.</p>
