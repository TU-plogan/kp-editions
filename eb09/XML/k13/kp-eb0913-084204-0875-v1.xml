                <p><label type="entry">KANSAS</label>, the central State of the American Union, lies
                    between 37° and 40° N. lat. and between 94° 38'and 102° W. long. It is bounded
                    on the N. by Nebraska, on the E. by Missouri, on the S. by Indian territory, and
                    on the W. by Colorado. The State is nearly rectangular in shape, with a breadth
                    of about 210 miles from north to south, and a length of 400 miles from east to
                    west. It contains an area of 81,318 square miles, or 52,043,520 acres.</p>
                <p>Kansas is an undulating plain, gently sloping from west to east, at an average of
                    nearly 7 feet per mile. There is also an inclination from north to south, as
                    indicated by the course of the rivers, which flow southerly as well as easterly,
                    but never northerly or westerly, except for short distances from local causes.
                    The mouth of the Kansas river, at the east line of the State, is 750 feet above
                    the sea-level; the average altitude of the western boundary is about 3500 feet.
                    The broad prairie surface is diversified by an endless succession of valleys and
                    woodlands. The great central valley is traversed by the Kansas or Kaw river,
                    which, inclusive of the Smokyhill branch, extends the entire length of the
                    State. Lateral valleys on the north are formed by the Saline, Solomon,
                    Republican, and Blue rivers, and other smaller streams. Another broad valley is
                    formed in the southern half of the State by the Arkansas river, with lateral
                    valleys on the north, traversed by the Walnut, Little Arkansas, Pawnee Fork, and
                    other streams. The southeastern portion contains the important Neosho valley,
                    and the smaller valleys of the Osage and Verdigris. In the extreme south-west
                    and along the southern boundary are the valley of the Cimarron, and a network of
                    the southern tributaries of the Arkansas. Numerous small affluents of the
                    Missouri enrich and diversify the north-eastern quarter of the State. The
                    streams of Kansas are usually fed by perennial springs, and, as a rule, the
                    eastern and middle portions of the State are well watered. The western part is
                    more elevated, and water is less abundant.</p>

                        τ</hi><hi rend="italic">Pav</hi> surface presents three distinct geological
                    sections. The eastern portion of the State belongs to the Carboniferous system,
                    in which are found inexhaustible beds of valuable bituminous coal, often at
                    shallow depths or cropping out on the surface. The central portion belongs to
                    the Triassic formation, witl magnesian limestone, ferruginous sandstone, and
                    gypsum as the representative rocks. Magnesian limestone, knowr as dolomite, is
                    especially plentiful along the Blue. Republican, and Neosho rivers and their
                    tributaries. This beautiful stone, resembling white, grey, and cream-coloured
                    marble, is exceedingly useful for building purposes. Il crops out in the bluffs
                    in endless quantities, and is easily worked. The wèstern portion of the State
                    belongs to the Cretaceous formation, in which chalks and a species ol native
                    quicklime are very prominent in the river bluffs. The white and cream-coloured
                    chalks are much used foi building purposes, but the blue is usually too soft foi
                    exposure to the weather. The quicklime as quarried from the bluffs slakes
                    perfectly, and with sand makes a fairly good mortar, without calcination or
                    other previous prépara tions, Lead-mines are extensively worked in the south
                    eastern portion of the State, and prosperous towns and cities are growing up in
                    connexion with these mines. Ir the central region, salt is produced from wells,
                    and appears in occasional marshes. Salt industries are carried on al Solomon
                    City, near the mouth of the Solomon river, and an excellent brine is obtained at
                    Junction City. The sail of the south-west is found in beds and dry
                    incrustations, varying in thickness from a few inches to 2 feet. The salts of
                    Kansas are remarkably free from lime and other im∙</p>

                <p>purities. Gypsum is found in beautiful crystalline form in extensive quarries,
                    but it has not been much utilized. The lignite found near the Colorado line
                    makes a valuable domestic fuel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate of Kansas is exceptionally
                    salubrious. Extremes of heat and cold occur, as in all open prairie countries,
                    but as a rule the winters are dry and mild, while the summer heats are tempered
                    by the perpetual prairie breezes. The summer nights are invariably cool and
                    refreshing. The mean annual temperature at Fort Riley for twenty-three years
                    ending December 1874 has been 53°. The highest temperature there during the same
                    period was 98° and the lowest 12° below zero. The average annual rainfall at the
                    city of Lawrence for six years (1875-1880) was 32 ’ 68 inches, the heaviest
                    rainfalls occurring in May, June, July, and August, the lightest in November,
                    December, January, and February.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soil.—</hi> The soil of the upland prairies is generally a deep
                    rich clay loam, of a dark colour. The bottom lands near the streams are a black
                    sandy loam; and the intermediate lands, or “second bottoms,” show a rich and
                    deep black* loam, containing very little sand. These soils are all easily
                    cultivated, free from stones, and exceedingly productive. There are exceptional
                    spots on the upland prairies composed of stiff clay, not as easily cultivated,
                    but very productive when properly managed and enriched. In the early history of
                    the country the prairies were covered with the short “buffalo grass,” very
                    nutritious for pasturage, on which immense herds of buffalo and other animals
                    subsisted, but utterly unfit for hay. With the disappearance of the buffalo, and
                    as the country is settled and cultivated, the short buffalo grass gives place to
                    the tall blue stem and other bladed grasses valuable alike for pasture and for
                    hay. Timber is abundant along the streams in the eastern section of the State,
                    but is less plentiful in the central portion, and very scarce in some parts of
                    the west. The varieties of timber embrace oak, elm, black walnut, cottonwood,
                    mulberry, box, elder, willow, hickory, sycamore, white ash, and other hard and
                    soft woods.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The farm products of 1880 were as follows :—
                    Indian com, 101,420,718 bushels; winter wheat, 23,507,223; spring wheat,
                    1,772,661; rye, 676,507; oats, 11,483,796; barley, 287,057; buckwheat, 43,455;
                    Irish potatoes, 4,919,227; sweet potatoes, 391,196; castor beans, 558,974; flax
                    seed, 1,245,279; sorghum syrup, 3,787,585 gallons; cotton, 142,517 tt&gt;; hemp,
                    635,8721b; millet and Hungarian hay, 629,084 tons; Timothy hay, 79,634 tons; hay
                    from wild or native grasses, 798,707 tons; clover pasture, 5927 acres; blue
                    grass pasture, 38,259 acres; native grass pasture, 901,125 acres; produce of
                    market gardens to the value of $449,797.</p>
                <p>The bright climate and pure atmosphere are admirably adapted to the growth of the
                    apple, pear, peach, plum, grape, and cherry. The smaller fruits also, with
                    scarce an exception, flourish finely. Trees never suffer from sodden or
                    water-soaked roots, and very seldom from the winter’s cold, when reasonable
                    judgment and care have been exercised in selecting and managing the grounds. At
                    a national exhibition in Philadelphia in 1869 the great gold medal of the
                    National Pomological Society was awarded to Kansas “for a collection of fruits
                    unsurpassed for size, perfection, and flavour;” and similar awards have been
                    made to Kansas fruits at later exhibitions. In November 1872 the American
                    Institute, at its great show, awarded a diploma for 190 varieties of apples
                    grown in Kansas, as the largest and handsomest exhibited. At the International
                    Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876, Kansas exhibited ninety-six varieties of
                    apples, and received the diploma of the centennial commission. Estimates based
                    on the tables of 1877 indicate that the number of bearing trees now in the State
                    (1881) is about as follows :—2,500,000 apple, 100,000 pear, 8,000,000 peach,
                    200,000 plum, and 1,000,000 cherry trees. The planting of trees is still on the
                    increase, and the older orchards are very profitable. The same is true of
                    vineyards and plantations of small fruits.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Live Stock.—</hi> The wide prairies, with their nutritious
                    grasses for hay and grazing and their never-failing springs of pure water, make
                    the State a very paradise to the herdsman and stock-raiser. The following are
                    the statistics for 1880 :—horses, 367,589; mules and asses, 58,303; milch cows,
                    366,640; other homed cattle,748,672; sheep, 426,492; swine, 1,281,630; value of
                    animals slaughtered and sold for slaughter, $12,700,045; value of poultry and
                    eggs sold, $531,550; wool (clip of 1878), 289,644 lb; wool (1879), 1,194,453 lb;
                    honey (produce of 1879), 370,398 lb; wax (1879), 10,949 tt&gt;. The great herds
                    of buffalo which formerly overran the plains have disappeared, the elk is gone,
                    and deer and other game are less plentiful than formerly. There remain, however,
                    the rabbit, hare, turkey, prairie hen, quail, and the usual variety of migratory
                    water-fowl, to gratify the sportsman. The numerous streams are well supplied
                    with fish of choice varieties and of unusually large size, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manufactures.—</hi> There is perhaps no tract of country of equal extent
                    better supplied with available water power than Kansas. The streams are fed by
                    living springs, and the inclination of the country insures uniformly rapid
                    currents. Most of the streams maintain a good flow of water in the driest
                    seasons, and in case of heavy rains many of them “underflow” the adjacent bottom
                    lands, saturating the permeable substratum of the country with the surplus
                    water, which in time drains out and feeds the subsiding streams. This feature is
                    particularly true of the Saline, Solomon, and Smokyhill rivers. The Smokyhill
                    river has not risen above the banks of its deep channel at Junction City since
                    1869, while at the lowest stages it is capable of driving large flouring-mills,
                    having half a dozen sets of burrs. A dam on the Kansas river at Lawrence
                    supplies a water-power capable of developing a great manufacturing centre. In
                    1870 there were one hundred and ten improvements of water-power in the state.
                    Estimates based on the latest statistics now place the number of utilized mill
                    sites at about three hundred, where flouring-mills, saw-mills, planing-mills,
                    and woollen-mills run the entire year, with very little hindrance from either
                    high or low water. In the eastern section of the State, where coal is plentiful,
                    steam-power is much used, especially in the manufacture of iron. At Leavenworth
                    there are manufactories of iron bridges, engines, boilers, stoves, railroad
                    iron; and miners’ tools. There are also manufactories of waggons, carriages,
                    carpets, soaps, paints, and cement, at Leavenworth, Fort Scott, Lawrence,
                    Columbus, Ottawa, and other places. At Topeka, Parsons, Armstrong, and Argentine
                    there are rolling mills and railroad repair shops, while planing-mills,
                    tanneries, cheese factories, and pork-packing establishments are found in
                    various localities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Transport and Trade.—</hi> There ar’e numerous railroads in the
                    State, with an aggregate length of completed track of 3104 miles. The central
                    branch in the north and the Union Pacific (Kansas division) near the centre
                    traverse the northern half of the State from east to west, in nearly parallel
                    lines,—the latter extending by its connexions to San Francisco. The Atchison,
                    Topeka, and Santa Fe line passes from the north-east to the south-west,
                    extending through to the Pacific coast; and the Missouri Pacific (Kansas
                    division), by uniting with the Texas Central, connects the richest portion of
                    Kansas with the Gulf of Mexico at Galveston. Other lines in connexion with these
                    facilitate the internal commerce of the State. Kansas has an eastern front of
                    150 miles on the Missouri river, which is navigable for steamboats of all sizes.
                    The internal rivers of the State are not utilized for commercial purposes,
                    though the Kansas was formerly considered navigable to Fort Kiley, near the
                    mouth of the Republican river, and steamboats have ascended the Smokyhill to the
                    mouth of the Saline, about 50 miles farther west. By means of these railroads
                    and the Missouri river immense quantities of wheat, corn, cattle, and swine are
                    sent from Kansas to the eastern markets; flour is sent south, south-west, and
                    west, and butter, poultry, and eggs, with large quantities of vegetables, hay,
                    and garden produce, to the western mining regions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> The public schools are liberally endowed and
                    supported. Two sections of land (1280 acres) are set apart in each congressional
                    district for school fund purposes. There are in the State 5242 public school
                    buildings, and the value of public school property is $4,633,044. The teachers
                    employed number 6707. The pupils of school age are estimated from statistics of
                    1875 at 230,000, about half of whom are in actual attendance. The annual
                    expenditure for ⅛chool purposes, estimated from statistics of 1875, is
                    1,500,000. The State supports a university at Lawrence, and. a normal school at
                    Emporia; and the agricultural college at Manhattan is endowed by the general
                    Government. There are also State institutions for the education of the blind,
                    and the deaf and dumb, and for the care of the insane. A reform school for
                    juvenile offenders is being built at the State capital.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion.—</hi> All the usual religious denominations are
                    represented, owning church property to the amount of $2,511,520.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> In Kansas, as in all the States of the
                    American Union, the government is vested in three departments, legislative,
                    executive, and judicial. The governor is elected for a term of two years. The
                    legislature consists of a senate and house of representatives. The members of
                    the house are elected for two years, and members of the senate for four. The
                    judiciary consists of a State supreme court and subordinate district courts. The

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Kansas belongs to that immense tract of country,
                    purchased by the American Government from France in 1803, known as the Louisiana
                    purchase. Prior to 1854 it was in the hands of various Indian tribes, some
                    native, and others which had been removed from the older States. It was
                    organized and opened for settlement as a territory by Act of Congress in May
                    1854, in the midst of a heated contest on the slavery question. . The
                    slaveholders and the friends of freedom at once began a vigorous contest for the
                    occupancy and control of the new territory, and thus it was that Kansas became
                    the vanguard in the great struggle which resulted in the overthrow of slavery in
                    the United States. Before the formal beginning of the war, societies were
                    organized by the rival settlers and their friends in the States on both sides of
                    the slavery question, and even rival legislatures were elected and convened. The
                    discussions frequently resulted in personal violence, and the greatest
                    excitement prevailed till the breaking out of the civil war. Kansas was admitted
                    into the Union as a State in January 1861, and took an active part in furnishing
                    troops for the suppression of the rebellion. The State was frequently invaded,
                    and the city of Lawrence was sacked and burned in August 1863. Since the
                    overthrow of slavery, Kansas has shared fully in the general progress of the
                    country. (J. D.+)</p>
