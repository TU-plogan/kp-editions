                    century, and which has also played an important part in the Christian church
                    since the Middle <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0844-0811"/> Ages. The term primarily denotes “reception” and
                    then “doctrines received by tradition.” In the older Jewish literature the name
                    is applied to the whole body of received religious doctrine with the exception
                    of the Pentateuch, thus including the Prophets and Hagiographa as well as the
                    oral traditions ultimately embodied in the Mishnah. It is only since the 11th or
                    12 th century that Kabbalah has become the exclusive appellation for the
                    renowned system of theosophy which claims to have been transmitted
                    uninterruptedly by the mouths of the patriarchs and prophets ever since the
                    creation of the first man.</p>
                <p>The cardinal doctrines of the Kabbalah embrace the nature of the Deity, the
                    Divine emanations or Sephiroth, the cosmogony, the creation of angels and man,
                    their destiny, and the import of the revealed law. According to this esoteric
                    doctrine, God, who is boundless· and above everything, even above being and
                    thinking, is called <hi rend="italic">En</hi><hi rend="italic">Soph
                    (aπeφoς)</hi>; He is the space of the universe containing το παν, but the
                    universe is not his space. In this boundlessness He could not be comprehended by
                    the intellect or described in words, and as such the En Soph was in a certain
                    sense <hi rend="italic">À</hi><hi rend="italic">yin,</hi> non-existent <hi
                    rend="italic">(Zohar,</hi> iii. 283). To make his existence known and
                    comprehensible, the En Soph had to become active and creative. As creation
                    involves intention, desire, thought, and work, and as these are properties which
                    imply limit and belong to a finite being, and moreover as the imperfect and
                    circumscribed nature of this creation precludes the idea of its being the direct
                    work of the infinite and perfect, the En Soph had to become creative, through
                    the medium of ten Sephiroth or intelligences, which emanated from him like rays
                    proceeding from a luminary.</p>
                <p>Now the wish to become manifest and known, and hence the idea of creation, is
                    co-eternal with the inscrutable Deity, and the first manifestation of this
                    primordial will is called the first <hi rend="italic">Sephira</hi> or emanation.
                    This first Sephira, this spiritual substance which existed in the En Soph from
                    all eternity, contained nine other intelligences or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sephiroth.</hi> These again emanated one from the other, the second from the
                    first, the third from the second, and so υn up to ten.</p>
                <p>The ten Sephiroth, which form among themselves and with the En Soph a strict
                    unity, and which simply represent different aspects of one and the same being,
                    are respectively denominated (1) the Crown, (2) Wisdom, (3) Intelligence, (4)
                    Love, (5) Justice, (6) Beauty, (7) Firmness, (8) Splendour,</p>
                <p>(9) Foundation, and</p>
                <p>(10) Kingdom. Their evolution was as follows: “When the Holy Aged, the concealed
                    of all concealed, assumed a form, he produced everything in the form of male and
                    female, as things could not continue in any other form. Hence Wisdom, the second
                    Sephira, and the beginning of development, when it proceeded from the Holy Aged
                    (another name of the first Sephira) emanated in male and female, for Wisdom
                    expanded, and Intelligence, the third Sephira, proceeded from it, and thus were
                    obtained male and female, viz., Wisdom the father and Intelligence the mother,
                    from whose union the other pairs of Sephiroth successively emanated <hi
                    rend="italic">” (Zohar,</hi> iii. 290). These two opposite potencies, viz., the
                    masculine Wisdom or Sephira No. 2 and the feminine Intelligence or Sephira No. 3
                    are joined together by the first potency, the Crown or Sephira No. 1; they yield
                    the first triad of the Sephiric decade, and constitute the divine head of the
                    archetypal man, as will be seen in the accompanying figure.</p>
                <p>From the junction of Sephiroth No. 2 and 3 emanated the masculine potency Love or
                    Mercy (4) and the feminine potency Justice (5), and from the junction of the
                    latter two emanated again the uniting potency Beauty (6). Beauty, the sixth
                    Sephira, constitutes the chest in the archetypal man, and unites Love (4) and
                    Justice (5), which constitute the divine arms, thus yielding the second triad of
                    the Sephiric decade. From this second conjunction emanated again the masculine
                    potency Firmness (7) and the feminine potency Splendour (8), which constitute
                    the divine legs of the archetypal man; and these sent forth Foundation (9),
                    which is the genital organ and medium of union between them, thus yielding the
                    third triad in the Sephiric decade. Kingdom (10), which emanated from the ninth
                    Sephira, encircles all the other nine, inasmuch as it is the Shechina, or divine
                    halo, which encompasses the whole by its all-glorious presence.</p>
                <p>In their totality and unity the ten Sephiroth are not only denominated the World
                    of Sephiroth, or the World of Emanations, but, owing to the above
                    representation, are called the primordial or archetypal man ( = πρωτόγονον) and
                    the heavenly man. It is this form which, as we are assured, the prophet Ezekiel
                    saw in the mysterious chariot (Ezek. i 1-28), and of which the earthly man is a
                    faint copy.</p>
                <p>As the three triads respectively represent intellectual, moral, and physical
                    qualities, the first is called the Intellectual, the second the Moral’ or
                    Sensuous, and the third the Material World. In the figure of the archetypal man
                    it will be seen that the three Sephiroth on the right are masculine, and
                    represent the principle of rigour, that the three on the left are feminine and
                    represent the principle of mercy, and that the four central or uniting Sephiroth
                    represent the principle of mildness. Hence the right is called “the Pillar of
                    Judgment,” the left “the Pillar of Mercy,” and the centre “the Middle Pillar.”
                    The middle Sephiroth are synecdochically used to represent the worlds or triads
                    of which they are the uniting potencies. Hence the Crown, the first Sephira,
                    which unites Wisdom and Intelligence to constitute the first triad, is by itself
                    denominated the Intellectual World. So Beauty is by itself described as the
                    Sensuous World, and in this capacity is called the Sacred King or simply the
                    King, whilst Kingdom, the tenth Sephira, which unites all the nine Sephiroth, is
                    used to denote the Material World, and as such is denominated the Queen or the
                    Matron. Thus a trinity of units, viz., the Crown, Beauty, and Kingdom, is
                    obtained within the trinity of triads. But further, each Sephira is as it were a
                    trinity in itself. It (1) has its own absolute character, (2) receives from
                    above, and (3) communicates to what is below. “Just as the Sacred Aged is
                    represented by the number three, so are all the other lights (Sephiroth) of a
                    threefold nature” <hi rend="italic">(Zohar,</hi> iii. 288). In this
                    all-important doctrine of the Sephiroth, the Kabbalah <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n845/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0845-0812"/> insists upon the fact that these potencies are
                    not creations of the En Soph, which would be a diminution of strength; that they
                    form among themselves and with the En Soph a strict unity, and simply represent
                    different aspects of the same being, just as the different rays which proceed
                    from the light, and which appear different things to the eye, are only different
                    manifestations of one and the same light; that for this reason they all alike
                    partake of the perfections of the En Soph; and that as emanations from the
                    Infinite, the Sephiroth are infinite and perfect like the En Soph, and yet
                    constitute the first finite things. They are infinite and perfect when the En
                    Soph imparts his fulness to them, and finite and imperfect when that fulness is
                    withdrawn from them.</p>
                <p>The conjunction of the Sephiroth, or, according to the language of the Kabbalah,
                    the union of the crowned King and Queen, produced the universe in their own
                    image. Worlds came into existence before the En Soph manifested himself in the
                    human form of emanations, but they could not continue, and necessarily perished
                    because the conditions of development which obtained with the sexual opposites
                    of the Sephiroth did not exist. These worlds which perished are compared to
                    sparks which fly out from a red-hot iron beaten by a hammer, and which are
                    extinguished according to the distance they are removed from the burning mass.
                    Creation is not <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">nihilo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> it is simply a further expansion or evolution of the
                    Sephiroth. The world reveals and makes visible the Boundless and the concealed
                    of the concealed. And, though it exhibits the Deity in less splendour than its
                    Sephiric parents exhibit the En Soph, because it is farther removed from the
                    primordial source of light than the Sephiroth, still, as it is God manifested,
                    all the multifarious forms in the world point out the unity which they
                    represent. Hence nothing in the whole universe can be annihilated. Everything,
                    spirit as well as body, must return to the source whence it emanated <hi
                    rend="italic">(Zohar,</hi> ii. 218). The universe consists of four different
                    worlds, each of which forms a separate Sephiric system of a decade of
                    emanations. They were evolved in the following order. (1) The World of
                    Emanations, also called the Image and the Heavenly or Archetypal Man, is, as we
                    have seen, a direct emanation from the En Soph. Hence it is most intimately
                    allied to the Deity, and is perfect and immutable. From the conjunction of the
                    King and Queen <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> these ten Sephiroth) is produced
                    (2) the World of Creation, or the Briatic world, also called “the Throne.” Its
                    ten Sephiroth, being farther removed from the En Soph, are of a more limited and
                    circumscribed potency, though the substances they comprise are of the purest
                    nature and without any admixture of matter. The angel Metatron inhabits this
                    world. He alone constitutes the world of pure spirit, and is the garment of
                    Shaddai, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the visible manifestation of the Deity.
                    His name is numerically equivalent to that of the Lord <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Zohar,</hi> iii. 231). He governs the visible world, preserves the harmony and
                    guides the revolutions of all the spheres, and is the captain of all the myriads
                    of angelic beings. This Briatic world again gave rise to (3) the World of
                    Formation, or Yetziratic World. Its ten Sephiroth, being still farther removed
                    from the Primordial Source, are of a less refined substance. Still they are yet
                    without matter. It is the abode of the angels, who are wrapped in luminous
                    garments, and who assume a sensuous form when they appear to men. The myriads of
                    the angelic hosts who people this world are divided into ten ranks, answering to
                    the ten Sephiroth, and each one of these numerous angels is set over a different
                    part of the universe, and derives his name from the heavenly body or element
                    which he guards <hi rend="italic">(Zohar,</hi> i. 42). From this world finally
                    emanated (4) the World of Action, also called the World of Matter. Its ten
                    Sephiroth are made up of the grosser elements of the former three worlds; they
                    consist of material substance limited by space and perceptible to the senses in
                    a multiplicity of forms. This world is subject to constant changes and
                    corruption, and is the dwelling of the evil spirits. These, the grossest and
                    most deficient of all forms, are also divided into ten degrees, each lower than
                    the other. The first two are nothing more than the absence of all visible form
                    and organization; the third degree is the abode of darkness; whilst the
                    remaining seven are “the seven infernal halls,” occupied by the demons, who are
                    the incarnation of all human vices. These seven hells are subdivided into
                    innumerable compartments corresponding to every species of sin, where the demons
                    torture the poor deluded human beings who have suffered themselves to be led
                    astray whilst on earth. The prince of this' region of darkness is Sämäel, the
                    evil spirit, the serpent who seduced Eve. His wife is the Harlot or the Woman of
                    Whoredom. The two are treated as one person, and are called “the Beast” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Zohar,</hi> ii. 255-259, with i. 35).</p>
                <p>The whole universe, however, was incomplete, and did not receive its finishing
                    stroke till man was formed, who is the acme of the creation and the microcosm.
                    “The heavenly Adam <hi rend="italic">(fe.,</hi> the ten Sephiroth) who enamated
                    from the highest primordial obscurity <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the En Soph)
                    created the earthly Adam” <hi rend="italic">(Zohar,</hi> ii. 70). “Man is both
                    the import and the highest degree of creation, for which reason he was formed on
                    the sixth day. As soon as man was created everything was complete, including the
                    upper and nether worlds, for everything is comprised in man. He unites in
                    himself all forms” <hi rend="italic">(Zohar,</hi> iii. 48). Each member of his
                    body corresponds to a part of the visible universe. “Just as we see in the
                    firmament above, covering all things, different signs which are formed of the
                    stars and the planets, and which contain secret things and profound mysteries
                    studied by those who are wise and expert in these things; so there are in the
                    skin, which is the cover of the body of the son of man, and which is like the
                    sky that covers all things above, signs and features which are the stars and
                    planets of the skin, indicating secret things and profound mysteries whereby the
                    wise are attracted who understand the reading of the mysteries in the human
                    face” <hi rend="italic">(Zohar,</hi> ii. 76). The human form is shaped after the
                    four letters which constitute the Tetragrammaton. The head is in the shape of ’,
                    the arms and the shoulders are like ∏, the breast like % and the two legs with
                    the back again resemble ∏ <hi rend="italic">(Zohar,</hi> ii. 72). The souls of
                    the whole human race pre-exist in the World of Emanations, and are all destined
                    to inhabit human bodies. Like the Sephiroth from which it emanates, every soul
                    has ten potencies, consisting of a trinity of triads. (1) The Spirit (Π0E^) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> j</hi> which is the highest degree of being, corresponds to
                    and is operated upon by the Crown, which is the highest triad in the Sephiroth,
                    and is called the Intellectual World; (2) the Soul (∏∙U), which is the seat of
                    the moral qualities, corresponds to and is operated upon by Beauty, which is the
                    second triad in the Sephiroth, and is called the Moral Work!; and (3) the Cruder
                    Soul (^⅛2), which is immediately connected with the body, and is the cause of
                    its lower instincts and the animal life, corresponds to and is operated upon by
                    Foundation, the third triad in the Sephiroth, called the Material World. Each
                    soul, prior to its entering into this world, consists of male and female united
                    into one being. When it descends on this earth the two parts are separated and
                    animate two different bodies. “At the time of marriage the Holy One, blessed be
                    he, who knows all souls and spirits, unites them again as they were before; and
                    they again constitute one body and one soul, forming as it were the right and
                    the left of the individual. . . . This union, however, is influenced by the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n846/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0846-0813"/> deeds of the man and by the ways in which he
                    walks. If the man is pure and his conduct is pleasing in the sight of God, he is
                    united with that female part of the soul which was his component part prior to
                    his birth” <hi rend="italic">{Zohar,</hi> i. 91). The soul’s destiny upon earth
                    is to develop those perfections the germs of which are eternally implanted in
                    it, and it ultimately must return to the infinite source from which it emanated.
                    Hence, if, after assuming a body and sojourning upon earth, it becomes polluted
                    by sin and fails to acquire the experience for which it descends from heaven, it
                    must three times reinhabit a body, till it is able to ascend in a purified state
                    through repeated trials. If, after its third residence in a human body, it is
                    still too weak to withstand the contamination of sin, it is united with another
                    soul, in order that by their combined efforts it may resist the pollution which
                    by itself it was unable to conquer. When the whole pleroma of pre-existent souls
                    in the world of the Sephiroth shall have descended and occupied human bodies and
                    have passed their period of probation and have returned purified to the bosom of
                    the infinite Source, then the soul of Messiah will descend from the region of
                    souls; then the great Jubilee will commence. There shall be no more sin, no more
                    temptation, no more suffering. Universal restoration will take place. Satan
                    himself, “the venomous Beast,” will be restored to his angelic nature. Life will
                    be an everlasting feast, a Sabbath without end. All souls will be united with
                    the Highest Soul, and will supplement each other in the Holy of Holies of the
                    Seven Halls <hi rend="italic">{Zohar,</hi> i. 45, 168; ii. 97).</p>
                <p>According to the Kabbalah all these esoteric doctrines are contained in the
                    Hebrew Scriptures. The uninitiated cannot perceive them; but they are plainly
                    revealed to the spiritually minded, who discern the profound import of this
                    theosophy beneath the surface of the letters and words of Holy Writ. “If the law
                    simply consists of ordinary expressions and narratives, such as the words of
                    Esau, Hagar, Laban, the ass of Balaam, or Balaam himself, why should it be
                    called the law of truth, the perfect law, the true witness of God? Each word
                    contains a sublime source, each narrative points, not only to the single
                    instance in question, but also to generals” <hi rend="italic">{Zohar,</hi> iii.
                    149, <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> 152).</p>
                <p>To obtain these heavenly mysteries, which alone make the Torah superior to
                    profane codes, definite hermeneutical rules are employed, of which the following
                    are the most important. (1) The words of several verses in the Hebrew Scriptures
                    which are regarded as containing a recondite sense are placed over each other,
                    and the letters are formed into new words by reading them vertically. (2) The
                    words of the text are ranged in squares in such a manner as to be read either
                    vertically or boustrophedon. (3) The words are joined together and redivided.
                    (4) The initials and final letters of several words are formed into separate
                    words. (5) Every letter of a word is reduced to its numerical value, and the
                    word is explained by another of the same quantity. (6) Every letter of a word is
                    taken to be the initial or abbreviation of a word. (7) The twenty-two letters of
                    the alphabet are divided into two halves; one half is placed above the other;
                    and the two letters which thus become associated are interchanged. By this
                    permutation, <hi rend="italic">Aleph,</hi> the first letter of the alphabet,
                    becomes <hi rend="italic">Lamed,</hi> the twelfth letter; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Beth</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">Mem,</hi> and so on. This cipher alphabet
                    is called <hi rend="italic">Albam,</hi> from the first interchangeable pairs.
                    (8) The commutation of the twenty-two letters is effected by the last letter of
                    the alphabet taking the place of the first, the last but one the place of the
                    second, ana so forth. This cipher is called <hi rend="italic">Atbash.</hi> These
                    hermeneutical canons are much older than the Kabbalah. They obtained in the
                    synagogue from time immemorial, and were used by the Christian fathers in the
                    interpretation of Scripture. Thus Canon V., according to which a word is reduced
                    to its numerical value and interpreted by another word of the same value, is
                    recognized in the New Testament <hi rend="italic">(comp.</hi> Rev. xiii. 18).
                    Canon VI. is adopted by Irenaeus, who tells us that, according to the learned
                    among the Hebrews, the name Jesus, contains two letters and a half, and
                    signifies that Lord who contains heaven and earth D'DE&gt; !TliT] <hi
                    rend="italic">(Against Heresies,</hi> ii.</p>
                <p>xxiv., vol. i. p. 205, ed. Clark). The cipher <hi rend="italic">Atbash</hi>
                    (Canon VIII.) is used in Jeremiah xxv. 26, li. 41, where Sbeshach is written for
                    Babel. In Jer. li. 1, &lt;∣∣Q0 ∏b&gt; <hi rend="italic">Leb-Kamaι’(A.</hi> V.,
                    “the midst of them that rise up against me”), is written for DΠt2*D, <hi
                    rend="italic">Chaldaea,</hi> by the same rule.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to advert to the relation between the Kabbalah and Christianity
                    in order to account for the extraordinary part which this theosophy played in
                    the Christian church, especially at the time of the Renaissance. We have already
                    seen that the Sephiric decade, or the archetypal man, like Christ, is considered
                    to be of a double nature, both infinite and finite, perfect and imperfect. More
                    distinct, however, is the doctrine of the Trinity. On Deut. vi. 43, where
                    Jehovah occurs first, then Elohênü, and then again Jehovah, we are told “The
                    voice though one, consists of three elements, fire <hi rend="italic">{i.e,</hi>
                    warmth), air <hi rend="italic">{ue.,</hi> breath), and water <hi rend="italic"
                    >{i.e.,</hi> humidity), yet all three are one in the mystery of the voice and
                    can only be one. Thus also Jehovah, Elohênü, Jehovah, constitute one—three forms
                    which are one” <hi rend="italic">{Zohar,</hi> ii. 43; compare iii. 65).
                    Discussing the thrice holy in Isaiah vi. 3, one codex of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zohar</hi> had the following remark: “The first holy denotes the Holy Father,
                    the second the Holy Son, and the third the Holy Ghost” (comp. Galatinus, <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Arcanis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cathol.,</hi> lib. ii. c. 3, p. 31; Wolf, <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hebraica,</hi> i. 1136). Still more distinct is the doctrine of
                    the atonement. “The Messiah invokes all the sufferings, pain, and afflictions of
                    Israel to come upon Him. Now if He did not remove them thus and take them upon
                    Himself, no man could endure the sufferings of Israel, due as their punishment
                    for transgressing the law; as it is written (Isa. liii. 4), Surely He hath borne
                    our griefs and carried our sorrows” <hi rend="italic">{Zohar,</hi> ii. 12).
                    These and similar statements favouring the doctrines of the New Testament have
                    made many Kabbalists of the highest position in the synagogue embrace the
                    Christian faith, and write elaborate books to win their Jewish brethren over to
                    Christ. As early as 1450 a company of Jewish converts in Spain, at the head of
                    which were Paul de Heredia, Vidal de Saragossa de Aragon, and Davila, published
                    compilations of Kabbalistic treatises to prove from them the doctrines of
                    Christianity. They were followed by Paul Rici, professor at Pavia, and physician
                    to the emperor Maximilian I. Sharing the conviction of his fellow converts that
                    the doctrines of the Kabbalah are the doctrines of Christianity, this eminent
                    Hebraist translated into Latin the Kabbalistic work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Gates of Light,</hi> which he dedicated to the emperor (1516). It was from
                    this work that Pico de Mirandola and John Reuchlin learnt the true secrets of
                    the Kabbalah. Prominent among the “nine hundred theses” which Mirandola had
                    placarded in Rome, and which he undertook to defend in the presence of all
                    European scholars, whom he invited to the Eternal City, promising to defray
                    their travelling expenses, was the following: “No science yields greater proof
                    of the divinity of Christ than magic and the Kabbalah.” Mirandola so convinced
                    Pope Sixtus of the paramount importance of the Kabbalah as an auxiliary to
                    Christianity that his holiness exerted himself to have Kabbalistic writings
                    translated into Latin for the use of divinity students. With equal zeal did
                    Reuchlin act as the apostle of the Kabbalah. His treatises exercised an almost
                    magic influence upon the greatest thinkers of the time. Pope Leo X. and the
                    early Reformers were alike captivated by the charms of the Kabbalah as
                    propounded by Reuchlin, and not only divines, but statesmen and warriors, began
                    to study the Oriental languages in order to be able to fathom the mysteries of
                    Jewish theosophy.</p>
                <p>Though the followers of this theosophy claim two works as their codes, viz., the
                    <hi rend="italic">Booh of Creation</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Zohar,</hi> it
                    is really only the latter which is the Bible of the Kabbalists. The renowned <hi
                    rend="italic">Zohar</hi> is written in Aramaic, and is a commentary on the
                    Pentateuch, according to its division into fifty-two hebdomadal lessons. It
                    derives its name Ι∏∏, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Light, from the words “Let
                    there be light” (Gen. i. 4), with the exposition of which it begins.

                    congregation of six surviving disciples.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Zohar</hi> pretends to be a compilation made by R. Simon b.
                    Yochi, who flourished about 70-110 <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.,</hi> of doctrines
                    which God communicated to Adam in Paradise, and which have been received
                    uninterruptedly from the mouths of the patriarchs and prophets. Amongst the many
                    facts, however, established by modern criticism which prove the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zohar</hi> to be a compilation of the 13th century, the following
                    are the most prominent :—(1) the <hi rend="italic">Zohar</hi> itself praises
                    most fulsomely R. Simon, its reputed author, and exalts him above Moses; (2) it
                    mystically explains the Hebrew vowel points which did not obtain till 570; (3)
                    the compiler borrows two verses from the celebrated hymn called “The Royal
                    Diadem,” written by Ibn Gebirol, who was born about 1021; (4) it mentions the
                    capture of Jerusalem by the crusaders and the retaking of the Holy City by the
                    Saracens; (5) it speaks of the comet which appeared at Rome, July 15, 1264,
                    under the pontificate of Urban IV.; (6) by a slip the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zohar</hi> assigns a reason why its contents were not revealed before 5060-66
                    A.M., <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 1300-1306 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.;</hi> (7)
                    the doctrine of the En Soph and the Sephiroth was not known before the 13th
                    century; and (8) the very existence of the <hi rend="italic">Zohar</hi> itself
                    was not known prior to the 13th century. Hence it is now believed that Moses de
                    Leon (oδ. 1305), who first circulated and sold the <hi rend="italic">Zohar</hi>
                    as the production· of R. Simon, was himself the author. That eminent scholars
                    both in the synagogue and in the church should have been induced to believe in
                    its antiquity is owing to the fact that the <hi rend="italic">Zohar</hi>
                    embodies many opinions and doctrines which obtained among the Jews prior to the
                    time of Christ. The undoubted antiquity of these has served as a lever in the
                    minds of these scholars to raise the late speculations about the En Soph, the
                    Sephiroth, &amp;c., to the same age.</p>
