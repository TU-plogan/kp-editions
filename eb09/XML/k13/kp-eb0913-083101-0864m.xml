                    Australia and the Philippines in the east. The fruit of this species, as of many
                    other Euphorbiaceous plants, is covered with stellate hairs, among which are
                    intermixed ruby-coloured glands. These are found also on other parts of the
                    plant, especially among the down with which the under surface of the leaf is
                    covered. Kâmalâ is collected in many parts of India, and forms one of the lesser
                    products of the Government forests in the Madras presidency at Naini Tai, where
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mallotus</hi> is found growing in immense quantities at
                    the foot of the hills. According to Mr F. E. G. Matthews, numbers of people,
                    chiefly women and children, are engaged in collecting the powder for
                    exportation. A quantity of the berries is thrown into a large basket, and rubbed
                    with the hand until the powder is removed and falls through the basket, as
                    through a sieve, on a cloth spread below it to receive it.</p>
                <p>The collection of kâmalâ begins in March, and lasts for about a month. The drug
                    thus prepared contains, besides the glands, stellate hairs and fragments of
                    leaves. Some samples, however, are occasionally met with in commerce containing
                    as much as 60 per cent, of earthy matter, which is easily detected by its
                    sinking when the kâmalâ is stirred up with water, or by the amount of ash left
                    when the powder is incinerated. In India kâmalâ has long been known, since it
                    has several ancient Sanskrit names, one of which, kapila, signifies dusky or
                    tawny red. Under the name of wars, kanbil, or qinbil, kâmalâ appears to have
                    been known to the Arabian physicians as a remedy for tapeworm and skin diseases
                    as early as the 10th century, and indeed is mentioned by Paulus Aegineta in the
                    7th, but it did not attract any special attention in Europe as a medicine until
                    experimented with by Mackinnon, a surgeon in the Bengal medical establishment,
                    who tried it in numerous cases of tapeworm. Anderson and others in India, and
                    Leared in London, confirmed the results obtained, and established the fact that
                    kâmalâ is an efficient taenifuge. It was soon after introduced into the British
                    pharmacopoeia (1864).</p>
                <p>Kâmalâ floats on water, which scarcely acts on it even at a boiling heat, but it
                    yields about 80 per cent, of a splendid red resin to alcohol, ether, chloroform,
                    benzol, glacial acetic acid and bisulphide of carbon. When sprinkled over a
                    flame it ignites with a flash like lycopodium, and yields after incineration
                    about 1 *7 per cent, of ash. Leube found that the resin consisted of two
                    varieties, one more easily soluble, and fusing at 176° Fahr. (80° C.), and the
                    other dissolving less readily, fusing at 375 ’ 8° Fahr. (191° C.). Anderson
                    obtained a substance, named by him rottierin, C <hi rend="subscript"> 22</hi> H
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 20</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, by allowing a
                    strong ethereal solution of kâmalâ to stand for a few days. This when purified
                    by recrystallization formed satiny minute tabular yellow crystals soluble in
                    ether, sparingly soluble in cold and more so in hot alcohol, and insoluble in
                    water.</p>
                <p>Another kind of kâmalâ under the Arabic name of wars is sometimes exported from
                    Aden, where it is shipped from Harar on the east coast of Africa, and is also
                    collected in southern Arabia and exported thence to the Persian Gulf and Bombay.
                    The plant from which this variety is obtained is not known. It differs from true
                    kâmalâ in having a deep purple colour, in the greater coarseness of its
                    particles, in yielding 12 per cent, of ash, in having long simple hairs mixed
                    with it, and in becoming quite black when heated to from 199 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 4° Fahr. (93° (λ)to212° Fahr. (100° C.), at which
                    temperature true kâmalâ undergoes no change. The microscopic structure of the
                    glands is also different, the resin cells being oblong instead of club-shaped,
                    and the grains themselves cylindrical or subconical instead of irregularly
                    spherical. It is to this variety of kâmalâ that the name wars alone belongs,
                    while kâmalâ, kanbil, and qinbil are restricted to the red powder collected in
                    India. In 1875-76 there were exported from Aden 42,975 lb of wars. Dr Vaughan
                    when residing in Aden in 1852 observed that under the name of wars kâmalâ was
                    also used as a dyestuff for silk <hi rend="italic">(Pharmacographia,</hi> p.</p>
