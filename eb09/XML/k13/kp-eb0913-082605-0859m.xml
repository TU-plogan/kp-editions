                    instrument by means of which beautiful forms may be seen. It was invented by Sir
                    David Brewster about 1815,—the idea of the instrument having occurred to him
                    some time before while he was engaged with experiments on the polarization of
                    light by reflexion. When it first appeared it attracted almost universal
                    attention. This arose from the extreme beauty of the forms which it presented,
                    their endless variety and perfect symmetry, as well as the readiness with which
                    one beautiful form could be converted into another. The construction of the
                    instrument was so simple, too, that almost any one could make it; and, in
                    consequence, the patent originally taken out by Brewster was persistently
                    evaded; kaleidoscopes were made by the hundred<pb break="no"

                    of them were sent abroad; and it is stated that no fewer than two hundred
                    thousand were sold in London and Paris in the space of three months. Besides
                    being of essential service in the art of the designer, the kaleidoscope
                    constitutes a very useful piece of philosophical apparatus, as it illustrates,
                    in a very beautiful way, the optical problem of the multiplication of images
                    produced by reflexion when the object is placed between two piano mirrors
                    inclined to each other at a definite angle.</p>
                <p>The general principle of the instrument will be easily understood from the
                    following description and figures.</p>
                <p>1. Let OA, OB (fig. 1) be the sections of two plane mirrors placed perpendicular
                    to the plane of the paper and inclined to each other at a right angle. Let P be
                    a luminous point, or object, placed between them. According to the general law
                    of the reflexion of light from plane mirrors, the image of P formed by the
                    mirror OA will be as far behind OA as P is in front of it; that is, the image of
                    P is P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, where PX=P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> X,
                    the line PP <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> being perpendicular to OA. Now P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> may be regarded as a new object placed before the
                    mirror OB, and hence the image of P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> formed by OB
                    will be P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> where P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Y
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Y <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. Similarly the image of P formed by OB will be P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ', where PY=P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> 'Y, and the
                    image of P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ' formed by OA will also be at a point
                    such that P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> 'X <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> X <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, that is, the two last
                    formed images will coincide. Hence we have three images placed symmetrically
                    about 0, constituting, with the object P, a symmetrical pattern of four luminous
                    points placed at the corners of a rectangle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">S,.</hi> Let the mirrors OA and OB (fig. 2) be inclined to each
                    other at any angle <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and let P be the object placed
                    between them. With centre 0 and radius OP describe a circle. Evidently the
                    images formed by successive reflexions from the mirrors will all lie on the
                    circumference of this circle. We shall denote the images formed by a <hi
                    rend="italic">first</hi> reflexion at OA, <hi rend="italic">second</hi> at OB,
                    <hi rend="italic">third</hi> at OA, and so on, by the symbols P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, P <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 3</hi> respectively; and the images formed by a <hi rend="italic">first</hi>
                    reflexion at OB, <hi rend="italic">second</hi> at OA, <hi rend="italic"
                    >third</hi> at OB, and so on by P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ', P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ', P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ' respectively. Draw
                    PP <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> perpendicular to OA, P <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> perpendicular to OB, P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> perpendicular to AO
                    produced, and P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>
                    perpendicular to BO produced. Then P], P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, P <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> are the first set of
                    images formed. Similarly draw the lines PP <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ', P∕P
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ', P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> 'P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ', P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> ', then P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    ’, P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ', P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ζ P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> ' are the second set of images formed by a first
                    reflexion at OB. Now, when any image falls within the angle vertically opposite
                    to A0B, it is evident that no further reflexion can take*place, as it is behind
                    both, mirrors. Hence the number of images formed depends upon the size of the
                    angle AOB and also upon the position of the point P in relation to the
                    mirrors.</p>
                <p>When a symmetrical picture is required, it is essential that the two last formed
                    images, that is, P <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> and P <hi rend="subscript">
                    4</hi> ' in the figure, should coincide, and we must determine when this will be
                    the case. We shall measure the distances of the several images from P by the
                    arcual distances PP <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, &amp;c. Now it is evident
                    that</p>
                <p>P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> PP <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> = 2PA + 2PB = 2AB = 2α.</p>
                <p>P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> PP <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ' = PP <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + PP <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ' = PB <hi
                    rend="subscript"> +</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B + PA + P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> 'A</p>
                <p>≈PB + PA + AB + P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> A +AB + P <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> 'B</p>
                <p>= 4AB = 4α, P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> PP <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ' =
                    6a.</p>
                <p>P <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> PP√=2na,</p>
                <p>Now, when the last formed imagée coincide, the arcual distance between them must
                    be a whole circumference. Hence if P <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> and P√ be the
                    last formed coincident images, we have</p>
                <p>P <hi rend="subscript"> 71</hi> PP√ = 2nα — 2ιr.</p>
                <p>Hence a = —; that is, the mirrors must be inclined to each other <hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">H</hi> at an angle which is an exact
                    submultiple of two right angles, or, which is the same thing, an even
                    submultiple of 360°.</p>
                <p>3. Next suppose that, instead of a point, we put a line as an object in the angle
                    between the mirrors; and, first, let us suppose that the mirrors are inclined to
                    each other at an angle which is an odd submultiple of 360° (as one-fifth of 360°
                    in fig. 3). OA, OB are the mirrors, PQ the line placed between them. The image
                    of PQ formed by OA is PQ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, that formed by OB is QP
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. The image of PQ <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi>
                    formed by OB is P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Q <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    and the image of QP <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> formed by OA is Q <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Now</hi> it is readily seen that the points P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and
                    Q <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> will not, in general, coincide, and, hence, a
                    symmetrical picture of the line cannot in general be formed when the angle is an
                    odd submultiple of 360°. If, however, the line OP = OQ, then the points P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and Q <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> will coincide, and a
                    symmetrical picture of five lines be formed. Secondly, let us suppose that the
                    angle AOB is an even submultiple of 360°. By following the course of the images
                    it will be seen that the last-formed images of the line coincide in all
                    positions of PQ, and hence a symmetrical figure can, in all cases, be
                    formed.</p>
                <p>As the object of the kaleidoscope is to produce symmetrical figures from objects
                    placed in any position between the mirrors, we are necessarily limited to angles
                    which are <hi rend="italic">even</hi> submultiples of 360°.</p>
                <p>The simple kaleidoscope consists essentially of two plane mirrors EOA and EOB
                    (fig. 4) inclined to each other at an angle which is an even submultiple of
                    360°. A very common angle in practice is 60°. The mirrors are usually made of
                    two strips of thin flat glass,—the length of each being from 6 to 12 inches, and
                    the greatest breadth from 1 to 3 inches.</p>
                <p>The mirrors are first fixed, in any convenient manner, at the proper angle, and
                    then inserted into a cylindrical tube of brass or paper. At the one end of the
                    tube is a small eyehole opposite the point E, while the other end is closed by
                    what is called the “object box.” This consists of a shallow cylindrical box,
                    which fits on to the end of the tube, and contains the objects from whose
                    reflexion the pattern is produced. These objects may consist of petals of
                    differently coloured flowers, scraps of differently coloured paper, or, still
                    better, pieces of coloured glass. Very often the objects consist of small glass
                    tubes filled with differently coloured liquids and then hermetically sealed.
                    These produce a very fine effect. The objects are placed in the box between two
                    circles of thin glass which fit into the box, the one of which is transparent
                    and the other obscured by grinding. When in position the transparent glass is
                    close to the end* of both mirrors and fills up the sector AOB, while the other,
                    the obscured one, is fixed into the outer end of the object box. The distance
                    between the two glasses is made as small as possible,—just room enough being
                    left to allow the objects to fall freely by their own weight into any position
                    between the glasses. Suppose now that the angle AOB is 60°, and that the eye is
                    placed at E, a beautiful symmetrical picture of six equal and similar sectors
                    will be seen round the point O; and, by simply turning the tube round, so as to
                    allow the objects to fall into a new position, an endless variety of pictures
                    can be produced.</p>
                <p>It is important to notice the proper position of the eye. This should be, as
                    nearly as possible, in the plane <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n861/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0861-0828"/> of both mirrors,—first, because in that position
                    oιdy the direct and reflected sectors are all at the same distance from the eye,
                    and, in consequence, no want of symmetry is introduced by the foreshortening of
                    one sector more than another; and, secondly, because in that position the
                    maximum amount of light is reflected to the eye by the mirrors, and, in
                    consequence, the various sectors appear as nearly as possible equally
                    illuminated. Of course a certain amount of light is necessarily lost at each
                    reflexion, and hence there is always a slight difference between the luminosity
                    of the various sectors. However, this is found not to introduce any serious want
                    of symmetry when the instrument is properly constructed.</p>
                <p>A modification of the simple kaleidoscope was introduced by Sir David Brewster,
                    whereby the images of large and distant objects can be introduced into the
                    picture. This is effected by removing the object box and replacing it by a tube
                    carrying at its outer end a double convex lens, represented by LL in fig. 5. By
                    a screw adjustment the lens can be so placed as to focus the distant object
                    exactly in the plane of the sector AOB, and so bring its image into the very
                    best position for producing symmetrical patterns. When this instrument is
                    directed towards a tree in full foliage, or towards an arrangement of flowers in
                    full bloom, a very beautiful effect is produced, which can be varied by
                    gradually moving the instrument. This form was called by Brewster the <hi
                    rend="italic">telescopic kaleidoscope.</hi></p>
                <p>Another form is called the <hi rend="italic">polyangular kaleidoscope.</hi> (fig.
                    6). The only essential difference in it is that the mirrors are so arranged that
                    the angle between them can be varied at pleasure. This, being very useful for
                    illustrating the theory of the instrument, is the form usually found in
                    collections of philosophical apparatus.</p>
                <p>In all the instruments above described only two mirrors have been employed; but
                    obviously we may have more than two. Suppose we wish to employ three mirrors
                    enclosing a triangular opening, and that we also wish to produce perfectly
                    symmetrical pictures. We are here limited in our choice of angles by the
                    following conditions—first, the sum of the three angles which the mirrors make
                    with each other must be equal to 180°, and, secondly, each angle must be an even
                    submultiplo of 360°. By trial it is easily found that the only angles which
                    satisfy these conditions are 60 <hi rend="superscript"> δ</hi>, 60°, 60°; 90°,
                    60°, 30°; and 90°, 45°, 45°. Hence with three mirrors we must choose one or
                    other of these three sets. The first is that usually chosen.</p>
                <p>Suppose similarly we wish to use four mirrors; then, we must put them either in
                    the form of a square, when all the mirrors are of equal breadth, or in the form
                    of a rectangle, when the opposite mirrors are of equal breadth. It is obvious
                    that in these two cases only will the angle between each pair of mirrors be an
                    even submultiple of 360°.</p>
                <p>With more than four mirrors kaleidoscopes cannot be constructed so as to give
                    symmetrical forms, since each of the interior angles of a regular polygon of
                    more than four sides must exceed an even submultiple of 360°.</p>

                    application of the instrument to the art of designing. (J. BL.)</p>
