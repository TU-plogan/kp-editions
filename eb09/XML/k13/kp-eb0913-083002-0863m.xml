                <p><label type="entry">KALUGA</label>, a central government of European Russia,
                    surrounded by those of Moscow, Smolensk, Orel (Orloff), and Tula. The area is
                    estimated at 25,594 square.miles, or according to the maps of the Kaluga
                    surveying office 27,407. For the most part the surface is flat, and the
                    culminating point of the government is a hill in the northern district of
                    Meduin, 910 feet in height. In the north-west there is a considerable tract of
                    peat-bog. The Oka, a main tributary of the Volga, and its confluents (the
                    Zhizdra, the Ugra,. &amp;c.), drain all but a strip of country in the west,
                    which is traversed by the Bolva, an affluent of the Dnieper. Strata of
                    Carboniferous Limestone prevail except in the north, where Jurassic rocks take
                    their place. The coal though common enough is of poor quality, and has been
                    comparatively little worked. Clays from the southern districts are employed in
                    the glass-works of Kaluga and the surrounding governments. Iron-ore is obtained
                    in considerable abundance between the left-hand feeders of the Bolva and the
                    upper course of the Zhizdra. According to the reports of the statistical
                    committee for 1880 <hi rend="italic">(Pam-yatnaya Knizhka,</hi> 1881) about
                    1,246,874 acres were covered with forest (pines, firs, birches), large tracts
                    more especially existing in the Zhizdra district; 20,000 acres consisted of
                    marsh land, 903,580 acres were under tillage, and 2,201,208 were devoted to
                    pasturage. The soil in most parts of the government is composed of sand or clay;
                    and it is only in certain portions of the districts of Peremuishl, Kozelsk, and
                    Meshtchovsk that the famous “black earth” is found. Agriculture is in a
                    comparatively low state in Kaluga, requiring a great increase in the outlay of
                    capital, and especially the keeping of more live stock for the fattening of the
                    soil</p>
                <p>Rye and oats are the principal crops, but the production is less than the local
                    demand. Buckwheat, potatoes, flax, and hemp are also grown. Manufacturing
                    industries are on the increase, the cloth and cotton factories employing upwards
                    of 2000 men, the iron-works more than 6000, the paper-mills about 1300, and the
                    match-works more than 1500. The breeding of canaries, which are sent to all
                    parts of Russia, was a source of livelihood to 350 persons in 1880. Railway
                    lines from Moscow to Orel, from Moscow to Smolensk, and from Smolensk to Orel
                    enclose the government in a triangle, but none of them touch its territory. By
                    means, however, of the navigable streams, a good deal of traffic is carried on.
                    The government is divided into eleven districts <hi rend="italic">(uyezd):—</hi>
                    Kaluga, Mosalsk, Meshtchovsk, Likhvin, Kozelsk, Zhizdra, Peremuishl, Meduin,
                    Borovsk, Maloyaroslavets, and Tarusa. The following are the towns of more than
                    5000 inhabitants, according to the returns for 1870 Kaluga, 38,600; Zhizdra,
                    11,700; Borovsk, 9500; Meduin, 7800; Kozelsk, 7350; Sukhinitchi, 6050;
                    Meshtchovsk, 5450; Maloyaroslavets, 5150. The government had a population of
                    1,114,372 in 1880.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Kaluga,</hi> the chief town of the above government, is
                    situated 475 feet above the sea-level on the left bank of the Oka, at the
                    confluence of the Yatchenka, 114 miles south-west of Moscow, in 54° 3Γ N. lat.
                    and 36° 6' E. long. Among the public buildings may be mentioned the cathedral of
                    the Trinity (rebuilt in the present century in room of an older edifice dating
                    from 1687), two monastic establishments, a male and a female gymnasium, an
                    ecclesiastical seminary (with 219 students in 1879), an infant asylum, an
                    orphanage, a public hospital, a lunatic asylum, a hospital for incurables, and a
                    house of correction. The principal articles of production are leather, oil, bast
                    mats, wax candles, starch, and a particular kind of cake known in Russia by the
                    name of the town. This last item alone counts for more than 1,000,000 roubles
                    (£156,000) per annum in the local trade. Situated as it is on a navigable river,
                    and at the junction of important roads, Kaluga is naturally the centre of no
                    small commercial activity. Even in the beginning of the century its merchants
                    and manufactures were known in Leipsic, Bremen, and Dantzic. Including the
                    suburban villages of Yamskaya and Podsavalya the town had 36,880 inhabitants in
                    1870.</p>
                <p>The first historical mention of Kaluga occurs in 1389, when Demetrius of the Don
                    assigned it to his son; and its final incorporation with the principality of
                    Moscow belongs to the year 1518. In 1607 it was held by the pretender
                    Bolotnikoff, and vainly besieged for four months by the forces of Shuiski; but
                    in 1619 it fell into the hands of the Zaporogian hetman. Nor was it from war
                    alone that Kaluga suffered. Two thirds of its inhabitants were carried off by a
                    plague; and in 1622 the whole place was laid waste by a conflagration. It
                    recovered, however, and, in spite of several extensive conflagrations
                    (especially in 1742 and 1754) has continued to flourish. The rank of chief town
                    of a province was obtained in 1719. In 1734 the population numbered 13,788, and
                    by 1785 had increased to 17,078. On several occasions Kaluga has been chosen as
                    the residence of political prisoners; among others, the famous Schamyl (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Russkαyα Stanna,</hi> 1877) spent his exile there. .</p>
