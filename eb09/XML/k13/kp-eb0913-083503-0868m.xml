                    the sea. It is 370 miles distant from Herat on the north-west, by Girishk and
                    Farrah,—Girishk being 75 miles, and Farrah 225 miles from Kandahar. From Cabul,
                    on the north-east, it is distant 315 miles, by Khelat-i-Ghilzai and
                    Ghazni,—Khelat-i-Ghilzai being 85 miles, and Ghazni 225 miles from Kandahar. To
                    the Pishin valley the distance is about 110 miles, and from Pishin to India the
                    three principal routes measure approximately as follows :—by the Zhôb valley to
                    Dera Ismail Khan, 300 miles; by the Béri valley to Dera Ghazi Khan, 275 miles;
                    by Quetta and the Bolân to Dadur, 125 miles; and by Chappar and Nari (the
                    proposed railway route) to Sibi, 120 miles. Sibit is connected by rail with the
                    rest of India. Immediately round the city is a plain, highly cultivated and well
                    populated to the south and west; but on the north-west this plain is barren, and
                    is bounded by a double line of rough and precipitous hills, rising to about 1000
                    feet above its general level, and breaking its dull monotony with irregular
                    lines of scarped precipices, crowned with fantastic pinnacles and peaks. To the
                    north-west these hills form the watershed between the valleys of the Argandab
                    and the Tarnak, until they are lost in the mountain masses of the Hazarajat,—a
                    wild region inhabited by tribes of Tartar origin, which effectually shuts off
                    Kandahar from communication with the north. On the south-west they lose
                    themselves in the sandy desert of Registan, which wraps itself round the plain
                    of Kandahar, and forms another impassable barrier.</p>
                <p>But there is a break in these hills,—a gate, as it were, to the great high road
                    between Herat and India; and it is this gate which the fortress of Kandahar so
                    effectually guards, and to which it owes its strategic importance. Other routes
                    there are, open to trade, between Herat and northern India, either following the
                    banks of the Hari Rud, or, more circuitously, through the valley of the Helmand
                    to Cabul; or the line of hills between the Argandab and the Tarnak may be
                    crossed close to Khelat-i-Ghilzai; but of the two former it may be said that
                    they are not ways open to the passage of Afghan armies owing to the hereditary
                    bitterness of hostility existing between the Eimâk and Hazâra tribes and the
                    Afghans generally, while the latter is not beyond striking distance from
                    Kandahar. The one great high road from Herat and the Persian frontier to India
                    is that which passes by Farrah and crosses the Helmand at Girishk. Between
                    Kandahar and India new and feasible means of communication are being discovered
                    with every geographical search into the intermediate country. To the north-west,
                    and parallel to the long ridges of the Tarnak watershed, stretches the great
                    road to Cabul, the same which was traversed by Nott in 1842, and by Stewart and,
                    more recently, by Roberts in 1880. Between this and the direct route to Pishin
                    is a road, well known, though never yet traversed by a British force, which
                    leads through Maruf to the Kundar river and the Guleri Pass into the plains of
                    Hindustan at Dera Ismail Khan. This is the most direct route to northern India,
                    but it involves the passage of some rough country, where lies the great
                    watershed between the basins of the Helmand and the Indus. But the best known
                    road from Kandahar to India is that which stretches across the series of open
                    stony plains interspersed here and there with rocky hills of irregular formation
                    leading to the foot of the pass across <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n869/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0869-0836"/> the Kojak range, on the far side of which from
                    Kandahar lies the valley of Pishin. The passage of the Kojak involves a rise and
                    fall of some 2300 feet, but an excellent road now crosses the pass. The proposed
                    line of railway to Kandahar follows an easier but comparatively waterless route,
                    turning the Kojak at Gwaja (about 25 miles southwest of the Kojak Pass), and
                    involving no serious gradients. Between the Pishin valley and India are several
                    routes, all more or less open to a force equipped for mountain warfare, of which
                    the best known are the Bolân and the Chappar (or Nari) passes from the plateau
                    of Afghanistan to the plains of Sind at Jacobabad; and the Zhôb and the Béri
                    valley routes leading through the Sulimani range to Dera Ismail and Dera Ghazi
                    Khan respectively. The Bori valley was the line followed by Sir M. Biddulph in
                    1879, and it diverges but slightly from that known as the Thal-Chotiali route.
                    Thus Kandahar becomes a sort of focus of all the direct routes converging from
                    the wide-stretching western frontier of India towards Herat and Persia, and the
                    fortress of Kandahar gives protection on the one hand to trade between Hindustan
                    and Herat, and on the other it lends to Cabul security from Herat invasion.</p>
                <p>Kandahar is approximately a square-built city, surrounded by a wall of about 3∣
                    miles circuit, and from 25 to 30 feet high, with an average breadth of 15 feet.
                    Outside the wall is a ditch 10 feet deep. The city and its defences are entirely
                    mud-built, with no pretensions to architectural beauty. There are four main
                    streets crossing each other nearly at right angles, the central “chouk” being
                    covered with a dome. These streets are wide and bordered with trees, and are
                    flanked by shops with open fronts and verandahs much after the universal fashion
                    of the East. There are no buildings of any great pretension in Kandahar, a few
                    of the more wealthy Hindus occupying the best houses. The tomb of Ahmed Shah is
                    the only attempt at monumental architecture. This, with its rather handsome
                    cupola, and the twelve minor tombs of Ahmed Shah’s children grouped around,
                    contains a few good specimens of fretwork and of inlaid inscriptions. The four
                    streets of the city divide it into convenient quarters for the accommodation of
                    its mixed population of Duranis, Ghilzais, Parsiwans, and Kakuris, numbering in
                    all some 30,000 souls. Of these the greater proportion are the Parsiwans
                    (chiefly Kizilbashes).</p>
                <p>It is reckoned that there are 1600 shops and 182 mosques in the city. The mullas
                    of these mosques are generally men of considerable power. The walls of the city,
                    are pierced by the four principal gates of “Cabul,” “Shikarpur,” “Herat/’ and
                    the “Idgah,” opposite the four main streets, with two minor gates, called the
                    Top Khana and the Bardurani respectively, in the western half of the city. The
                    Idgah gate passes through the citadel, which is a square built enclosure with
                    sides of about 260 yards in length. The flank defences of the main wall are
                    insufficient; indeed there is no pretence at scientific structure about any part
                    of the defences; but the site of the city is well chosen for defence, and the
                    water supply (drawn by canals from the Argandab or derived from wells) is
                    good.</p>
                <p>About 4 miles west of the present city, stretched along the slopes of a rocky
                    ridge, and extending into the plains at its foot, are the ruins of the old city
                    of Kandahar as it existed until it was sacked and plundered by Nadir Shah in
                    1738. From the top of the ridge a small citadel overlooks the half-buried ruins.
                    On the northeast face of the hill forty steps, cut out of solid limestone, lead
                    upward to a small, dome-roofed recess, which contains some interesting Persian
                    inscriptions cut in relief on the rock, recording particulars of the history of
                    Kandahar, and defining the vast extent of the kingdom of the emperor Baber.
                    Popular belief ascribes the foundation of the old city to Alexander the
                    Great.</p>
                <p>Although Kandahar has long ceased to be the seat of government, it is
                    nevertheless by far the most important trade centre in Afghanistan, and the
                    revenues of the Kandahar province assist largely in supporting the chief power
                    at Cabul. There are no manufactures or industries of any importance peculiar to
                    Kandahar, but the long lines of bazaars display goods from England, Russia,
                    Hindustan, Persia, and Turkestan, embracing a trade area as large probably as
                    that of any city in Asia. The customs and town dues together amount to a sum
                    equal to the land revenue of the Kandahar province, which is of considerable
                    extent, stretching to Pul-i-Sangin, 10 miles south of Khelat-i-Ghilzai on the
                    Cabul side, to the Helmand on the west, and to the Hazara country on the north.
                    Although Farrah has been governed from Kandahar since 1863, its revenues are not
                    reckoned as a part of those of the province. The land revenue proper is assessed
                    in grain, the salaries of Government officials, pay of soldiers, &amp;c., being
                    disbursed by “barats” or orders for grain at rates fixed by Government, usually
                    about 20 per cent, above the city market prices. The land revenue for the year
                    1877-78 amounted to 640,000 rupees English. English goods imported from
                    Kurrachee pay upwards of 18 per cent, on their value at Kandahar. By the time
                    they are exposed for sale at Herat they pay upwards of 28 per cent, <hi
                    rend="italic">ad valorem.</hi> Nevertheless the greater part of the English
                    goods sold at Herat are imported by Kurrachee and Kandahar—a fact which
                    testifies to the great insecurity of trade between Meshhed and Herat. Some of
                    the items included as town dues are curious. For instance, the tariff on animals
                    exposed for sale includes a charge of 5 per cent, <hi rend="italic">ad
                    valorem</hi> on slave girls, besides a charge of 1 rupee per head. The kidney
                    fat of all sheep and the skins of all goats slaughtered in the public yard are
                    perquisites of Government, the former being used for the manufacture of soap,
                    which, with snuff, is a Government monopoly. The imports consist chiefly of
                    English goods, indigo, cloth, boots, leather, sugar, salt, iron, and copper,
                    from Hindustan, and of shawls, carpets, “barak” (native woollen cloth), postins
                    (coats made of skins), shoes, silks, opium, and carpets from Meshhed, Herat, and
                    Turkestan. The exports are wool, cotton, madder, cummin seed, asafoetida, fruit,
                    silk, and horses. The system of coinage is also curious: 105 English rupees are
                    melted down, and the alloy extracted, leaving 100 rupees worth of silver; 295
                    more English rupees are then melted, and the molten metal mixed with the 100
                    rupees silver; and out of this 808 Kandahari rupees are coined. As the Kandahari
                    rupee is worth about 8 annas (half an English rupee) the Government thus
                    realizes a profit of 1 per cent. Government accounts are kept in “Kham” rupees,
                    the “Kham” being worth about five-sixths of a Kandahari rupee; in other words,
                    it about equals the franc, or the Persian “keran.” Immediately to the south and
                    west of Kandahar is a stretch of well-irrigated and highly cultivated country,
                    but it is the valley of the Argandab that possesses the chief local wealth of
                    agriculture, and which, from the luxuriant abundance of its orchards and
                    vineyards, offers the most striking scenes of landscape beauty. The wide extent
                    of the pomegranate fields forms a striking feature in the valley,—the
                    pomegranates of Kandahar, with its “sirdar” melons and grapes, being unequalled
                    in quality by any in the East. The vines are grown on artificial banks, probably
                    for want of the necessary wood to trellis them,—the grapes being largely
                    exported in a semi-dried state. Fruit, indeed, besides being largely exported,
                    forms the chief staple of the food supply of the inhabitants throughout
                    Afghanistan. The art of irrigation is so well understood that the water supply
                    is at times exhausted, no river water being allowed to run to waste. The plains
                    about Kandahar are chiefly watered by canals drawn from the Argandab near
                    Baba-wali, and conducted through the same gap in the hills which admits the
                    Herat road. The amount of irrigation and the number of water channels form a
                    considerable impediment to the movement of troops, not only immediately about
                    Kandahar, but iu all districts where the main rivers and streams are bordered by
                    green bands of cultivation. Irrigation by “karez” is also largely resorted to.
                    The karez is a system of underground channelling which usually taps a
                    sub-surface water supply at the foot of some of the many rugged and apparently
                    waterless hills which cover the face of the country. The broad nullahs which
                    seam their sides frequently possess a supply of water some distance below the
                    surface which can be tapped by boring. The water is not brought to the surface,
                    but is carried over long distances by an underground channel or drain, which is
                    constructed by sinking shafts at intervals along the required course, and
                    connecting the shafts by tunnelling. The general agricultural products of the
                    country are wheat, barley, pulse, fruit, madder, asafoetida, lucerne, clover,
                    and tobacco.</p>
                <p>Of the mineral resources of the Kandahar district not much is known, but an
                    abandoned gold mine exists about 2 miles north of the town. Some general idea of
                    the resources of the Kandahar district may be gathered from the fact that it
                    supplied the British troops with everything except luxuries during the entire
                    period of occupation in 1879-81; and that, in spite of the great strain thrown
                    on those resources by the presence of the two armies of Ayub Khan and of General
                    Roberts, and after the total failure of the autumn crops and only a partial
                    harvest the previous spring, the army was fed without great difficulty until the
                    final evacuation, at one-third of the prices paid in Quetta for supplies drawn
                    from India.</p>

                <p>Kandahar has a stormy history. Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni took it in the 11th
                    century from the Afghans who then held it. In the beginning of the 13th century
                    it was taken by Jenghiz Khan, and in the 14th by Timur. In 1507 it was captured
                    by the emperor Baber, but shortly afterwards it fell again into Afghan hands, to
                    be retaken by Baber in 1521. Baber’s son, Humayun, agreed to cede Kandahar to
                    Persia, but failed to keep his word, and the Persians besieged the place
                    unsuccessfully. Thus it remained in the possession of the Moghuls till 1625,
                    when it was taken by Shah Abbas. Aurungzebe tried to take it in 1649 with 5000
                    men, but failed. Another attempt in 1652 was equally unsuccessful. It remained
                    in Persian possession till 1709, when it was taken by the Afghans, but was
                    retaken after a two years’ siege by Nadir Shah. Nadir Shah was assassinated in
                    1749, and immediately on hearing the news of his death Ahmed Shah (Abdalli)
                    seized Nadir Shah’s treasure at Kandahar, and proclaimed himself king, with the
                    consent, not only of the Afghans, but, strange to say, of the Hazaras and
                    Baluchis as well. He at once changed the site of the city to its present
                    position, and thus founded the Afghan kingdom, with modern Kandahar as its
                    capital. Ahmed Shah died in 1773, and was succeeded by his son Taimur, who died
                    in 1793, and left the throne to his son Zaman Shah. This prince was deposed by
                    his half brother Mahmud, who was in his turn deposed by Shah Suja, the full
                    brother of Zaman Shah. After a .short reign Shah Suja was compelled to abdicate
                    from his inability to repress the rising power of Fatteh Khan, a Barakzai chief,
                    and he took refuge first with Runjit Singh, who then ruled the Punjab, and
                    finally secured the protection of British power. . Afghanistan was now
                    practically dismembered. Mahmud was reinstated by Fatteh Khan, whom he appointed
                    his vizier, and whose nephews, Dost Mahommed Khan and Kohn dil Khan, he placed
                    respectively in the governments of Cabul and Kandahar. Fatteh Khan was
                    barbarously murdered by Kamran (Mahmud’s son) near Ghazni in 1818; and in
                    retaliation Mahmud himself was driven from power, and the Barakzai clan secured
                    the sovereignty of Afghanistan. While Dost Mahommed held Cabul, Kandahar became
                    temporarily a sort of independent chiefship under two or three of his brothers.
                    In 1839 the cause of Shah Suja was actively supported by the British. Kandahar
                    was occupied, and Shah Suja reinstated on the throne of his ancestors. Dost
                    Mahommed was defeated near Cabul, and after surrender to the British force, was
                    deported into Hindustan. The British army of occupation in southern Afghanistan
                    continued to occupy Kandahar from 1839 till the autumn of 1842, when General
                    Nott marched on Cabul to meet Pollock’s advance from Jalalabad. The cantonments
                    near the city, built by Nott’s division, were repaired and again occupied by the
                    British army in 1879, when Shere Ali was driven from power by the invasion of
                    Afghanistan, nor were they finally evacuated till the spring of 1881. (T. H.
