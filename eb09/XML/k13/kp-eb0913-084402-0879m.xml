                    humble circumstances, he passed a quiet and almost undisturbed existence within
                    the narrow limits of his native place. Education, both of school and university,
                    he obtained at Königsberg, and during a prolonged academic activity in that
                    retired Prussian town he gave forth the works which have exercised such
                    influence on European thought that, in the estimation of the best historical
                    judges, they may be placed on a level with the great events of the French
                    Revolution as the most important factors in determining the characteristic
                    features of 19th century culture. A biography of Kant can be little more than a
                    record of the successive phases of his literary activity.</p>
                <p>The family of Kant was of Scotch extraction, the grandfather of the philosopher
                    having been an emigrant from Scotland who had settled, first at Memel, and
                    afterwards at Tilsit. The name Cant, as it was originally spelled, is not
                    uncommon in the north of Scotland, whence the family is said to have come, and
                    it is not perhaps mere fancy to trace in some of the ethical doctrines of the
                    critical philosophy and in the personal character of its author some of the
                    prominent features of Scottish nationality. The father of the philosopher
                    carried on the business of a saddler in Königsberg, and in that town, on the 22d
                    April 1724, was born Immanuel, the fourth of a large family, most of whom died
                    at an early age. Königsberg was then somewhat noted as a stronghold of what is
                    known as Pietism, a phase of religious thought and life which had in Germany, as
                    elsewhere, too much that was unpleasing, but which nevertheless was capable of
                    exercising a powerful influence for good on the development of a really strong
                    and ample character. “Say what you will of Pietism,” writes Kant to his friend
                    Rink, “no one can deny the real worth of the characters which it formed; they
                    possessed the highest that man can possess —a peace, a cheerfulness, an inner
                    harmony with self, which was disturbed by no passion.” To influences of this
                    kind Kant was subjected in his early years, partly from his mother, for whose
                    memory he ever cherished the warmest affection and regard, partly from his
                    excellent friend and patron, Schulz, the director of the Collegium Fredericianum
                    in Königsberg, and afterwards professor of theology in the university. At the
                    Collegium Fredericianum Kant was entered in his tenth year, with the definite
                    view of proceeding to the theological courses of the university. His inclination
                    at this time, determined probably by the high character of his teachers, was
                    towards classics, and he was recognized, with his schoolfellow, the afterwards
                    celebrated David Ruhnken, as among the most competent and promising classical
                    scholars of the college. His taste for the greater Latin authors, particularly
                    Lucretius, was never lost, and he acquired through his school training an
                    unusual facility in Latin composition. With Greek authors he does not appear to
                    have been equally familiar.</p>
                <p>During his university course, which began in 1740, Kant was principally attracted
                    towards mathematics and physics, doubtless through the influence of Knutzen, who
                    then, as extraordinary professor, lectured on most branches of mathematics and
                    also on philosophy. The lectures on classics do not seem to have satisfied Kant,
                    and, though he attended Schulz’s courses on theology, and even preached on one
                    or two occasions, he appears finally to have given up the intention of entering
                    the church. The last years of his university studies were much disturbed by the
                    straitened means of his family, and he was compelled to have recourse to private
                    teaching of the humblest kind. The death of his father, in 1746, destroyed his
                    hopes of remaining at the university until he should have obtained some
                    subordinate academic post. Much against his inclination he undertook the office
                    of private tutor, and for nine years acted in this capacity in various families
                    in the immediate neighbourhood of Königsberg. Although the life was not one
                    which Kant would have chosen, and one for which he was not specially
                    qualified—as he used to say regarding the excellent precepts of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Pedagogics,</hi> he was never able to apply them—yet it gave him
                    an extended knowledge of the world, and added to his other accomplishments the
                    grace and polish of refined society, which he displayed ever afterwards to a
                    degree somewhat unusual in a philosopher by profession.</p>
                <p>In 1755 Kant returned to Königsberg as tutor in the family of Count Kayserling.
                    By the kindness of a friend named Richter, he was enabled again to take up his
                    university career, and in autumn of that year he graduated as doctor and
                    qualified as “Privatdocent.” Two of the theses publicly defended on the occasion
                    are printed in his works; an address, on the easier and harder styles of
                    philosophical exposition, has not been publishe'd. For fifteen years he
                    continued to labour in this subordinate position, his fame as writer and
                    lecturer steadily increasing. On two occasions he was disappointed in the hope
                    of obtaining a professorship in his own university, but during this time, as in
                    later years, he refused all offers that would have withdrawn him <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0880-0845"/> from Königsberg. The only academic preferment
                    received by him during the lengthy probation was the post of underlibrarian, to
                    which he was appointed in 1766. His lectures, at first mainly upon physics,
                    gradually expanded until nearly all descriptions of philosophy were included
                    under them. A most interesting programme of his courses on metaphysics, logic,
                    ethics, and physical geography for the session 1765-66 has been printed in his
                    works (i. 289- 299). The history of his literary activity during this period
                    will be given in connexion with the notice of his writings.</p>
                <p>In 1770 he obtained the chair of logic and metaphysics at Königsberg, and
                    delivered as his inaugural address the dissertation <hi rend="italic">De
                    Mundi</hi><hi rend="italic">Sensibilis</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Iηtelligibilis Forma</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Principiis.</hi> Eleven years later appeared the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kritik</hi><hi rend="italic">of Pure Reason,</hi> the work towards which he had
                    been steadily advancing, and of which all his later writings are
                    developments.</p>
                <p>In 1783 he published the <hi rend="italic">Prologomena,</hi> intended as an
                    introduction to the <hi rend="italic">Kritik,</hi> which had been found to stand
                    in need of some explanatory comment. A second edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kritik,</hi> with some modifications, appeared in 1787, after which it remained
                    unaltered.</p>
                <p>In spite of its frequent obscurity, its novel terminology, and its declared
                    opposition to prevailing systems, the Kantian philosophy made rapid progress in
                    Germany. In the course of ten or twelve years from the publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kritik</hi><hi rend="italic">of Pure Reason,</hi> it was expounded
                    in all the leading universities, and it even penetrated into the schools of the
                    Church of Rome. Such men as Schulze in Königsberg, Kiesewetter in Berlin, Jakob
                    in Halle, Born and Heydenreich in Leipsic, Reinhold and Schmid in Jena, Buhle in
                    Göttingen, Tennemann in Marburg, and Snell in Giessen, with many others, made it
                    the basis of their philosophical teaching, while theologians like Tieftrunk,
                    Stäudlin, and Ammon -eagerly applied it to Christian doctrine and morality.
                    Young men flocked to Königsberg as to a shrine of philosophy. The Prussian
                    Government even undertook the expense of their support. Kant was hailed by some
                    as a second Messiah. He was consulted as an oracle on all questions of
                    casuistry,—as, for example <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> on the lawfulness of
                    inoculation for the small-pox. This universal homage for a long time left Kant
                    unaffected; it was only in his later years that he spoke of his system as the
                    limit of philosophy, and resented all further progress. He still pursued his
                    quiet round of lecturing and authorship, and contributed from time to time
                    papers to the literary journals. Of these, among the most remarkable was his
                    review of Herder’s <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of History,</hi> which greatly
                    exasperated that author, and led to a violent act of retaliation some years
                    after in his <hi rend="italic">Metakritik</hi><hi rend="italic">of Pure
                    Reason.</hi> Schiller at this period in vain sought to engage Kant upon his <hi
                    rend="italic">Horen.</hi> He remained true to the Berlin <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal,</hi> in which most of his criticisms appeared.</p>
                <p>In 1792 Kant, in the full height of his reputation, was involved in a painful
                    collision with the Government on the question of his religious doctrines.
                    Wöllner had replaced Von Zedlitz as minister of spiritual affairs, and, in an
                    age peculiarly lax and heterodox, an unwise attempt was made to apply a rigid
                    censorship to works of philosophical theology. It was not wonderful that the
                    philosophy of Kant had excited the declared opposition of all adherents of
                    historical Christianity, since its plain tendency was towards a moral
                    rationalism, and it-could not by any process of interpretation be reconciled to
                    the literal doctrines of the Lutheran Church. It would have been much better to
                    permit his exposition of the philosophy of religion to enjoy the same literary
                    rights as his earlier works, since Kant could not be interdicted without first
                    silencing a multitude of theologians who were at least equally separated from
                    positive Christianity. The Government, however, judged otherwise; and after the
                    first part of his book, <hi rend="italic">On Religion within the Limits of
                    Reason alone,</hi> had appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Berlin Journal,</hi>
                    the publication of the remainder, which treats in a more rationalizing style of
                    the peculiarities of Christianity, was forbidden. Kant, thus shut out from
                    Berlin, availed himself of his local* privilege, and, with the. sanction of the
                    theological faculty of his own university, published the full work in
                    Königsberg. The Government, who were probably as much influenced by hatred and
                    fear of the French Revolution, of which Kant was supposed to be a partisan, as
                    by love of orthodoxy, resented the act; and a secret cabinet order was received
                    by him intimating the displeasure of the king, Frederick William II., and
                    exacting from him a pledge not to lecture or write at all on religious subjects
                    in future. With this mandate Kant, after a struggle, complied, and kept his
                    engagement till 1797, when the death of the king, according to his construction
                    of his promise, set him free. This incident, however, produced a very
                    unfavourable effect on his spirits. He withdrew in 1794 from society; next year
                    he gave up all his classes but one public lecture on logic or metaphysics; and
                    in 1797, before the removal of the interdict on his theological teaching, he
                    ceased altogether his public labours, after an academic course of forty-two
                    years. He previously, in the same year, finished his treatises on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Metaphysics of Ethics,</hi> which, with his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anthropology,</hi> completed in 1798, were the last considerable works that he
                    revised with his own hand. His <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Logic,</hi> on <hi
                    rend="italic">Physical Geography,</hi> on <hi rend="italic">Paedagogics,</hi>
                    were edited during his lifetime by his friends and pupils. By way of asserting
                    his right to resume theological disquisition, he also issued in 1798 his <hi
                    rend="italic">Strife of the Faculties,</hi> in which all the strongest points of
                    his work on religion were urged afresh, and the correspondence that had passed
                    between himself and his censors was given to the world.</p>
                <p>From the date of his retirement from the chair Kant declined in strength, and
                    gave tokens of intellectual decay. His memory began to fail, and a large work at
                    which he wrought night and day, on the connexion between physics and
                    metaphysics, was found to be only a repetition of his already published
                    doctrines. After 1802, finding himself attacked with a weakness in the limbs,
                    attended with frequent fits of falling, he mitigated a little the Spartan
                    severity of his life, and also consented to receive medical advice. A constant
                    restlessness oppressed him; his sight gave way; his conversation became an
                    extraordinary mixture of metaphors; and it was only at intervals that gleams of
                    his former power broke out, especially when some old chord of association was
                    struck in natural science or physical geography. A few days before his decease,
                    with a great effort he thanked his medical attendant for his visits in the
                    words, “I have not yet lost my feeling for humanity.” On the 12th of February
                    1804, he breathed his last, having almost completed the eightieth year of his
                    age.</p>
                <p>It is superfluous to characterize the genius of Kant; but a few words may be
                    added as to his personal appearance and habits of life, study, and teaching. His
                    stature was small, and his appearance feeble. He was little more than 5 feet
                    high; his breast was almost concave, and, like Schleiermacher, he was deformed
                    in the right shoulder. His hair was light, his complexion fresh, his forehead
                    high and square, while his eye of light blue showed an expression of unusual
                    depth and power. His senses were quick and delicate; and, though of weak
                    constitution, he escaped, by strict regimen, all serious illness till the close
                    of life.</p>
                <p>His life was arranged with mechanical regularity; and, as he never married, he
                    kept the habits of his studious youth to old age. His man-servant awoke him
                    summer <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n881/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0881-0846"/> and winter at five o’clock; and, on being
                    appealed to on one occasion, testified that Kant had not once failed in thirty
                    years to respond to the call. After rising he studied for two hours, then
                    lectured other two, and spent the rest of the forenoon, till one, at his desk.
                    He then dined at a restaurant, which* he frequently changed, to avoid the influx
                    of strangers, who crowded to see and hear him— till in later years his growing
                    means enabled him to invite a friend or two daily to his own home. This was his
                    only regular meal; and, as he loved the <hi rend="italic">ducere</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">caenam</hi> of the Romans, he often prolonged the conversation
                    till late in the afternoon. He then walked out for at least an hour in all
                    weathers, and spent the evening in lighter reading, except an hour or two
                    devoted to the preparation of his next day’s lectures, after which he retired
                    between nine and ten to rest. The furniture of his house was of the simplest
                    character; and, though he left a considerable sum, the produce of his writings,
                    to his relatives, he indulged in no luxury, and was a pattern of that
                    superiority to fashion and appearance so often met within the literary life of
                    Germany. In his earlier years he often spent his evenings in general society,
                    where his overflowing knowledge and conversational talents made him the life of
                    every party. He was especially intimate with the families of two English
                    merchants of the name of Green and Motherby, where he found many opportunities
                    of meeting ship-captains, and other travelled persons, and thus gratifying his
                    passion for physical geography. This social circle included also the celebrated
                    Hamann—the Magus or Wizard of the North—the friend of Herder and Jacobi, who was
                    thus a mediator between Kant and these philosophical adversaries.</p>
                <p>Kant’s reading was of the most extensive and miscellaneous kind. He cared
                    comparatively little for the history of speculation, being in this department
                    more a discoverer than a scholar. But his acquaintance with books of science,
                    general history, travels, and belles lettres was boundless. He was well versed
                    in English literature, chiefly of the age of Queen Anne, and had read English
                    philosophy from Locke to Hume, and the Scottish school. He was at home in
                    Voltaire and Rousseau, but had little or no acquaintance with the French
                    sensational philosophy. He was familiar with all German literature up to the
                    date of his <hi rend="italic">Kritik,</hi> but ceased to follow it in its great
                    development by Goethe and Schiller. It was his habit to obtain books in sheets
                    from his publishers Kanter and Nicolovius; and he read over for many years all
                    the new works in their catalogue, in order to keep abreast of universal
                    knowledge. He was excessively fond of newspapers and works on politics; aiìd
                    this was the only kind of reading that could interrupt his studies in
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>As a lecturer, Kant avoided altogether that rigid style in which his books were
                    written, and which was only meant for thinkers by profession. He sat behind a
                    low desk, with a few jottings on slips of paper, or text-books marked on the
                    margin, before him, and delivered an extemporaneous address, opening up the
                    subject by partial glimpses, and with many digressions and interspersed
                    anecdotes or familiar illustrations, till a complete idea of it was presented.
                    His voice was extremely weak, but sometimes rose into eloquence, and always
                    commanded perfect silence. Like Adam Smith, he fixed his eye on one student, and
                    marked by his countenance whether the lecture was understood. The least
                    irregularity in the appearance or dress of this selected hearer disconcerted
                    him; and the story is well known of the missing button, which defeated a
                    lecture. Though kind to his students, he refused on principle to remit their
                    fees, as this, he thought, would discourage independence. It was another
                    principle that his chief exertions should be bestowed on the intermediate class
                    of talent, as the geniuses would help themselves, and the dunces were beyond
                    remedy. Hence he never delivered his deeper doctrines, such as are found in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Kritik,</hi> from the chair. His other avocations allowed him
                    little personal intercourse with his numerous hearers, and he often complained
                    of the want of lively sympathy and ascertained progress inseparable from such a
                    system.</p>
                <p>Simple, honourable, truthful, kind-hearted, and high-minded as Kant was in all
                    moral respects, he was somewhat deficient in the region of sentiment. He had
                    little enthusiasm for the beauties of nature, and indeed never sailed out into
                    the Baltic, or travelled more than 40 miles from Königsberg. Music he
                    disregarded, and all poetry that w as more than sententious prose. His ethics
                    have been reproached with some justice as setting up too low an ideal for the
                    female sex. Though faithful in a high degree to the duties of friendship, he
                    could not bear to visit his friends in sickness, and after their death he
                    repressed all allusion to their memory. His engrossing intellectual labours no
                    doubt tended somewhat to harden his character; and in his zeal for rectitude of
                    purpose he forgot the part which affection and sentiment must ever play in the
                    human constitution. Those who count these defects most grave will yet find much
                    to admire in the lofty tone of his character, and in the benevolence which could
                    thus express itself: “Whoever will suggest to me a good action left undone, him
                    will I thank, though he suggest it even in my last hour !”</p>
                <p>This brief notice of his life may appropriately close with Herder’s beautiful
                    sketch of Kant’s character, all the more interesting that it was written in
                    1795, after their quarrel: —“I have had the good fortune to know a philosopher
                    who was my teacher. In the vigour of life he had the same youthful gaiety of
                    heart that now follows him I believe into old age. His open forehead, built for
                    thought, was the seat of imperturbable cheerfulness and joy; the most pregnant
                    discourse flowed from his lips; wit, humour, and raillery came to him at will,
                    and his instructions had all the charm of an entertainment. With the same easy
                    mastery with which he tested the doctrines of Leibnitz, Wolf, Baumgarten,
                    Crusius, and Hume, or pursued the discoveries of Newton, Kepler, and other
                    lights of science, he also took up the current writings of Rousseau, such as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Émile</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Héloise,</hi> or any new
                    phenomenon of the natural world, and from the criticism of each came back to the
                    impartial study of nature, and to the enforcement of the dignity of man. History
                    in all its branches, natural science, physics, mathematics, and experience were
                    the materials that gave interest to his lectures and his conversation; nothing
                    worthy of study was to him indifferent; no faction or sect, no selfishness or
                    vanity, had for him the least attraction, compared with the extension and
                    elucidation of truth. He excited and pleasantly impelled us to mental
                    independence; despotism was foreign to his nature. This man, whom I name with
                    the deepest gratitude and respect, is Immanuel Kant; his image rises before me
                    surrounded with pleasing recollections !”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Writings of Kant.</hi></p>
                <p>From the preceding sketch of Kant’s academic activity it must be evident that he
                    combined in a quite unusual degree knowledge of physical science with
                    speculative acuteness and devotion to the special work of philosophy. No other
                    thinker of modern times has been throughout his work so penetrated with the
                    fundamental conceptions of physical science; no other has been able to hold with
                    such firmness the balance between empirical and speculative ideas. Beyond all
                    question much of the influence which the critical philosophy has exercised and
                    continues to exercise must be ascribed to this characteristic feature in the
                    training of its great author.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n882/mode/1up"

                <p>The early writings of Kant are almost without exception on questions of physical
                    science. It was only by degrees that philosophical problems began to engage his
                    attention, and that the main portion of his literary activity was turned towards
                    them. It will be convenient, therefore, in enumerating the varied writings of
                    Kant, to place in a separate group those which bear directly on physical
                    science. The following are the most important in this group :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Thoughts on the True Estimate of Eis Viva,</hi> 1747: an
                    essay dealing with the famous dispute between the Cartesians and Leibnitzians
                    regarding the expression for the <hi rend="italic">amount of a force.</hi>
                    According to the Cartesians, this quantity was directly proportional to
                    velocity; according to their opponents, it varied with the square of the
                    velocity. The dispute has now lost its interest, for physicists have learned to
                    distinguish accurately the two quantities which are vaguely included under the
                    expression <hi rend="italic">amount of</hi> ∕orcc,and consequently have been
                    able to show in what each party was correct and in what it was in error. Kant’s
                    essay, with some fallacious explanations and divisions, criticizes acutely the
                    arguments of the Leibnitzians, and concludes with an attempt to show that both
                    modes of expression are correct when correctly limited and interpreted.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Whether the Earth in its Revolution has experienced some
                    Change since the Earliest Times,</hi> 1754. In this brief essay Kant throws out
                    a notion which has since been carried out, in ignorance of Kant’s priority, by
                    Delaunay (1865) and Adams. He points out that the action of the moon in raising
                    the waters of the earth must have a secondary effect in the slight retardation
                    of the earth’s motion, and refers to a similar cause the fact that the moon
                    turns always the same face to the earth.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">General History and Theory of the Heavens</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic">‘</hi> ‘ Allgemein e NaturGeschichte und
                    Theorie des Himmels ”), published anonymously in 1755. In this remarkable work
                    Kant, proceeding from the Newtonian conception of the solar system, extends his
                    consideration to the entire sidereal system, points out how the whole may be
                    mechanically regarded, and throws out the important speculation which has since
                    received the title of the nebular hypothesis. In some details, such, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as the regarding of the motion of the entire solar
                    system as portion of the general cosmical mechanism, he had predecessors, among
                    others J. Wright of Durham, but the work as a whole contains a wonderfully acute
                    anticipation of much that was afterwards carried out by Herschel and Laplace.
                    The hypothesis of the original nebular condition of the system, with the
                    consequent explanation of the great phenomena of planetary formations and
                    movements of the satellites and rings, is unquestionably to be assigned to
                    Kant.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Brief Account of some Thoughts on Fire</hi> (“Meditationum
                    quarun-dam de Igne succincta delineatio”), 1755: an inaugural dissertation,
                    containing little beyond the notion that bodies operate on one another through
                    the medium of a uniformly diffused, elastic, and subtle matter (ether) which is
                    the underlying substance of heat and light. Both heat and light are regarded as
                    vibrations of this diffused ether.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">On the Causes of Earthquakes,</hi> 1755; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Description of the Earthquake of</hi> 1755, 1756; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Consideration of some Recently Experienced Earthquakes,</hi> 1756.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Explanatory Remarks on the Theory of the Winds,</hi> 1756.
                    In this brief tract, Kant, apparently in entire ignorance of the explanation
                    given in 1735 by Hadley, points out how the varying velocity of rotation of the
                    successive zones of the earth’s surface furnishes a key to the phenomena of
                    periodic winds. His theory is in almost entire agreement with that now received.
                    See the parallel statements from Kant’s tract and Dove’s essay on the influence
                    of the rotation of the earth on the flow of its atmosphere, 1835, given in
                    Zellner’s work, <hi rend="italic">Ueber die</hi><hi rend="italic">Natur der
                    Cometen,</hi> pp. 477-482.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">On the Different Races of Men,</hi> 1775; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Determination of the Notion of a Human Race,</hi> 1785; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conjectural Beginning of Human History,</hi> 1786: three tracts containing some
                    points of interest as regards the empirical grounds for Kant’s doctrine of
                    teleology. Reference will be made to them in the notice of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kritik</hi><hi rend="italic">of Judgment.</hi></p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">On the Eolcanoes in the Moon,</hi> 1785; <hi rend="italic"
                    >On the Influence of the Moon on the Weather,</hi> 1794. The second of these
                    contains a remarkable discussion of the relation between the centre of the
                    moon’s figure and its centre of gravity. From the difference between these Kant
                    is led to conjecture that the climatic conditions of the side of the moon turned
                    from us must be altogether unlike those of the face presented to us. His views
                    have been restated by Hansen.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Physical Geography,</hi> 1822: published from
                    notes of Kant’s lectures, with the approval of the author.</p>
                <p>Consideration of these works is sufficient to show that Kant's mastery of the
                    science of his time was complete and thorough, and that his philosophy is to be
                    dealt with as having throughout a reference to general scientific conceptions.
                    For more detailed treatment of his importance in science, reference may be made
                    to Zöllner’s essay on “Kant and his Merits on Natural Science” contained in the
                    .work on the <hi rend="italic">Nature of Comets</hi> (pp. 426-484); to Dietrich,
                    <hi rend="italic">Kant and Newton;</hi> to Schultze, <hi rend="italic">Kant and
                    Darwin;</hi> and to Reuschle’s careful analysis of the scientific works in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic">Vicrteljahrs-schrift,</hi>
                    1868.</p>
                <p>The notice of the philosophical writings of Kant need not be more than
                    bibliographical, as in the account of his philosophy it will be necessary to
                    consider at some length the successive stages in the development of his thought.

                <p>Historians are accustomed to divide the general current of speculation into
                    epochs or periods marked by the dominance of some single philosophic conception
                    with its systematic evolution. Perhaps in no case is the character of an epoch
                    more clearly apparent than in that of the critical philosophy. The great work of
                    Kant absolutely closed the lines of speculation along which the philosophical
                    literature of the 18th century had proceeded, and substituted for them a new and
                    more comprehensive method of regarding the essential problems of thought, a
                    method which has prescribed, the course of philosophic speculation in the
                    present age. The critical system has thus a twofold aspect. It takes up into
                    itself what had characterized the previous efforts of modem thought, shows the
                    imperfect nature of the fundamental notions therein employed, and offers a new
                    solution of the problems to which these notions had been applied. It opens up a
                    new series of questions upon which subsequent philosophic reflexion has been
                    directed, and gives to them the form, under which it is possible that they
                    should be <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n883/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0883-0848"/> fruitfully regarded. A work of this kind is
                    essentially epoch-making. , .</p>
                <p>In any complete account of the Kantian system it is therefore necessary that
                    there should be constant reference, on the one hand, to the peculiar character
                    of the preceding 18th century philosophy, and, on the other hand, to the
                    problems left for renewed treatment to more modern thought. Fortunately the
                    development of the Kantian system itself furnishes such treatment as is
                    necessary of the former reference. For the critical philosophy "was a work of
                    slow growth. In the early writings of Kant we are able to trace with great
                    definiteness the successive stages through which he passed from the notions of
                    the preceding philosophy to the new and comprehensive method which gives its
                    special character to the critical work. Scarcely any great mind, it has been
                    said with justice, ever matured so slowly. In the early essays we find the
                    principles of the current philosophies, those of Leibnitz and English
                    empiricism, applied in various directions to those problems which serve as tests
                    of their truth and completeness; we note the appearance of the difficulties or
                    contradictions which manifest the one-sidedness or imperfection of the principle
                    applied; and we can trace the gradual growth of the new conceptions which were
                    destined, in the completed system, to take the place of the earlier method. To
                    understand the Kantian work it is indispensable to trace the history of its
                    growth in the mind of its author.</p>
                <p>Of the two preceding stages of modern philosophy, only the second, that of Locke
                    and Leibnitz, seems to have influenced practically the course of Kant’s
                    speculation. With the Cartesian movement as a whole he shows little acquaintance
                    and no sympathy, and lιis own philosophic conception is never brought into
                    relation with the systematic treatment of metaphysical problems characteristic
                    of the Cartesian method. The fundamental question for philosophic reflexion
                    presented itself to him in the form which it had assumed in the hands of Locke
                    and his successors in England, of Leibnitz and the Leibnitzian school in
                    Germany. The transition from the Cartesian movement to this second stage of
                    modern thought had doubtless been natural and indeed necessary. Nevertheless the
                    full bearings of the philosophic question were somewhat obscured by the
                    comparatively limited fashion in which it was then regarded. The tendency
                    towards what may be technically called subjectivism, a tendency which
                    differentiates the modern from the ancient method of speculation, is expressed
                    in Locke and Leibnitz in a definite and peculiar fashion. However widely the two
                    systems differ in details, they are at one in a certain fundamental conception
                    which dominates the whole course of their philosophic construction. They are
                    throughout individualist, <hi rend="italic">i.</hi><hi rend="italic">β.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> they accept as given fact the existence of the concrete,
                    thinking subject, and endeavour to show how this subject, as an individual
                    conscious being, is related to the wider universe of which he forms part. In
                    dealing with such a problem, there are evidently two lines along which
                    investigation may proceed. It may be asked how the individual mind comes to know
                    himself and the system of things with which he is connected, how the varied
                    contents of his experience are to be accounted for, and what certainty attaches
                    to his subjective consciousness of things. Regarded from the individualist point
                    of view, this line of inquiry becomes purely psychological, and the answer may
                    be presented, as it was presented by Locke, in the fashion of a natural history
                    of the growth of conscious experience in the mind of the subject. Or, it may be
                    further asked, how is the individual really connected with the system of things
                    apparently disclosed to' him in conscious experience? what is. the precise
                    significance of the existence which he ascribes both to himself and to the
                    objects of experience? what is the nature of the relation between himself as one
                    part of the system, and the system as a whole? This second inquiry is
                    specifically metaphysical in bearing, and the kind of answer furnished to it by
                    Leibnitz on the one hand, by Berkeley on the other, is in fact prescribed or
                    determined beforehand by the fundamental conception of the individualist method
                    with which both begin their investigations. So soon as we make clear to
                    ourselves the essential nature of this method, we are able to discern the
                    specific difficulties or perplexities arising in the attempt to carry it out
                    systematically, and thus to note with precision the special problems presented
                    to Kant at the outset of his philosophic reflexions.</p>
                <p>Consider, first, the application of the method on its psychological side, as it
                    appears in Locke. Starting with the assumption of conscious experience as the
                    content or filling-in of the individual mind, Locke proceeds to explain its
                    genesis and nature by reference to.the real universe of things and its
                    mechanical operation upon the mind. The result of the interaction of mind, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the individual mind, and the system of things, is
                    conscious experience, consisting of ideas, which may be variously compounded,
                    divided, compared“or dealt with by the subjective faculties or powers with which
                    the entity, Mind, is supposed to be endowed. Matter of fact and matter of
                    knowledge are thus at a stroke dissevered. The very notion of relation between
                    mind and things leads at once to the counter notion of the absolute restriction
                    of mind to its own subjective nature. That Locke was unable to reconcile these
                    opposed notions is not surprising; that the difficulties and obscurities of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> arise from the impossibility of reconciling them is
                    evident on the slightest consideration of the main positions of that work. Of
                    these difficulties the philosophies of Berkeley and Hume are systematic
                    treatments. In Berkeley we find the resolute determination to accept only the
                    one notion, that of mind as restricted to its own conscious experience, and to
                    attempt by this means to explain the nature of the external reality to which,
                    obscure reference is made. Any success in the attempt is due only to the fact
                    that Berkeley introduces alongside of his individualist notion a totally new
                    conception, that of mind itself as not in the same way one of the matters of
                    conscious experience, but as capable of reflexion upon the whole of experience
                    aud of reference to the supreme mind as the ground of all reality. It is only in
                    Hume that we have definitely and completely the evolution of the individualist
                    notion as groundwork of a theory of knowledge; and it is in his writings,
                    therefore, that we may expect to find the fundamental difficulty of that notion
                    clearly apparent. It is not a little remarkable that we should find in Hume, not
                    only the sceptical dissolution of all fixity of cognition, which is the
                    inevitable result of the individualist method, but also the clearest
                    consciousness of the very root of the difficulty. The systematic application of
                    the doctrine that conscious experience consists only of isolated objects of
                    knowledge, impressions or ideas, leads Hume to distinguish between truths
                    reached by analysis and truths which involve real connexion of the objects of
                    knowledge. The first he is willing to accept without further inquiry, though it
                    is an error to suppose, as Kant seems to have supposed, that he regarded
                    mathematical propositions as coming under this head (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hume)</hi>; with respect to the second, he finds himself, and confesses that he
                    finds himself, hopelessly at fault. No real connexions between isolated objects
                    of experience are perceived by us. No single matter of fact necessarily implies
                    the existence of any other. In short, if the difficulty be put in its ultimate
                    form, no existence thought as a distinct individual can transcend itself, or
                    imply relation to any other existence. If the parts of conscious experience are
                    regarded as so many distinct things, there is no possibility of connecting them
                    other than contingently, if at all. If the individual mind be really thought as
                    individual, it is impossible to explain how it should have knowledge or
                    consciousness at all. “In short,” says Hume, “there are two principles which I
                    cannot render consistent, nor is it in my power to renounce either of them,
                    viz., <hi rend="italic">that all our distinct perceptions are distinct
                    existences,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">that the mind never perceives any real
                    connexion among distinct existences.</hi> Did our perceptions either inhere in
                    something simple or individual, or did the mind perceive some real connexion
                    among them, there would be no difficulty in the case” (App. to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Treatise of Human Haturd).</hi></p>
                <p>Thus, on the one hand, the individualist conception, when carried out to its full
                    extent, leads to the total negation of all real cognition. If the real system of
                    things, to which conscious experience has reference, be regarded as standing in
                    causal relation to this experience, there is no conceivable ground for the
                    extension to reality of the notions which somehow are involved in thought. The
                    same result is apparent, on the other hand, when we consider the theory of
                    knowledge implied in the Leibnitzian individualism. The metaphysical conception
                    of the monads, each of which is the universe <hi rend="italic">in mice,</hi>
                    presents insuperable difficulties when the connexion or interdependence of the
                    monads is in question, and these difficulties obtrude themselves when the
                    attempt is made to work out a consistent doctrine of cognition. For the whole
                    mass of cognizable fact, the <hi rend="italic">mundus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >intelligibilis,</hi> is contained <hi rend="italic">impliciter</hi> in each
                    monad, and the several modes of apprehension can only be regarded as so many
                    stages in the developing consciousness of the monad. Sense and understanding,
                    real connexion of facts and analysis of notions, are not, therefore, distinct in
                    kind, but differ only in degree. The same fundamental axioms, the logical
                    principles of identity and sufficient reason, are applicable in explanation of
                    all given propositions. It is true that Leibnitz himself did not work out any
                    complete doctrine of knowledge, but in the hands of his successors the theory
                    took definite shape in the principle that the whole work of cognition is in
                    essence analytical. The process of analysis might be complete or incomplete. For
                    finite intelligences there was an inevitable incompleteness so far as knowledge
                    of matters of fact was concerned. In respect to them, the final result was found
                    in a series of irreducible notions or categories, the <hi rend="italic">prima
                    possibilia,</hi> the analysis and elucidation of which was specifically the
                    business of philosophy or metaphysics.</p>
                <p>It will be observed that, in the Leibnitzian as in the empirical individualism,
                    the fundamental notion is still that of the abstract separation of the thinking
                    subject from the materials of conscious experiexce. From this separation arise
                    all the difficulties in the effort to develop the notion systematically, and in
                    tracing the history of Kant’s philosophical progress we are able to discern the
                    gradual perception on his part that here was to be found the ultimate cause of
                    the perplexities which became apparent in considering the subordinate
                    doctrinesof the system. The successive essays which have already been enumerated
                    as composing Kant’s precritical work are not to be regarded as so many imperfect
                    sketches of the doctrines of the <hi rend="italic">Kritik,</hi> nor are we to
                    look in them for anticipations of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0884-0849"/> critical view. They are essentially tentative,
                    and exhibit with unusual clearness the manner in which the difficulties of a
                    received theory force on a wider and more comprehensive view. There can be no
                    doubt that some of the special features of the <hi rend="italic">Kritik</hi> are
                    to be found in these precritical essays, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    doctrine of the <hi rend="italic">Aesthetik</hi> is certainly foreshadowed in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation</hi> of 1770; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kritik,</hi> however, is no patchwork, and what appears in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertation</hi> takes an altogether new form when it is wrought
                    into the more comprehensive conception of the later treatise.</p>
                <p>The particular problem which gave the occasion to .the first of the precritical
                    writings is, in an imperfect or particular fashion, the fundamental question to
                    which the <hi rend="italic">Kritik</hi> is an answer. What is the nature of the
                    distinction between knowledge gained by analysis of notions and knowledge of
                    matters of fact? Kant seems never to have been satisfied with the Wolffian
                    identification of logical axioms and of the principle of sufficient reason. The
                    tract on the <hi rend="italic">False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic
                    Figures,</hi> in which the view of thought or reason as analytic is clearly
                    expressed, closes with the significant division of judgments into those which
                    rest upon the logical axioms of identity and contradiction and those for which
                    no logical ground can be shown. Such immediate or indemonstrable judgments, it
                    is said, abound in our experience. They are, in fact, as Kant presently
                    perceived, the foundations for all judgments regarding real existence. It was
                    impossible that the question regarding their nature and legitimacy and their
                    distinction from analytic judgments should not present itself to him. Tire three
                    tracts belonging to the years 1763-64 bring forward in the sharpest fashion the
                    essential opposition between the two classes of judgments. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on Negative Quantities,</hi> the fundamental thought is the
                    total distinction in kind between logical opposition (the contradictoriness of
                    notions, which Kant always viewed as formed, definite products of thought) and
                    real opposition. For the one the adequate explanation is found in the logical
                    axiom of analytical thinking; for the other no such explanation is to be had.
                    Logical ground and real ground are totally distinct. “I can understand perfectly
                    well,” says Kant, “how a consequence follows from its reason according to the
                    law of identity, since it is discoverable by mere analysis of the notion
                    contained in it. . . . But how something follows from another thing and not
                    according to the law of identity, this I should gladly have made clear to me. .
                    . . How shall I comprehend that, since something is, something else should be ?”
                    Real things, in short, are distinct existences, and, as distinct, not
                    necessarily or logically connected in thought. “I have,” he proceeds, ‘ ‘
                    reflected on the nature of our knowledge in relation to our judgments of reason
                    and consequent, and I intend to expound fully the result of my reflexions. It
                    follows from them that the relation of a real ground to that which is thereby
                    posited or denied cannot be ex-pessed by a judgment but only by means of a
                    notion, which by analysis may certainly be reduced to yet simpler notions of
                    real grounds, but yet in such a way that the final resort of all our cognition
                    in this regard must be found in simple and irreducible notions of real grounds,
                    the relation of which to their consequents cannot be made clear.”</p>
                <p>The striking similarity between Kant’s expressions in this <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay</hi> and the remarks with which Hume introduces his analysis of the
                    notion of cause has led to the supposition that at this period of his
                    philosophical career Kant was definitely under the influence of the earlier
                    empirical thinker. Consideration of the whole passage is quite sufficient to
                    show the groundlessness of this supposition. The difficulty with which Kant is
                    presented was one arising inevitably from reflexion upon the Leibnitzian theory
                    of knowledge, and the solution does not in any way go beyond that theory. It is
                    a solution, in fact, which must have been impossible had the purport of Hume’s
                    empirical doctrine been present to Kant’s mind. He is here at the point at which
                    he remained for many years, accepting without any criticism certain fundamental
                    notions as required for real cognition. His ideal of metaphysic is still that of
                    complete analysis of given notions. No glimmering of the further question,
                    Whence come these notions and with what right do we apply them in cognition? is
                    yet apparent. Any direct influence from Hume must be referred to a later period
                    in his career.</p>
                <p>The prize essay <hi rend="italic">On the Principles of Natural Theology and
                    Morals</hi> brings forward the same fundamental opposition,—though in a special
                    form. Here, for the first time, appears definitely the distinction between
                    synthesis and analysis, and in the distinction is found the reason for the
                    superior certainty and clearness of mathematics as opposed to philosophy.
                    Mathematics, Kant thinks, proceeds synthetically, for in it the notions are
                    constructed. Metaphysics, on the other hand, is analytical in method; in it the
                    notions are given, and by analysis they are cleared up. It is to be observed
                    that the description of mathematics as synthetic is not an anticipation of the
                    critical doctrine on the same subject. Kant does not, in this place, raise the
                    question as to the reason for assuming that the arbitrary syntheses of
                    mathematical construction have any reference to reality. The deeper significance
                    of synthesis has not yet become apparent.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Only Possible Ground of Proof for the Existence of
                    God,</hi> the argument, though largely Leibnitzian, advances one step further
                    towards the ultimate inquiry. For there Kant states as precisely as in the
                    critique of speculative theology his fundamental doctrine that real existence is
                    not a predicate to be added in thought to the conception of a possible subject.
                    So far as subjective thought is concerned, possibility, not real existence, is
                    contained in any judgment.</p>
                <p>The year 1765 was marked by the publication of Leibnitz’s posthumous <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouveaux Essais,</hi> in which his theory of knowledge is more
                    fully stated than in any of his previous tracts. In all probability Kant gave
                    some attention to this work, though no special reference to it occurs in his
                    writings, and it may have assisted to give additional precision to his doctrine.
                    In the curious essay, <hi rend="italic">Dreams of a Clairvoyant,</hi> published
                    1766, he emphasizes his previously reached conclusion that connexions of real
                    fact are mediated in our thought by ultimate notions, but adds that the
                    significance and warrant for such notions can be furnished only by experience.
                    He is inclined, therefore, to regard as the function of metaphysics the complete
                    statement of these ultimate, indemonstrable notions, and therefore the
                    determination of the limits to knowledge by their means. Even at this point,
                    where he approximates more closely to Hume than to any other thinker, the
                    difficulty raised by Hume does not seem to occur to him. He still appears to
                    think that experience does warrant the employment of such notions, and when
                    there is taken into account his correspondence with Lambert during the next few
                    years, one would be inclined to say that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Architektonik</hi> of the latter represents most completely Kant’s idea of
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>On another side Kant had been shaking himself free from the principles of the
                    Leibnitzian philosophy. According to Leibnitz, space, the order of coexisting
                    things, resulted from the relations of monads to one another. But Kant began to
                    see that such a conception did not accord with the manner in which we determine
                    directions or positions in space. In the curious little essay, <hi rend="italic"
                    >On the Ground of distinguishing Particular Divisions in Space,</hi> he pointed
                    out that the idea of space as a whole is not deducible from the experience of
                    particular spaces, or particular relations of objects in space, that we only
                    cognize relations in space by reference to space as a whole, and finally that
                    definite positions involve reference to space as a given whole.</p>
                <p>The whole development of Kant’s thought up to this point is intelligible when
                    regarded from the Leibnitzian point of view, with which he started. There
                    appears no reason to conclude that Hume at this time exercised any direct
                    influence. One may go still further, and add that even in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertation</hi> of 1770, generally regarded as more than foreshadowing the
                    <hi rend="italic">Kritik,</hi> the really critical question is not involved. A
                    brief notice of the contents of this tract will suffice to show how far removed
                    Kant yet was from the methods and principles of the critical or transcendental
                    philosophy. Sense and understanding, according to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertation,</hi> are the two sources of knowledge. The objects of the one are
                    things of sense or <hi rend="italic">phenomena</hi>; the objects of the other
                    are <hi rend="italic">noumena.</hi> These are absolutely distinct, and are not
                    to be regarded as differing only in degree. In <hi rend="italic">phenomena</hi>
                    we distinguish <hi rend="italic">matter,</hi> which is given by sense, and <hi
                    rend="italic">form,</hi> which is the law of the order of sensations. Such form
                    is twofold—the order of space and time. Sensations formed by space and time
                    compose the world of appearance, and this when treated by the understanding,
                    according to logical rules, is <hi rend="italic">experience.</hi> But the
                    logical use of the understanding is not its only use. Much more important is the
                    <hi rend="italic">real</hi> use, by which are produced the pure notions whereby
                    we think things as they are. These pure notions are the laws of the operation of
                    the intellect; they are <hi rend="italic">leges</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >intellectus.</hi></p>
                <p>Apart, then, from the expanded treatment of space and time as subjective forms,
                    we find in the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation</hi> little more than the very
                    precise and definite formulation of the slowly growing opposition to the
                    Leibnitzian doctrines. That the pure intellectual notions should be defended as
                    springing from the nature of intellect is not out of harmony with the statement
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Träume eines Geistersehers,</hi> for there the pure
                    notions were allowed to exist, but were not held to have validity for actual
                    things except on grounds of experience. Here they are supposed to exist,
                    dissevered from experience, and are allowed validity as determinations of things
                    in themselves.</p>
                <p>The stage which Kant had now reached in his philosophical development was one of
                    great significance. The doctrine of knowledge expressed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertation</hi> was the final form which the Wolffian rationalism could
                    assume for him, and, though many of the elements of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kritik</hi> are contained therein, it was not really in advance of the Wolffian
                    theory. The doctrine of space and time as forms of sense-perception, the
                    reference of both space and time and the pure intellectual notions to the laws
                    of the activity of mind itself, the distinction between sense and understanding
                    as one of kind, not of degree, with the correlative distinction between
                    phenomena and noumena,—all of these reappear, though changed and modified, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Kritik.</hi> But, despite this resemblance, it seems clear
                    that, so far as the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation</hi> Js concerned, the way
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n885/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0885-0850"/> had only been prepared for the true critical
                    inquiry, and that the real import of Hume’s sceptical problem had not yet dawned
                    upon Kant. From the manner, however, in which the doctrine of knowledge had been
                    stated in the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation,</hi> the further inquiry had been
                    rendered inevitable. It had become quite impossible for Kant to remain longer
                    satisfied with the ambiguous position assigned to a fundamental element of his
                    doctrine of knowledge, the so-called pure intellectual notions. These notions,
                    according to the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation,</hi> had no function save in
                    relation to things-in-themselves, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to objects which
                    are not directly or immediately brought into relation to our faculty of
                    cognition. They did not serve as the connecting links of formed experience; on
                    the contrary, they were supposed to be absolutely dissevered from all experience
                    which was possible for intelligence like ours. In his previous essays, Kant,
                    while likewise maintaining that such pure, irreducible notions existed, had
                    asserted in general terms that they applied to experience, and that their
                    applicability or justification rested on experience itself, but had not raised
                    the question as to the ground of such justification. Now, from another side, the
                    supreme difficulty was presented−how could such notions have application to any
                    objects whatsoever? For some time the correlative difficulty, how <hi
                    rend="italic">objects</hi> of sense-perception were possible, does not seem to
                    have suggested itself to Kant. In the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation</hi>
                    sense-perception had been taken as receptivity of representations of objects,
                    and experience as the product of the treatment of such representations by the
                    logical or analytical processes of understanding. Some traces of this confused
                    fashion of regarding sense-perceptions are left even in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kritik,</hi> specially perhaps in the <hi rend="italic">Aesthetik,</hi> and
                    they give rise to much of the ambiguity which unfortunately attaches to the more
                    developed theory of cognition. So soon, however, as the critical question was
                    put, on what rests the reference of representations in us to the object or
                    thing? in other words, how do we come to have knowledge of objects at all? it
                    became apparent that the problem was one of perfect generality, and applied, not
                    only to cognition through the pure notions, but to sense-perceptions likewise.
                    It is in the statement of this general problem that we find the new and
                    characteristic feature of Kant’s work.</p>
                <p>There is thus no reason to doubt the substantial accuracy of Kant’s reference to
                    the particular occasion or cause of the critical inquiry. Upto the stage
                    indicated bythe <hi rend="italic">Dissertation,</hi> he had been attempting, in
                    various ways, to unite two radically divergent modes of explaining
                    cognition—that which would account for the content of experience by reference to
                    affection from things without us, and that which viewed the intellect itself as
                    somehow furnished with the means of pure, rational cognition. He now discovered
                    that Hume’s sceptical analysis of the notion of cause was really the treatment
                    of one typical or crucial instance of the much more general problem. If
                    experience, says Hume, consists solely of states of mind somehow given to us,
                    each of which exists as an effect, and therefore as distinct from others, with
                    what right do we make the common assumption that parts of experience are
                    necessarily connected? The only possible answer, drawn from the premises laid
                    down, must be that there is no warrant for such an assumption. Necessity for
                    thought, as Kant had been willing to admit and as Hume also held, involves or
                    implies something more than is given in experience—for that which is given is
                    contingent—and rests upon an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> or pure notion. But
                    <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> notions, did they exist, could have no claim to
                    regulate experience. Hume, therefore, for his part, rejected entirely the notion
                    of cause as being fictitious and delusive, aiιd professed to account for the
                    habit of regarding experience as necessarily connected by reference to
                    arbitrarily formed custom of thinking. Experience, as given, contingent
                    material, had a certain uniformity, and recurring uniformities generated in us
                    the habit of regarding things as necessarily connected. That such a resort to
                    experience for explanation could lead to no valid conclusion has been already
                    noted as evident to Hume himself.</p>
                <p>The dogmatic or individualist conception of experience had thus proved itself
                    inadequate to the solution of Hume’s difficulty regarding the notion of cause,—a
                    difficulty which Kant, erroneously, had thought to be the only case contemplated
                    by his predecessor. The perception of its inadequacy in this respect, and the
                    consequent generalization of Hume’s problem, are the essential features of the
                    new critical method. For Kant was now prepared to formulate his general inquiry
                    in a definite fashion. His long-continued reflexion on the Wolffian doctrine of
                    knowledge had made clear to him that synthetic connexion, the essence of real
                    cognition, was not contained in the products of thinking as a formal activity of
                    mind operating on material otherwise supplied. On the other hand, Hume s
                    analysis enabled him to see that synthetic connexion was not contained in
                    experience regarded as given material. Thus neither the formal nor the material
                    aspect of conscious experience, when regarded from the individualist point of
                    view, supplied any foundation for real knowledge, whether <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> or empirical. An absolutely new conception of experience was
                    necessary, if the fact of cognition was to be explained at all, and the various
                    modes in which Kant expresses the business of his critical philosophy were
                    merely different fashions of stating the one ultimate problem, differing
                    according to the particular aspect of knowledge which he happened to have in
                    view. To inquire how synthetic <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> judgments are
                    possible, or how far cognition extends, or what worth attaches to metaphysical
                    propositions, is simply to ask, in a specific form, what elements are
                    necessarily involved in experience of which the subject is conscious. How is it
                    possible for the individual thinking subject to connect together the parts of
                    his experience in the mode we call cognition?</p>
                <p>The problem of the critical philosophy is, therefore, the complete analysis of
                    experience from the point of view of the conditions under which such experience
                    is possible for the conscious subject. The central ideas are thus
                    self-consciousness, as the supreme condition under which experience is
                    subjectively possible, and the manifold details of experience as a varied and
                    complex whole. The solution of the problem demanded the utmost care in keeping
                    the due balance between these ideas; and it can hardly be said that Kant was
                    perfectly successful. He is frequently untrue to the more comprehensive
                    conception which dominates his work as a whole. The influence of his previous
                    philosophical training, nay, even the unconscious influence of terminology,
                    frequently induces in his statements a certain laxity and want of clearness. He
                    selects definitely for his starting point neither the idea of self-consciousness
                    nor the details of experience, but in his actual procedure passes from one to
                    the other, rarely, if ever, taking into full consideration the weighty question
                    of their relation to one another. Above all, he is continuously under the
                    influence of the individualist notion which he had done so much to explode. The
                    conception of conscious experience, which is the net result of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kritik,</hi> is indefinitely profounder and richer than that which
                    had ruled the 18th century philosophizing, but for Kant such experience still
                    appears as somehow the arbitrary product of the relation between the individual
                    conscious subject and the realm of real facts. When he is actually analysing the
                    conditions of knowledge, the influence of the individualist conception is not
                    prominent; the conditions are stated as quite general, as conditions of
                    knowledge. But so soon as the deeper, metaphysical problems present themselves,
                    the shadow of the old doctrine reappears. Knowledge is regarded as a mechanical
                    product, part furnished by the subject, part given to the subject, and is thus
                    viewed as mechanically divisible into <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">a posteriori,</hi> into pure and empirical, necessary and
                    contingent. The individual as an agent, conscious of universal moral law, is yet
                    regarded as in a measure opposed to experience, and the Kantian ethical code
                    remains purely formal. The ultimate relation between intelligence and natural
                    fact, expressed in the notion of end, is thought as problematic or contingent.
                    The difficulties or obscurities of the Kantian system, of which the above are
                    merely the more prominent, may all be traced to the one source, the false or at
                    least inadequate idea o( the individual. The more thorough explanation of the
                    relation between experience as critically conceived and the individual subject
                    was the problem left by Kant for his successors.</p>
                <p>In any detailed exposition of the critical system it would be requisite in the
                    first place to state with some fulness the precise nature of the problems
                    immediately before Kant, and in the second place to follow with some closeness
                    the successive stages of the system as presented in the three main works, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Kritik</hi><hi rend="italic">of Pure Reason,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kritik</hi><hi rend="italic">of Practical Reason,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kritik</hi><hi rend="italic">of Judgment,</hi> with the more
                    important of the minor works, the <hi rend="italic">Metaphysic oj Nature</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Metaphysic of Ethics.</hi> It would be necessary,
                    also, in any such expanded treatment, to bring out clearly the Kantian
                    classification of the philosophical sciences, and to indicate the relation
                    between the critical or transcendental investigation of the several faculties
                    and the more developed sciences to which that investigation serves as
                    introduction. As any detailed statement of the critical system, however
                    compressed, would be beyond the limits of the present article, it is proposed
                    here to select only the more salient doctrines, and to point out in connexion
                    with them what advance had been effected by Kant, and what remained for
                    subsequent efforts at complete solution of the problems raised by him. Much that
                    is of interest and value must necessarily be omitted in any sketch of so
                    elaborate a system, and for all points of special interpretation reference must
                    needs be made to the many elaborate dissertations on or about the Kantian
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>The doctrine from which Kant starts in his critical or transcendental
                    investigation of knowledge is that to which the slow development of his thought
                    had led him. The essence of cognition or knowledge was a synthetic act, an act
                    of combining in thought the detached elements of experience. Now synthesis was
                    explicable neither by reference to pure thought, the logical or elaborative
                    faculty, which in Kant’s view remained analytic in function, nor by reference to
                    the effects of external real things upon our faculties of cognition. For, on the
                    one hand, analysis or logical treatment applied only to objects of knowledge as
                    already given in synthetic forms, and, on the other hand, real things could
                    yield only isolated effects and not the combination of these effects in the
                    forms of cognitive experience. If experience is to be matter of knowledge for
                    the conscious subject, it must be regarded as the conjoint product of given
                    material and synthetic combination. Form and matter <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0886-0851"/> may indeed be regarded separably and dealt with
                    in isolation for purposes of critical inquiry, but in experience they are
                    necessarily and inseparably united. The problem of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kritik</hi> thus becomes for Kant the complete statement of the elements
                    necessarily involved in synthesis, and of the subjective processes by which
                    these elements are realized in our individual consciousness. He is not asking,
                    with Locke, whence the details of experience arise; he is not attempting a
                    natural history of the growth of experience in the individual mind; but he is
                    endeavouring to state exhaustively what conditions are necessarily involved in
                    any fact of knowledge, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in any synthetic combination
                    of parts of experience by the conscious subject.</p>
                <p>So far as the elements necessarily involved in conscious experience are
                    concerned, these may be enumerated briefly thus :—given data of sense, inner or
                    outer; the forms of perception, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> space and time; the
                    forms of thought, i.e., the categories; the ultimate condition of knowledge, the
                    identity of the pure ego or self. The ego or self is the central unity in
                    reference to which alone is any part of experience cognizable. But the
                    consciousness of self is the foundation of knowledge only when related to given
                    material. The ego has not in itself the element of difference, and the essence
                    of knowledge is the consciousness of unity in difference. For knowledge,
                    therefore, it is necessary that difference should be <hi rend="italic"
                    >given</hi> to the ego. The modes under which it is possible for such given
                    difference to become portion of the conscious experience of the ego, the modes
                    under which the isolated data can be synthetically combined so as to form a
                    cognizable whole, make up the form of cognition, and upon this form rests the
                    possibility of any <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> or rational knowledge.</p>
                <p>The notion of the ego as a purely logical unity, containing in itself no element
                    of difference, and having only analytic identity, is fundamental in the critical
                    system, and lies at the root of all its difficulties and perplexities. To say
                    that the ego as an individual does not <hi rend="italic">produce</hi> the world
                    of experience is by no means the same as to say that the ego is pure unity
                    without element of difference. In the one case we are treating the ego as one of
                    the objects of experience and denying of it productive efficacy; in the second
                    case we are dealing with the unity of the ego as a condition of knowledge, of
                    any experience whatsoever. In this second sense, it is wholly wrong to assert
                    that the ego is pure identity, pure unity. The unity and identity of the ego, so
                    regarded, are taken in abstraction, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as dissevered
                    from the more complex whole of which they are necessary elements. When the ego
                    is taken as a condition of knowledge, its unity is not more important than the
                    difference necessarily correlated with it. That the ego as a thing should not
                    produce difference is quite beside the mark. The consequences of the abstract
                    separation which Kant so draws between the ego and the.world of experience are
                    apparent throughout his whole system. Assuming at the outset an opposition
                    between the two, self and matter of knowledge, he is driven by the exigencies of
                    the problem of reconciliation to insert term after term as means of bringing
                    them together, but never succeeds in attaining a junction which is more than
                    mechanical. To the end, the ego remains, partly the pure logical ego, partly the
                    concrete individual spirit, and no explanation is afforded of the relation
                    between them. It is for this reason that the system of forms of perception and
                    categories appears so contingent and haphazard. No attempt is made to show how
                    or why the difference supplied for the pure logical ego should present itself
                    necessarily under these forms. They are regarded rather as portions of the
                    subjective mechanism of the individual consciousness. The mind or self appears
                    as though it were endowed with a complex machinery by which alone it could act
                    upon the material supplied to it. Such a crude conception is far, indeed, from
                    doing justice to Kant’s view, but it undoubtedly represents the underlying
                    assumption of many of his cardinal doctrines. The philosophy of Fichte is
                    historically interesting as that in which the deficiencies of Kant’s fundamental
                    position were first discerned and the attempt made to remedy them.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately for the consistency of the <hi rend="italic">Kritik,</hi> Kant does
                    not attempt to work out systematically the elements involved in knowledge before
                    considering the subjective processes by which knowledge is realized in
                    consciousness. He mixes up the two inquiries, and in the general division of his
                    work depends rather upon the results of previous psychology than upon the lines
                    prescribed by his own new conception of experience. He treats the elements of
                    cognition separately in connexion with the several subjective processes involved
                    in knowledge, viz., sense and understanding. Great ambiguity is the natural
                    result of this procedure. For it was not possible for Kant to avoid the
                    misleading connotation of the terms employed by him. In strictness sense,
                    understanding, imagination, and reason ought to have had their functions defined
                    in close relation to the elements of knowledge with which they are severally
                    connected, and as these elements have no existence as separate facts, but only
                    as factors in the complex organic whole, it might have been possible to avoid
                    the error of supposing that each subjective process furnished a distinct,
                    separately cognizable portion of a mechanical whole. But the use of separate
                    terms, such as sense and understanding, ahnost unavoidably led to phraseology
                    only interpretable as signifying that each furnished a specific kind of
                    knowledge, and all Kant’s previous training contributed to strengthen this
                    erroneous view. Especially noteworthy is this in the case of the categories.
                    Kant insists upon treating these as <hi rend="italic">Begriffe,</hi> notions,
                    and assigns to them certain characteristics of notions. But it is readily seen,
                    and in the <hi rend="italic">Logik</hi> Kant shows himself fully aware of the
                    fact, that these pure connective links of experience, general aspects of objects
                    of intelligible experience, do not resemble concepts formed by the so-called
                    logical or elabora’tive processes from representations of completed objects.
                    Nothing but harm can follow from any attempt to identify two products which
                    differ so entirely. So, again, the <hi rend="italic">Aesthetik</hi> is rendered
                    extremely obscure and difficult by the prevalence of the view, already noted as
                    obtaining in the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation,</hi> that sense is a faculty
                    receiving representations of objects. Kant was anxious to avoid the error of
                    Leibnitz, who had taken sense and understanding to differ in degree only, not in
                    kind; but in avoiding the one error he fell into another of no less
                    importance.</p>
                <p>The consideration of the several elements which in combination make up the fact
                    of cognition, or perception, as it may be called, contains little or nothing
                    bearing on the origin and nature of the given data of sense, inner or outer. The
                    manifold-of sense, which plays so important a part in the critical theory of
                    knowledge, is left in an obscure and perplexed position. So much is clear,
                    however, that according to Kant sense is not to be regarded as receptive of
                    representations of objects. The data of sense are mere <hi rend="italic"
                    >stimuli,</hi> not partial or confused representations. The sense-manifold is
                    not to be conceived as having, <hi rend="italic">per se,</hi> any of the
                    qualities of objects as actually cognized; its parts are not cognizable <hi
                    rend="italic">per se,</hi> nor can it with propriety be said to be received
                    successively or simultaneously. When we apply predicates to the sense-manifold
                    regarded in isolation, we make that which is only a factor in the experience of
                    objects into a separate, independent object, and use our predicates
                    transcendently. Kant is not always in his language faithful to his view of the
                    sense-manifold, but the theory as a whole, together with his own express
                    definitions, is unmistakable. On the origin of the data of sense, Kant’s remarks
                    are few and little satisfactory. He very commonly employs the term <hi
                    rend="italic">effection</hi> of the faculty of sense as expressing the mode of
                    origin, but offers no further explanation of a term which has significance only
                    when interpreted after a somewhat mechanical fashion. Unquestionably certain of
                    his remarks indicate the view that the origin is to be sought in
                    things-in-themselves, but against hasty misinterpretations of such remarks there
                    are certain cautions to be borne in mind. The relation between phenomena and
                    noumena in the Kantian system does not in the least resemble that which plays so
                    important a part in modern psychology—between the subjective results of sense
                    affection and the character of the objective conditions of such affection. Kant
                    has pointedly declared that it would be a gross absurdity to suppose that in his
                    view separate, distinct things-in-themselves existed corresponding to the
                    several objects of perception. And, finally, it is not at all difficult to
                    understand why Kant should say that the affection of sense originated in the
                    action of things-in-themselves, when we consider what was the thing-in-itself to
                    which he was referring. The thing-in-itself to which the empirical order and
                    relations of sense-experience are referred is the divine order, which is not
                    matter of knowledge, but involved in our practical or moral beliefs. Critics who
                    limit their view to the <hi rend="italic">Kritik</hi><hi rend="italic">of Pure
                    Beason,</hi> and there, in all probability, to the first or constructive portion
                    of the work, must necessarily fail to interpret the doctrines of the Kantian
                    system, which do not become clear or definite till the system has been
                    developed. Beason was, for Kant, an organic whole; the speculative and moral
                    aspects are never severed; and the solution of problems which appear at first
                    sight to belong solely to the region of speculative thought may be found
                    ultimately to depend upon certain characteristics of our nature as
                    practical.</p>
                <p>Data of sense-affection do not contain in themselves synthetic combination. The
                    first conditions of such combination are found by Kant in the universal forms
                    under which alone sense-phenomena manifest themselves in experience. These
                    universal forms of perception, space and time, are necessary, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a priori,</hi> and in characteristic features resembling intuitions, not
                    notions. They occupy, therefore, a peculiar position, and one section of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kritik,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Aesthetik,</hi> is entirely
                    devoted to the consideration of them. It is important to observe that it is only
                    through the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> character of these perceptive forms
                    that rational science of nature is at all possible. Kant is here able to resume,
                    with fresh insight, his previous discussions regarding the synthetic character
                    of mathematical propositions. In his early essays he had rightly drawn the
                    distinction between mathematical demonstration and philosophic proof, referring
                    the certainty of the first to the fact that the constructions were synthetic in
                    character and entirely determined by the action of constructive imagination. It
                    had not then occurred to him to ask, With what right do we assume that the
                    conclusions arrived at from arbitrary constructions in mathematical matter have
                    applicability to objects of experience? Might not mathematics be a purely
                    imaginary science? To this question he is now enabled to return an <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n887/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0887-0852"/> answer. Space and time, the two essential
                    conditions of senseperception, are not data given by things, but universal forms
                    of intellect into which all data of sense must be received. Hence, whatever is
                    true of space and time regarded by imagination as objects, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> quantitative constructions, must be true of the objects making up
                    our sense-experience. The same forms and the same constructive activity of
                    imagination are involved in mathematical synthesis and in the constitution of
                    objects of sense-experience. The foundation for pure or rational mathematics,
                    there being included under this the pure science of movement, is thus laid in
                    the critical doctrine of space and time.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Aesthetik</hi> isolates sense perception, and considers its
                    forms as though it were an independent, complete faculty. A certain confusion,
                    arising from this, is noticeable in the <hi rend="italic">Analytik</hi> when the
                    necessity for justifying the position of the categories is under discussion, but
                    the real difficulty in which Kant was involved by his doctrine of space and time
                    has its roots even deeper than the erroneous isolation of sensibility. He has
                    not in any way “deduced” space and time, but, proceeding from the ordinary
                    current view of sense-experience, has found these remaining as residuum after
                    analysis. The relation in which they stand to the categories or pure notions is
                    ambiguous; and, when Kant has to consider the fashion in which category and data
                    of sense are to be brought together, he merely places side by side as <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> elements the pure connective notions and the pure
                    forms of perception, and finds it, apparently, only a matter of contingent
                    convenience that they should harmonize with one another and so render cognition
                    possible. To this point also Fichte was the first to call attention.</p>
                <p>Affection of sense, even when received into the pure forms of perception, is not
                    matter of knowledge. For cognition there is requisite synthetic combination, and
                    the intellectual function through which such combination takes place. The forms
                    of intellectual function Kant proceeds to enumerate with the aid of the commonly
                    received logical doctrines. For this reference to logic he has been severely
                    blamed, but the precise nature of the debt due to the commonly accepted logical
                    classification is very generally misconceived. Synthetic combination, Kant
                    points out, is formally expressed in a judgment, which is the act of uniting
                    representations. At the foundation of the judgments which express the types of
                    synthetic combination, through which knowledge is possible, lie the pure general
                    notions, the abstract aspect of the conditions under which objects are
                    cognizable in experience. General logic has also to deal with the union of
                    representations, though its unity is analytic merely, not synthetic. But the
                    same intellectual function which serves to give unity in the analytic judgments
                    of formal logic serves to give unity to the synthetic combinations of real
                    perception. It appeared evident, then, to Kant that in the forms of judgment, as
                    they are stated in the common logic, there must be found the analogues of the
                    types of judgment which are involved in transcendental logic, or in the theory
                    of real cognition. His view of the ordinary logic was wide and comprehensive,
                    though in his restriction of the science to pure form one can trace the
                    influence of his earlier training, and it is no small part of the value of the
                    critical philosophy that it has revived the study of logic and prepared the way
                    for a more thorough consideration of logical doctrines. The position assigned to
                    logic by Kant is not, in all probability, one which can be defended; indeed, it
                    is hard to see how Kant himself, in consistency with the critical doctrine of
                    knowledge, could have retained many of the older logical theorems, but the
                    precision with which the position was stated, and the sharpness with which logic
                    was marked off from cognate philosophic disciplines, prepared the way for the
                    more thoughtful treatment of the whole question.</p>
                <p>Formal logic thus yields to Kant the list of the general notions, pure
                    intellectual predicates, or categories, through which alone experience is
                    possible for a conscious subject. It has already been noted how serious was the
                    error involved in the description of these as notions, without further attempt
                    to clear up their precise significance. Kant, indeed, was mainly influenced by
                    his strong opposition to the Leibnitzian rationalism, and therefore assigns the
                    categories to understanding, the logical faculty, without consideration.of the
                    question,—which might have been suggested by the previous statements of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertation,</hi> —what relation these categories held to the
                    empirical notions formed by comparison, abstraction, and generalization when
                    directed upon representations of objects. But when the categories are described
                    as notions, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> formed products of thought, there rises
                    of necessity the problem which had presented itself to Kant at every stage of
                    his pre-critical thinking,—with what right can we assume that these notions
                    apply to objects of experience? The answer which he proceeds to give altogether
                    explodes the definition of the categories as formed products of thought, and
                    enables us to see more clearly the nature of the new conception of experience
                    which lies in the background of all the critical work.</p>
                <p>The unity of the ego, which has been already noted as an element entering into
                    the synthesis of cognition, is a unity of a quite distinct and peculiar kind.
                    That the ego to which different parts of experience are presented must be the
                    same ego, if there is to be cognition at all, is analytically evident; but the
                    peculiarity is that the ego must be conscious of its owu unity and identity, and
                    this unity of self-consciousness is only possible in relation to difference not
                    contained in the ego but given to it. The unity of apperception, then, as Kant
                    calls it, is only possible in relation to synthetic unity of experience itself,
                    and the forms of this synthetic unity, the categories, are, therefore, on the
                    one hand, necessary as forms in which self-consciousness is realized, and, ou
                    the other hand, restricted in their application and validity to the data of
                    given sense, or the particular element of experience. Thus experience presents
                    itself as the organic combination of the particular of sense with the individual
                    unity of the ego through the universal forms of the categories. Reference of
                    representations to the unity of the object, synthetic unity of apperception, and
                    subsumption of data of sense under the categories, are thus three sides or
                    aspects of the one fundamental fact.</p>
                <p>In this deduction of the categories, as Kant calls it, there appears for the
                    first time an endeavour to connect together into one organic whole the several
                    elements entering into experience. It is evident, however, that much was wanting
                    before this essential task could be regarded as complete. Kant has certainly
                    brought together self-consciousness, the system of the categories and data of
                    sense. He has shown that the conditions of self-consciousness are the conditions
                    of possible experience. But he has not shown, nor did he attempt to show, how it
                    was that the conditions of self-consciousness are the very categories arrived at
                    by consideration of the system of logical judgments. He does endeavour to show,
                    but with small success, how the junction of category and data of sense is
                    brought about, for according to his scheme these stood, to a certain extent at
                    least, apart from and independent of one another. The failure to effect an
                    organic combination of the several elements was the natural consequence of the
                    false start which had been made.</p>
                <p>The mode in which Kant endeavours to show how the several portions of cognition
                    are subjectively realized brings into the clearest light the inconsistencies and
                    imperfections of his doctrine. Sense had been assumed as furnishing the
                    particular of knowledge, understanding as furnishing the universal; and it had
                    been expressly declared that the particular was cognizable only in and through
                    the universal. Still, each was conceived as somehow in itself complete and
                    finished. Sense and understanding had distinct functions, and there was wanting
                    some common term, some intermediary which should bring them into conjunction.
                    Data of sense as purely particular could have nothing in common with the
                    categories as purely universal. But data of sense had at least one universal
                    aspect,—their aspect as the particular of the general forms, space and time.
                    Categories were in themselves abstract and valueless, serviceable only when
                    restricted to possible objects of experience. There was thus a common ground on
                    which category and intuition were united in one, and an intermediate process
                    whereby the universal of the category might be so far individualized as to
                    comprehend the particular of sense. This intermediate process —which is really
                    the junction of understanding and sense—Kant calls productive imagination, and
                    it is only through productive imagination that knowledge or experience is
                    actually realized in our subjective consciousness. The specific forms of
                    productive imagination are called <hi rend="italic">schemata,</hi> and upon the
                    nature of the schema Kant gives much that has proved of extreme value for
                    subsequent thought.</p>
                <p>Productive imagination is thus the concrete element of knowledge, and its general
                    modes are the abstract expression of the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> laws of
                    all possible experience. The categories are restricted in their applicability to
                    the schema, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to the pure forms of conjunction of the
                    manifold in time, and in the modes of combination of schemata and categories we
                    have the foundation for the rational sciences of mathematics and physics.
                    Perception or real cognition is thus conceived as a complex fact, involving data
                    of sense and pure perceptive forms, determined by the category and realized:
                    through productive imagination in the schema. The system of principles which may
                    be deduced from the consideration of the mode in which understanding and sense
                    are united by productive imagination is the positive result of the critical
                    theory of knowledge, and some of its features are remarkable enough to deserve
                    attention. According to his usual plan, Kant arranges these principles in
                    conformity with the table of the categories, dividing the four classes, however,
                    into two main groups, the mathematical and the dynamical. The mathematical
                    principles are the abstract expression of the necessary mode in which data of
                    sense are determined by the category in the form of intuitions or
                    representations of objects; the dynamical are the abstract expression of the
                    modes in which the existence of objects of intuition is determined. The
                    mathematical principles are constitutive, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> express
                    determinations of the objects themselves; the dynamical are regulative, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> express the conditions under which objects can form
                    parts of real experience. Under the mathematical principles come the general
                    rules which furnish the ground for the application of quantitative reasoning
                    to-real facts of experience. For as data of sense are only possible <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n888/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0888-0853"/> objects when received in the forms of space and
                    time, and as space and time are only cognized when determined in definite
                    fashion by the understanding through the schema of number (quantity) or degree
                    (quality), all intuitions are extensive quantities and contain a real element,
                    that of sense, which has degree. Under the dynamical principles, the general
                    modes in which the existence of objects are determined, fall the analogies of
                    experience, or general rules according to which the existence of objects in
                    relation to one another can be determined, and the postulates of experience, the
                    general rules according to which the existence of objects for us or our own
                    subjective existence can be determined. The analogies of experience rest upon
                    the order of perceptions in time, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> their permanence,
                    succession, or coexistence, and the principles are respectively those of
                    substance, causality, and reciprocity. It is to be observed that Kant in the
                    expression of these analogies reaches the final solution of the difficulty which
                    had so long pressed upon him, the difficulty as to the relation of the pure
                    connective notions to experience. These notions are not directly applicable to
                    experience, nor do we find in experience anything corresponding to the pure
                    intellectual notions of substance, cause, and reciprocity. But experience is for
                    us the combination of data of sense in the forms of productive imagination,
                    forms determined by the pure intellectual notions, and accordingly experience is
                    possible for us only as in modes corresponding to the notions. The permanent in
                    time is substance in any possible experience, and no experience is possible save
                    through the determination of all changes as in relation to, a permanent in time.
                    Determined sequence is the causal relation in any possible experience, and no
                    experience is possible save through the determination of perceived changes as in
                    relation to a determined order in time. So with coexistence and reciprocity.</p>
                <p>The postulates of experience are general expressions of the significance of
                    existence in the experience of a conscious subject. The element of reality in
                    such experience must always be given by intuition, and, so far as determination
                    of existence is assumed, external intuition is a necessary condition of inner
                    intuition. The existence of external things is as certain as the existence of
                    the concrete subject, and the subject cannot cognize himself as existing save in
                    relation to the world of facts of external perception. Inner and outer reality
                    are strictly correlative elements in the experience of the conscious
                    subject.</p>
                <p>Throughout the positive portion of his theory of cognition, Kant has been beset
                    by the doctrine that the categories, as finished, complete notions, have an
                    import or significance transcending the bounds of possible experience. Moreover,
                    the manner in which space and time had been treated made it possible for him to
                    regard these as contingent forms, necessary for intelligences like ours, but not
                    to be viewed as absolutely necessary. The real meaning of these peculiarities is
                    hardly ever expressed by him, though it is clear that the solution of the matter
                    is to be found in the inadequacy of the positive theory to meet the demands of
                    reason for completed explanation. But the conclusion to which he was led was one
                    of the greatest importance for the after development of his system. Cognition is
                    necessarily limited. The categories are restricted in their application to
                    elements of possible experience to that which is presented in intuition, and all
                    intuition is for the ego contingent. But to assert that cognition is limited and
                    its matter contingent is to form the idea of an intelligence for whom cognition
                    would not be limited and for whom the data of intuition would not be given,
                    contingent facts, but necessarily produced along with the pure categories. This
                    idea of an intuitive understanding is the definite expression for the completed
                    explanation which reason demands, and it involves the conception of a realm of
                    objects for such an understanding, a realm of objects which, in opposition to
                    the <hi rend="italic">phenomena</hi> of our relative and limited experience, may
                    be called <hi rend="italic">noumena</hi> or things-iu-themselves. The <hi
                    rend="italic">noumenon,</hi> therefore, is in one way the object of a
                    non-sensuous intuition, but more correctly is the expression of the limited and
                    partial character of our knowledge. The idea of a noumenon is thus a limiting
                    notion.</p>
                <p>Assuredly, the difficult section of the <hi rend="italic">Kritik,</hi> on the
                    ground of the distinction between phenomena and noumena, would not have led to
                    so much misconception as it has done, had Kant then brought forward what lies at
                    the root of the distinction, his doctrine of reason and its functions.
                    Understanding, as has been seen, is the faculty of cognition strictly so called;
                    and within its realm, that of space, time, and matter, positive knowledge is
                    attainable. But the ultimate conception of understanding, that of the world of
                    objects, quantitatively determined, and standing in relation of mutual
                    reciprocity to one another, is not a final ground of explanation. We are still
                    able and necessitated to reflect upon the whole world of phenomena as thus
                    cognized, and driven to inquire after its significance. In our reflexion we
                    necessarily treat the objects, not as phenomena, as matters of positive,
                    scientific knowledge, but as things-in-theιnselves, as noumena. The distinction
                    between phenomena and noumena is, therefore, nothing but the expression of the
                    distinction between understanding and reason, a distinction which, according to
                    Kant, is merely subjective.</p>
                <p>The specific function of reason is the effort after completed explanation of the
                    experience presented in cognition. But in such effort there are no notions to be
                    employed other than the categories, and these, as has already been seen, have
                    validity only in reference to objects of possible experience. We may expect,
                    then, to find the transcendent employment of the categories leading into various
                    difficulties and inconsistencies. The criticism of reason in its specific aspect
                    throws fresh light on the limits to human knowledge and the significance of
                    experience.</p>
                <p>Experience has presented itself as the complex result of relation between the ego
                    or subject and the world of phenomena. Reason may therefore attempt a completed
                    explanation either of the ego or of the world of phenomena or of the total
                    relation between them. The three inquiries correspond to the subjects of the
                    three ancient metaphysical sciences, rational psychology, rational cosmology,
                    rational theology. It is readily seen, in regard to the first of them, that all
                    attempts to determine the nature of the ego as a simple, perdurable, immaterial
                    substance rest upon a confusion between the ego as pure logical unity and the
                    ego as object of intuition, and involve a transcendent use of the categories of
                    experience. It profits not to apply such categories to the soul, for no
                    intuition corresponding to them is or can be given. The idea of the soul must be
                    regarded as transcendent. So too when we endeavour, with the help of the
                    categories of quantity, quality, relation, and modality, to determine the nature
                    and relation of parts of the world, we find that reason is landed in a peculiar
                    difficulty. Any solution that can be given is too narrow for the demands of
                    reason and too wide for the restrictions of understanding. The transcendent
                    employment of the categories leads to antinomy, or equally balanced statements
                    of apparently contradictory results. Due attention to the relation between
                    understanding and reason enables us to solve the antinomies and to discover
                    their precise origin and significance. Finally, the endeavour to find in the
                    conception of God, as the supreme reality, the explanation of experience, is
                    seen to lead to no valid conclusion. There is not any intuition given whereby we
                    might show the reality of our idea of a Supreme Being. So far as knowledge is
                    concerned, God remains a transcendental ideal.</p>
                <p>The criticism of the transcendental ideas, which is also the examination of the
                    claims of metaphysic to rank as a science, yields a definite and intelligible
                    result. These ideas, the expression of the various modes in wlιich unity of
                    reason may be sought, have no objects corresponding to them in the sphere of
                    cognition. They have not, therefore, like the categories, any <hi rend="italic"
                    >constitutive</hi> value, and all attempts at metaphysical construction with the
                    notions or categories of science must be resigned as of necessity hopeless. But
                    the ideas are not, on that account, destitute of all value. They are supremely
                    significant, as indicating the very essence of the function of reason. The
                    limits of scientific cognition become intelligible, only when the sphere of
                    understanding is subjected to critical reflexion and compared with the possible
                    sphere of reason, that is, the sphere of rationally complete cognition. The
                    ideas, therefore, in relation to knowledge strictly so called, have <hi
                    rend="italic">regulative</hi> value, for they furnish the general precepts for
                    extension and completion of knowledge, and, at the same time, since they spring
                    from reason itself, they have a real value in relation to reason as the very
                    inmost nature of intelligence. Self-consciousness cannot be regarded as merely a
                    mechanically determined result. Free reflexion upon the whole system of
                    knowledge is sufficient to indicate that the sphere of intuition, with its
                    rational principles, does not exhaust conscious experience. There still remains,
                    over and above the realm of nature, the realm of free, self-conscious spirit;
                    and, within this sphere, it may be anticipated that the ideas will acquire a
                    significance richer and deeper than the merely regulative import which they
                    possess in reference to cognition.</p>
                <p>Where, then, are we to look for this realm of free self-consciousness? Not in the
                    sphere of cognition, where objects are mechanically determined, but in that of
                    will or of reason as practical. That reason is practical or prescribes ends for
                    itself is sufficiently manifest from the mere fact of the existence of the
                    conception of morality or duty, a conception which can have no corresponding
                    object within the sphere of intuition, and which is theoretically, or in
                    accordance with the categories of understanding, incognizable. The presence of
                    this conception is the datum upon which may be founded ⅞ special investigation
                    of the conditions of reason as practical, a <hi rend="italic">Kritik</hi> of
                    pure practical reason, and the analysis of it yields the statement of the formal
                    prescripts of morality.</p>
                <p>The realization of duty is impossible for any being which is not thought as free,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> capable of self-determination. Freedom, it is true,
                    is theoretically not an object of cognition, but its impossibility is not
                    thereby demonstrated. The theoretical proof rather serves as useful aid towards
                    the more exact determination of the nature and province of self-determination,
                    and of its relation to the whole concrete nature of humanity. For in man
                    self-determination and mechanical determination by empirical motives coexist,
                    and only in so far as he belongs and is conscious of belonging both to the
                    sphere of sense and to the sphere of reason does moral obligation become
                    possible for him. The supreme end prescribed by reason in its practical aspect,
                    namely, the complete subordination of the empirical <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n889/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0889-0854"/> side of nature to the prescripts of morality,
                    demands, as conditions of its possible realization, the permanence of ethical
                    progress in the moral agent, the certainty of freedom in self-determination, and
                    the necessary harmonizing of the spheres of sense and reason through the
                    intelligent author or ground of both. These conditions, the postulates of
                    practical reason, are the concrete expressions of the three transcendental
                    ideas, and in them we have the full significance of the ideas for reason.
                    Immortality of the soul, positive freedom of will, and the existence of an
                    intelligent ground of things are speculative ideas practically warranted, though
                    theoretically neither demonstrable nor comprehensible.</p>
                <p>Thus reason as self determining supplies notions of freedom; reason as determined
                    supplies categories of understanding. Union between the two spheres, which seem
                    at first sight disparate, is found in the necessary postulate that reason shall
                    be realized, for its realization is only possible in the sphere of sense. But
                    such a union, when regarded <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >abstracto,</hi> rests upon, or involves, a notion of quite a new order, that of
                    the adaptation of nature to reason, or, as it may be expressed, that of end in
                    nature. Understanding and reason thus coalesce in the faculty of <hi
                    rend="italic">judgment,</hi> which mediates between, or brings together, the
                    universal and particular elements in conscious experience. Judgment is here
                    merely <hi rend="italic">reflective</hi>; that is to say, the particular element
                    is given, so determined as to be possible material of knowledge, while the
                    universal, not necessary for cognition, is supplied by reason itself. The
                    empirical details of nature, which are not determined by the categories of
                    understanding, are judged as being arranged or ordered by intelligence, for in
                    no other fashion could nature, in its particular, contingent aspect, be thought
                    as forming a complete, consistent, intelligible whole.</p>
                <p>The investigation of the conditions under which adaptation of nature to
                    intelligence is conceivable and possible makes up the subject of the third great
                    <hi rend="italic">Kritik,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Kritik</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of Judgment,</hi> a work presenting unusual difficulties to the
                    interpreter of the Kantian system. The general principle of the adaptation of
                    nature to our faculties of cognition has two specific applications, with the
                    second of which it is more closely connected than with the first. In the first
                    place, the adaptation may be merely <hi rend="italic">subjective,</hi> when the
                    empirical condition for the exercise of judgment is furnished by the feeling of
                    pleasure or pain; such adaptation is aesthetic. In the second place, the
                    adaptation may be objective or logical, when empirical facts are given of such
                    akind that their possibility can be conceived only through the notion of the end
                    realized in them; such adaptation is teleological, and the empirical facts in
                    question are organisms.</p>
                <p>Aesthetics, or the scientific consideration of the judgments resting on the
                    feelings of pleasure and pain arising from the harmony or want of harmony
                    between the particular of experience and the laws of understanding, is the
                    special subject of the <hi rend="italic">Kritik</hi><hi rend="italic">of
                    Judgment,</hi> but the doctrine of teleology there unfolded is the more
                    important for the complete view of the critical system. For the analysis of the
                    teleological judgment and of the consequences flowing from it leads to the final
                    statement of the nature of experience as conceived by Kant. The phenomena of
                    organic production furnish data for a special kind of judgment, which, however,
                    involves or rests upon a quite general principle, that of the contingency of the
                    particular element in nature and its subjectively necessary adaptation to our
                    faculty of cognition. The notion of contingency arises, according to Kant, from
                    the fact that understanding and sense are distinct, that understanding does not
                    determine the particular of sense, ami, consequently, that the principle of the
                    adaptation of the particular to our understanding is merely supplied by reason
                    on account of the peculiarity or limited character of understanding. End in
                    nature, therefore, is a subjective or problematic conception, implying the
                    limits of understanding, and consequently resting upon the idea of an
                    understanding constituted unlike ours,—of an intuitive understanding in which
                    particular and universal should be given together. The idea of such an
                    understanding is, for cognition, transcendent, for no corresponding fact of
                    intuition is furnished, but it is realized with practical certainty in relation
                    to reason as practical. For we are, from practical grounds, compelled with at
                    least practical necessity to ascribe a certain aim or end to this supreme
                    understanding. The moral law, or reason as practical, prescribes the realization
                    of the highest good, and such realization implies a higher order than that of
                    nature. We must, therefore, regard the supreme cause as a moral cause, and
                    nature as so ordered that realization of the moral end is in it possible. The
                    final conception of the Kantian philosophy is, therefore, that of ethical
                    teleology. As Kant expresses it in a remarkable passage of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kritik,</hi> “The systematic unity of ends in this world of intelligences,
                    which, although as mere nature it is to be called only the world of sense, can
                    yet as a system of freedom be called an intelligible, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> moral world <hi rend="italic">(regnum gratiae),</hi> leads
                    inevitably to the teleogical unity of all things which constitute this great
                    whole according to universal natural laws, just as the unity of the former is
                    according to universal and necessary moral laws, and unites the practical with
                    the speculative reason. The world must be represented as having originated from
                    an idea, if it is to harmonize with that use of reason without which we should
                    hold ourselves unworthy of reason—viz., the moral use, which rests entirely on
                    the idea of the supreme good. Hence all natural research tends towards the form
                    of a system of ends, and in its highest development would be a physico-theology.
                    But this, since it arises from the moral order as a unity grounded in the very
                    essence of freedom and not accidentally instituted by external commands,
                    establishes the teleology of nature on grounds which <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> must be inseparably connected with the inner possibility of things.
                    The teleology of nature is thus made to rest on a transcendental theology, which
                    takes the ideal of supreme ontological perfection as a principle of systematic
                    unity, a principle which connects all things according to universal and
                    necessary natural laws, since they all have their origin in the absolute
                    necessity of a single primal being” (p. 538).</p>
