                    received at the British Museum, of which, in the following September, he
                    published a figure <hi rend="italic">(Ceη. Birds,</hi> part xvii.), naming it

                    late Mr Strange <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1847, p. 50); while
                    in the same year Jules Verreaux sent an example, with an account of its habits,
                    to the museum of Paris, which was published by Dr Pucheran <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Rev. Zooloyique,</hi> 1847, p. 385). Various observers, among whom must be
                    especially named Drs Lyall <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1852, p.
                    31) and Haast <hi rend="italic">(Verh. zool.-bot. Gesellsch. Wien,</hi> 1863, p.
                    1115) supplied other particulars, and many specimens have now been received in
                    Europe, so that it is represented in most museums, and at least half a dozen
                    examples have reached England alive. Yet, though much has been written about it,
                    there is no detailed description of its internal structure, which fact is the
                    more to be regretted since the bird is obviously doomed to early extinction, and
                    the opportunity of solving several zoological problems of great interest, which
                    a minute examination of its anatomy might afford, will be lost if some one does
                    not speedily take the matter in hand. Few existing birds offer a better subject
                    for a monographer, and it is to be hoped that, if perish the genus and species
                    must, posterity will not have to lament the want of an exhaustive treatise on
                    its many and wonderful characteristics.</p>

                    instances it seems to make for itself) under the roots of trees or rocks during
                    the daytime, and only issuing forth about sunset to seek its food, which is
                    solely vegetable in kind, and consists of the twigs, leaves, seeds, and fruits
                    of trees, grass, and fern-roots— some observers say mosses also. It sometimes
                    climbs trees, but generally remains on the ground, only using its comparatively
                    short wings to balance itself in running, or to break its fall when it drops
                    from a tree—though not always then—being apparently quite incapable of real
                    flight. It thus becomes an easy prey to the marauding creatures—cats, rats, and
                    so forth—which European colonists have let loose in New Zealand, so disastrously
                    for its indigenous inhabitants. Sir G. Grey says it had been, within the memory
                    of old people, abundant in every part of that country, but (writing in 1854) was
                    then found only in the unsettled districts. But as the latter are continually
                    suffering from encroachment, so are the haunts of the Kakapo, and it is <pb

                    us, there are localities which, though unsettled, it does not seem to inhabit,
                    and thus little hope can be entertained of its surviving much longer.</p>
                <p>The Kakapo is about the size of a Raven, of a green or brownish-green colour,
                    thickly freckled and irregularly barred with dark brown, and dashed here and

                    most striking feature of the bird is its head, armed with a powerful beak, that
                    it well knows how to use, and its face clothed with hairs and elongated feathers
                    that sufficiently resemble the physiognomy of an Owl to justify the generic name
                    bestowed upon it. Of its internal structure little has been described, and that
                    not always correctly. Its furcula has been said <hi rend="italic">{Proc. Zool.
                    Society,</hi> 1874, p. 594) to be “lost,” whereas the clavicles, which in most
                    birds unite to form that bone, are present, though they do not meet, while in

                    be regarded but in connexion with the incapacity of the bird for flight, and may
                    very likely be, as some have supposed, the result of disuse. There can be
                    scarcely any doubt as to the propriety of considering this genus the type of a
                    separate Family of <hi rend="italic">Psittaci</hi>; but whether it stands alone,

                    captivity the Kakapo is said to shew much intelligence, as well as an
                    affectionate and playful disposition, soon attaching itself to its master and
                    taking pleasure in caressing him and being caressed in turn. Unfortunately it
                    does not seem to share the longevity characteristic of most Parrots, and none
                    that have been held in confinement appear to have long survived, while many
                    succumb speedily. For further details the reader may be referred to Gould’s <hi
