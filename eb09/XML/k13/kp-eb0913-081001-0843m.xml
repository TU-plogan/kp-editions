                    back of the tongue to the back of the palate; it is surd, corresponding to G,
                    which is sonant; and it has this value and no other in all modern alphabets in
                    which .it is found. In many alphabets, however, it is supplanted wholly or to a
                    great extent by the symbol C. The reason of this has been already explained
                    under the letters C and G. The substitution of Ç for K took place in Italy,—the
                    original character surviving only in a few well-understood abbreviations; and in
                    consequence of this those alphabets which have been derived from Italy naturally
                    have the C; while those derived directly from the Greek, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the Gothic, which came through Ulfilas, and the different alphabets
                    which trace back to Cyril (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Alphabet),</hi> have only
                    the K. In German we find K, with the exception of some words borrowed from other
                    languages, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Cabinet, Cardinal, Caprice, &amp;c.; but
                    even foreign words when thoroughly naturalized take the German spelling, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Karte, Kammer, Onkel, &amp;c. In French, on the other
                    hand, K is found only in a few foreign words, and even these are merely names of
                    men or countries. In England the large admixture of French words in the Teutonic
                    language has produced some irregularity in spelling; but the K is not found· (as
                    might have been expected) in the Teutonic words, because the Roman alphabet was
                    introduced by missionaries into England, and therefore the oldest English (or
                    Anglo-Saxon) writings regularly have C and not K. The letter was introduced
                    probably first in words borrowed from the German (thus in Alfred’s version of
                    Gregory’s <hi rend="italic">Pastoral</hi> we find “kycglum” (p. 297,1. 1, ed.
                    Sweet), the dative of the German “Kugel ”), or through German influence, as for
                    example in the <hi rend="italic">Blickling Homilies</hi> of the 10th century, we
                    find “kyning” (p. 163, 1. 23, ed. Morris) beside the much more common “cyning.”
                    It would have been very convenient both in English and in other languages of
                    modern Europe if K could have been kept as the sole symbol for the pure sound
                    and C as the symbol for a common corruption of it, now to be described.</p>
                <p>This corruption is due to palatization; the middle instead of the back of the
                    tongue is raised against the palate, and the result is the difference of sound
                    between, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> “kirk” and “church.” This corruption was
                    common in Sanskrit, and a special symbol was assigned to the sound. It is found
                    in late Latin, especially before an <hi rend="italic">i;</hi> and so it passed
                    into Italian, where <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is regularly sounded as our <hi
                    rend="italic">ch</hi> before <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi>; in the words where the sound remained unchanged the symbol <hi
                    rend="italic">ch</hi> is employed to represent it, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    in “che.” In French the change was much greater; here <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    passed into the sA-sound (denoted by <hi rend="italic">chi)</hi> before <hi
                    rend="italic">a, e.g.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> in “chambre” from
                    “camera,” “chaud” from “calidus”; observe that the symbol <hi rend="italic"
                    >ch</hi> has just the opposite value to the Italian one; while before <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> the sound underwent a still
                    greater change; it sank into the simple sibilant s, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    “civitas”—pronounced in Latin “kivitas”—became “cité,” whence our own sound;
                    “certus” became “certein.” In English, palatization has been very extensive;
                    thus Old English “cese” (sounded like German “käse”) became “cheese,” “cild”
                    became “child,” &amp;c.; here dialectic variation may often be seen, e.^., in
                    AlnwicA but NorwicA, Caistor but Chester.</p>
                <p>Another still greater change of K has been called “labialization”: this is the
                    passage of the A·-sound through an intermediate <hi rend="italic">kw</hi> into
                    <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> This was common in Greek, where, <hi rend="italic"
                    >eg.,</hi> we find <hi rend="italic">lτropαι, τρεπω,</hi> of which the root form
                    as shown by other languages was <hi rend="smallcaps">sak, tark</hi>; in Latin we
                    have the transitional forms “sequ-or,” “torqu-eo”; in the Italian dialects the
                    change was complete, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Oscan “pid” corresponded to
                    Latin “quid,”and Umbrian “pumpe” to “quomque.” This change arose from a slight
                    rounding of the lips while the speech-organs were in the position for A·-sound;
                    this produced a more or less distinct <hi rend="italic">kw</hi> according to the
                    amount of the rounding, passing finally intop, when the rounding amounted to
                    absolute closing of the lips. For the intermediate sound the Latin employed the
                    symbol Q, which is a slightly turned form of the original? (Koppa) taken by the
                    Greeks from the Phoenician, but not required by them, and therefore suffered to
                    fall out except in numeration; the Latin took it on, and, if it had consistently
                    employed it alone to denote the slightly labialized <hi rend="italic">k,</hi>
                    the result would have been good; but it regularly added w to it (QU), so that
                    the Q might as well have been written K. The superfluous letter passed on to the
                    French and English languages.</p>
                <p>There is reason for believing that this labializing tendency is very old,—as old
                    indeed as the Indo-European language itself. It is probable that that language
                    had both the <hi rend="italic">k</hi> pure and another with a slight <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> sound following it. This appears from the fact (first
                    thoroughly ascertained by Fick) that in one set of cognate words which had an
                    original <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> we find <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> in
                    Sanskrit, κ or τr in Greek, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >qu</hi> in Latin, <hi rend="italic">k</hi> in Lithuanian and Sclavonic; in
                    another set we find p in Sanskrit, <hi rend="italic">sz</hi> (which is our
                    sA-sound) in Lithuanian, s in Slavonic, but only <hi rend="italic">k</hi> in
                    Greek and c in Latin; that is, in one set we see the phenomenon of labialism, in
                    the other assibilation but no touch of labialism; from which we infer that the
                    assibilated <hi rend="italic">k</hi> in the derived languages traces back to <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> pure, the labialized <hi rend="italic">k</hi> to a sound
                    which in the original language was at least slightly modified from <hi
                    rend="italic">k.</hi> An instance of the assibilation may be seen in the
                    correspondence of Sanskrit “çatam,” Lithuanian “szimtas,” to Latin “centum,”
                    Greek <hi rend="italic">εκατόν</hi>; neither in Greece nor in Italy is there any
                    labialized form of this word.</p>
