                    (1651-1716), traveller and physician, was born September 16, 1651, at Lemgo in
                    Lippe-Detmold, Westphalia, where his father was a pastor. He studied at Hameln,
                    Lüneburg, Hamburg, and Lübeck, and, after graduating as doctor of philosophy at
                    Cracow, he spent four years at Königsberg in Prussia, in the study of medicine
                    and the natural sciences. In 1681 he visited Upsala in Sweden, where he was
                    offered inducements to settle; but his desire for foreign travel led him eagerly
                    to accept the post of secretary to the embassy which Charles XI. sent through
                    Russia to Persia in 1683. When after a stay of two years the Swedish embassy
                    prepared to return from Ispahan, Kaempfer entered the service of the Dutch East
                    India Company, as chief surgeon of the fleet then in the Persian Gulf. A
                    malignant fever which seized him at Gamron on the Gulf prevented his further
                    travels for a long while; and he did not arrive at Batavia till September 1689.
                    The following winter was spent by Kaempfer in studying the natural history of
                    Java; and in May 1690 he set out for Japan as physician to the embassy sent
                    yearly to that country by the Dutch. The ship in which he sailed touched at
                    Siam, and in September arrived at Nagasaki, the only Japanese port then open to
                    foreigners. Kaempfer stayed two years in Japan, during which he twice visited
                    Yedo (now Tokio), the capital of the shogun. His adroitness, insinuating
                    manners, and medical skill overcame the habitual jealousy and reticence of the
                    natives, and enabled him to elicit much valuable information, which he has
                    embodied in his <hi rend="italic">History of Japan.</hi> In November 1692
                    Kaempfer left Japan, and in October 1693 he landed at Amsterdam. Receiving the
                    degree of doctor of medicine at Leyden, he settled down in his native city to
                    edit and publish his travels and scientific papers at his leisure; but his
                    appointment as physician to the count of Lippe involved him in the cares of an
                    extensive medical practice that hindered his literary labours. His health,
                    already impaired by his travels, gave way under various domestic troubles; and
                    he died at Lemgo, November 2, 1716, in his sixtysixth year.</p>
                <p>The only work Kaempfer lived to publish was <hi rend="italic">Amoenitatum</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Exoticarum Politi∙co-ρhysico-medicarum Fasciculi V.</hi>
                    (Lemgo, 1712), a selection from his papers giving most interesting results of
                    his observations in Georgia, Persia, and Japan. At his death his unpublished
                    manuscripts were purchased by Sir Hans Sloane) and conveyed to England. Among
                    them was a <hi rend="italic">History of Japan,</hi> which was translated from
                    the manuscript into English by J. G. Scheuchzer and published at London, in 2
                    vols., in 1728. The original German lias never been published, the extant German
                    version being taken from the English. The interest and value of the work are
                    very great. It not only contains a history, strictly so called, but also a
                    description of the political, social, and physical state of the country in the
                    17th century. For upwards of a.hundred years it remained the chief, if not
                    almost the only available source of information about Japan for the general
                    reader, and is still not wholly obsolete. A life of the author is prefixed to
                    the <hi rend="italic">History.</hi></p>
