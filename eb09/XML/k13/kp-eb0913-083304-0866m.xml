                    district.</p>
                <p>The general physical characteristics of Kámrúp are those common to the whole
                    valley of Assam. In the immediate neighbourhood of the Brahmaputra the land is
                    low, and exposed to annual inundation. In this marshy tract reeds <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n867/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0867-0834"/> and canes flourish luxuriantly, and the only
                    cultivation is that of rice. At a comparatively short distance from the river
                    banks, the ground begins to rise in undulating knolls towards the mountains of
                    Bhutân on the north, and towards the Khâsi territory on the south. The hills
                    south of the Brahmaputra in some parts reach the height of 800 feet. It is on
                    the slopes of these hills, amid the primeval jungle, that European planters have
                    set out their trim tea-gardens. The general scenery of Kâmrùp is thus agreeably
                    diversified; and the villages are described as very picturesque. The
                    Brahmaputra, which divides the district into two nearly equal portions, is
                    navigable by river steamers and large cargo boats throughout the year, and
                    receives several tributaries navigable by large native boats in the rainy
                    season. The chief of these are the Manâs, Châul Khoyâ, and Barnadi on the north,
                    and the Kulsi and Dibru on the south bank. Forests cover about 130 square miles
                    of the district, of which 49 square miles have been reserved by the forest
                    department. There is also a plantation reserve, where seedlings of teak, <hi

                    >sissu, sum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nahor</hi> are reared, and experiments
                    are being made with the caoutchouc tree.</p>
                <p>The census of 1871 returned a population of 561,781 (292,688 males and 268,993
                    females), spread over an area of 3631 square miles. Hindus numbered 514,024;
                    Mahometans, 45,823; Buddhists, 182; Christians, 204, of whom 120 are natives;
                    and “others,” 448. Kamrup is the headquarters of a sect of Vishnuvites, known as
                    Mahâpurushias, who are described as extremely bigoted. The Mahometans are
                    supposed to be the descendants of the early invaders. The native Christian
                    community is under the charge of the American Baptist Mission, which has a
                    station at Gauhati town. The population is entirely rural, the only town with
                    upwards of 5000 inhabitants being Gauhâti, with 11,492. The temples of Hajo and
                    Kamakhya attract many pilgrims from all quarters.</p>
                <p>The staple crop of the district is rice, of which there are three crops. The
                    state is the landlord, and the land settlement is made directly with the
                    cultivators. The condition of the cultivators is high, and it is found difficult
                    to obtain labourers for ordinary work. The indigenous manufactures are confined
                    to the weaving of silk and cotton cloths for home use, and to the making of
                    brass cups and plates. The cultivation and manufacture of tea are conducted
                    almost solely by European capital. In 1874 there were twenty-four plantations,
                    with 2638 acres under tea, the out-turn being 375,634 lb. The chief exports are
                    rice, oilseeds, timber, and cotton; the imports are fine rice, salt, piece
                    goods, sugar, betel nuts, cocoa nuts, and hardware. Education in 1872 was
                    afforded by 146 schools, attended by 3969 pupils, including a high school and
                    college in Gunhati town. The mean temperature is 76°, and the average annual
                    rainfall 70 ’ 12 inches.</p>
