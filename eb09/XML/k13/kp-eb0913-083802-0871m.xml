                <p><label type="entry">KANGAROO</label>. When Captain Cook, during his first
                    memorable voyage of discovery, was detained, for the purpose of refitting his
                    ship at Endeavour river, on the north-east coast of Australia, a strange-looking
                    animal, entirely unknown to them, was frequently seen by the ship’s company; and
                    it is recorded in the annals of the voyage that, on the 14th of July 1770, “Mr
                    Gore, who went out this day with his gun, had the good fortune to kill one of
                    the animals which had been so much the subject of our speculation, . . . and
                    which is called by the natives kanguroo,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hawkesworth, <hi rend="italic">Collection of Voyages,</hi>
                    vol. iii. p. 577 (1773).</p></note> a name which, though it does not appear to
                    be now known to any of the aboriginal tribes of the country, has been adopted
                    for this animal in all European languages, with only slight modifications of
                    spelling. With the exception of a passing glimpse in the beginning of the same
                    century by the Dutch traveller Bruyn of some living examples of an allied
                    species, to be referred to presently, this was the first introduction to the
                    civilized world of any member of a group of animals now so familiar. The
                    affinities of the species, skins of which were brought home by Captain Cook and
                    subsequent voyagers, were recognized by Schreber as nearer to the American
                    opossums (then the only known marsupials) than to any other mammals with which
                    zoologists were acquainted, and consequently it was placed by him, in his great
                    work on the Mammalia, then in the course of publication, in the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Didelphis,</hi> with <hi rend="italic">qiqantea</hi> for a
                    specific designation,—the latter having been bestowed upon it by Zimmerman under
                    the impression that it was a huge species of jerboa. Soon afterwards (1791) Dr
                    Shaw very properly formed a new genus for its reception, which he named <hi
                    rend="italic">Macropus,</hi> in allusion to the peculiar length of its hind
                    foot. By the name thus formed, <hi rend="italic">Macropus giganteus,</hi> this
                    kind of kangaroo has ever since been known in zoological literature.</p>
                <p>Further explorations in Australia and the neighbouring islands have led to the
                    discovery of a very considerable number of species, which are now included in
                    the family <hi rend="italic">Macropodidae,</hi> one of the subdivisions of the
                    order <hi rend="italic">Marsupialia, ioτ</hi> the characters of which see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Macropodidae,</hi> or kangaroos, taken as a whole, form a
                    very well marked family, easily distinguished from the remaining members of the
                    order by their general conformation, and by peculiarities in the structure of
                    their limbs, teeth, and other organs. They vary in size from that of a sheep
                    down to a small rabbit. The head, especially in the larger species, is small,
                    compared with the rest of the body, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n872/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0872-0839"/> and tapers forward to the muzzle. The shoulders
                    and fore limbs are feebly developed, and the hind limbs of disproportionate
                    strength and magnitude, which gives them a peculiarly awkward appearance when
                    moving about on all fours, as they occasionally do when feeding. Rapid
                    progression is, however, performed only by the powerful hind limbs, the animal
                    covering the ground by a series of immense bounds, during which the fore part of
                    the body is inclined forwards, and balanced by the long, strong, and tapering
                    tail, which is carried horizontally backwards. When not moving they often assume
                    a perfectly upright position, the tail aiding the two hind legs to form a sort
                    of supporting tripod, and the front limbs dangling by the side of the chest.
                    This position gives full scope for the senses of sight, hearing, and smell to
                    warn of the approach of enemies, from which they save themselves by their
                    bounding flight. The fore paws have five distinct digits, each armed with a
                    strong, curved claw. The foot of the hind limb is quite different, and very
                    peculiar in construction, being extremely long and narrow, and (with only one,
                    lately discovered, exception) without any hallux or great toe. It consists
                    mainly of one very large and strong toe, corresponding to the fourth of the
                    human or other typically developed foot, ending in a strong curved and pointed
                    claw. Close to the outer side of this lies a smaller fifth digit, and to the
                    inner side two excessively slender toes (the second and third), bound together
                    almost to the extremity in a common integument. The two little claws of these
                    toes, projecting together from the skin, may be of use in scratching and
                    cleaning the fur of the animal, but the toes must have quite lost all connexion
                    with the functions of support or progression.</p>
                <p>The dental formula, when completely developed, is <hi rend="italic">incisors ⅜,
                    canines ⅜, premolars -</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">, molars
                    ⅛</hi> on each side, giving a total of thirty-four teeth. The three incisors of
                    the upper jaw are arranged in a continuous arched series, and have crowns with
                    broad cutting edges; the first or middle incisor is often larger than the
                    others. Corresponding to these in the lower jaw is but one tooth on each side,
                    but it is of great size, procumbent or directed horizontally forwards, narrow,
                    lanceolate, pointed, and with sharp edges. Owing to the laxity of the union of
                    the two rami of the lower jaw at the symphysis, in many species the two lower
                    incisors can be made to work together like the blades of a pair of scissors, a
                    very remarkable arrangement not known to occur in other mammals. The canines are
                    absent or rudimentary, always so in the lower jaw, and often deciduous at an
                    early age in the upper jaw. The premolars are compressed, with cutting
                    longitudinal edges, the anterior one is always deciduous, being lost about the
                    time the second one replaces the milk molar, so that both premolars are never
                    found iu place and use in the same individual. The true molars have quadrate
                    crowns, provided with two strong transverse ridges, or with four obtuse cusps.
                    In <hi rend="italic">Macropus giganteus</hi> and its immediate allies, both
                    premolars and one or two of the anterior true molars are shed during the
                    lifetime of the animal, so that in old examples only the two posterior molars
                    and the incisors are found in place. The milk dentition, as in other marsupials,
                    is confined to a single molar tooth on each side of each jaw, the other molars
                    and incisors being never changed. The dentition of the kangaroos, functionally
                    considered, thus consists of sharp-edged incisors, most fully developed near the
                    median line of the mouth, for the purpose of cropping the various kinds of
                    herbage on which they feed, and ridged and tuberculated molars for crushing it,
                    there being no tusks or canines for offensive or defensive purposes.</p>
                <p>The number of vertebrae is—in the cervical region 7, dorsal 13, lumbar 6, sacral
                    2, caudal varying according to the length of the tail, but generally from 21 to
                    25. In the fore limb the clavicle and the radius and ulna are well developed,
                    allowing of considerable freedom of motion of the hand. The pelvis has large
                    epipubic or “marsupial” bones. The femur is short, and the tibia and fibula of
                    great length, as is the foot, the whole of which is applied to the ground when
                    the animal is at rest in the upright position.</p>
                <p>The stomach is of large size, and very complex, its walls being puckered up by
                    longitudinal muscular bands into a great number of sacculi, like those of the
                    human colon. The alimentary canal is long, and the caecum well developed. All
                    the species have a marsupium or pouch formed by a fold of the skin of the
                    abdomen, covering the mammary glands with their four nipples. In this pouch the
                    young (which, as in other marsupials, leave the uterus in an extremely small and
                    imperfect condition) are placed as soon as they are born; there their growth and
                    development proceeds; and to it they resort temporarily for the purpose of
                    shelter, concealment, or transport, for some time after they are able to run and
                    jump about the ground and feed upon the same herbage which forms the nourishment
                    of the parent. During the early period of their sojourn in the pouch, the blind,
                    naked, helpless young creatures (which in the great kangaroo scarcely exceed an
                    inch in length) are attached by their mouths to the nipple of the mother, and
                    are fed by milk injected into their stomach by the contraction of the muscle
                    covering the mammary gland. In this stage of their existence the respiratory
                    organs are modified much as they are permanently in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> the elongated upper part of the larynx projecting into the
                    posterior nares, and so maintaining a free communication between the lungs and
                    the external surface, independently of the mouth and gullet, thus averting all
                    danger of suffocation while the milk is passing down the latter passage.</p>
                <p>The kangaroos are all vegetable feeders, browsing on grass and various kinds of
                    herbage, the smaller species also eating roots. They are naturally timid,
                    inoffensive creatures, but the larger ones when hard pressed will turn <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0873-0840"/> and defend themselves, sometimes killing a dog by
                    grasping it in their fore paws, and inflicting terrible wounds with the sharp
                    claws of their powerful hind legs, sustaining themselves meanwhile upon the
                    tail. The great majority are inhabitants of Australia and Tasmania, forming one
                    of the most prominent and characteristic features of the fauna of these lands,
                    and in the scenery of the country, as well as the economy of nature, performing
                    the part of the deer and antelopes of other parts of the world, which are
                    entirely wanting in Australia. They were very important sources of food-supply
                    to the natives, and are hunted by the colonists, both for sport and with a view
                    to their destruction, on account of the damage they naturally do in consuming
                    the grass, now required for feeding cattle and sheep. Notwithstanding this, they
                    have in some districts increased in numbers, owing to the suppression of their
                    former enemies, the aborigines and the dingo or native dog. A few species are
                    found in New Guinea and the adjacent islands, which belong, in the zoological
                    sense, to the Australian province, beyond the bounds of which none have been
                    found either existing or in a fossil state.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Macropodidae</hi> are divided into two well-marked
                    sections—(1) the true kangaroos <hi rend="italic">{Macroρodimse),</hi> and (2) a
                    group consisting of smaller animals, commonly called rat-kangaroos, or
                    (improperly) “kangaroo-rats,” or sometimes potoroos.</p>
                <p>I. In the <hi rend="italic">Macropodinae</hi> (see fig. 3) the cutting edges of
                    the upper incisors are nearly level, or the first pair but slightly longer than
                    the others. The canines are rudimentary and often wanting. The premolars are
                    usually not longer (from before backwards) than the true molars, and less
                    compressed than in the next section. The crowns of the molars have always two
                    prominent transverse ridges. The fore limbs are small with subequal toes, armed
                    with strong, moderately long, curved claws. Hind limbs very long and strongly
                    made. Head small, with more or less elongated muzzle. Ears generally rather long
                    and ovate.</p>
                <p>Upwards of thirty species of this group have been described, and many attempts
                    have been made to subdivide it into smaller groups or genera for the convenience
                    of arrangement and description, but these have generally been based upon such
                    trivial characters that it is preferable to speak of most of them as sections of
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Macropus,</hi> reserving generic rank only to two
                    forms somewhat aberrant both in structure and geographical distribution.
                    According to this arrangement the genera will be as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Macropus,</hi> Shaw, divided into the following sections or
                    subgenera. A. <hi rend="italic">Macropus</hi> proper, of which the type is <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. giganteus,</hi> spoken of at the beginning of this article as
                    having been discovered in 1770 by the first English explorers of Australia. It
                    is the common great kangaroo, called “boomer,” “forrester,” or “old man” by the
                    colonists, and frequents the open grassy plains of the greater part of eastern
                    Australia and Tasmania. Some closely allied species or perhaps local varieties,
                    <hi rend="italic">Μ. ocydromus, Μ. f</hi><hi rend="italic">uliginosus,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Μ. melanops,</hi> are found in southern and western Australia.
                    B. <hi rend="italic">Os-phranter,</hi> Gould, distinguished from the above by
                    the naked muffle, includes some very large and handsome species, which
                    principally dwell in rocky mountain ranges, as the great red kangaroo, <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">rufus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    antilopinus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">robustus.</hi>
                    C. <hi rend="italic">Halmatwnιs,</hi> F. Cuv. The kangaroos of this section have
                    also the muffle naked, but they are rather smaller species, frequenters of
                    forests and dense impenetrable brushes and scrubs, and hence often called brush
                    kangaroos, though a native name “wallaby” is now generally applied to them.
                    There are many species, of which <hi rend="italic">Μ. bennettii, Μ. ruficollis,
                    Μ. ualabatus, Μ. dorsalis, Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">agilis,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. derbianus, Μ. thetidis, Μ. billardieri</hi> are the best known.
                    <hi rend="italic">Μ. brachyurus</hi> is remarkable for its comparatively short
                    and slender tail and small ears. The earliest known species of kangaroo,
                    referred to before, <hi rend="italic">Μ. brunii</hi> (Schreber), may perhaps
                    belong to this section. Several examples were seen by Bruyn in 1711 living in
                    captivity in the garden of the Dutch governor of Batavia, and described and
                    figured in the account of his travels <hi rend="italic">{Reizen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">over Moskovie,</hi> &amp;c.) under the name of “Filanfler.” It was
                    quite lost sight of, and its name even transferred by S. Müller to another
                    species (now known as <hi rend="italic">Dorcopsis miilleri,</hi> Schlegel) until
                    rediscovered in 1865 by Rosenberg, who sent a series of specimens to the Leyden
                    Museum from the islands of Aru and Great Key, thus determining its true habitat.
                    Quite recently three other species of true kangaroo have been discovered out of
                    Australia :— <hi rend="italic">Μ. papzιanus,</hi> Peters, from the eastern
                    extremity of New Guinea, near Yule Island; <hi rend="italic">Μ. crassipes,</hi>
                    Pierson-Ramsay, from near Port Moresby; and <hi rend="italic">Μ. browni,</hi>
                    Pierson-Ramsay, from New Ireland. D. <hi rend="italic">Onyclwyalea,</hi> Gould,
                    with a hairy muffle and long and slender tail, furnished with a horny nail-like
                    organ at the apex. <hi rend="italic">Μ. unguifer, Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >Lagorchestes,</hi> Gould, hare-kangaroos, a group of small hare-like animals,
                    great leapers and swift runners, which mostly affect the open grassy ridges,
                    particularly those of a stony character, sleeping in forms or seats like the
                    common hare. Their limbs are comparatively small, their claws sharp and slender,

                    facility among the branches of large trees, and feeding on the bark, leaves, and
                    fruit. In accordance with this habit their hinder limbs are comparatively
                    shorter than in tire true kangaroos, and their fore limbs are longer and more
                    robust, and have very strong curved and pointed claws. These differ from all the

                    the molar teeth, and in the circumstance that the fur of the back of the neck is

                    slightly curved. Premolars of both jaws always with large, simple, compressed
                    crowns, with a nearly straight or slightly concave free cutting edge, both outer
                    and inner surfaces usually marked by a series of parallel, vertical grooves and
                    ridges. Molars with quadrate crowns, having a blunt, conical cusp at each
                    corner, the fourth notably smaller than the third, sometimes rudimentary or
                    absent. Fore feet narrow; three middle toes considerably exceeding the first and

                <p>The potoroos or rat-kangaroos are all small animals, none of them exceeding a

                    toe, without nail. It is, therefore, a form of great interest, as showing a
                    structure of foot connecting that of the kangaroos with that of the phalangers.
                    The single known species, <hi rend="italic">H. moschatus,</hi> Ramsay, has been
                    lately discovered in north-east Australia. It was described almost
                    simultaneously by Owen under the name of <hi rend="italic">Pleopus
                    nudicaudatus.</hi></p>
                <p>In seeking among the other marsupials for the nearest allies to the kangaroos,
                    using this word in the comprehensive sense as above, two most striking points in
                    their organization must be borne in mind, the structure of the hind foot and the
                    dentition. Of the former the essential peculiarity is the great predominance of
                    the fourth digit, and the remarkable character of the second and third, which
                    while retaining a considerable length, are of extreme tenuity, and buried up to
                    the claws in a common integument. Such a structure of foot is quite unknown out
                    of the marsupial order, but in that order it is found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phalangistidae</hi> in a very modified form, associated with a large opposable
                    hallux, and a broad sole of the foot,, appropriate for climbing trees; and
                    again, in almost the’ same form as in the kangaroos, in the ground-dwelling <hi
                    rend="italic">Peramelidae,</hi> which in their dentition and digestive organs
                    are so widely different. The Australian carnivorous marsupials, <hi
                    rend="italic">Dasyuridae,</hi> and the American opossums or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Didelphidae,</hi> show no trace of this singular conformation. It is therefore
                    only with the former families, the <hi rend="italic">Phalan-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gistidae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Peramelidae,</hi> that the
                    kangaroos are allied by this character.</p>
                <p>The chief peculiarity of the dentition consists in the presence of three pairs of
                    incisors in the upper jaw, the first or middle one of which is generally the
                    largest, opposed to a single pair in the lower jaw, strong, sharp, and
                    procumbent. These are followed by an interval, in which may be, in the upper jaw
                    only, a canine, but always so small, as to be of little functional importance.
                    The premolars are compressed and cutting, and the true molars ridged or
                    tuberculated. Such a dentition is found among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phalangistidae</hi> alone of existing marsupials. In this respect the <hi
                    rend="italic">Peramelidae</hi> are completely separated from the kangaroos,
                    their numerous small incisors, large canines, and cuspidated molars resembling
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">Dasyuridae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Didelphidae.</hi> On the whole then, the kangaroos and the phalangers are
                    groups most nearly allied in essential characters, having both dentition and
                    extremities formed upon the same fundamental type, though with modifications of
                    the latter to suit their respective terrestrial and arboreal habits.</p>
                <p>Remains of numerous extinct species of true kangaroos, many of them of much
                    larger size than any now existing, are abundant in the Pleistocene deposits of
                    Australia, and have been described and figured by Professor Owen in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi> Hitherto they have been found in
                    no other part.of the world. Other animals of gigantic size, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diprotodon,</hi> as large as a rhinoceros, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nototherium,</hi> but little inferior, with dentition of the same
                    general type, but the structure of whose feet is not yet known, lived with these
                    kangaroos in the same land. An extraordinary modification of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hypsiprymnus</hi> type, with the great premolar characteristic of
                    that genus immensely exaggerated in size, and the true molars equally reduced,
                    misnamed <hi rend="italic">Thylacοleο</hi><hi rend="italic">carnifex,</hi> was
                    another contemporary. Beyond these, which all belong to the most recent
                    geological epoch, we have no knowledge, of any extinct animals which can be said
                    to be nearly allied to kangaroos, or to connect them with any other forms of
                    mammals. The only marsupials discovered in European Tertiaries resemble the
                    existing opossums of America, and except in their common marsupial characters
                    have no affinities with the kangaroos.</p>
                <p>It is, however, a most remarkable fact that in the Purbeck beds of the newer
                    Oolitic series, not only in England, but also in deposits of corresponding age
                    in America, lower jaws of small mammals (to which Dr Falconer gave the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Plagiaulax),</hi> with a type of dentition showing a
                    considerable resemblance to that described above as peculiar to the kangaroos
                    and their existing allies, have been discovered. Unfortunately no part of the
                    skull or upper teeth, or of the limbs of any of these is as yet known; so
                    whether the resemblance was fully carried out, even in the dentition, is
                    uncertain, and it is almost too great a stretch of the imagination to assume
                    that the modern “diprotodon t” marsupials have derived their special type of
                    toothstructure from such remote ancestry. The evidence of the affinity of the
                    still more ancient <hi rend="italic">Hypsiprymηopsis</hi> (Boyd Dawkins),
                    founded upon a single and much worn tooth, having some resemblance to one of the
                    large premolars of <hi rend="italic">Hypsiprymnus,</hi> found in the
                    infra-Liassic beds of Watchet in Somersetshire, is based on still slighter
                    foundation; but, if it should eventually turn out to be well-grounded, it would
                    carry back the type to an extraordinary antiquity.</p>

                <p> KÄNGRA, a district in the lieutenant-governorship of the Punjab, India, lying
                    between 31° 20' and 33° N. lat., and between 75° 39' and 78’ 55' Έ. long.,
                    bounded on the N.W. by Gurdaspur district and Chamba state, on the N.E. by the
                    Himâlaya mountains, on the S.E. by the states of Bashahr, Mandi, and Bilâspur,
                    and on the S.W. by Hoshiarpur district, with an area of 8988 square miles.
                    Kângra district comprises a vast tract, extending eastward from the plain
                    country of the Bâri and Jalandhar Doâbs, across two distinct Himâlayan ranges,
                    far into the heart of Thibet. It naturally falls into three parts—the
                    sub-Himâlayan country of Kângra proper, the central valleys of Kullu and
                    Bangâhal, and the rugged outer region of the Tibetan slope. It consists almost
                    entirely of immense mountain ranges, whose three parallel lines, with a
                    transverse ridge, form four main basins, in each of which a great river takes
                    its rise—the Beas (Biâs), Spiti, Chenâb, and Râvi. From the great variety of the
                    different tracts included in the district by modern arrangements, it is
                    impossible to assign any general physical peculiarities to the whole beyond
                    their common characteristic as mountainous regions, intersected by snowy chains
                    and scored by deep river valleys. The western portion, abutting on the Punjab
                    plains, admits of cultivation, and supports a comparatively dense population;
                    while the bare and sterile eastern glens are sparsely inhabited by a Tibetan
                    race.</p>
                <p>The census of 1868 disclosed a population of 743,882 (393,571 males and 350,311
                    females),—83 to the square mile. The Hindus numbered 693,505; Mahometans,
                    48,613; Sikhs, 1314; Christians, 277; and “others,” 173. The six municipal towns
                    with their population are—Nιirpur, 7151; Kângra, 6344; Haripur, 3839; Sujanpur
                    Tira, 3393; Jawâla-mukhi, 2847; Dharmsala, 202h The famous Hindu temple· of
                    Nagarkot at Kângra town is one of the oldest and most wealthy shrines in India,
                    and twice exposed the district to the plunder of the Mahometans.</p>
                <p>The cultivated area of the district is returned at 681 square miles, or less than
                    one-thirteenth of the entire surface. The staple crops include wheat and barley
                    for the spring, and rice and maize for the autumn harvest. Rice is the principal
                    crop of the upper valleys, while maize composes the ordinary food of the upland
                    people for six months of the year. Sugar-cane covers a large area in the
                    neighbourhood of Kângra town. Tea cultivation has taken root as an imnortant
                    industry, both in Kângra proper and in <pb break="no"

                    twenty-eight plantations, producing a gross out-turn of 428,655 ft&gt; of tea,
                    valued at £65,000. Potatoes also constitute a considerable crop. In Lâhùl and
                    Spiti barley is the agricultural staple; but the former tract does not grow a
                    sufficient quantity of grain for its own consumption, being largely supplied by
                    importations from Kullm</p>
                <p>Agι∙icultural produce forms the staple of the export trade; the imports consist
                    of grain, cotton, tobacco, and European piece goods. The P&lt;ilampur fair,
                    established by Government with a view to fostering commerce with Central Asia,
                    draws together a small concourse of Yârkandi merchants. The Lâhûlis carry on an
