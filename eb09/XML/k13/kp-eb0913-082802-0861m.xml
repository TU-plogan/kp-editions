                <p><label type="entry">KÁLIDÁSA</label> is the most illustrious name among the
                    writers of the second epoch of Sanskrit literature, which, as contrasted with
                    the age of the Vedic hymns, may be characterized as the period of artificial
                    poetry. Owing to the utter absence of the historical sense in the Hindu race, it
                    is impossible to fix with chronological exactness the lifetime of either
                    Kâlidâsa or any other Sanskrit author. Native tradition places him in the 1st
                    century B.c.; but the evidence on which this belief rests has been shown to be
                    wholly worthless. The works of the poet have been found to contain no allusions
                    by which their date can be directly determined; yet the extremely corrupt form
                    of the Prâkrit or popular dialects spoken by the women and the subordinate
                    characters in his plays, as compared with the Prâkrit in inscriptions of
                    ascertained age, has led the chief authorities, Weber and Lassen, to agree in
                    fixing on the 3d century of our era as the approximate period to which the
                    writings of Kâlidâsa should be referred.</p>
                <p>The richness of his creative fancy, his delicacy of senti ment, and his keen
                    appreciation of the beauties of nature, combined with remarkable powers of
                    description, which are conspicuous throughout his works, place Kâlidâsa in the
                    first rank of Oriental poets. The effect, however, of his productions as a whole
                    is greatly marred by extreme artificiality of diction, which, though to a less
                    extent than in other Hindu poets, not unfrequently takes the form of puerile
                    conceits, and plays on words, the matter being treated merely as a means for
                    displaying dexterity in the manipulation of the language. In this respect his
                    writings contrast very unfavourably with the more genuine poetry of the Vedas.
                    Though a true poet, he is wanting in that artistic sense of proportion so
                    characteristic of the Greek mind, which exactly adjusts the parts to the whole,
                    and combines form and matter into an inseparable poetic unity. Kâlidâsa’s fame
                    rests chiefly on his dramas, but he is also distinguished as an epic and a lyric
                    poet.</p>

                <p>He wrote three plays, the plots of which all bear a general resemblance to each
                    other, inasmuch as they consist of love intrigues, which, after numerous and
                    seemingly insurmountable impediments of a similar nature, are ultimately brought
                    to a successful conclusion.</p>
                <p>Of these, <hi rend="italic">Çakuntalâ</hi> is that which has always justly
                    enjoyed the greatest fame and popularity. The unqualified praise bestowed upon
                    it by Goethe sufficiently guarantees its poetic merit. There are two recensions
                    of the text in India, the Bengali and the Devanâgari, the latter being generally
                    considered older and purer. <hi rend="italic">Çakuntalà</hi> was first
                    translated into English by Sir William Jones (Calcutta, 1789), who used the
                    Bengali recension. It was soon after translated into German by G. Forster
                    (1791), and by Herder in 1803. An edition of the Sanskrit original, with French
                    translation, was published by Chézy at Paris in 1830. This formed the basis of a
                    translation by Hirzel (Zurich, 1830). Another edition of the Bengali recension
                    was published by Prema Chandra (Calcutta, 1860) for the use of European
                    students. The Devanâgari recension was first edited by Bohtlingk (Bonn, 1842),
                    with a German translation. On this were based the successive German translations
                    of Meyer (Tübingen, 1851) and Lobedanz (2d ed., Leipsic, 1861). The same
                    recension has been edited by Dr C. Burkhard with a Sanskrit-Latin vocabulary and
                    short Prakrit grammar (Breslau, 1872), and by Professor Monier Williams (Oxford,
                    2d ed., 1872). Another edition was published at Bombay in 1861.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vikramorvaçi,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Urvaçl</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">won by Valour,</hi> abounds with fine lyrical passages, and is of
                    all Indian dramas second only to <hi rend="italic">Çakuntalà</hi> in poetic
                    beauty. It was edited by Lenz (Bonn, 1833) and translated into German by Hofer
                    (Berlin, 1837), by Hirzel (1838), and by Lobedanz (Leipsic, 1861). The best
                    edition is by Bollensen (Petersburg, 1845). There is also an English edition by
                    Monier Williams, a metrical and prose version by the late Professor H. H.
                    Wilson, and a literal prose translation by Professor E. B. Cowell (1851).</p>
                <p>The third play, entitled <hi rend="italic">Mdlavikdgnimiira,</hi> has
                    considerable poetical and dramatic merit, but is confessedly inferior to the
                    other two. It possesses the advantage, however, that its hero Agnimitra and its
                    heroine Mâlavikâ are more ordinary and human characters than those of the other
                    plays. It was edited by Dr Tullberg at Bonn, 1840, and more correctly by Shankar
                    P. Pandit, with English notes, in 1869, and ably translated into German by
                    Professor Weber in 1856.</p>
                <p>Two epic poems are also attributed to Kalidasa. The longer of these is entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Raghuvança,</hi> the subject of which is the same as that of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Rdmdyana,</hi> viz., the history of Hama, but beginning
                    with a long account of his ancestors, the ancient rulers of Ayodhya (edited by
                    Stenzler, London, 1832). The other epic is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kumd-rasambhaνa,</hi> the theme of which is the birth of Kumâra, otherwise
                    called Kârttikeya or Skanda, god of war (edited by Stenzler, London, 1838, and
                    by the Rev. K. Μ. Banerjea, 3d ed., Calcutta, 1872). Though containing many fine
                    passages, it is tame as a whole.</p>
                <p>His lyrical poems are the <hi rend="italic">McghadMa</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rilasamhàra.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">MeghadMa,</hi> or the
                    Cloud-Messenger, describes the complaint of an exiled lover, and the message he
                    sends to his wife by a cloud. It is full of deep feeling, and abounds with fine
                    descriptions of the beauties of nature. It was edited with free English
                    translation by H. H. Wilson (Calcutta, 1813), and by Gildemeister (Bonn, 1841);
                    a German adaptation by Μ. Müller appeared at Königsberg (1847), and one by
                    Schmitz at Bielefeld (1859). It was edited by Johnson, with vocabulary and
                    Wilson’s metrical translation (London, 1867). The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ritusamhàra,</hi> or Collection of the Seasons, is a short poem, of less
                    importance, on the six seasons of the year. There is an edition by Bohlen, with
                    prose Latin and metrical German translation (Leipsic, 1840).</p>
                <p>Another poem, entitled the <hi rend="italic">Nalodaya,</hi> or Rise of Nala,
                    edited by Benary (Berlin, 1830) and by Yates (Calcutta, 1844), which is a
                    treatment of the story of Nala and Damayanti, but describes especially the
                    restoration of Nala to prosperity and power, has been ascribed to the celebrated
                    Kalidasa, but was probably written by another poet of the same name. It is full
                    of most absurd verbal conceits and metrical extravagances.</p>
                <p>So many poems, partly of a very different stamp, are attributed to Kalidasa that
                    it is scarcely possible to avoid the necessity of assuming the existence of more
                    authors than one of that name. It is by no means improbable that there were
                    three poets thus named; indeed modern native astronomers are so convinced of the
                    existence of a triad of authors of this name that they apply the term Kalidasa
                    to designate the number three. (A. A. Μ.)</p>
