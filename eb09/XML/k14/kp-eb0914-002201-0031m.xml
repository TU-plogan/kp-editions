                    was little foretaste of anything greatly or even genuinely good; but between the
                    marshy and sandy flats of sterile or futile verse there were undoubtedly some
                    few purple patches of floral promise. The style was frequently detestable—a
                    mixture of sham Spenserian and mock Wordsworthian, alternately florid and arid.
                    His second book, <hi rend="italic">Endymion,</hi> rises in its best passages to
                    the highest level of Barnfield and of Lodge, the two previous poets with whom,
                    had he published nothing more, he might most properly have been classed; and
                    this, among minor minstrels, is no unenviable place. His third book raised him
                    at once to a foremost rank in the highest class of English poets. Never was any
                    one of them but Shelley so little of a marvellous boy and so suddenly revealed
                    as a marvellous man. Never has any poet suffered so much from the chaotic
                    misarrangement of his poems in every collected edition. The rawest and the
                    rankest rubbish of his fitful spring is bound up in one sheaf with the ripest
                    ears, flung into one basket with the richest fruits, of his sudden and splendid
                    summer. The <hi rend="italic">Ode to a Nightingale,</hi> one of the final
                    masterpieces of human work in all time and for all ages, is immediately preceded
                    in all editions now current by some of the most vulgar and fulsome doggrel ever
                    whimpered by a vapid and effeminate rhymester in the sickly stage of whelphood.
                    Shelley, up to twenty, had written little or nothing that would have done credit
                    to a boy of ten; and of Keats also it may be said that the merit of his work at
                    twenty-five was hardly by comparison more wonderful than its demerit at
                    twenty-two. His first-book fell as flat as it deserved to fall; the reception of
                    his second, though less considerate than on the whole it deserved, was not more
                    contemptuous than that of immeasurably better books published about the same
                    time by Coleridge, Landor, and Shelley. A critic of exceptional carefulness and
                    candour might have noted in the first book so singular an example of a stork
                    among the cranes as the famous and noble sonnet on Chapman’s Homer; a just judge
                    would have indicated, a partial advocate might have exaggerated, the value of
                    such golden grain amid a garish harvest of tares as the hymn to Pan and the
                    translation <pb break="no"

                    the weedy wilderness of <hi rend="italic">Endymion.</hi> But the hardest thing
                    said of that poem by the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi> reviewer was
                    unconsciously echoed by the future author of <hi rend="italic">Adoηais,—</hi>
                    that it was all but absolutely impossible to read through; and the obscener
                    insolence of the “Blackguard’s Magazine,” as Landor afterwards very justly
                    labelled it, is explicable though certainly not excusable if we glance back at
                    such a passage as that where Endymion exchanges fulsome and liquorish
                    endearments with the “known unknown <hi rend="italic">from whom his being sips
                    such darling (!) essence.’’</hi> Such nauseous and pitiful phrases as these, and
                    certain passages in his correspondence, make us understand the source of the
                    most offensive imputations or insinuations levelled against the writer’s
                    manhood; and, while admitting that neither his love-letters, nor the last
                    piteous outcries of his wailing and shrieking agony, would ever have been made
                    public by merciful or respectful editors, we must also admit that, if they ought
                    never to have been published, it is no less certain that they ought never to
                    have been written; that a manful kind of man or even a manly sort of boy, in his
                    love-making or in his suffering, will not howl and snivel after such a
                    lamentable fashion. One thing hitherto inexplicable a very slight and rapid
                    glance at his amatory correspondence will amply suffice to explain: how it came
                    to pass that the woman so passionately beloved by so great a poet should have
                    thought it the hopeless attempt of a mistaken kindness to revive the memory of a
                    man for whom the best that could be wished was complete and compassionate
                    oblivion. For the side of the man’s nature presented to her inspection, this
                    probably was all that charity or reason could have desired. But that there was a
                    finer side to the man, even if considered apart from the poet, his
                    correspondence with his friends and their general evidence to his character give
                    more sufficient proof than perhaps we might have derived from the general
                    impression left on us by his works; though indeed the preface to <hi
                    rend="italic">Endymion</hi> itself, however illogical in its obviously implied
                    suggestion that the poem published was undeniably unworthy of publication, gave
                    proof or hint at least that after all its author was something of a man. And the
                    eighteenth of his letters to Miss Brawne stands out in bright and brave contrast
                    with such as seem incompatible with the traditions of his character on its
                    manlier side. But if it must be said that he lived long enough only to give
                    promise of being a man, it must also be said that he lived long enough to give
                    assurance of being a poet who was not born to come short of the first rank. Not
                    even a hint of such a probability could have been gathered from his first or
                    even from his second appearance; after the publication of his third volume it
                    was no longer a matter of possible debate among judges of tolerable competence
                    that this improbability had become a certainty. Two or three phrases cancelled,
                    two or three lines erased, would have left us in <hi rend="italic">Lamia</hi>
                    one of the most faultless as surely as one of the most glorious jewels in the
                    crown of English poetry. <hi rend="italic">Isabella,</hi> feeble and awkward in
                    narrative to a degree almost incredible in a student of Dryden and a pupil of
                    Leigh Hunt, is overcharged with episodical effects of splendid and pathetic
                    expression beyond the reach of either. <hi rend="italic">The Eve of St
                    Agnes,</hi> aiming at no doubtful success, succeeds in evading all casual
                    difficulty in the line of narrative; with no shadow of pretence to such interest
                    as may be derived from stress of incident or depth of sentiment, it stands out
                    among all other famous poems as a perfect and unsurpassable study in pure colour
                    and clear melody—a study in which the figure of Madeline brings back upon the
                    mind’s eye, if only as moonlight recalls a sense of sunshine, the nuptial
                    picture of Marlowe’s Hero and the sleeping presence of Shakespeare’s Imogen.
                    Beside this poem should always be placed the less famous but not less precious
                    <hi rend="italic">Eve of St Mark,</hi> a fragment unexcelled for the simple
                    perfection of its perfect simplicity, exquisite alike in suggestion and in
                    accomplishment. The triumph of <hi rend="italic">Hyperion</hi> is as nearly
                    complete as the failure of <hi rend="italic">Endymion;</hi> yet Keats never gave
                    such proof of a manly devotion and rational sense of duty to his art as in his
                    resolution to leave this great poem unfinished; not, as we may gather from his
                    correspondence on the subject, for the pitiful reason assigned by his
                    publishers, that of discouragement at the reception given to his former work,
                    but on the solid and reasonable ground that a Miltonic study had something in
                    its very scheme and nature too artificial, too studious of a foreign influence,
                    to be carried on and carried out at such length as was implied by his original
                    design. Fortified and purified as it had been on a first revision, when much
                    introductory allegory and much tentative effusion of sonorous and superfluous
                    verse had been rigorously clipped down or pruned away, it could not long have
                    retained spirit enough to support or inform the shadowy body of a subject so
                    little charged with tangible significance. The faculty of assimilation as
                    distinguished from imitation, than which there can be no surer or stronger sign
                    of strong and sure original genius, is not more evident in the most Miltonic
                    passages of the revised <hi rend="italic">Hyperion</hi> than in the more
                    Shakespearean passages of the unrevised tragedy which no radical correction
                    could have left other than radically incorrigible. It is no conventional
                    exaggeration, no hyperbolical phrase of flattery with more sound than sense in
                    it, to say that in this chaotic and puerile play of <hi rend="italic">Otho the
                    Great</hi> there are such verses as Shakespeare might not without pride have
                    signed at the age when he wrote and even at the age when he rewrote the tragedy
                    of <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet.</hi> The dramatic fragment of <hi
                    rend="italic">King Stephen</hi> shows far more power of hand and gives far more
                    promise of success than does that of Shelley’s <hi rend="italic">Charles the
                    First.</hi> Yet we cannot say with any confidence that even this far from
                    extravagant promise would certainly or probably have been kept; it is certain
                    only that Keats in these attempts did at least succeed in showing a possibility
                    of future excellence as a tragic or at least a romantic dramatist. In every
                    other line of high and serious poetry his triumph was actual and consummate;
                    here only was it no more than potential or incomplete. As a ballad of the more
                    lyrical order, <hi rend="italic">La belle Dame sans Merci</hi> is not less
                    absolutely excellent, less triumphantly perfect in force and clearness of
                    impression, than as a narrative poem is <hi rend="italic">Lamia.</hi> In his
                    lines on Robin Hood, and in one or two other less noticeable studies of the
                    kind, he has shown thorough and easy mastery of the beautiful metre inherited by
                    Fletcher from Barnfield and by Milton from Fletcher. The simple force of spirit
                    and style which distinguishes the genuine ballad manner from all spurious
                    attempts at an artificial simplicity was once more at least achieved in his
                    verses on the crowning creation of Scott’s humaner and manlier genius—Meg
                    Merrilies. No little injustice has been done to Keats by such devotees as fix
                    their mind’s eye only on the more salient and distinctive notes of a genius
                    which in fact was very much more various and tentative, less limited and
                    peculiar, than would be inferred from an exclusive study of his more specially
                    characteristic work. But within the limits of that work must we look of course
                    for the genuine credentials of his fame; and highest among them we must rate his
                    unequalled and unrivalled odes. Of these perhaps the two nearest to absolute
                    perfection, to the triumphant achievement and accomplishment of the very utmost
                    beauty possible to human words, may be that to Autumn and that on a Grecian Urn;
                    the most radiant, fervent, and musical is that to a Nightingale; the most
                    pictorial and perhaps the tenderest in its ardour of passionate fancy is that to
                    Psyche; the subtlest in sweetness of thought and feeling is that on <pb

                    have seen than any that is in these; lovelier it surely has never seen, nor ever
                    can it possibly see. From the divine fragment of an unfinished ode to Maia we
                    can but guess that if completed it would have been worthy of a place beside the
                    highest. His remaining lyrics have many beauties about them, but none perhaps,
                    can be called thoroughly beautiful. He has certainly left us one perfect sonnet
                    of the first rank; and as certainly he has left us but one.</p>
                <p>Keats, on high and recent authority, has been promoted to a place beside
                    Shakespeare; and it was long since remarked by some earlier critic of less note
                    that as a painter of flowers his touch had almost a Shakespearean felicity,—
                    recalling, a writer in our own day might have added, the hand of M. Fantin on
                    canvass. The faultless force and the profound subtlety of this deep and cunning
                    instinct for the absolute expression of absolute natural beauty can hardly be
                    questioned or overlooked; and this is doubtless the one main distinctive gift or
                    power which denotes him as a poet among all his equals, and gives him right to a
                    rank for ever beside Coleridge and Shelley. As a man, the two admirers who have
                    done best service to his memory are, first and far foremost, Lord Houghton, and
                    secondly Mr Matthew Arnold. These alone, among all who have written of him
                    without the disadvantage or advantage of a personal acquaintance, have clearly
                    seen and shown us the manhood of the man. That ridiculous and degrading legend
                    which imposed so strangely on the generous tenderness of Shelley, while evoking
                    the very natural and allowable laughter of Byron, fell to dust at once for ever
                    on the appearance of that admirable and unsurpassed biography which gave perfect
                    proof to all time that “men have died and worms have eaten them,” but not for
                    fear of critics or through suffering inflicted by reviews. Somewhat too
                    sensually sensitive he may have been in either capacity, but the nature of the
                    man was as far as was the quality of the poet above the pitiful level of a
                    creature whose soul could “let itself be snuffed out by an article”; and in
                    fact, owing doubtless to the accident of a death which followed so fast on his
                    early appearance and his dubious reception as a poet, the insolence and
                    injustice of his reviewers in general have been comparatively and even
                    considerably exaggerated. Except from the chief fountain - head of professional
                    ribaldry then open in the world of literary journalism, no reek of personal
                    insult arose to offend his nostrils; and then as now the tactics of such
                    unwashed malignants were inevitably suicidal; the references to his brief
                    experiment of apprenticeship to a surgeon which are quoted from <hi
                    rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> in the shorter as well as in the longer memoir by
                    Lord Houghton could leave no bad odour behind them save what might hang about
                    men’s yet briefer recollection of his assailant’s un-memorable existence. The
                    false Keats, therefore, whom Shelley pitied and Byron despised would have been,
                    had he ever existed, a thing beneath compassion or contempt. That such a man
                    could have had such a genius is almost evidently impossible; and yet more
                    evident is the proof which remains on everlasting record that none was ever
                    further from the chance of decline to such degradation than the real and actual
                    man who made that name immortal. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.</hi><hi

                <p>Subjoined are the most important facts in the life of Keats. He was born, as
                    already stated, in London on October 29, 1795. At an early age he was sent to
                    school at Enfield, and in 1810 he was apprenticed to a surgeon at Edmonton. On
                    the completion of his apprenticeship, in. 1815, he removed to London for the
                    purpose ot walking the hospitals, and soon made the acquaintance of Leigh Hunt,
                    and subsequently that of Haydon, Hazlitt, Shelley, and others. After having
                    published some sonnets in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> of which Hunt was
                    at that time editor, he was encouraged by the ρr ιise of his friends to give to
                    the world a volume o? <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> in 1817, and a second,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Endymion, a Poetic Romance,</hi> in the following
                    year. Meanwhile, symptoms of hereditary lung-disease having shown themselves, he
                    spent some months in visiting the English lake district and portions of Scotland
                    and Ireland, but without re-establishing his failing health; on his return to
                    London the despondency which had fallen upon him on this account was deepened by
                    the death of his younger brother. Soon after this event he first became
                    acquainted with Miss Brawne, and the friendship rapidly grew into a passion
                    which combined with straitened circumstances and the steady progress of disease
                    to give a tragical cast to all that remained of his brief career. In 1820 the
                    results of his literary activity during the two preceding years were published
                    in <hi rend="italic">Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St Agnes, and other Poems.</hi>
                    In autumn of the same year, having been advised to winter in a more genial
                    climate, he sailed for Italy. The voyage proved of little advantage, and after
                    some months of suffering he died at Rome on February 23, 1821. <hi rend="italic"
