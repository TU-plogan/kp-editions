                <p><label type="entry">KUEN-LUN, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Kouen-lun</hi></label>, the
                    name given to the mountains between western Tibet and the plains of eastern
                    Turkestan; it is derived from the Chinese geographers, and is probably a
                    corruption of some Turkish or Tibetan word; it appears to be unknown locally.
                    The name having been adopted, chiefly on the initiative of Humboldt, before any
                    correct geographical knowledge had been obtained of the region to which it was
                    applied, it has been used with inconvenient want of precision, and this has
                    encouraged erroneous conceptions. Little precise information is yet available on
                    the subject, but there is no reason to doubt that, within the limits to which
                    actual exploration has gone, the mountains designated as Kuen-lun form the
                    northern border of the high lands of Tibet, descending to the central Asian
                    plain, just as those commonly spoken of under the name of Himalaya constitute
                    the broad mountainous slope which descends to the lower levels of India.</p>
                <p>Nothing can be said with confidence of the northern border of Tibet east of 82°
                    E. long., but from this point westward, to about the 75th meridian, it consists
                    of a series of mountain ranges on a scale of magnitude quite analogous to that
                    of the higher ranges of the Himalaya, and beyond the last-named meridian merges
                    into the Thian-Shan mountains. A line of demarcation between the summit of the
                    Tibetan plateau and its northern flank can, in the present condition of our
                    knowledge, only be fixed in an arbitrary manner, and it may for convenience be
                    regarded as following the watershed line from which the streams flow northward
                    to the plain of eastern Turkestan. Using the name <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n164/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0164-0153"/> Kuen-lun in the sense thus explained, the
                    zone it includes will be seen to abut at its north-western extremity on the
                    series of elevated plateaus known under the name of Pamir, which extend over a
                    distance of nearly 200 miles to a little beyond 39° N. lat. Here the width of
                    the zone is about 100 miles. To the eastward it becomes broader, and on the 79th
                    meridian is nearly 150 miles across. In this region the chief ranges appear to
                    be laid out, generally, in a north-west and south-east direction, like those of
                    western Tibet, with transverse ridges at irregular intervals. The transverse
                    direction would seem to predominate in the outer portion of the zone nearest to
                    the plain of Turkestan, but the geographical details are too little known to
                    permit us to say more on this point. Of the longitudinal ranges two are of
                    conspicuous magnitude, running approximately parallel to one another about 60 or
                    70 miles apart; the more northern or outer may be spoken of as the main Kuenlun;
                    the other, which separates the waters of the Indus, which run off to the
                    south-west, from those of the streams which pass down to the plains of Khotan,
                    Yarkand, and Kashgar, constitutes the watershed before referred to, and has been
                    called the Muztagh or Karakorum range from two of the best known passes across
                    it. The latter of these great lines of elevation, from which the Kuen-lun slope
                    of the Tibetan plateau may be said to commence, is of very considerable altitude
                    throughout, its summits rising more than 28,000 feet above sea-level, and few of
                    the passes falling below 18,000 or even 19,000 feet over a length of some 400
                    miles. Its flanks are covered with enormous glaciers, some of them being
                    continuous for distances of 60 or 70 miles. The main Kuen-lun is not much
                    inferior in magnitude, one of its peaks rising above 25,000 feet, while the
                    points between that elevation and 20,000 feet are numerous. The passes lie
                    between 18,000 feet on the east and 13,000 feet on the west. The valleys between
                    these ranges vary in elevation from about 15,000 feet to 10,000 feet, the
                    drainage in some cases collecting in small lakes, in others forming streams
                    which, after flowing for some distance parallel to the separating ridges,
                    suddenly change their direction and run off to the north-east through deep
                    transverse lines of rupture, in a manner analogous to that observed on the
                    border of the Himalayan mountain slope.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The whole of the region is described as remarkable for its general barren
                    character. The mountain sides are naked and the valleys for the most part narrow
                    and steep. There is a complete absence of forest, and trees of any sort are only
                    found at the lower levels bordering on the northern plain,—walnuts, poplars, and
                    willows alone being mentioned, besides a few fruit trees. The vegetation is
                    scanty and botanically poor, brushwood being found along some of the rivers, and
                    pastures in the bottoms of the deep valleys among the higher ranges. Among the
                    shrubs are species common in Tibet, such as tamarisk, juniper, astragalus,
                    willow, rose, barberry, and clematis. The animal life also appears to be mainly
                    that found in the neighbouring parts of Tibet.</p>
                <p>Some facts of interest relating to the geological structure of these mountains
                    may be gathered from the fragmentary reports of Dr Stoliczka, the accomplished
                    geologist who so prematurely died from the results of exposure in these
                    inhospitable regions. The summit of the Karakorum Pass is of Triassic age, and
                    cretaceous beds are found in some of the ranges on the north of the Kuen-lun
                    main range, associated with Palaeozoic deposits supposed to be Carboniferous and
                    Silurian. For the greater portion of the year the climate is very rigorous. The
                    extremes of temperature are great, and the rainfall little.</p>
                <p>The population is small. The fixed settlements are confined to the outer valleys;
                    few villages or hamlets are found above 6000 feet of altitude, and hardly any
                    over 8000 feet The upper valleys are occupied by a nomadic population, wholly
                    pastoral in their habits.</p>
                <p>The tract may be regarded as appertaining politically to the sovereigns for the
                    time being of the principalities lying in the plain below it. But from the
                    nature of the case any recognized authority hardly extends beyond the
                    permanently inhabited region. (R. S.)</p>
