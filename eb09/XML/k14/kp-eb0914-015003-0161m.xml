                    the supreme ruler descended from Jenghiz was usually distinctively termed in the
                    13th century) (1216-1294) was the most eminent of the successors of Jenghiz
                    (Chinghiz), and the founder of the Mongol dynasty in China. He was the second
                    son of Tuli, youngest of the four sons of Jenghiz by his favourite wife. Jenghiz
                    was succeeded in the khanship by his third son Okkodai, or Ogdai (1229), he by
                    his son Kuyuk (1246), and Kuyuk by Mangku, eldest son of Tuli (1252). Kublai was
                    born in 1216, and, young as he was, took part with his younger brother Hulaku
                    (afterwards conqueror of the caliph and founder of the Mongol dynasty in Persia)
                    in the last campaign of Jenghiz (1226—27). The Mongol poetical chronicler,
                    Sanang Setzen, records a tradition that Jenghiz himself on his deathbed
                    discerned young Kublai’s promise and predicted his distinction.</p>
                <p>Northern China, Cathay as it was called (vol. v. p. 627), had been partially
                    conquered by Jenghiz himself, and the conquest had been followed up till the Kin
                    or “golden” dynasty of Tartars, reigning at Kai-fung-fu on the Yellow River,
                    were completely subjugated (1234). But China south of the Great Kiang remained
                    many years later subject to the native dynasty of Sung, reigning at the great
                    city of Linggan, or Kinsai <hi rend="italic">(King-sz</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">, “</hi> capital ”), now known as
                    Hang-chow-fu. Operations to subdue this region had commenced in 1235, but
                    languished till Mangku’s accession. Kublai was then named his brother’s
                    lieutenant in Cathay, and operations were resumed. By what seems a vast and
                    risky strategv, of which the motives are not <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n162/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0162-0151"/> quite clear, the first campaign of Kublai was
                    directed to the subjugation of the remote western province of Yunnan. After the
                    capture of Talifu (well known in recent years as the capital of a Mohammedan
                    insurgent sultan) Kublai returned north, leaving the war in Yunnan to a trusted
                    general. Some years later (1257) the khan Mangku himself entered on a campaign
                    in west China, and died there, before Ho-chow in Sz’chuen (1259).</p>
                <p>Kublai assumed the succession, but it was disputed by his brother Arikbugha, and
                    by his cousin Kaidu, and wars with these retarded the prosecution of the
                    southern conquest. Doubtless, however, this was constantly before Kublai as a
                    great task to be accomplished, and its fulfilment was in his mind when he
                    selected as the future capital of his empire the Chinese city that we now know
                    as Peking. Here, in 1264, to the north-east of the old city, which under the
                    name of Yenking had been an occasional residence of the Kin sovereigns, he
                    founded his new capital, a great rectangular plot of 18 miles in circuit. The
                    (so-called) “Tartar city” of modern Peking is the city of Kublai, with about
                    one-third at the north cut off, but Kublai’s walls are also on this retrenched
                    portion still traceable.</p>
                <p>The new city, officially termed Tai-tu (“great court”), but known among the
                    Mongols and western people as Kaan-baligh (“city of the khan”; see vol. iv. p.
                    722), was finished in 1267. The next year war against the Sung empire was
                    resumed, but was long retarded by the strenuous defence of the twin cities of
                    Siang-yang and Fan-ching, on opposite sides of the river Han, and commanding two
                    great lines of approach to the basin of the Great Kiang. The siege occupied
                    nearly five years. After this Bayan, Kublai’s best lieutenant, a man of high
                    military genius and noble character, took command. It was not, however, till
                    1276 that the Sung capital surrendered, and Bayan rode into the city (then
                    probably the greatest in the world) as its conqueror. The young emperor, with
                    his mother, was sent prisoner to Kaan-baligh; but two younger princes had been
                    despatched to the south before the fall of the city, and these successively were
                    proclaimed emperor by the adherents of the native throne. An attempt to maintain
                    their cause was made in Fuh-keen, and afterwards in Canton province; but in 1279
                    these efforts were finally extinguished, and the faithful minister who had
                    inspired them terminated the struggle by jumping with his young lord into the
                    sea.</p>
                <p>Even under the degenerate Sung dynasty the conquest of southern China had
                    occupied the Mongols during intermittent campaigns of half a century. But at
                    last Kublai was ruler of all China, and probably the sovereign (at least
                    nominally) of a greater population than had ever acknowledged one man’s
                    supremacy. For, though his rule was disputed by the princes of his house in
                    Turkestan, it was acknowledged by those on the Volga, whose rule reached to the
                    frontier of Poland, and by the family of his brother Hulaku, whose dominion
                    extended from the Oxus to the Arabian desert. For the first time in history the
                    name and character of an emperor of China were familiar as far west as the Black
                    Sea, and not unknown in Europe. The Chinese seals which Kublai conferred on his
                    kinsmen reigning at Tabriz are· stamped upon their letters to the kings of
                    France, and survive in the archives of Paris. Adventurers from Turkestan,
                    Persia, Armenia, Byzantium, even from Venice, served him as ministers, generals,
                    governors, envoys, astronomers, or physicians; soldiers from all Asia to the
                    Caucasus fought his battles in the south of China. Once in his old age (1287)
                    Kublai was compelled to take the field in person against a serious revolt,
                    raised by Nayan, a prince of his family, who held a vast domain on the borders
                    of Manchuria. Nayan was taken and executed. The revolt had been stirred up by
                    Kaidu, who survived his imperial rival, and died in 1301. Kublai himself died in
                    1294, at the age of seventy-eight.</p>
                <p>Though a great figure in Asiatic history, and far from deserving a niche in the
                    long gallery of Asiatic tyrants, Kublai misses a record in the short list of the
                    good rulers. His historical locus was a happy one, for, whilst be was the first
                    of his race to rise above the innate barbarism of the Mongols, he retained the
                    force and warlike characterof his ancestors, which vanished utterly in the
                    effeminacy of those who came after him. He had great intelligence and keen
                    desire of knowledge, with apparently a good deal of natural benevolence and
                    magnanimity. But his love of splendour, and his fruitless expeditions beyond
                    sea, created enormous demands for money, and he shut his eyes to the character
                    and methods of those whom he employed to raise it. A remarkable narrative of the
                    oppressions of one of these, Ahmed of Fenâket, and of the revolt which they
                    provoked, is given by Marco Polo, in substantial accordance with the Chinese
                    annals.</p>
                <p>Kublai patronized Chinese literature and culture generally. Of the great
                    astronomical instruments which he caused to be made specimens are still
                    preserved at Peking, which are truly splendid as works of art, and not
                    contemptible as works of science. Though he put hardly any Chinese into the
                    first ranks of his administration, he attached many to his confidence, and was
                    personally popular among them. Had his endeavour to procure European priests for
                    the instruction of his people, of which we know through Marco Polo, prospered,
                    the Roman Catholic Church, which did gain some ground under his successors,
                    might have taken stronger root in China. Failing this momentary effort, Kublai
                    probably saw in the organized force of Tibetan Buddhism the readiest instrument
                    in the civilization of his countrymen, and that system received his special
                    countenance. An early act of his reign had been to constitute a young lama of
                    intelligence and learning the head of the Lamaite church, and eventually also
                    prince of Tibet, an act which may be regarded as a precursory form of the rule
                    of the “grand lamas” of Lassa. The same ecclesiastic, Mati Dhwaja, was employed
                    by Kublai to devise a special alphabet for use with the Mongol language. It was
                    chiefly based on Tibetan forms of Nagari; some coins and inscriptions in it are
                    extant; but it had no great vogue, and soon perished. Of the splendour of his
                    court and entertainments, of his palaces, summer and winter, of his great
                    hunting expeditions, of his revenues and extraordinary paper currency, of his
                    elaborate system of posts and much else, an account is given in the book of
                    Marco Polo, who passed many years in Kublai’s service.</p>
                <p>We have alluded to his foreign expeditions, which were almost all disastrous.
                    Nearly all arose out of a hankering for the nominal extension of his empire by
                    claiming submission and tribute. Expeditions against Japan were several times
                    repeated; the last, in 1281, on an immense scale, met with huge discomfiture.
                    Kublai’s preparations to avenge it were abandoned owing to the intense
                    discontent which they created. In 1278 he made a claim of submission Upon
                    Champa, an ancient state representing what we now call Cochin China. This
                    eventually led to an attempt to invade the country through Tongking, and to a
                    war with the latter state, in which the Mongols had much the worst of it. War
                    with Burmah (or Mien, as the Chinese called it) was provoked in very similar
                    fashion, but the result was more favourable to Kublai’s arms. The country was
                    overrun as far as the Irawaddy deltaj the ancient capital Pag&lt;4n, with its
                    magnificent temples, destroyed, and the old royal dynasty overthrown. The last
                    attempt of the kind was against Java, and occurred in the last year of the old
                    khan’s reign. The envoy whom he <pb break="no"

                    with ignominy. A great armament was equipped in the ports of Fuhkeen to avenge
                    this insult; but after some temporary success the force was compelled to
                    re-embark with a loss of 3000 men. The death of Kublai prevented further
                    action.</p>
                <p>Some other expeditions, in which force was not used, gratified the khan’s vanity
                    by bringing back professions of homage, with presents, and with the curious
                    reports of foreign countries in which Kublai delighted. Such expeditions
                    extended to the states of southern India, to eastern Africa, and even to
                    Madagascar.</p>
                <p>Of Kublai’s twelve legitimate sons, Chingkim, the favourite and designated
                    successor, died in 1284-85; and Teimur, the son of Chingkim, took his place. No
                    great king arose in the dynasty after Kublai. He had in all nine successors of
                    his house on the throne of Kaan-baligh, but the long and imbecile reign of the
                    ninth, Toghon Teimur, ended (1368) in disgrace and expulsion, and the native
                    dynasty of Ming reigned in their stead. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. y.)</hi></p>
