                    north-west extremity of the Caucasus, comprising the entire basin of the river
                    of that name. It is bounded on the N. by the lands of the Don Cossacks and the
                    steppes of Stavropol, E. by the watershed of the river basins of the Caspian and
                    sea of Azoff, S. and S.W. by the Caucasian Alps, and W. by the Black Sea and
                    Straits of Kertch. Its area comprises 27,728 square miles. Ekaterinodar, the
                    chief town (population 30,000), is the residence of the governor, who, being
                    also ataman in chief of the Kuban Cossacks, is invested with military and civil
                    power. Climate varies greatly, the highest temperature reaching 104° Fahr., the
                    lowest seldom falling below 10° Fahr. The country is very healthy, except in the
                    lowlands, where fever prevails. The soil is of extreme fertility, yielding an
                    abundance of wheat, •maize, and tobacco. Fruit, such as apples, pears, cherries,
                    is plentiful, and the vine is cultivated with success near Temrouk and Taman.
                    The upper valleys are richly covered with forests abounding in fir, oak, ash,
                    beech, hornbeam, &amp;c.; the lower parts consist of extensive pasture lands and
                    swamps. The animals include the stag, roe-deer, bear, wild boar, wolf, fox,
                    ibex, and chamois, also the bison (which, however, is very rare) in the virgin
                    forests of the Teberda; numerous water-fowl, such as ducks, geese, swans,
                    pelicans, also the pheasant, partridge, bustard, and mountain turkey. The rivers
                    and lakes are plentifully supplied with fish, trout abounding in the mountain
                    streams and the sturgeon at the delta of the river Kuban. The mineral wealth
                    consists of coal, salt, petroleum, and ozokerite. The river Kuban (the ancient
                    Hypanis, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Caucasus,</hi> vol. v. p. 254) is navigable in
                    flat-bottomed boats over a distance of 100 miles between Temrouk and
                    Ekaterinodar. The delta comprises several lakes.</p>
                <p>It is on the upper banks of the Kuban that the Ass or Osses, and the enigmatic
                    corner of <hi rend="italic">Asia Propria,</hi> are believed to have been
                    located. The history of the original settlements of the various native tribes
                    named below, and their language and worship before the introduction of
                    Mohammedanism, remain a blank page in the legends of the Caucasus. The peninsula
                    of Taman, a land teeming with relics of ancient Greek colonists, has been
                    occupied successively by the Cimmerians, Sarmatians, Khazars, Mongols, and other
                    nations. The Genoese, who had established an extensive trade in the 13th
                    century, were expelled by the Turks in 1484, and in 1784 Russia obtained by
                    treaty the entire peninsula and the territory on the right bank of the
                    Kuban,—the latter being granted by Catherine II. in 1792 to the Cossacks of the
                    Dnieper. Then commenced the bloody struggle with the Circassians which continued
                    for more than half a century. The mountaineers were finally subdued in 1864, and
                    400,000 of their number expatriated. Those, however, who elected to remain have
                    become more prosperous than they had ever been. The population of Kuban,
                    862,473, embraces 510,038 Cossacks, 108,346 settlers of Russian origin, 4280
                    foreigners, and 95,602 natives. Cossack villages are military settlements, the
                    men carrying arms as well as following the plough. They are exempt from the
                    poll-tax (3 to 4 roubles) to which the others are subjected, but military
                    service is compulsory, as is gratuitous labour in the construction and repair of
                    roads, bridges, &amp;c. Not only domestic but even field work is conducted
                    mostly by women, remarkable for physical strength and endurance. Corn growing,
                    the rearing of cattle, and fishing are the most profitable occupations. The
                    native mountaineers, known under the general name of Circassians, but locally
                    distinguished as the Karatchai, Abadsikb, Khakoutchy, Shapsough, have greatly
                    altered their mode of life since the pacification of the Caucasus, still,
                    however, maintaining Mohammedanism, speaking their vernacular, and strictly
                    observing the customs of their ancestors. When during the late Russo-Turkish war
                    insurrections broke out amongst the natives on the Terek, in Dagestan, and
                    Abkhasia, these tribes remained peaceful and perfectly loyal. Their villages,
                    especially those of the Karatchai, are striking examples of human industry,
                    poverty being quite unknown; for the general emancipation in 1867 put an end to
                    intestine strife, the predatory expeditions of former times, and the parasitic
                    existence of numerous chiefs on the forced labour· of serfs. The native popula,
                    tion, as well as the Cossacks, enjoy certain rights of self-government, and are
                    allowed to hold meetings to that end. Exports include wheat, tobacco, leather,
                    wool, petroleum, and live cattle; imports dry goods, grocery, and hardware.
                    Local industry is limited to a few tanneries, petroleum refineries, and spirit
                    distilleries; but Russian and foreign capitalists have of late obtained
                    concessions for exploring the petroleum region stretching between Khadaji and
                    Taman, and the coal-mines of Khumarinsky in the upper valley of the Kuban.</p>
