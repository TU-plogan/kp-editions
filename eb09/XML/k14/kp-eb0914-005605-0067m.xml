                <p><label type="entry">KHÁNDESH, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Candeish</hi></label>, a
                    district of Bombay Presidency, India, lying between 20° 15' and 22° N. lat., and
                    73° 37' and 76“ 24' E. long., bounded on the N. by the SAtpura hills, E. by
                    Berar, S. by the SAtmAla or Ajanta hills, S.W. by NAsik district, and W. by
                    Baroda territory, with an area of 10,162 square miles. The chief town is Dhulia.
                    The principal natural feature is the TApti river, which enters at the south-east
                    corner of the district, and flows in a north-westerly direction, dividing
                    KhAndesh into two unequal parts. Of these the larger lies towards the south, and
                    is drained by the river Girna. Northwards beyond the alluvial plain, which
                    contains some of the richest tracts in KhAndesh, the land rises towards the
                    SAtpura hills. In the centre and east the country is level, save for some low
                    ranges of barren hills, and has in general an arid, unfertile appearance.
                    Towards the north and west, the plain rises into a difficult and rugged country,
                    thickly wooded, and inhabited by wild tribes of Bhils, who chiefly support
                    themselves on the fruits of the forests and by the profits of wood-cutting. The
                    drainage of the district centres in the TApti, which receives thirteen principal
                    tributaries in its course through KhAndesh. None of the rivers are navigable,
                    and the TApti flows in too deep a bed to be made use of for irrigation. The
                    district on the whole, however, is fairly well supplied with surface water.
                    KhAndesh is not rich in minerals. A large area is under forest; but the jungles
                    have been robbed of most of their valuable timber. Wild beasts are numerous. As
                    late as 1858 tigers abounded; but since then they have been very closely hunted,
                    and driven almost entirely out of the plains into the rough hilly country.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 returned the population at 1,028,642 (males 530,610, and
                    females 498,032),—Hindus, 948,279; Musalmâns, 79,359; Parsis, 61; Christians,
                    517; Jews, 36; Sikhs, 59; “others,” 331. Of the aboriginal tribes the Bhils are
                    the most important. They number 122,092, and formerly were a wild and lawless
                    robber tribe. Since the introduction of British rule, the efforts made by kindly
                    treatment, and by the offer of suitable employment, to win the Bhils from their
                    disorderly life have been most successful. Many of them are now employed in
                    police duties and as village watchmen. The total area of Government cultivable
                    land is returned at 3,453,549 acres, of which 2,218,355 acres were under
                    cultivation in 1875-76. Food grains take up 52 per cent.; pulses, 5f per cent.;
                    fibres, 28 per cent.; oil seeds, 11 percent.; miscellaneous crops, 31 per cent,
                    of the cultivated area. Irrigation is more extensively practised in KhAndesh
                    than in the Deccan and the southern Marhattâ country. Owing to the liability of
                    the district to river-floods, almost every year is marked by some failure of the
                    crops. The chief exports are food grains, oil seeds, butter, indigo, wax, and
                    honey; and the imports salt, spices, metal, piece goods, cotton yarn, and sugar.
                    There are ten steam cotton presses, and one steam spinning and <pb break="no"

                    have established agencies in the district; and towards the east, in the rich
                    Tâpti valley, Jalgâon and Bhusawal are rising into important centres of trade.
                    The trunk road from Bombay to Agra and the Great Indian Peninsula Railway
                    intersect the district, and of late years roads have been made all along the
                    chief lines of traffic. The total revenue in 1876-77 amounted to £422,291, of
                    which £303,706 was made up of the land tax. The same year there were 272
                    schools, with 16,249 pupils. The average annual rainfall for the five years
                    ending 1875-76 was 25 inches. Fevers and cutaneous affections are the prevailing
                    diseases.</p>
