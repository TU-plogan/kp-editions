                    archiépiscopal principality of Cologne. “Ego Thomas Kempis,” he says in his
                    chronicle of the monastery of Mount St Agnes, “scholaris Daventriensis, ex
                    diocesi Coloniensi natus.” His father was a poor hard-worked peasant; his mother
                    “ad custodiam rei domestic® attenta, in opere alacris, in victu sobria, in potu
                    abstemia, in verbo pauca, in factis pudica,” as her son fondly says, kept a
                    dame’s school for the younger children of the town. John and Gertrude Hammerken
                    had two sons, John and Thomas, both of whom found their way to Deventer, and
                    thence to Zwolle and to the convent of Mount St Agnes. Thomas reached Deventer
                    when he was barely twelve years old, was taught by a dame the beginnings of his
                    learning, and in a few months to his great joy entered the classes of Florentius
                    Radewyn. After the fashion of the time he was called Thomas from Kempen, and the
                    school title, as was often the case then, pushed aside the family name. Thomas
                    Hammerken was forgotten; Thomas a Kempis has become known to the whole Christian
                    world.</p>
                <p>This school at Deventer had become famous long before Thomas a Kempis was
                    admitted to its classes. It had been founded by Gerhard Groot, a wealthy burgher
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Groot),</hi> who had been won to pious living mainly
                    through the influence of Ruysbroeck, the Flemish mystic. It was at Deventer, in
                    the midst of this mystical theology and hearty practical benevolence, that
                    Thomas a Kempis was trained. Gerhard Groot was his saintly ideal. Florentius
                    Radewyn and Gerhard’s other early disciples were his heroes; their presence was
                    his atmosphere, the measure of their lives his horizon. But he was not like
                    them; he was not an educational reformer like Radewyn, nor a man of affairs like
                    Gerhard. He liked books and quiet corners all his days, he says; and so, when
                    conviction of sin and visions of God’s grace came to him in the mediaeval
                    fashion of a dream of the anger and forgiveness of the Virgin, Florentius <pb

                    advised him to join the Augustinian order, and sent him to Zwolle to the new
                    convent of Mount St Agnes, where his brother John was prior. Thomas was received
                    there in 1399, he professed the vows in 1407, received priest’s orders in 1413,
                    became sub-prior in 1425, and died on the 8th of August 1471, being ninety-one
                    years old.</p>
                <p>The convent of Mount St Agnes was poor, and most of the monks had to earn money
                    to support their household by copying MSS. Thomas was a most laborious copyist:
                    missals, books of devotion, and a famous MS. Bible were written by him; and the
                    weightiest argument of those who deny that he is the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Imitatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Christi</hi> is that he was a
                    copyist. He also wrote a large number of original writings, most of them
                    relating to the convent life, which was the only life he knew. He wrote a
                    chronicle of the monastery and several biographies—the life of Gerhard Groot, of
                    Florentius Radewyn, of a Flemish lady St Louise, of Groot’s original disciples;
                    a number of tracts on the monastic life— <hi rend="italic">The Monk's Alphabet,
                    The Discipline of Cloisters, A Dialogue of Novices, The Life of the Good Monk,
                    The Monk's Epitaph, Sermons to Novices, Sermons to Monks, The Solitary Life, On
                    Silence, On Poverty, Humility, and Patience·,</hi> two tracts for young people—
                    <hi rend="italic">A Manual of Doctrine for the Young,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >A Manual for Children·,</hi> and books for edification— <hi rend="italic">On
                    True Compunction, The Garden of Roses, The Valley of Lilies, The Consolation of
                    the Poor and the Sick, The Faithful Dispenser, The Soul's Soliloquy, The
                    Hospital of the Poor.</hi> He has also left behind him three collections of
                    sermons, a number of letters, some hymns, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Imitatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Christi,</hi> if that be his. These writings
                    help us to see the man and his surroundings, and contemporary pious records make
                    him something more than a shadow. We see a real man, but a man helpless anywhere
                    save in the study or in the convent,—a little fresh-coloured man, with soft
                    brown eyes, who had a habit of stealing away to his cubiculum whenever the
                    conversation became too lively; somewhat bent, for it is on record that he stood
                    upright when the psalms were chanted, and even rose on his tiptoes with his face
                    turned upwards; genial, if shy, and occasionally given to punning, as when he
                    said that he preferred Psalmi to Salmones; a man who perhaps led the most placid
                    uneventful life of all men who ever wrote a book or scribbled letters. It was
                    not that he lived in uneventful times: it is impossible to select a stormier
                    period of European history, or a period when the stir of the times made its way
                    so well into the obscurest corners. Bohemia, Huss leading, was ablaze in revolt
                    at one end of Europe; France and England, then France and Burgundy, were at
                    death-grips at the other. Two popes anathematized each other from Avignon and
                    from Rome, and zealous churchmen were at their wit’s end to concoct ways and
                    means, by general councils of Constance and Basel and otherwise, to restore
                    peace to a distracted church, and to discipline the clergy into decent living.
                    But Thomas knew nothing about all this. He was intent on his copying, on his
                    little books, and on his quiet conversations. His very biographies are
                    colourless. He had not even the common interest in the little world coming up to
                    the convent gate which most monks may be supposed to have. His brethren made him
                    oeconomiae prefectus, but he was too “simple in worldly affairs” and too
                    absent-minded for the post, and so they deposed him and made him sub-prior once
                    more. And yet it is this placid kindly fresh-coloured old man who is commonly
                    said to be the author of that book the <hi rend="italic">Imitation of
                    Christ,</hi> which has been translated into more languages than any other book
                    save the Bible, and which has moved the hearts of so many men of all nations,
                    characters, and conditions of life.</p>
                <p>Did Thomas a Kempis write the <hi rend="italic">Imitation of Christ?</hi> Had it
                    not been for his connexion with this famous little book, Thomas would have been
                    no better known than Gerhard Groot, Florentius Radewyn, or Jan van Ruysbroeck.
                    The problem of authorship has given rise to the most interminable controversy
                    the history of literature has ever seen, and one which seems to be still as
                    fresh as it was in the 17th century. It arose in this way. The author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Imitatio</hi> sent it forth anonymously. If Thomas was the author
                    he must have written it when he was about forty-five years of age, and it must
                    have found its way into England and France within a very short space of time.
                    Then Thomas was a copyist, a man who spent his life in copying for sale books
                    which he had not composed. These are the only presumptions which make it likely
                    that the <hi rend="italic">Imitatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Christi</hi> had
                    another author. But down till the beginning of the 17th century Thomas was
                    almost universally esteemed the author of the <hi rend="italic">Imitatio.</hi>
                    Some MSS. undoubtedly bore the name of St Bernard, and others that of John
                    Gerson; but the great majority of MSS. testified to the authorship of Thomas. In
                    1604, however, a Spanish student of the <hi rend="italic">Imitatio</hi> found a
                    sentence from it quoted in what was believed to be a sermon of Bonaventura, who
                    died in 1273, long before either Gerson or Thomas was born. It was afterwards
                    proved that the sermon was not by Bonaventura, but belonged to the end of the
                    15th century; still for the time it was supposed that Thomas could not have
                    written the <hi rend="italic">Imitatio,</hi> and learned men looked anxiously
                    for a clue to an earlier author. Just then, in 1605, Bernardin R,ossignoli,
                    superior of the Jesuit college at Arona, discovered in the college library a MS.
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Imitatio</hi> without date, and bearing the title
                    Incipiunt capitula primi libri Abbatis Johannis Gersen, De Imitatione Christi.
                    The college had formerly belonged to the Benedictines, and it was supposed,
                    wrongly as it turned out, that the MS. had been in the old Benedictine library,
                    and was therefore ancient. Here then was an author, Gersen, and a MS. of the
                    date required. The facts were, however, that the MS. was of the beginning of the
                    16th century, and had been brought to Arona from Genoa in 1579. Constantine
                    Cajetan, famous for his insane devotion to the order of St Benedict, got the
                    Arona MS. printed at Rome, declaring that the author was John Gersen, an abbot
                    of the order of St Benedict Cajetan next discovered in a copy of the printed
                    Venice edition of the <hi rend="italic">Imitatio</hi> of 1501 a note in an
                    unknown hand: “This book was not written by John Gerson, but by John, abbot of
                    Vercelli.” He also found an MS. bearing the name of John of Canabaco. Weaving
                    these unconnected details together, Cajetan declared that the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Imitation of Christ</hi> was John Gerson of Canabaco, Benedictine
                    abbot of Vercelli. Thus began the famous controversy. It has been a controversy
                    really between the supporters of Thomas a Kempis and the Benedictines, who
                    advocate the claims of John Gersen, a mythical personage whose very existence
                    has been taken for granted and never proved. But, while this is the crux of the
                    dispute, the authorship has been claimed for a great variety of writers:—John
                    Scotus Erigena, Bernard of Clairvaux, Giovanni Gerso (an Italian monk and
                    philanthropist of the close of the 12th century), Pope Innocent III., Scoto
                    Giovanni and Thomas Gallus, both abbots of Vercelli, David of Augsburg,
                    Bonaventura, Ubertin of Cassalis, Peter de Corbario, Ludolf of Saxony, Kalkar,
                    Humbert, Martinus Carthus, Giovanni Michele, Joannes Paumerii (the last four
                    probably transcribers— their names are appended to single MSS. in an early
                    printed edition), John Gerson a brother of the famous chancellor of Paris, John
                    Gerson the famous chancellor himself, John Gersen the supposed Benedictine
                    abbot, Walter Hilton an English monk, Thomas a Kempis, John a Kempis the elder
                    brother of Thomas, and John of Canabaco, probably John of Tambacho, a professor
                    in the university of Prague. It will be sufficient to examine the claims of four
                    of these candidates.</p>
                <p>Walter Hilton, a monk of Schene (Sheen) in Surrey, who wrote several devotional
                    books, notably <hi rend="italic">Scala</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Musica Ecclesiastica,</hi> and this is
                    confirmed by Pits, who wrote much later. The earlier MSS. of the <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Imitatione</hi> are called <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Musica Ecclesiastica,</hi> and the
                    earliest English MS., now in Magdalen College, Oxford, and dated 1438, bears
                    that title. The inference has been drawn that Hilton wrote the first three books
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi> in England, and that Thomas copied them
                    and added the fourth book (see <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries,</hi> March
                    1881). We have no <hi rend="italic">contemporary</hi> evidence, however, that
                    Hilton did write a treatise called <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Musica Ecclesiastica,</hi> and this work may have been attributed to him
                    because the MS. copies have been found in volumes also containing some of his
                    devotional writings.</p>
                <p>John Gerson, chancellor of Paris (1363-1429, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gerson),</hi> is called the author of the <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi> in
                    several undated MSS., and more especially in two MSS. dated 1441 and 1460. His
                    claims have been supported on the ground of MS. evidence, the presence of
                    Gallicanisme in the Latin of the treatise, and the common tradition in France.
                    The evidence to the contrary is so strong, however, that his cause has been
                    given up by all save by Frenchmen who, like^Vert, considerit patriotic to
                    declare themselves “pour Gerson, Gerson, et pour la France.” <pb break="no"

                    the Benedictine order and by others. The first requisite here is to show that
                    such a man ever lived, and this in spite of the pains taken has not yet been
                    done.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This mythical

                    probability Gersen is a mistake of early copyists for Gersoιι. The MS. evidence
                    is as follows. The earliest <hi rend="italic">dated</hi> MS. claimed for Gersen
                    gives the author J. Gers., and is dated 1441; the second gives the author’s name
                    in the same contracted fashion, J. Gers., and is dated 1464; while two of the
                    earlier undated MSS., those of Florence and Padolirone, call the author J.
                    Gersen, chancellor of Paris. The other MSS. which write the author’s name J.
                    Gersen are all late or undated. In short, there is not a vestige of early
                    evidence to connect the <hi rend="italic">Imitatio</hi> with a John Gersen, and
                    there is no contemporary evidence whatever. Gersen is a creation of Cajetan’s
                    for the renown of the Benedictine order, and the motive which has prompted
                    Gersen’s supporters finds fitting expression in the dedication to St Benedict of

                    1880).</p>
                <p>Thomas aKempis is acknowledged to be the author by most of the earliest dated
                    MSS., by most of the earliest printed editions of the book, by a great mass of
                    contemporary evidence, and by a great deal of internal evidence, some of a most
                    interesting kind. Of MSS. may be mentioned the Kirchheim MS. of 1425, the
                    autograph of Thomas (1441), the MS. of Innersdorf (1441), and that of Liege
                    (1444). Twenty-two printed editions in the 15th century attributed the <hi
                    rend="italic">Imitatio</hi> to Thomas. The contemporary witnesses are numerous
                    and convincing. John Buschius of the canons regular of λVindes-heim, scarcely a
                    league from Mount St Agnes, who had met and conversed with Thomas, calls him the
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Imitation.</hi> Brother Herman, living in a
                    monastery of the canons regular near Halle, who had met Thomas at Windesheim,
                    declared that Thomas was the author of the <hi rend="italic">Imitatio.</hi>
                    Similar testimony is borne by Matthias Farinator, a transcriber of the book, by
                    Peter Schott, by Johann Lambert, either during the lifetime of Thomas or a few
                    years after his death. And Hirsche has produced a new contemporary witness from
                    an old Belgian chronicle (“Chronique de Jean Brandon, avec les additions
                    d’Adrien de But,” p. 547, published in <hi rend="italic">Colled,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Chroniques Belges inédites),</hi> which says that Thomas wrote
                    the <hi rend="italic">Qui sequitur</hi><hi rend="italic">me</hi> in metre. The
                    proof from internal evidence has been set on quite a fresh basis by the studies
                    of Carl Hirsche, who has discovered from a careful examination of the MS. of
                    1441 (Bibliothèque de Bourgogne, Brussels, Nos. 5855 and 5861) that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Imitation</hi> was written and pointed for the purpose of
                    chanting. This discovery has enabled him to compare the book with other writings
                    of Thomas as to punctuation, rhythm, and rhymes, with the result that he has
                    incontestably proved the great similarity between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Imitation</hi> and the undisputed works of Thomas.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Imitatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Christi</hi> is commonly
                    classed among the mystical writings of the 15th century, and in the opinion of
                    writers of the most opposite schools of thought it sums up all that is best of
                    that side of Latin Christianity which includes the theology of the Victorines,
                    of Bernard and Bonaventura, of Eckhart, Tauler, and Ruysbroeck. Mediaeval
                    Christianity shows two ideas of the Christian life struggling for the mastery,
                    each with the common watchword of separation from the world. The one was
                    modelled on Augustine’s <hi rend="italic">City of God,</hi> and was fulfilled in
                    Hildebrand’s conception of a spiritual empire to be raised on the ruins of
                    political society; the other came to light in the aspirations of Francis of
                    Assisi, and the assimilation of Anselm’s maxim that sinners can appropriate the
                    benefits won for them by Christ by imitating the Saviour. Francis’s idea of
                    imitation was rndely picturesque. The Bible shows Christ obedient, poor,
                    unmarried; we can imitate the Master by keeping the vows of obedience, poverty,
                    and chastity. This crass idea of an imitation of Christ gave new force to the
                    monastic movement, and put new meaning into its vows, and it spread in various
                    ways through Fratrice∏i, Spirituales, Wycliffe’s poor preachers, &amp;c., far
                    beyond the Franciscan order. This idea of imitation by “evangelical poverty” was
                    almost spent by the 14th century, and was succeeded by the more refined
                    conception of imitation by “renunciation,” the watchword of the mystical
                    movement of the 14th and 15th centuries. But by this time the conflict of the
                    Franciscan ideal of the Christian life with Hildebrand’s ideal had thoroughly
                    rent mediaeval Christendom, and there were two Christianities facing each other,
                    a religious and a political. The breach became wider by the degradation of the
                    papacy, and by the great schism. The “universal” of the church was lost, and had
                    not been discovered again. The new idea of obedience was not obedience to
                    ecclesiastical superiors, but the subordination of the lower part of man’s
                    nature to the higher, and of the whole to God. This “renunciation,” cut off from
                    practical sympathy with the visible church, feeding itself on a vague idea of
                    union with Christ, might easily have fallen a prey to Buddhist and Averroist
                    notions floating in the European atmosphere (some of the mystics did so fall
                    away) had it not been saved by its clinging to the sacraments, the one mediaeval
                    means of grace, and by its contact with practical Christian work. And gradually
                    out of Eckhart through Tauler two schools arose, both of which use
                    “renunciation” as their watchword—imitation by renunciation. The one school,
                    that of Henry Suso, saw Christ’s renunciation best exhibited in His passion, and
                    therefore held that men can imitate by suffering; they too have a body to
                    mortify. The other, that of Ruysbroeck, saw Christ’s renunciation in His
                    incarnation; so that men can renounce by contemplation, which gives us
                    initiation into the incarnation. Ruysbroeck was Groot’s teacher, and Groot
                    taught Thomas, in whom ∖ve see the gathered wisdom of that idea of a quest for
                    pardon by imitation of Christ which began with Anselm and came down through
                    Franciscan revivals and mystical movements to him in the 15th century. But
                    Thomas is far more than Ruysbroeck or Groot. He is wider and more sympathetic.
                    He includes Ruysbroeck, Tauler, Eckhart,Bonaventura, the Franciscans, and even
                    the old Victorines. He sums up in his little book the heart religion of Latin
                    Christianity</p>
