                <p><label type="entry">KINROSS</label>, a small inland county of Scotland, is
                    situated between 56° 8' and 56° 18' N. lat., and 3° 14' and 3° 35' W. long. It
                    is of an irregular circular form, and in outline somewhat resembles a toothed
                    wheel, lying between Perthshire on the north-west and Fife on the south-east.
                    Its breadth from west to east is about 12 miles, and its length from north to
                    south about 10 miles; the area is 49,812 acres, or about 78 square miles. Next
                    to Clackmannan it is the smallest county in Scotland.</p>
                <p>The surface consists principally of an oval and level plain, which is bounded on
                    the N.W. by the Ochils, on the E. by Bishop Hill and the Lomonds, on the S. by
                    Benarty Hill, and on the S.W. by the Cleish Hills. This plain opens out on the
                    west along the Devon valley towards Stirling, on the north-east towards the
                    valley of the Eden, and more narrowly on the south between the Cleish Hills and
                    Benarty. Kinross is touched by the river Devon at the Crook of Devon, not far
                    from the Rumbling Bridge; and the river Leven, which has its source in the loch
                    of that name, flows for about half a mile in Kinross before entering Fife. Of
                    the streams which flow into Lochleven the principal are the Gairney, the South
                    Queich, and the North <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0103-0092"/> Queich. Lochleven, the area of which has been
                    lessened by extensive reclamation works undertaken in 1826, has still a surface
                    of 3406 acres, and its trout fishing is the best of any loch in Scotland. The
                    loch contains several islands, the principal being Queen Mary’s Island, 8 acres
                    in extent, Reed Bowers, 1 acre, and the island of St Serf, 80 acres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Agriculture.—</hi> The greater part of the county
                    belongs to the upper strata of the Old Red Sandstone, but a portion in the
                    north-west to the porphyry formation of the Ochils, while on the east there is a
                    narrow boundary of the Coal-measure slightly interrupted by trap. Coal is
                    wrought in the southern part of the county, but only to a small extent;
                    limestone is very abundant, and sandstone is obtained for building purposes.</p>
                <p>The lower part of the county is generally well sheltered, and suitable for all
                    kinds of crops. In this region the soil is generally of a mossy character, but
                    when well drained and cultivated is very fertile. The eminences are devoted
                    chiefly to the pasturage of sheep and the rearing of cattle. Much land has been
                    reclaimed within recent years, and the methods of farming are now quite equal to
                    those of the most advanced districts of Scotland.</p>
                <p>A great proportion of the land is held in fee by small proprietors who farm their
                    own properties. The following table gives a classification of holdings according
                    to size in 1880 and 1875 :—</p>

                <p>According to the agricultural returns for 1881, the total area under crops was
                    31,459 acres, of which 7296 acres were under corn crops, 3698 under green crops,
                    11,348 under rotation grasses, 9100 permanent pasture, and 17 fallow. 2576 acres
                    were under woods. The percentage of cultivated area in 1870 was 67’9, and in
                    1880 it was 63 Ό. The area under permanent pasture has increased very much of
                    late years, while there is an unusually large percentage under rotation grasses.
                    5801 acres, or more than two-thirds of the area under corn crops, is occupied by
                    barley and bere, while oats had 1350 and wheat only 112 acres. Nearly the whole
                    area under green crops was occupied either by turnips and swedes or potatoes,
                    turnips and swedes having 2663 and potatoes 957 acres.</p>
                <p>The total number of horses in 1881 was 1039. Of these 699 were used solely for
                    agricultural purposes, and 340, a very large proportion, were unbroken horses or
                    mares kept solely for breeding. Cattle in 1881 numbered 5555. Milch cows
                    numbered 984, less than one-fifth of the whole. A considerable number of cattle
                    are pastured on the lowland farms. They are chiefly a native breed, which has
                    been much improved by crossing. Sheep in 1881 numbered 26,530. They are chiefly
                    pastured on the hills, but a considerable number are also wintered on the
                    lowland farms. Pigs in 1881 numbered 504.</p>
                <p>In 1872-73 the land was divided between 728 proprietors, and its gross annual
                    value was £64,671, 14s. Of the owners, 468 or 64 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    3 per cent, possessed less than 1 acre, and the average value per acre was £1,
                    8s. 10⅛⅛d. There were nine proprietors who held more than 1000 acres, the
                    largest estates being those of the Right Hon. W. P. Adam, 2869 acres, and Sir
                    Graham Montgomery, 2336.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures and Trade.—</hi> Tartan plaids, shawls, and other
                    woollen goods are manufactured at Kinross, which also possesses corn-mills and a
                    brewery. There is a large linen factory at Milnathort, as well as manufactories
                    for woollen goods.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The county sheriff courts are held
                    λveekly or fortnightly. Kinross is now joined with Clackmannan and Linlithgow in
                    one sheriffdom, and quarter sessions are held on the first Tuesday of March,
                    July, August, and October. The county unites with Clackmannan in returning a
                    member to parliament.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population. —</hi> Kinross has the smallest population of any
                    county in Scotland. From 6725 in 1801 it rose to a maximum of 9072 in 1831, from
                    which it fell in 1841 to 8763, and, although in 1851 it rose to 8924, it
                    gradually diminished till in 1871 it was 7198, while in 1881 it was 6699, of
                    whom 3112 were males and 3587 females. The principal villages are Kinross
                    (population in 1881, 1960), the capital of the county and a market-town;
                    Milnathort (1269), with linen and woollen manufactures; Kinnesswood (25θ); and a
                    portion of Kelty, the remaindex being in Fife.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> The early history of
                    Kinross-shire is given in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Fife.</hi> There are
                    traces of an ancient fort or camp on the top of the hill of Dumglow in the
                    parish of Cleish, and a remarkable cairn called Cairn-a-vain on a hill on the
                    northern boundary of the parish of Orwell, in the centre of which a rude stone
                    cist was discovered with an urn full of bones and charcoal. In 1857 a hoard of
                    seven hundred Roman coins was dug up in the vicinity of the county town. The
                    priory of Portmoak, properly situated on the island of St Serf in Lochleven,
                    although the prior and canons often resided at Kinnesswood, was originally the
                    oldest Culdee establishment in Scotland,—being a gift of the Pictish kings after
                    their conversion. Some time before 961 it was made over to the bishop of St
                    Andrews, and shortly after 1144 a body of canons regular was established in it
                    in connexion with the priory of canons regular established in that year at St
                    Andrews. The castle of Lochleven was a royal residence as far back as 1257. In
                    it Archibald, earl of Douglas, was imprisoned in 1429, and Queen Mary from June
                    16th 1567 to May 2d 1568. A short distance north-east of Kinross stands the
                    ruined castle of Burleigh.</p>
