                    (1718-1783), an eminent Hebraist, was born at Totnes, Devonshire, on April 4,
                    1718. His father was parish clerk and master of a charity school, in which
                    latter situation Benjamin was chosen to succeed him at an early age. His talents
                    and acquirements interested some rich friends in his behalf, and by their
                    liberality he was provided with the means of studying at Oxford. Entering
                    himself of Wadham College in 1744, he soon distinguished himself in Hebrew and
                    divinity; and while still an undergraduate published two dissertations, <hi
                        rend="italic">On the Tree of Life in Paradise, with some Observations on the
                        Pall of Man,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">On the Oblations of Cain and
                        Abel,</hi> which came to a second edition in 1747, and procured him the
                    honour of a bachelor’s degree before the statutable time. Shortly afterwards he
                    was elected fellow of Exeter College, and in 1750 he took his degree of M.A. In
                    1767 he was appointed keeper of the Radcliffe library, and made D.D. He was also
                    canon of Christ Church and rector of Culham in Oxfordshire, and was subsequently
                    presented to the living of Mynhenyote, Cornwall, which however, being unable to
                    visit it, he resigned two years before his death. He died of a lingering illness
                    at Oxford, on September 18, 1783.</p>
                <p>The great work with which his name continues to be associated in the annals of
                    Biblical scholarship is the <hi rend="italic">Vetus</hi><hi rend="italic"

                        >cum</hi><hi rend="italic">variis Lectionibus,</hi> 2 vols, fol., Oxford,
                    1776-80. The course of the studies which resulted in it may be gathered from the
                    nature of the publications by which it was preceded. Two dissertations entitled
                        <hi rend="italic">The State of the Printed Hebrew Text of the Old Testament
                        considered,</hi> published respectively in 1753 and 1759, were expressly
                    designed to combat the then curremt ideas as to the “absolute integrity” of the
                    received Hebrew text. The first contains “a comparison of 1 Chrom xi. with 2
                    Sam. v. and xxiii., and observations on seventy MSS., with an extract of
                    mistakes and various readings”; the second defends the claims of the Samaι <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> itan Pentateuch, assails the correctness of the
                    printed copies of the Chaldee paraphrase, gives an account of Hebrew MSS. of the
                    Bible known to be extant, and catalogues one hundred MSS. preserved in the
                    British Museum and in the libraries of Oxford and Cambridge. His labours
                    provoked severe animadversion in some quarters, and even from such men as
                    Warburton and Home; but they at least had the effect of drawing public attention
                    to the subject to which they related, and in 1760 he issued his proposals for
                    collecting all Hebrew MSS. of date prior to the invention of printing which
                    could be discovered either at home or abroad. Subscriptions to the amount of
                    nearly £10,000 were obtained, and many learned men addressed themselves to the
                    work of collation, Bruns of Helmstadtmaking himself specially useful as regarded
                    MSS. in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. Between 1760 and 1769 ten “annual
                    accounts” of the progress of the work were given; in its course six hundred and
                    fifteen MSS. and fifty-two printed editions of the Bible were either wholly or
                    partially collated, and use wasalso made (butoften veryperfunctorily) of the
                    quotations in the Talmud. The materials "thus collected, when properly arranged
                    and made ready for the press, extended to 30 vols. fol. The text finally
                    followed in printing was that of Van der Hooght,—unprinted however, the points
                    having been disregarded in collation,—and the various readings were printed at
                    the foot of the page. The Samaritan Pentateuch stands alongside the Hebrew in
                    parallel columns. The <hi rend="italic">Dissertatio Generalis,</hi> appended to
                    the second volume, contains an account of the MSS. and other authorities
                    collated, and also a review of the Hebrew text, divided into periods, and
                    beginning with the formation of the Hebrew canon after the return of the Jews
                    from the exile. Kennicott’s greatwork was in one sense a failure. It yielded no
                    materials of value for the emendation of the received text, and by disregarding
                    the vowel points overlooked the one thing in which some result (grammatical if
                    not critical) might have been derived from collation of Massoretic MSS. But the
                    negative result of the publication and of the <hi rend="italic">Variae</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Lectiones</hi> of De Rossi, published some years later, was
                    important. It showed that the Hebrew text can be amended only by the use of the
                    versions aided by conjecture.</p>
