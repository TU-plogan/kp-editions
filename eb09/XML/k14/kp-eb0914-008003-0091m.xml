                    of Linnaeus, and the <hi rend="italic">Tyrannus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >carolineηsis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">T. pipiri</hi> of most later writers, a
                    common and characteristic inhabitant of North America, ranging as high as 57° N.
                    lat. or further, and westward to the Rocky Mountains, beyond which it goes to
                    Oregon, Washington Territory, and British Columbia, though apparently not
                    occurring in California. In Canada and the northern States of the Union it is a
                    summer visitor, wintering in the south, but also reaching Cuba; and, passing
                    through Central America, it has been found in Bolivia and eastern Peru. Both the
                    scientific and common names of this species are taken from the way in which the
                    cock will at times assume despotic authority over other birds, attacking them
                    furiously as they fly, and forcing them to divert or altogether desist from
                    their course. Yet it is love of his mate or his young that prompts this
                    bellicose behaviour, for it is only in the breeding season that he indulges in
                    it; but then almost every large bird that approaches his nest, from an Eagle
                    downwards, is assaulted, and those alone that possess greater command of flight
                    can escape from his repeated charges, which are accompanied <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0092-0081"/> by loud and shrill cries. Ou these occasions it
                    may be that the King-bird displays the emblem of his dignity, which is commonly
                    concealed; for, being otherwise rather plainly coloured—dark ashy-grey above and
                    white beneath —the erectile feathers of the crown of the head, on being parted,
                    form as it were a deep furrow, and reveal their base, which is of a bright
                    golden-orange in front, deepening into scarlet, and then passing into
                    silvery-white. This species seems to live entirely on insects, which it captures
                    on the wing, and is in bad repute with bee-masters,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is called in some parts the
                    Bee-Martin.</p></note> though, according to Dr Coues, it “destroys a thousand
                    noxious insects for every bee it eats.” It builds, often in an exposed
                    situation, a rather large nest, coarsely constructed outside, but neatly lined
                    with fine roots or grasses, and lays five or six eggs of a pale salmon colour,
                    beautifully marked with blotches and spots of purple, brown, and orange,
                    generally disposed in a zone near the larger end.</p>
                <p>Nearly akin to the King-bird is the Petchary or Chicheree, so called from its
                    loud and petulant cry, <hi rend="italic">T. dominicensis,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">T. griseus,</hi> one of the most characteristic and conspicuous
                    birds of the West Indies, and the earliest to give notice of the break of day.
                    In habits, except that it eats a good many berries, it is the very counterpart
                    of its congener, and is possibly even more jealous of any intruder. At all
                    events its pugnacity extends to animals from which it could not possibly receive
                    any harm, and is hardly limited to any season of the year.</p>
                <p>In several respects both of these birds, with several of their allies, resemble
                    some of the Shrikes; but it must be clearly understood that the likeness is but
                    of analogy, and that there is no near affinity between the two Families <hi
                    rend="italic">Laniidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tyrannidae,</hi> which belong
                    to wholly distinct sections of the great Passerine Order; and, while the former
                    is a comparatively homogeneous group, much diversity of form and habits is found
                    among the latter. Similarly many of the smaller <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tyrannidae</hi> bear some analogy to certain <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muscicapidae,</hi> with which they were at one time confounded (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Flycatcher,</hi> vol. ix. p. 351); but the difference between
                    them is deep seated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This is not the place to dwell upon the essential nature of the difference;
                    but two easy modes of discriminating them externally may be mentioned. All the
                    <hi rend="italic">Laniidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Muscicapidae</hi> have but
                    <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> primary guides in their wings, and their tarsi are
                    covered with scales in front only; while in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tyrannidae</hi> there are <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> primaries, and the tarsal
                    scales extend the whole way round. The more recondite distinction in the
                    structure of the trachea seems to have been first detected by Macgillivray, who
                    wrote the anatomical descriptions published in 1839 by Audubon <hi rend="italic"
                    >(On. Biography,</hi> v. pp. 421, 422); but its value was not appreciated till
                    the publication of Johannes Miiller’s classical treatise on the vocal organs of
                    Passerine Birds <hi rend="italic">{Abhandl. k. Akad. Wissmsch. Berlin,</hi>
                    1845, pp. 321, 405).</p></note> Nor is this all, for out of the seventy genera,
                    or thereabouts, into which the <hi rend="italic">Tyrannidae</hi> have been
                    divided, comprehending perhaps three hundred and fifty species, all of which are
                    peculiar to the New World, a series of forms can be selected which find a kind
                    of parallel to a series of forms to be found in the other group of <hi
                    rend="italic">Passeres</hi>; and the genus <hi rend="italic">Tyrannus,</hi>
                    though that from which the Family is named, is by no means a fair representative
                    of it; but it would be hard to say which genus should be so accounted. The birds
                    of the genus <hi rend="italic">Muscisaxicola</hi> have the habits and almost the
                    appearance of Wheatears; the genus <hi rend="italic">Alectorurus</hi> calls to
                    mind a Water-Wagtail; <hi rend="italic">Euscarthmus</hi> may suggest a Titmouse,
                    <hi rend="italic">Elaiηea</hi> perhaps a Willow-Wren; but the greatest number of
                    forms have no analogous bird of the Old World with which they can be compared;
                    and, while the combination of delicate beauty and peculiar external form
                    possibly attains its utmost in the long-tailed <hi rend="italic">Milvulus,</hi>
                    the glory of the Family may be said to culminate in the king of King-birds, <hi
                    rend="italic">Muscivvra regia.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
