                    elaborate one, was received partly in her father’s house and partly in Paris.
                    While still very young she was married to the Baron von Krüdener, a Russian
                    diplomatist twenty years her senior, whom she accompanied to Copenhagen and
                    subsequently to Venice; the union did not prove a very happy one, and for some
                    years the couple lived apart. It is understood that <hi rend="italic"
                    >Valérie,</hi> published by Madame Krüdener in 1804, is to a considerable extent
                    an autobiography of this period of her life; if this be so, it is impossible to
                    exonerate her of all blame for the domestic misfortunes which befel her. After
                    the death of her husband she resided for some time in Paris, mingling freely
                    with a large and brilliant social circle, but afterwards she retired to her
                    property in Livonia, where her sense of the vanity of earthly things gradually
                    deepened, and religious yearnings were quickened which ultimately found
                    satisfaction in the doctrine and worship of the Moravian community. In 1808 she
                    sιw much of Jung Stilling at Carlsruhe and of Oberlin in Steinthal; and the
                    religious convictions now formed were held by her with such earnestness that she
                    felt constrained to adopt the vocation of an itinerant preacher. Her obvious
                    sincerity, her culture and refinement, her social standing, enabled her to
                    attract considerable notice throughout Baden, in Strasburg, and in Switzerland,
                    especially in Geneva; and at Heilbronn in 1815 she could reckon even an emperor
                    (Alexander I. of Russia) among her attentive hearers. Her activity, however,
                    which was hardly favourable to established church order, soon became distasteful
                    to the authorities, and, after being invited to withdraw from more than one
                    German state, she again retired into private life on her estate in 1818. Led by
                    her enthusiasm of humanity to St Petersburg, she was dismissed by the emperor
                    for having declared her sympathy for the struggling cause of Greece. Ill health
                    now came upon her, and she was advised by her physicians to seek a warmer
                    climate. On the southward journey she died at Karasu-Bazar on December 25, 1824.
