                <p><label type="entry">KARATEGIN</label>, a country of Central Asia, now subject to
                    Bokhara, consisting of a highland district between the Hissar and the Darwaz
                    chains. It is bounded on the N. by the Russian province of Ferghana (Khokand),
                    on the E. by Kashgar, on the S. by independent Darwaz, and on the W. by Hissar
                    and other Bokharian provinces. The plateau is traversed by the Surkhab or Kyzyl
                    Su, a right-hand tributary of the Oxus, which rises in the Alai mountains, and
                    for the first 132 miles of its course “runs through gorges of extreme wildness.”
                    Below the hamlet of Khantia-hota (according to Abramof), the valley widens
                    considerably, and at Sar-i-pul, the only point where it is crossed by a bridge,
                    the river has a depth of 7 feet. With the neighbouring lands Karategin has no
                    communication except during summer, that is, from May to September. The winter
                    climate is extremely severe even in the more populous districts; the snow begins
                    to fall in October, and it is May before it disappears. During the warmer
                    months, however, the mountain sides are richly clothed with the foliage of
                    maple, mountain ash, apple, pear, and walnut trees; the orchards furnish, not
                    only apples and pears, but peaches, cherries, mulberries, and apricots; and the
                    farmers grow so much corn that the surplus is a regular article of export to the
                    neighbouring states. Every householder has a portion of the soil which he can
                    call his own; but if he leave it fallow for more than three years in succession,
                    he runs the risk of having it confiscated by the Government. Some proprietors
                    possess as much as from 300 to 500 acres, and keep from ten to twelve yoke of
                    work oxen and from six to twelve labourers. The necessity of storing fodder to
                    last for five months tends to keep low the number of domestic cattle. Both
                    cattle and horses are of a small and hardy breed. The wild animals—bears,
                    wolves, foxes, jackals, lynxes, martens, otters, &amp;c.—are of no small
                    economic importance; but the hunters and trappers are obliged to sell their
                    pelts to the Government at half the market price. Rough woollen cloth and mohair
                    are woven by the natives during their long winter; and they make excellent
                    firearms and other weapons. Trade is still carried on by barter, there being
                    neither coinage nor fixed market-place in the country. Foreign wares—iron,
                    cotton, silk, combs, mirrors, soap, &amp;c.—are introduced by merchants from
                    Kashgar and Hissar, who receive in exchange mainly cattle, hides, and skins.
                    Gold, however, is found in various places, more particularly at Sarym Saly
                    (according to Abramof); and there are salt-pits in the mountains near
                    Langar-sha. The chief town, Harm or Gharm, is a place of some eight hundred
                    houses (Arandarenko says three hundred and forty) situated on a hill on the
                    right bank of the Surkhab. With the exception of about five thousand tents of
                    nomadizing Kirghiz, the inhabitants of Karategin are understood to be
                    Galtchas—by some identified with, by others distinguished from the Tadjiks. They
                    speak a Persian dialect and profess the Mohammedan faith. Schuyler, who met with
                    some of them at Khokand, describes the Karateginese as swarthy, thickset,
                    good-natured fellows, who, gathered in a circle, would after prayers and supper
                    tell tale after tale and legend after legend till they dropped off to sleep. It
                    is calculated that the settled population of Karategin may amount to about
                    382,000 souls, the number of households being 36,672, distributed among four
                    hundred settlements.</p>
                <p>Karategin has hardly been touched by European exploration (the first expedition
                    was that of Oshanin in 1878); and of its history almost nothing is known. The
                    native princes or shahs, who claimed to be descended from Alexander the Great,
                    were till 1868 practically independent, and kept up a considerable degree of
                    state. Their allegiance was indeed claimed in an ineffective way by Khokand, but
                    eventually Bokhara took advantage of intestine feuds to secure their real
                    submission. Some geographers (Kiepert, for example) have been disposed to
                    recognize in Karategin the Paraetaceni of Alexander’s historians, and Colonel
                    Yule has conjecturally identified it with the Holumo (Garma ?) of Hwen
                    Tsang.</p>
