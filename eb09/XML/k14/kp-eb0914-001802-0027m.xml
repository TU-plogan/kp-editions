                    several varieties are also cultivated by the natives, those growing in a dry
                    soil being considered to be the most active.. To prepare the liquid the fresh
                    roots or leaves, after being chewed by young girls or boys, with good teeth,
                    clean mouths, and free from colds, are placed in a large wooden bowl (“umete”)
                    on three legs made of the wood of the vesi <hi rend="italic">(Afzelia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bijuga,</hi> Gray), and water or cocoa-nut milk poured over the
                    mass. The liquid is then stirred up, and the woody matter of the root is removed
                    by repeatedly drawing through the infusion long fibres prepared by crushing the
                    green stems of the vau <hi rend="italic">{Hibiscus,</hi> sp.), and passing them
                    frequently between two pieces of wood. By this means a muddy-looking liquid
                    resembling <hi rend="italic">café au lait</hi> in appearance, or of a greenish
                    hue if made from the leaves, is left in the bowl, a quantity of faecula
                    remaining suspended in the fluid. The drink is then distributed into cups made
                    of plantain leaves, by dipping some of the vau fibre into it and squeezing the
                    liquid into the cups, which are handed to the individuals present. As the
                    process of infusion only takes about twenty minutes, it is obvious that no
                    fermentation can take place. The taste of the liquid is at first sweet and then
                    pungent and acrid. The usual dose is half a cupful, equal to about two mouthfuls
                    of the root Intoxication follows in about twenty minutes, or immediately if
                    twice the usual quantity be taken.</p>
                <p>The drunkenness produced by kava differs from that of alcohol in being of a
                    melancholy, silent, and drowsy character, accompanied, if the drink be made from
                    roots growing in a damp soil, with great irritability at the slightest noise.
                    The fit lasts for about two hours, but in persons who only take it occasionally
                    it may continue for six or twelve hours. At Nukahiva kava is said to be used as
                    a daily beverage, probably in small quantities,—its use, however, being
                    forbidden to women and children. In many of the Pacific islands kava is given at
                    official receptions, being the offered and accepted token of hospitality.
                    Formerly the drinking of it preceded warlike enterprises and religious
                    festivals.</p>
                <p>The daily use of the drug is sometimes followed by a kind of skin disease, called
                    in Tahiti “arevareva.” The effect on those who are addicted to the use of kava
                    for any length of time is to produce obscurity of vision, red conjunctiva, and
                    yellow coloration of the teeth, while the skin where thick becomes dry, scaly,
                    cracked, and ulcerated, and the body becomes emaciated and decrepit. In Nukahiva
                    it is given as a medicine in phthisis and in bronchitis, a small dose being
                    taken before going to bed.</p>
                <p>Mr Collie, surgeon to the ship “Blossom,” states that he observed the infusion of
                    the root to be useful in certain skin diseases (Beachy, <hi rend="italic">Voyage
                    of the “Blossom,”</hi> vol. ii. p. 120). Some years ago it was introduced into
                    France as a remedy for various diseases of the mucous membranes <hi
                    rend="italic">{Annal.</hi><hi rend="italic">de Therap.,</hi> 1857, p. 61), and
                    it has also been recommended in gout <hi rend="italic">{Med. Times and
                    Gazette,</hi> 1856, p. 591).</p>
                <p>The root contains an essential oil of a yellow colour and agreeable odour, 2 per
                    cent, of a balsamic resin called kawin, and about 49 per cent, of starch, also a
                    neutral crystalline principle discovered in 1844 by Mr J. R. N. Morson, and
                    called <hi rend="italic">kavahiηe,</hi> or by Gobley <hi rend="italic"
                    >methysticin.</hi> It is readily soluble in boiling alcohol, crystallizing out
                    on cooling. Hydrochloric acid colours it red, this colour changing to yellow on
                    exposure on the air; concentrated sulphuric acid changes it to a rich purple
                    violet, which on exposure to the air gradually becomes green, or immediately if
                    diluted with water. These tests distinguish it from cubebin and piperin.</p>

                <p>K AVAL A, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Cavallo,</hi> a walled town of European Turkey
                    in the vilayet of Saloniki, situated on a promontory stretching southwards into
                    the bay of Kavala, opposite the island of Thaso. Numerous Roman remains have
                    been found in the neighbourhood, of which the chief is the large aqueduct on two
                    tiers of arches, which still serves to supply the town and dilapidated citadel
                    with water from Mount Pangeus. Kavala has a port on each side of its promontory,
                    and exports cotton and tobacco. The Turkish college <pb break="no"

                    was born in the town in 1769. The population is about 5000.</p>
                <p>Kavala has been identified with Neapolis, at which St Paul landed on his way from
                    Samothrace to Philippi, 10 miles to the north (Acts xvi. 11). Neapolis was the
                    port of Philippi, as Kavala now is of Seres; and in the bay on which it stands
                    the fleet of Brutus and Cassius was moored during the battle of Philippi. Some
                    authorities identify Neapolis with Datum (∆ατov), mentioned by Herodotus as
                    famous for its gold mines.</p>
