                    born in Ludwigsburg, Wurtemberg, on the 18th of September 1786. He received his
                    early education in the Latin school of Ludwigsburg and in the cloister school of
                    Maulbronn. After the death of his father, who was an upper bailiff and
                    government councillor in Ludwigsburg, Kerner was obliged to accept a position in
                    a cloth manufactory; but in 1804, aided by Pastor Conz, who had some reputation
                    as a poet, he was able to enter the university of Tübingen, where he studied
                    medicine. At Tübingen he made the acquaintance of Uhland, who was about his own
                    age; and the two young men encouraged each other in their first efforts in
                    poetry. Having completed his studies in 1809, Kerner spent some time in travel.
                    In 1815 he received a medical appointment in Gaildorf, and in 1819 was
                    transferred to Weinsberg, where he spent the rest of his life. Weinsberg is a
                    pretty little town in Würtemberg, and was formerly a free imperial city. Here
                    the emperor Conrad III. is said tc have besieged the castle of Count Welf; and,
                    according to the well-known legend, the women, having obtained permission to
                    retire with their most valuable possessions, stumbled out, each with her husband
                    on her back. Kerner built a house under the shadow of the castle
                    (“Weibertreue”); and through his exertions measures were taken for the
                    preservation of the ruins and the laying out of the surrounding grounds in
                    public gardens. He also occupied himself with the history of the town, and
                    published a work in two volumes describing <hi rend="italic">The Storming of
                    Weinsberg Tn</hi> 1525. He was troubled with an affection of the eyes, and
                    becoming almost blind he resigned his office and medical practice in 1851. He
                    died on the 21st of February 1862. Kerner takes rank as one of the best of the
                    Swabian school of poets, who had in some respects a close affinity to the
                    Romantic school, but aimed at greater simplicity and clearness.</p>
                <p>He attracted attention by his <hi rend="italic">Reiseschatten von dem
                    Schattenspieler</hi> 7λ∞(1811), and co-operated with Uhland, Schwab, and other
                    writers in producing the <hi rend="italic">Poetischer Almanach</hi> (1812) and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Deutscher Dichterwald</hi> (1813). In 1826 he issued a
                    collection of his poems, to which he added many new lyrics in subsequent
                    editions. He also published two other volumes of poetry, <hi rend="italic">Der
                    letzte Blütenstrauss</hi> (1852) and <hi rend="italic">Winterblüten</hi> (1859).
                    His lyrics are remarkable for the intermingling of quaint humour and delicate
                    pathos, while in his ballads, which are written with great spirit and in a
                    thoroughly popular tone, he prefers to represent such scenes of horror and
                    mystery as the romantic school delighted in. He devoted much study to abnormal
                    conditions of the brain, and wrote several popular works on animal magnetism and
                    kindred subjects. Of more importance than these labours were his investigations
                    on the influence of sebacic acid on animal organisms, and his work <hi

                    rend="italic">Wurtemberg.</hi> In his <hi rend="italic">Bilderbuch aus
                    meiner</hi><hi rend="italic">Kndbenzeit</hi> he gave a vivid and interesting
                    description of the circumstances of his youth. See K. Mayer in <hi rend="italic"
