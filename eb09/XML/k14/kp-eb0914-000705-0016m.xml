                    long., 4043 English feet above the sea-level. It consists of two towns, Kuhna
                    Shahr or “old city,” and Yangi Shahr or “new city,” about 5 miles apart, and
                    separated from one another by the Kizil Su, a tributary of the Tarim river,
                    which receives and deposits in the distant lake Lob Nor the drainage of the vast
                    semi-desert plain included between the Kuen-lun, Thian Shan, and Pamir
                    mountains. Situated at the junction of routes from the valley of the Oxus, from
                    Khokand and Samarkand, Almati, Aksu, and Khotan, the last two leading from China
                    and India, Kashgar has been noted from very early times as a political and
                    commercial centre. Like all other cities of Central Asia, it has changed hands
                    repeatedly, but its greatest modern prominence is probably due to its having
                    formed a few years ago the seat of government of the Amir Yakub Beg, surnamed
                    the Atalik Ghazi, who established and for a brief period ruled with remarkable
                    success a Mohammedan state comprising the chief cities of the Tarim basin from
                    Turfan round along the skirt of the mountains to Khotan. During his rule both
                    Russian and British missions visited Kashgar, and it is chiefly to this
                    circumstance that we are indebted for a full and tolerably recent knowledge
                    thereof. Kuhna Shahr is a small fortified city on high ground overlooking the
                    river Tuman. Its walls are lofty and supported by buttress bastions with
                    loopholed turrets at intervals; the fortifications, however, are but of hard
                    clay, and are much out of repair. The city contains about 2500 houses. Beyond
                    the bridge, a little way off, are the ruins of ancient Kashgar, which once
                    covered a large extent of country on both sides of the Tuman, and the walls of
                    which even now are 12 feet wide at the top and twice that in height. This
                    city—Aski Shahr as it is now called—was destroyed in 1514 by Mirza Ababakar on
                    the approach of Sultan Said Khan’s invading army. About 2 miles to the north
                    beyond the river is the shrine of Hazrat Afak, the saint king of the country,
                    who died and was buried here in 1693. It is a handsome mausoleum faced with blue
                    and white glazed tiles, standing under the shade of some magnificent silver
                    poplars. About it Yakub Beg erected a commodious college, mosque, and monastery,
                    the whole being surrounded by rich orchards, fruit gardens, and vineyards. The
                    Yangi Shahr of Kashgar is, as its name implies, quite modern, having been built
                    in 1838. It is of oblong shape running north and south, and is entered by a
                    single gateway. The walls are lofty and massive, and topped by turrets, while on
                    each side is a projecting bastion to protect <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n17/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0017-0008"/> the curtains by a flank fire. The whole is
                    surrounded by a deep and wide ditch, which can be filled from the river, at the
                    risk, however, of bringing down the whole structure, for the walls are of mud,
                    and stand upon a porous sandy soil In the time of the Chinese, before Yakub
                    Beg’s sway, Yangι Shahr held a garrison of six thousand men, and was the
                    residence of the <hi rend="italic">amban</hi> or governor. Yakub erected his <hi
                    rend="italic">orda</hi> or palace on the site of the amban’s residence, and two
                    hundred ladies of his harem occupied a commodious enclosure hard by. The mixture
                    of the various types seen in the markets of Kashgar has struck more than one
                    traveller. A square-faced flat-nosed Calmuck, with high cheek bones and a ruddy
                    hairless countenance, stands next to an Afghan of gigantic proportions, with
                    nut-brown complexion, handsome features, and glossy black beard, while one’s eye
                    rests next on the fair, full face and Dutch built frame of the Andijani, who is
                    jostled in turn by the familiar black-skinned and oily-faced Hindustani
                    Mussulman, the muddy-complexioned opium-smoking Chinaman, and the brown-skinned
                    bewhiskered and gentle-looking Badakshi, with high full forehead, long arched
                    finely carved nose and oval face of the true Aryan stamp. The population of
                    Kashgar at the time of the visit of Sir Douglas Forsyth’s mission in 1873 was
                    about 112,000.</p>
                <p>With the overthrow of the Chinese rule in 1865 the manufacturing industries of
                    Kashgar declined, and in the case of some of the profitable arts altogether
                    disappeared. Silk culture and carpet manufacture have flourished for ages at
                    Khotan, and the products always find a ready sale at Kashgar. Other manufactures
                    consist of a strong coarse cotton cloth called <hi rend="italic">kham</hi>
                    (which forms the dress of the common people, and for winter wear is padded with
                    cotton and quilted), boots and shoes, saddlery, felts, furs and sheep skins made
                    up into cloaks, and various articles of domestic use. A curious street sight in
                    Kashgar is presented by the hawkers of meat pies, pastry, and sweetmeats, which
                    they trundle about on hand-barrows just as their counterparts do in Europe;
                    while the knife-grinder’s cart, and the vegetable seller with his tray or basket
                    on his head, recall exactly similar itinerant traders further west.</p>
                <p>The earliest mention of Kashgar of which we have any authentic record is during
                    the second period of ascendency of the Han dynasty, when the Chinese general
                    Pan-Shan conquered and wrested from the hands of their masters the Hiungnu,
                    Yutien (Khotau), Sulei (Kashgar), and a group of states in the Tarim basin
                    almost up to the foot of the Thian Shan mountains. This happened in 76 B. c.,
                    about the time that the Chinese and Roman empires attained their furthest
                    expansion of dominion westward and eastward respectively, and were separated
                    only by the breadth of the Caspian. Kashgar lies in the country which Ptolemy
                    calls Scythia beyond the Imaus; in this he has a <hi rend="italic">Kαsiα
                    Regiο,</hi> possibly exhibiting the name whence Kashgar is formed. Next ensues a
                    long epoch of obscurity. The Chinese lost their hold over the western provinces,
                    and Ptolemy found no successor to continue his investigations into the countries
                    of the far East. In 634 Tai-tsung re-established Chinese sway over eastern
                    Turkestan and Sulei (Kashgar), and other places were converted into garrison
                    towns. It was shortly after this that Hwen Tsang passed through Kashgar (which
                    he calls Kie-sha) on his return journey from India to China. The Buddhist
                    religion, then fast decaying in India, was working its way to a new growth in
                    China, and contemporaneously the Nestorian Christians were establishing
                    bishoprics at Herat, Merv, and Samarkand, whence they subsequently proceeded to
                    Kashgar, and finally to China itself. In the 8th century came the Arab invasion
                    from the west, and we find Kashgar and Turkestan lending assistance to the
                    reigning queen of Bokhara, to enable her to repel the enemy. But although the
                    Mohammedan religion from the very commencement sustained checks, it nevertheless
                    made its weight felt upon the independent states of Turkestan to the north and
                    cast, and thus acquired a steadily growing, influence, which, aided as it was
                    through the channels of trade, facilitated the spread of the faith, and brought
                    it into serious collision with the Chinese religion, a struggle which has
                    endured down to our day, and can by no means be said to be unlikely to recur. It
                    was not, however, till the close of the 10th century that Islam was established
                    at Kashgar, when a prince of the hereditary family of Bughra Khan became a
                    convert thereto, and enforced it upon his subjects at the point of the sword.
                    After an interval, during which the Kara Khitai, a nomad race from the
                    north-east under rulers called the Gur Khans, became suzerains of Kashgar, the
                    growing power of Jenghiz Khan began to overspread the Kashgar borders. This
                    great conqueror in the space of six years overran the entire country from
                    Azerbijan on the west to the Indus on the east, and from the steppes of Kipchak
                    on the north to Seistan on the south, laying waste and butchering with a
                    ferocity which is said to have left its traces for centuries after. The invasion
                    of Jenghiz Khan had given a decided check to the progress of the Mohammedan
                    creed, but on his death, and during the rule of the Chaghatai Khans, who became
                    converts to that faith, Islam began to reassert its ascendency. In 1389-90 Timur
                    the Mughal undertook a campaign for the conquest of Moghulistan, and one of his
                    armies ravaged Kashgar, Andijan, and the intervening country. Moghulistan was at
                    this time under the governorship of Khudadail, a beneficent and popular ruler,
                    who at a later date entertained the famous embassy sent from Shah Rukh to the
                    emperor of China. Kashgar next passed through a troublous time, and in 1514, on
                    the invasion of the Khan Sultan Said, was destroyed by Mirza Ababakar, who with
                    the aid of ten thousand men built the new fort with massive defences higher up
                    on the banks of the Tuman. The dynasty of the Chaghatai Khans collapsed in 1572
                    by the dismemberment of the country between rival representatives; and soon
                    after two powerful Khojah factions, the White and Black Mountaineers <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ak</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kara Taghluk),</hi> arose, whose
                    dissensionsand warfares, with the intervention of the Calmucks of Zungaria, fill
                    up the history till 1759, when a Chinese army from Hi invaded the country, and,
                    after perpetrating wholesale massacres, finally consolidated their authority by
                    settling therein Chinese emigrants, together with a Manehu garrison. The Chinese
                    had thoughts of pushing their conquests towards western Turkestan and Samarkand,
                    the chiefs of which sent to ask assistance of the Afghan king Ahmed Shah. This
                    monarch despatched an embassy to Peking to demand the restitution of the
                    Mohammedan states of Central Asia, but the embassy was not well received, and
                    Ahmed Shah was too much engaged with the Sikhs to attempt to enforce his demands
                    by arms. The Chinese continued to hold Kashgar, with sundry interruptions from
                    Mohammedan revolts,—one of the most serious occurring in 1827, when the
                    territory was invaded and the city taken by Jahanghir Khojah; Chang-lung,
                    however, the Chinese general of Hi, recovered possession of Kashgar and the
                    other revolted cities in 1828. A revolt in 1829 under Mohammed Air Khan and
                    Yusuf, brother of Jahanghir, was more successful, and resulted in the concession
                    of several important trade privileges to the Mohammedans of the district of Alty
                    Shahr (the “six cities”), as it was then named. Until 1846 the country enjoyed
                    peace under the just and liberal rule of Zahir-ud-din, the Chinese governor, but
                    in that year a fresh Khojah revolt under Kath Tora led to his making himself
                    master of the city, with circumstances of unbridled licence and oppression. His
                    reign was, however, brief, for at the end of seventy-five days, on the approach
                    of the Chinese, he fled back to Khokand amid the jeers of the inhabitants. The
                    last of the Khojah revolts (1857) was of about equal duration with the previous
                    one, and took place unde r Wali-Khan, a degraded debauchee, and the murderer of
                    the lamented traveller Adolf Schlagintweit. The great Tungani revolt, or
                    insurrection of the Chinese Mohammedans, which broke out in 1862 in Kansuh,
                    spread rapidly to Zungaria and through the line of towns in the Tarim basin. The
                    Tungani troops in Yarkand rose, and (10th August 1863) massacred some seven
                    thousand Chinese, while the inhabitants of Kashgar, rising in their turn against
                    their masters, invoked the aid of Sadik Beg, a Kirghiz chief, who was reinforced
                    by Buzurg Khan, the heir of Jahanghir, and Yakub Beg, his general, these being
                    despatched at Sadik’s request by the ruler of Khokand to raise what troops they
                    could to aid his Mohammedan friends in Kashgar. Sadik Beg soon repented of
                    having asked for a Khojah, and eventually marched against Kashgar, which by this
                    time had succumbed to Buzurg Khan and Yakub Beg, but was defeated and driven
                    back to Khokand. Buzurg Khan delivered himself up to indolence and debauchery,
                    but Yakub Beg, with singular energy and perseverance, made himself master of
                    Yangi Shahr, Yangi-Hissar, Yarkand, and other towns, and eventually became sole
                    master of the country, Buzurg Khan proving himself totally unfitted for the post
                    of ruler. Kashgar and the other cities of the Tarim basin remained under Yakub
                    Beg’s rule until 1877, when the Chinese regained possession of their ancient
                    dominions after a campaign which, originally organized years before, and
                    conducted in tne most leisurely fashion, was characteristic of the measured
                    tenacity and resolution with which this nation follow up a settled policy. Since
                    the reoccupation of the country by the Chinese, trade has much declined,
                    especially with India, this traffic being regarded as illegal by the Chinese
                    authorities. Heavy exactions are made for military purposes, and considerable
                    emigration has taken place to Ladak and India. (C. E. D. B.)</p>
