                    but by the treaty of that date they were all recognized as Japanese. The
                    principal islands, beginning at the north, are Shumshu (226 square miles),
                    Paramushir (1135), Onekotan (244), Kharimkotan, Si Musir (161), Matua, Urup
                    (563), Iturup (2656), and Kunashir. Like the peninsula of Kamchatka, the whole
                    chain is of volcanic origin, and several of the islands—Yekarma, Musir, Raikoke,
                    Matua, Iturup—are still centres of volcanic activity. Mr Milne, who cruised
                    among the islands in 1878, counted fifty-two well-defined volcanic peaks, and at
                    least seventeen are known to give off steam. The peak of the island of Alaid,
                    estimated to have an altitude of at least 12,000 feet, had two great eruptions
                    in 1770 and 1793. None of the other eminences exceed 5000 feet in height. As the
                    slopes are for the most part exceedingly regular, the production of the
                    volcanoes must be assigned to a comparatively recent period; and the absence of
                    stratification seems to indicate a continuity of action. The forces at work must
                    have been enormous if, as appears probable, the chain was built up from the bed
                    of the sea. To the east of the islands the “Challenger” expedition found a depth
                    of 27,930 feet. The flora of the Kuriles is poor, especially towards the north;
                    in the southern islands it is similar to that of Yezo. In Kunashir, Urup, and
                    Iturup there are well-wooded portions. Sea-otters, wolves, and foxes are among
                    the wild animals hunted for their skins. Many of the islands are altogether
                    uninhabited, and none have more than the scantiest population. In 1868-70
                    Knipping estimated the total at from 200 to 300 persons, and since the treaty of
                    1875 a large number have removed to Saghalien and other parts of Russian
                    territory. Ethnographically the people of the Kuriles are in the main identical
                    with the Ainos of Yezo, those of the northern islands showing the influence of
                    intercourse with Kamchatka. They are quiet, timorous, and well-behaved, do not
                    practise polygamy, and carefully avoid intermarriage between blood relations.
                    The poorer people burn their dead, the wealthier embalm them. Once a year in
                    autumn they hold a great feast. Of a supreme deity they have some indistinct
                    idea, but they sacrifice to the sun, the moon, and the sea, and worship the
                    bear.</p>
                <p>The Kurile Islands were discovered in 1634 by the Dutch navigator De Vrees. The
                    Russians first learned about them from Japanese traders who visited Kamchatka in
                    1711; in the following year two Cossacks, Antsuiphoroff and Kozuirevskii,
                    crossed over to Shumshu; and in 1766-67 a voyage was made among the islands to
                    collect a fur tax. In 1795 a factory of the Russian American Company was
                    established on Urup. Captain Golovnin was taken prisoner by the Japanese on
                    Kunashir in 1811.</p>
