                    where he remained three years. The name of Kean secured him an engagement at
                    Drury Lane Theatre, where he made his debut 1st October 1827, in the character
                    of Norval, but failed to create a very favourable impression, his talents being
                    such as required long practice and careful study for their development; and his
                    continued failure to achieve popularity led him to leave London in the spring of
                    1828 for the provinces. After a visit to America in 1830, where he was received
                    with much favour, he in 1833 appeared at Covent Garden as Sir Edmund Mortimer,
                    but his success was not pronounced enough to encourage him to remain long in
                    London, especially as he had already in the provinces won a high position. In
                    January 1838 he returned to Drury Lane, and played Hamlet with a success which
                    gave him a place among the principal tragedians of his time. After his marriage
                    with the actress Miss Ellen Tree in 1842, he paid a second visit to America.
                    Returning to England in 1847, he entered on a successful engagement at the
                    Haymarket, and in 1850, along with Mr Kelly, he became lessee of the Princess
                    Theatre. The most noteworthy feature of his management was a series of gorgeous
                    Shakespearean revivals. Charles Kean cannot be called a great tragic actor. He
                    did all that could be done by the persevering cultivation of his powers, and in
                    many ways manifested the possession of high intelligence and refined taste, but
                    his defects of person and voice made it impossible for him to give a
                    representation at all adequate of the varying and subtle emotions characteristic
                    of pure tragedy. In melodramatic parts such as Louis XI. and the Corsican
                    Brothers his success was unequivocal and complete. From his “tour round the
                    world” Kean returned in 1866 in broken health, and he died at London, January
                    22, 1868.</p>
