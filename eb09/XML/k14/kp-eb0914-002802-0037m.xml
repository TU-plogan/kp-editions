                    Frasers of Kincardineshire through the marriage of Sir William Keith, who in
                    1458 was created Lord Keith and Earl Marischal of Scotland. William, earl
                    marischal, great grandson of the first of the line, distinguished himself at the
                    battle of Pinkie in 1547, and was a member of the council of the kingdom during
                    the minority of Queen Mary. By his marriage with his cousin Margaret, daughter
                    of Sir "William Keith of Inverugie, he nearly doubled his estates, but, becoming
                    involved in money embarrassments, he lived for some time in seclusion in his
                    castle of Dunnottar, obtaining on that account the sobriquet of “William that
                    kept the tower.” He was succeeded in 1581 by his grandson George, fifth earl,
                    who, besides having studied under the direction of Beza at Geneva, had acquired
                    a comprehensive knowledge of the politics and customs of most of the courts of
                    Europe. Probably for this reason he was chosen by King James to negotiate his
                    marriage with Queen Anne of Denmark and bring her to Scotland. Throughout life
                    he showed a keen interest in the advancement of learning. He was one of the
                    commissioners appointed in 1582 to inquire into the management of King’s
                    College, Aberdeen, and out of his own private fortune he founded and endowed
                    Marischal College in that city, which received a charter in 1593 He died at
                    Dunnottar, April 5, 1623. The estates of the Keiths were forfeited on account of
                    the part taken by George Keith, tenth earl, and his brother Francis (see next
                    article) in the rebellion of 1715. Through the influence of his brother with
                    Frederick the Great, the earl became governor of Neufchatel. After the reversal
                    of the attainder he returned to Scotland, but soon made his way back to Berlin,
                    where he died in April 1788. Through his death without issue the male line of
                    the house became extinct. From the female line descended the Keith Elphinstones,
                    one of whom, Sir George, was on account of his brilliant naval services created
                    an Irish peer with the title of Baron Keith of Stonehaven Marischal. Sir John
                    Keith, third son of the sixth earl marischal, was created Earl Kintore and Lord
                    Keith of Inverurie and Keith Hall, on account of the part he was supposed to
                    have taken in saving the regalia of Scotland when Dunnottar Castle, where they
                    were deposited, was besieged by Cromwell.</p>
