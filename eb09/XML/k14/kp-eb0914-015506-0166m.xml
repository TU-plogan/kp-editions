                    inhabited by the Kurds, but the name is not used in the country in this general
                    sense, nor indeed would it be technically correct, for in a very small portion
                    only of the region in question is the population exclusively Kurdish.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geography.</hi> — The furthest point to which the Kurds extend
                    north-westward is the junction of the two arms of the Euphrates near Kharpût, in
                    about 39° N. lat. and 39° E. long., while their south-eastern limit may be
                    defined <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n167/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0167-0156"/> as the frontier of Luristan, south of
                    Kirmânshàhân, in about 34° N. lat. and 47° E. long. The whole of this space,
                    which is roughly calculated to embrace an area of at least 60,000 square miles,
                    is mountainous, being in fact a section of the great chain which, known in
                    antiquity at one extremity as Taurus and at the other as Zagrus, bisects Asia
                    Minor from west to east, and then turning to the southeast buttresses the great
                    Persian plateau in a series of ranges rising step over step above the valley of
                    the Tigris. Kurdistan thus defined may be divided, according to its physical
                    features, into three separate sections. The first section, stretching from
                    Kharpιit to the Persian frontier, has been thus described by Consul Taylor, who
                    resided for many years in the country.</p>
                <p>“The general features,” he says, “of this tract are high mountains, enclosing
                    fertile valleys and an undulating upland, bounded on the south-west by the
                    Tigris, and intersected at several points by numerous streams having their rise
                    in the northern districts of the Diarbekir pashalic, and emptying themselves
                    into that river. The scenery in the highlands yields to no other portion of
                    Turkey for variety and romantic beauty, while the numerous rivers and streams
                    flow through charming landscapes and thickly wooded valleys, bathing in their
                    course the bases of castles and towns famous in profane and ecclesiastical
                    history.”</p>
                <p>To supplement ΔΓr Taylor’s general description, it may be enough to say that
                    there are three principal ranges running from west to east through this portion
                    of Kurdistan :—(1) The Dιijik and Mezoor Dagh (Paryadres and Abus of antiquity,
                    and Mount Simus of Armenian history), a lofty, rugged, and inaccessible range
                    which fills up the entire space between the two arms of the Euphrates, being
                    connected with Λnti-Taurus to the westward, and culminating far to the east in
                    the isolated peaks of the greater and lesser Ararat; (2) The Mudikân range,
                    south of the Murâd-sû, which is a continuation of the true Taurus, aud which is
                    prolonged under the names of Nimrùd Dâgh, Sipân Dâgh, and Alâ Dâgh, till it
                    reaches the Persian frontier to the north-east of Lake Van (in this range all
                    the headwaters of the Tigris rise, flowing south under the names of Debeneh-sù,
                    Ambâr-sù, Batmân-sù, and the rivers of Arzen and Bohtân, and joining the main
                    stream between Diarbekir and Jezireh); and (3) Mount Masius, or Jebel-Tür, an
                    inferior range, south of the Tigris, which divides Kurdistan from the great
                    Mesopotamian desert.</p>
                <p>The second or central division of Kurdistan, which may be regarded as extending
                    north and south from Lake Van to Sulimanieh, is of a more exclusively
                    mountainous character. With the exception indeed of the districts of Amadieh,
                    Shekelabâd, and Koi-Sanjâk on the immediate skirts of the Tigris basin, and the
                    open country of Azerbijân beyond the great range to the south-west of Lake
                    Urumieh, where the Kurds of the mountains have overflowed into Persia, there is
                    hardly a square mile of level laud anywhere to be found. The ranges of this
                    division, which preserve a general direction of north-north-west and
                    south-southeast, are throughout much broken up by transverse ridges, and seem to
                    be tossed about in inextricable disorder, a few peaks, such as the Jebel-Jùdi
                    above Amadieh (which almost certainly represents the Ararat of the Bible) and
                    the Gawâr (or Jawâr) Dagh near Julamerik in the Hakkâri country, rising to a
                    stupendous height, and thus dominating the surrounding mountains, while several
                    large rivers, and especially the Khabùr and the Upper and Lower Zâb, running in
                    narrow and precipitous beds, burst at right angles through the gorges of the
                    chain, and descend upon the Tigris valley in a series of cataracts amid scenery
                    of the wildest and most impressive grandeur. The usual elevation of the hills in
                    this part of Kurdistan is not less than 10,000 feet above the level of the sea,
                    while some of the highest peaks reach probably to an altitude of 14,000 or even
                    15,000 feet.</p>
                <p>In the third or southern division of Kurdistan, which includes the Turkish
                    pashalic of Sulimanieh and the Persian provinces of Ardelân and Kirmânshâhân,
                    the mountain chain diminishes both in height and breadth. The average height of
                    the hills is here only about 5000 or 6000 feet, and the loftiest range, that of
                    the Bend-i-Nùh, or Noah’s Hill, which forms the southern barrier of the gates of
                    Zagrus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is this
                    range, and not the Jebel-Jùdi, as is generally supposed, that represents the
                    Nisir of the cuneiform inscriptions, where the ark is said to have rested in the
                    Chaldaean account of the flood; and the same tradition is to be traced in the
                    belief which universally prevailed in Babylonia almost to modern times, that the
                    waters of the great deluge penetrated no farther to the eastward than the “peak
                    of Holwân.” See Sachau’s <hi rend="italic">Birun'x,</hi> p. 28.</p></note> and
                    upon which, according to the tradition of Babylonia, as opposed to the tradition
                    of Assyria, the ark is supposed to have rested, does not exceed an elevation of
                    8000 feet. The pass also which traverses the range at this point, and conducts
                    from the lowlands of Holwân to the upper plain of Kirrend, is only 10 miles in
                    length. At the foot of the great range on the western side are the fertile
                    plains of Shahrizor, Zohâb, and Ghilân, where rice is extensively cultivated,
                    while on the Persian side, though rocky ridges run out to the eastward both in
                    Ardelân and Kirmânshâhân, the general character of the country is open, and
                    cereals are everywhere produced in extraordinary abundance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> There are no means of calculating the total
                    Kurd population with even approximate accuracy, for neither in Turkey nor in
                    Persia has a Government census ever been attempted, and the revenue tables which
                    regulate taxation and conscription, and ought therefore to guide inquiry, are
                    wilfully distorted for political purposes to such an extent as to be quite
                    unreliable. From the materials, however, which have been recently collected by
                    the British consular officers employed in Asia Minor, with a view of testing the
                    relative strength of the Mohammedan and Christian populations, it seems pretty
                    clear that the Turkish Kurds exceed one million and a half in number, while the
                    estimates of travellers who have resided iu Persian Kurdistan give about 750,000
                    souls for the aggregate of the tribesmen and sedentary Kurds dwelling along the
                    mountains from Ararat to Kirmânshâhân, together with the scattered colonies of
                    the interior. The following rough table, then, has been compiled from the above

                <p>Attempts have been made to classify this Kurdish population as sedentary and
                    nomad, and in connexion with the classification to distinguish between tribal
                    and non-tribal communities; but all such divisions are arbitrary and fallacious,
                    and ought not to be admitted in a statistical account of the nation. No doubt
                    the original Kurdish organization was tribal, and the prevailing habits of the
                    tribes have always been nomadic and pastoral; but such habits are ever liable to
                    be modified by local circumstances, and at the present day it is quite incorrect
                    to suppose that the tribal Kurds are universally pastoral and migratory, while
                    the non-tribal Kurds are sedentary and agricultural. In reality the distinction
                    between living in villages as cultivators and living in tents as shepherds
                    mainly depends on the localities where the tribes happen to be established. The
                    Deyrsimlis, for instance, who inhabit the ranges of Dujik and Mezoor between the
                    two arms of the Euphrates, and who number, according to Consul Taylor’s
                    estimate, above 200,000 souls, reside almost exclusively in villages, owing to
                    the severity of their northern climate, while they follow agricultural and
                    pastoral pursuits indifferently. But, on the other hand, the tribes to the south
                    who have easy access to the Mesopotamian plains, prefer a nomadic life,
                    sheltering their flocks and herds in the warm pastures beyond the Tigris during
                    the winter, and driving them up in the summer to feed on the rich herbage of the
                    mountain sides; and the same rule may be held to apply generally throughout
                    Kurdistan, the tribesmen, whose natural instincts lead them to migrate between
                    summer and winter quarters, becoming sedentary only when obstacles, either
                    political or geographical, are placed in the way of their movements. With regard
                    also to the distinction that is sometimes drawn between tribal and non-tribal
                    Kurds, the hypothesis being that the latter, who live in villages and cultivate
                    the soil, are the descendants of the aboriginal peasantry, while the former, who
                    live in tents and support themselves with their flocks, are conquering invaders,
                    the explanation will certainly not hold good. There is in reality no ethnic
                    distinction between the two classes. Tribal Kurds who settle in villages very
                    soon lose their distinctive name, and mix with the peasantry of the
                    neighbourhood, while it constantly happens that a chief of village extraction,
                    either by his individual character or through Government support, founds a new
                    tribe and takes his place among the aristocracy of the nation. It may be added
                    that in respect to the relative importance of the two classes the sedentary
                    Kurds greatly outnumber the nomads, but that they are not so wealthy, nor so
                    independent, nor do they stand nearly so high in popular estimation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Character.—</hi> The Kurds generally bear a very indifferent
                    reputation, a worse reputation, perhaps, than they really deserve. Being aliens
                    to the Turks in language and to the Persians in religion, they are everywhere
                    treated with mistrust, and live as it were in a state of chronic warfare with
                    the powers that be. Such a condition is not of course favourable to the
                    development of the better qualities of human nature. The Kurds are thus wild and
                    lawless; they are much given to brigandage; they oppress and frequently maltreat
                    the Christian populations with whom they are brought in contact, —these
                    populations being the Armenians in Diarbekir, Erzeroum, and Van, the Jacobites
                    and Syrians in the Jebel-Tür, and the Nestorians and Chaldaeans in the Hakkâri
                    country,—but they are not as a general rule either fanatical or cruel. In the
                    Hakkâri country, indeed, they live under ordinary circumstances in perfect amity
                    with the Nestorians, from whom in outward appearance they are hardly
                    distinguishable. It must be added, too, that they are naturally brave and
                    hospitable, and in common with many other Asiatic races possess certain rude but
                    strict feelings of honour. Perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of the
                    Kurdish chief is pride of ancestry. This feeling is in many cases exaggerated,
                    for in reality the present tribal organization does not date from any great
                    antiquity. In the list indeed of eighteen principal tribes of the nation which
                    was drawn up by the Arabian historian Massoudi, in the 10th century, only two or
                    three names are to be recognized at the present day. A 14th century list,

                    modern Zerzas of Ushnei (cuneiform pillars of Kel-i-shin and Sidek noticed by

                    families both in Bohtân and Hakkâri, which are extant at the present day, can
                    really trace their descent from the Ommeyide caliphs, while the Babân chief of

                    Ahmed-ibn-Merwân, after remaining for some time among the Gurâns, gained
                    possession of the country of Shahrizor”; and the Ardelân family history, with
                    the gradual extension of their power over Persian Kurdistan, is then traced down
                    to the Saffavean period.</p></note> who also represents an elder branch of the
                    Gurâns, each claim an ancestry of at least five hundred years. There was up to a
                    recent period no more picturesque or interesting scene to be witnessed in the
                    East than the court of one of these great Kurdish chiefs, where, like another
                    Saladin, the bey ruled in patriarchal state, surrounded by an hereditary
                    nobility, regarded by his clansmen with reverence and affection, and attended by
                    a bodyguard of young Kurdish warriors, clad in chain armour, with flaunting
                    silken scarfs, and bearing javelin, lance, and sword as in the time of the
                    crusades.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Language and Religion.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The present
                    Kurdish language which is called Kermânji—a title difficult to explain—is an old
                    Persian patois, intermixed to the north with Chaldaean words and to the south
                    with a certain Turanian element which may not improbably have come down from
                    Babylonian times. Several peculiar dialects are spoken in secluded districts in
                    the mountains, but the only varieties which, from their extensive use, require
                    to be specified are the Zaza and the Gurân. The Zaza is spoken throughout the
                    western portion of the Deyrsim country, and is said to be unintelligible to the
                    Kermânji-speaking Kurds. It is largely intermingled with Armenian, and may
                    contain some trace of the old Cappadocian, but is no doubt of the same Aryan
                    stock as the standard Kurdish. The Gurân dialect again, which is spoken
                    throughout Ardelân and Kirmânshâhân<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Gurân are mentioned in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mesalik-el-AbsΛr</hi> as the dominant tribe in southern Kurdistan in the 14th
                    century, occupying very much the same seats as at present, from the Hamadan
                    frontier to Shahrizor. Their name probably signifies merely “the mountaineers,”
                    being derived from <hi rend="italic">gur</hi> or <hi rend="italic">giri,</hi> “a
                    mountain,” which is also found in Zagrus, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,
                    za-giri,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> beyond the mountain,” or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pusht-i-koh,</hi> as the name is translated in Persian. They are a fine,
                    active, and hardy race, individually brave, and make excellent soldiers, though
                    in appearance very inferior to the tribal Kurds of the northern districts. These
                    latter indeed delight in gay colours, while the Gurâns dress in the most homely
                    costume, wearing coarse blue cotton vests, with felt caps and <pb

                    long period abandoned nomadic habits, and are now almost universally congregated
                    in villages and occupied with the cultivation of the soil, so that in a great
                    part of Kurdistan the name Gurân has become synonymous with an agricultural
                    peasantry, as opposed to the migratory shepherds.</p></note> chiefly differs
                    from the northern Kurdish in being <pb corresp="pbn9158"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0169-0158"/> entirely free from any Semitic intermixture. It
                    is thus somewhat nearer to the Persian than the Kermânji dialect, but is
                    essentially the same language. It is a mistake to suppose that there is no
                    Kurdish literature. Many of the popular Persian poets have been translated into
                    Kurdish, and there are also books relating to the religious mysteries of the
                    Ali-01Uhis in the hands of the Deyrsimlis to the north and of the Gurâns of
                    Kirmânshâhân to the south. European scholars too have been assiduous of late
                    years in investigating the various Kurdish dialects. The New Testament in
                    Kurdish was printed at Constantinople in 1857. The Rev. Samuel Rhea published a
                    grammar and vocabulary of the Hakkàri dialect in 1872. Lerch, Brugsch, Chodzko,
                    Beresine, Blau, and many others have discussed different branches of the subject
                    in the scientific magazines of the Continent; and quite recently (1879) there
                    has appeared under the auspices of the Imperial Academy of St Petersburg a
                    French-Kurdish dictionary compiled originally by Mons. Jaba, many years Russian
                    consul at Erzeroum, but completed by Ferdinand Justi by the help of a rich
                    assortment of Kurdish tales and ballads, collected by Messrs Socin and Pryne in
                    Assyria. Justi’s preface to the dictionary gives a good account of the present
                    state of Kurdish studies in Europe and Asia.</p>
                <p>The religion of the Kurds also furnishes a very curious subject of inquiry. The
                    great body of the nation, in Persia as well as in Turkey, are Sunnis of the
                    Shafe’i sect, but in the recesses of the Deyrsim to the north and of Zagrus to
                    the south, there are large half-pagan communities, who are called indifferently
                    Ali-011ahi and Kizzil-bâsh, and who hold tenets of some obscurity, but of
                    considerable interest. Outwardly professing to be Shi’ahs or “followers of Ali,”
                    they observe secret ceremonies and hold esoteric doctrines which have probably
                    descended to them from very early ages, and of which the essential condition is
                    that there must always be upon the earth a visible manifestation of the Deity.
                    While paying reverence to the supposed incarnations of ancient days, to Moses,
                    David, Christ, Ali and his tutor Salmàn-el-Farsi, and several of the Shi’ah
                    imams and saints, they have thus usually some recent local celebrity at whose
                    shrine they worship and make vows; and there is, moreover, in every community of
                    Ali-Ollahis some living personage, not necessarily ascetic, to whom, as
                    representing the Godhead, the superstitious tribesmen pay almost idolatrous
                    honours. Among the Gurâns of the south the shrine of Baba Yadgâr, in a gorge of
                    the hills above the old city of Holwân, is thus regarded with a supreme
                    veneration, while in the family of a certain Syed who resides in the
                    neighbourhood the attributes of divinity are supposed to be hereditary. Similar
                    institutions are also found in other parts of the mountains, which may be
                    compared with the tenets of the Druses and Ansaris in Syria and the Ismaelis in
                    Persia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate, Productions, Fauna, &amp;c.—</hi> In a country like
                    Kurdistan, which extends over five or six degrees of latitude, and ranges in
                    altitude from 1500 to 15,000 feet above the sea, there is of course every
                    variety of climate and produce. In the northern part of this region the hills
                    are covered with pine forest, while the valleys abound with walnuts, sycamores,
                    and planes, and all sorts of fruit trees, and in summer the hillsides and
                    uplands are covered with a luxuriant herbage. The winters are here very
                    rigorous, and the tribes, as far as they can, migrate at that season to the
                    plains. In central Kurdistan the pine forests cease and give way to dwarf oak
                    and elms, the mastic, holly, &amp;c., while further to the south large trees
                    almost disappear, and a rough scrub takes their place. A succinct and graphic
                    description of Turkish Kurdistan is given by Consul Taylor in his notes of
                    travel published in the <hi rend="italic">Geographical Journal</hi> for
                    1865.</p>
                <p>“The modern Turkish province of Kurdistan,” he says, “watered by an infinity of
                    noble streams, with a salubrious climate and rich soil, yields to no other
                    province in the empire for the variety and richness of its vegetable and animal
                    produce, while its numerous mountain chains abound in mineral wealth. Among its
                    natural vegetable productions, galls, gum-tragacanth, madder-roots, and the
                    pistachio-nut, from which the natives extract a fine oil used in making soap,
                    are the most important,—the annual value of the export of the former alone being
                    upwards of £35,000. Oleaginous seeds and olive oil are produced in large
                    quantities, and the quality of the former is so superior that it finds its way
                    to many of the northern governments. Sheep’s wool was exported in 1863 to the
                    value of £70,000; and mohair, the produce of the Angorah goats, that thrive so
                    wonderfully in the neighbourhood of Jezireh, was eagerly sought after and bought
                    up by native traders from Kaiserieh and Constantinople in the same period to the
                    amount of £20,000.</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ The manufacture of native cotton cloths, shallees made from mohair, and short
                    woollen cloaks is actively pursued; and the shallee, for texture and variety of
                    colour and pattern, shows the extraordinary natural intelligence of the Kurdish
                    workman. Diarbekir is famous itself for its silk piece-goods, similar to those
                    of Aleppo and other parts of Syria, but, from its greater cheapness and
                    durability, more in request among the poorer classes of the mountains between
                    Diarbekir and the Black Sea. Sheep are exported in large quantities from the
                    mountains and desert to Aleppo, Damascus, and Beyrout, and camels, purchased
                    from the Arabs, to Kaiserieh and other parts of Asia Minor. The uplands and
                    hills abound in several species of polecat, martin, foxes, and wolves, whose
                    furs add considerably in value to the sum total of the export list. A beautiful
                    species of spotted lynx may be included among the former, although it is far
                    more scarce than those enumerated. A rough estimate of the whole annual value of
                    the animal and vegetable produce of the pashalic, whether consumed at home or
                    exported (exclusive of food), will amount to more than £700,000 sterling.”</p>
                <p>This account is generally applicabis to central and southern Kurdistan as well as
                    to the pashalics of Diarbekir and Erzeroum, but it requires to be supplemented
                    in some particulars. The rice and corn which are grown by the Kurds of the
                    Tigris basin and the Persian plains form a very important staple of export,
                    while the hill forests supply charcoal, wild silk, manna, and gummastic, in
                    addition to the produce noticed in Consul Taylor’s list, to a very large extent;
                    and it may be further noted that along the whole range of mountains from Jezireh
                    to Susa there is an outer ridge of low gypsum hills, which abounds throughout
                    its whole extent with petroleum and naphtha springs. Mineral oils are not at
                    present much appreciated by either Turks or Persians, but in the future of
                    Kurdistan this important source of wealth cannot be left out of account.</p>
                <p>With regard to the fauna of Kurdistan a few words must suffice. Neither lions nor
                    tigers are ever found in the mountains, though the former frequent the banks of
                    the Tigris and the latter are common in the Caspian forests. The wild animals of
                    Kurdistan are the leopard and lynx, the wild cat, bear, hyaena, wild boar, wolf,
                    jackal, and fox, the <hi rend="italic">mardi</hi> (or red deer), the roe and hog
                    deer (and fallow deer and antelope on the skirts of the hills), the wild goat
                    (or ibex), the wild sheep (or moufflon), together with badgers, hares, many
                    varieties of the polecat or martin, and the ordinary smaller animals. Of game
                    birds the most remarkable are the <hi rend="italic">Kel&gt;k-i-Derv</hi> (or
                    large partridge, first brought to the notice of naturalists by Consul Brandt),
                    the grey and red-legged partridge, the <hi rend="italic">Tihoo,</hi> quail,
                    woodcock, and snipe, three varieties of bustard, the grey crane, and wild geese
                    and ducks in abundance.</p>
                <p>It has not been found possible to compute the amount of revenue which is raised
                    from the Kurds. Consul Trotter remarks on this subject :—</p>
                <p>“The Turkish Kurds are found in almost every possible stage, from that of
                    thorough subjection to the Government (as in many of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n170/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0170-0159"/> the Diarbekir and Erzeroum villages, where they
                    pay all the regular taxes and are also drawn for the conscription) up to the
                    semi-independent Kurds of Bohtan, of Mudikân, and of the Deyrsim, who never pay
                    taxes except at the rare intervals that the Government is able to occupy their
                    country with a military force, and who have never hitherto, except on very rare
                    occasions, supplied soldiers to the army either regular or irregular.”</p>
                <p>And, if this uncertain liability to taxation is true of the Kurds of Erzeroum and
                    Diarbekir, it applies equally to the districts of Hakkàri and Rowandiz, and to
                    the great tribes such as the Herki, Hartushi, and HyderAnli, who migrate between
                    Persia and Turkey. In Sulimanieh, on the other hand, as well as in the Persian
                    provinces of Azerbijan, Ardelân, and Kirmânshâhàn, the revenue derived from the
                    Kurdish population is fixed, and may be estimated at £1 per house instead of the
                    £1, 6s. which is the usual Osmanli rate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities.—</hi> Kurdistan abounds in antiquities of the most
                    varied and interesting character. There is in the first place a series of
                    rock-cut cuneiform inscriptions, extending from Malatieh on the west to Miyandab
                    (in Persia) on the east, and from the banks of the Arras on the north to
                    Rowandiz on the south, which record the glories of a Turanian dynasty, who ruled
                    the country ofNairi during the 8th and 7th centuries B.C., contemporaneously
                    with the lower Assyrian empire. Intermingled with these are a few genuine
                    Assyrian inscriptions of an earlier date; and in one instance, at Van, a later
                    tablet of Xerxes brings the record down to the period of Grecian history. The
                    most ancient monuments of this class, however, are to be found at Holwân and in
                    the neighbourhood, where the sculptures and inscriptions belong probably to the
                    Guti and Lull tribes, and date from the early Babylonian period. Excavations at
                    this spot or in the mounds along the course of the Diyâleh, which is the great
                    river of southern Kurdistan, or more especially at Yassin Tepeh, the site of the
                    ancient city of Shahrizor, would probably lead to the discovery of relics
                    cognate with those which have been found in the palaces of Nineveh and
                    Babylon.</p>
                <p>Information has also been recently received that a cemetery full of inscribed
                    sepulchral urns has been laid bare by a landslip in the mountains between
                    Sulimanieh and Kirmânshâhân, and the description is calculated to arouse the
                    liveliest interest, though until the spot has been visited by some European
                    scholar no definite opinion can be given as to the character and antiquity of
                    the remains.</p>
                <p>In the northern Kurdish districts which represent the Arzanene, Intilene,
                    Anzitene, Zabdicene, and Moxuene of the ancients, there are also many
                    interesting remains of Roman cities, well worth examining. Arzen, Miyafarikin
                    (ancient Martyropolis), and Sisauronon have already been reported on by Consul
                    Taylor, but there is still abundant room for research, and attention should be
                    especially directed to the ruins of Dunisir near Dara, which Sachau the great
                    Orientalist has recently identified with the Armenian capital of Tigranocerta, a
                    city that has long been the despair of comparative geographers. Of the
                    Macedonian and Parthian periods there are remains both sculptured and inscribed
                    at several points in Kurdistan: at Bisitun, in a cave at Amadieh, at the
                    Mithraic temple of Kereftù, on the rocks at Sir Pul-i-Zohab near the ruins of
                    Holwân, and probably in some other localities, such as the Bâlik country between
                    Lahijân and Koi-Sanjâk, which have never been visited by Europeans; but the most
                    interesting site in all Kurdistan, perhaps in all western Asia, is the ruined
                    fire temple of Pâi Kιilf on the southern frontier of Sulimanieh, a spot that has
                    been hurriedly visited by two or three European travellers, but never thoroughly
                    examined. Among the debris of this temple, which are scattered over a bare
                    hillside, are to be found above one hundred slabs, inscribed with Parthian and
                    Pehlevi characters, the fragments of a wall which formerly supported the eastern
                    face of the edifice, and bore a bilingual legend of great length, dating from
                    the Sassanian period. Not more than half of the inscribed slabs have as yet been
                    copied, time and labour being required to clear out the other slabs which lie
                    embedded in the earth on the slope of the hill down which they have rolled, and
                    the locality, moreover, being one that cannot be easily examined or even
                    visited, owing to its exposed position among the brigand tribes of the frontier,
                    but it is to be earnestly hoped that, when an opportunity does offer, every
                    fragment of inscription may be recovered, so that it may be possible to
                    reconstruct the entire legend, which, independent of its historical interest, is
                    of special importance as the longest and latest specimen of the lapidary Pehlevi
                    writing. There are also remarkable Sassanian remains in other parts of
                    Kurdistan,—at Salmùs to the north, and at Kirmânshâhân and Kasr-i-Shirin on the
                    Turkish frontier to the south; and it is probable that an active search among
                    the hills would discover many similar objects of interest. It may indeed be
                    asserted that there is no region of the East at the present day which deserves a
                    more careful scrutiny and promises a richer harvest to the antiquarian explorer

                    illustrate northern Kurdistan between Van ami Diarbekir, but the inner mountains
                    of Bohtân, Hakkâri, Rowandiz, and the Batik country are still almost a “terra
                    incognita,” and require careful examination.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> With regard to the origin of the Kurds, itwas
                    formerly considered sufficient to describe them as the descendants of the
                    Carduchi, who opposed the retreat of the Ten Thousand through the mountains, but
                    modern research ascends far beyond the period of the Greeks. We now find that at
                    the dawn of history the mountains overhanging Assyria were held by a people
                    named <hi rend="italic">Gütû,</hi> a title which signified “a warrior,” and
                    which was rendered in Assyrian by the synonym of <hi rend="italic">Gardu</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Kardu,</hi> the precise term quoted by Strabo to explain the
                    name of the Cardaces (K0pδακes). These <hi rend="italic">Gmιi</hi> were a
                    Turanian tribe of such power as to be placed in the early cuneiform records on
                    an equality with the other nations of western Asia, that is, with the Syrians
                    and Hittites, the Susians, Elymaeans, and Accadians of Babylonia; and during the
                    whole period of thé Assyrian empire they seem to have preserved a more or less
                    independent political position. After the fall of Nineveh they coalesced with
                    the Medes, and, in common with all the nations inhabiting the high plateaus of
                    Asia Minor, Armenia, and Persia, became gradually Aryanized, owing to the
                    immigration at this period of history of tribes in overwhelming numbers which,
                    from whatever quarter they may have sprung, belonged certainly to the Aryan
                    family.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gütü</hi> or Kurdιι were reduced to subjection by Cyrus
                    before he descended upon Babylon, and furnished a contingent of fighting men to
                    his successors, being thus mentioned under the names of Saspirians and
                    Alarodians in the muster roll of the army of Xerxes which was preserved by
                    Herodotus.</p>
                <p>In later times they passed successively under the sway of the Macedonians, the
                    Parthians, and Sassanians, being especially befriended, if we may judge from
                    tradition as well as from the remains still existing in the country, by the
                    Arsacian monarchs, who were probably of a cognate race. Gotarzes indeed, whose
                    name may perhaps be translated “chief of the <hi rend="italic">Gtitüf</hi> was
                    traditionally believed to be the founder of the Gurdns, the principal tribe of
                    southern Kurdistan,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“The
                    Kalhιir tribe are traditionally descended from Gudarz-ibn-Gio, whose son Roham
                    was sent by Bahman Keiâni to destroy Jerusalem and bring the Jews into
                    captivity. This Roham is the individual usually called Bokht-i-nasser
                    (Nebuchadnezzar), and he ultimately succeeded to the throne. The neighbouring
                    country has ever since remained in the hands of his descendants, who are called

                    tradition still exists in the country, and Γ∩TAPZHC ΓEOΠOΘPO2 is found on the
                    rock at Bisitun, showing that Gudarz-ibn-Gio was really an historic personage.

                    and his name and titles are still preserved in a Greek inscription at Bisitun
                    near the Kurdish capital of Kirmânshâhân. Under the caliphs of Baghdad the Kurds
                    were always giving trouble in one quarter or another. In 224 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and again in 293, there were formidable
                    insurrections in northern Kurdistan; and a third time, in 309, the Boide amir,
                    Azad-ad-Dowleh, was obliged to lead the forces of the caliphate against the
                    southern Kurds, capturing the famous fortress of Seπnaj, of which the ruins are
                    to be seen at the present day near Bisitun, and reducing the province of
                    Shahrizor with its capital city now marked by the great mound of Yassin Teppeh.
                    The most flourishing period of Kurdish power was probably during the 12th
                    century of our era, when the great Saladin, who belonged to the Rewendi branch
                    of the Hadabâni tribe, founded the Ayubite dynasty of Syria, and Kurdish
                    chiefships were established, not only to the east and west of the Kurdistan
                    mountains, but as far as Khorâsân upon one side and Egypt and Yemen on the
                    other. During the Mongol and Tartar domination of western Asia the Kurds in the
                    mountains remained for the most part passive, yielding a reluctant obedience to
                    the provincial governors of the plains, and for the last three or four centuries
                    they have been divided in their allegiance between the Turkish and Persian
                    crowns. After Sultan Selim in 1514 had defeated the army of Shah Ismael, the
                    founder of the Saffavean dynasty,he employed one of his generals, Sultan Hussein
                    Beg of Amadieh, to recover Shahrizor and its dependencies from Persia; and from
                    that time to the present day the political status has not been materially
                    disturbed. The frontier line indeed bisecting Kurdistan from north to south,
                    which was agreed upon in 1047 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi>, between Sultan
                    Murad IV. and Shah Saffi, after the recovery of Baghdad by the former sovereign,
                    is substantially the same line that was adopted by the Russian and British
                    commissioners who were employed in 1840-42 to mediate between the two Asiatic
                    powers and delimit their respective territories. But in the meantime changes of
                    some moment have occurred in the interior organization of Kurdistan. Both in
                    Turkey and in Persia the independent power of the Kurds has been much curtailed.
                    In Turkey the pashas of Kharput, Erzeroum, and Diarbekir have been invested witn
                    larger powers of control, while the authority of the sultan has been further
                    strengthened by the establishment of Turkish <pb break="no"

                    Sulimanieh, in succession to the old hereditary Kurdish chiefs. With the
                    tortuous policy, it is true, which is characteristic of the Osmanli race, the
                    Forte has not unfrequently of late years encouraged the development of native
                    strength in various parts of Kurdistan for a time and for certain special
                    purposes; but, when the position of the local magnate has anywhere become one of
                    political danger, the central Government has stepped in and without difficulty
                    has reasserted its supreme authority.</p>
                <p>In 1834, for instance, the famous Reshid Mohammed Pasha chastised the Kurds, who
                    had everywhere broken loose from Siwas to Rowandiz, and adopted severe measures
                    of repression, which are still remembered and dreaded. In 1843 again, Beder Khan
                    Beg, who from his patrimonial government of Bohtan had extended his sway over
                    the whole mountain range, and had sworn to exterminate the Nestorian Christians,
                    was crushed immediately that the Porte put forth its strength against him; but
                    the most notable instance of sudden Kurdish aggrandizement and collapse has
                    occurred during the year 1881. Sheikh Obeidullah, chief of the small tribe of
                    Oramar, who resided in a village of the mountains south of Lake Van, had
                    acquired great local influence, owing to the sanctity of his family, but more
                    especially from his own ascetic habits and his personal character. He seems to
                    have really entertained the idea at one time of establishing an independent
                    Kurdish kingdom, concentrating under his own individual authority all the
                    scattered remnants of his race both in Persia and in Turkey. At any rate, having
                    collected a very considerable force of Kurds in the summer of 1880, he suddenly
                    burst in upon the plains of Persia and ravaged Azerbijaπ to the south of Lake U
                    rumfeh, sweeping the country up to the walls of Maragha on one side of the lake
                    and of Urumieh upon the other. Having been joined by the Zerzas, the Mikris, the
                    Bilbass, and all the tribes of the Persian frontier, it is considered certain
                    that he might have marched on and pillaged Tabriz had he taken full advantage of
                    the panic which followed on the first invasion; but, he having faltered and thus
                    given time for the arrival of Persian reinforcements, the movement, which was at
                    one time most serious, collapsed, and he retired to the mountains. Now the
                    Turkish Government had unquestionably in the first instance encouraged Sheikh
                    Obeidullah’s increasing power and aspirations, not with a view of hostility to
                    Persia, but in the hope that the establishment of a fanatical and great
                    independent Kurdish principality about Lake Van would paralyse any movement of
                    the Armenian nation towards the recovery of its liberty. The Porte indeed in all
                    probability still cherishes the idea of thus controlling the action of its
                    Christian subjects, though it has been compelled by the pressure of the European
                    powers, and under the threat of reprisals from Persia, to arrest Sheikh
                    Obeidullah and keep him under surveillance at Constantinople, while measures
                    have been taken to prevent any immediate renewal of disturbances on the
                    frontier.</p>
                <p>The policy of the Persian Government towards its Kurdish subjects has been not
                    very dissimilar to the Turkish programme. Aware of the military efficiency of
                    the tribes, the Persian crown as long ago as the time of Nadir Shah transferred
                    a large colony of Shadillu and Zafferanlιi Kurds to the Khorâsân frontier,
                    where, enjoying the rich lands of Bùjnùrd and Kuchân, and strengthened by a line
                    of fortresses, they have ever since been engaged in unceasing conflict with the
                    Turkomans of the Attock, and from whence they afforded invaluable assistance,
                    both in carriage and supplies, to the Russian columns in their late advance into
                    the country of the Akhâls. Persia has also raised several regiments of regular
                    infantry from the Kurdish Shek⅛ks of the north, as well as from the Gurâns and
                    Kalhιirs of the south, while the shah has also placed Persian governors over the
                    Kurdish districts south of Lake Urumieh, and has appointed princes of the blood
                    to administer the more distant and unruly Kurdish provinces of Ardelan and
                    Kirmânshàhân. At present perhaps the only communities among whom a spirit of
                    Kurdish nationality may be said to flourish free from the taint, be it for good
                    or be it for bad, of foreign influence, are the Deyrsimlis of the upper
