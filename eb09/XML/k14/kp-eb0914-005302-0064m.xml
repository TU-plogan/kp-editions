                    one of the smaller Falcons, originating probably from its peevish and languid
                    cry. This bird, though in the form of its bill and length of its wings one of
                    the true Falcons, and by many ornithologists placed among them under its
                    Linnaean name of <hi rend="italic">Falco</hi><hi rend="italic">tinnunculus,</hi>
                    is by others referred to a distinct genus <hi rend="italic">Tinnunculus</hi> as
                    <hi rend="italic">T. alaudarius—</hi> the last being an epithet wholly
                    inappropriate. We have here a ease in which the propriety of the custom which
                    requires the establishment of a genus on structural characters may seem open to
                    question. The differences of structure which separate <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tinnunculus</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Falco</hi> are of the slightest, and,
                    if insisted upon, in the way some systematists have done, must lead to including
                    in the former birds which obviously differ from Kestrels in all but a few
                    characters arbitrarily chosen; and yet, if structural characters be set aside,
                    the Kestrels form an assemblage readily distinguishable by several peculiarities
                    from all other <hi rend="italic">Falconidae,</hi> and an assemblage that the
                    instinct of real ornithologists (though this is treading upon dangerous ground)
                    does not hesitate to separate from the true Falcons of the genus <hi

                    >Aesalon,</hi><hi rend="italic">IIypotriorchis,</hi> and the rest (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Falcon,</hi> voh ix. p. 2). Scarcely any one outside the walls
                    of an ornithological museum or library would doubt for a moment whether any bird
                    shewn to him were a Kestrel or not; and Mr Gurney believes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ibis,</hi> 1881, p. 277) that the aggregation of species placed by Mr Sharpe
                    <hi rend="italic">(Cat. Birds Brit. Museum,</hi> i. pp. 423-448) under the
                    generic designation of <hi rend="italic">Cerchneis</hi> (which should properly
                    be <hi rend="italic">Tinnunculus)</hi> includes “three natural groups
                    sufficiently distinct to be treated as at least separate subgenera, bearing the

                <p>The ordinary Kestrel of Europe, <hi rend="italic">Falco</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tinnunculus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tinnunculus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >alaudarius,</hi> is by far the commonest bird of prey in the British Islands,
                    and is too common and well-kuown a bird to need any description. It is almost
                    entirely a summer migrant, coming from the south in early spring and departing
                    in autumn, though examples (which are nearly always found to be birds of the
                    year) occasionally occur iu winter, some arriving on the eastern coast in
                    autumn. It is most often observed while practising its habit of hanging in the
                    air for a minute or two in the same spot, by means of short and rapid beats of
                    its wings, as, with head pointing to windward and expanded tail, it is looking
                    out for prey,—which consists chiefly of mice, but it will at times take a small
                    bird, and the remains of frogs, insects, and even earth-worms have been found in
                    its crop. It generally breeds in the deserted nest of a Crow or I’ie, but
                    frequently in rocks, ruins, or even in hollow trees— laying four or five eggs,
                    mottled all over with dark brownish-red, sometimes tinged with orange and at
                    other times with purple. Though it may occasionally snatch up a young Partridge
                    or Pheasant,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>When what
                    are called ‘ ‘ tame” Pheasants are bred, a Kestrel will often contract the bad
                    habit of infesting the coops and carrying off the young birds. This evil may
                    easily be stopped, but it should not lead to the relentless persecution of the
                    species, especially when it is remembered that the Kestrel is in the first place
                    attracted to the spot by the presence of the mice which come to eat the
                    Pheasants’ food.</p></note> the Kestrel is quite the most harmless bird-of-prey,
                    if it be not, from its destruction of mice and cockchafers, a most beneficial
                    species. It is a species of very wide range, extending over nearly the whole of
                    Europe from 68° N. lat., and the greater part of Asia— though the form which
                    inhabits Japan and is abundant in north-eastern China has been by some writers
                    deemed distinct and called <hi rend="italic">T. jαponicus—</hi> and it also
                    pervades the greater part of Africa, becoming, however, scarce in southern
                    latitudes, and unknown beyond Fantee on the west and Mombasa on the east coast
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1881, p. 457). The southern countries of Europe
                    have also another and smaller species of Kestrel, <hi rend="italic">T.
                    tinnunculoides</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cenchris</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T. ηaumanni</hi> of some writers), which is
                    widely spread in Africa and Asia, though specimens from India and China are
                    distinguished as <hi rend="italic">T. pekinensis.</hi></p>
                <p>Three other species are found in Africa as well— <hi rend="italic">Τ. rupicola,
                    T. rupicoloides,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T. aloρex—</hi> the first of which
                    is a common bird in the Cape Colony, while the others occur in the interior.
                    Some of the islands of the Ethiopian region have peculiar species of Kestrel, as
                    the <hi rend="italic">T. ηewtoηi</hi> of Madagascar, <hi rend="italic">T.
                    punctatus</hi> of Mauritius, and <hi rend="italic">T. gracilis</hi> of the
                    Seychelles; while, on the opposite side, the Kestrel of the Cape Verd Islands
                    has been separated as <hi rend="italic">T. neglectus.</hi></p>

                <p>The next species deserving of notice is that of America, <hi rend="italic">T.
                    sparverius,</hi> commonly known in Canada and the United States as the
                    “Sparrow-Hawk”—a beautiful little bird, though not more courageous than the rest
                    of its relations. Various attempts have been made to recognize several species,
                    more or less in accordance with locality, but the majority of ornithologists
                    seem unable to accept the distinctions which have been elaborated chiefly by Mr
                    Sharpe <hi rend="italic">{ut supra)</hi> and Mr Ridgway <hi rend="italic">{North
                    American Birds,</hi> iii. pp. 159-175), the former of whom recognizes six
                    species, while the latter now admits but three, <hi rend="italic">T. sparverius,
                    T. leucophrys,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T. sparverioides,</hi> with five
