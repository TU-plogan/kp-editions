                    41' and 28’ 42' N. lat., and 80’ 4' 30" and 81’ 23' E. long., bounded on the N.
                    by the river Mohan, separating it from Nepâl, E. by the Kauriâla river,
                    separating it from Bharâich district, S. by Sitâpur district, and W. by
                    Shâhjahânpur district in the North-Western Provinces, with an area of 2963
                    square miles.</p>
                <p>Kheri district consists of a series of fairly elevated plateaus, separated by
                    rivers flowing from the north-west, each of which is bordered by a belt of
                    alluvial land. The rivers are, commencing from the east, the Kauriâla, Suheli,
                    Dahâwar, Chauka, Ul, Jamwâri, Kathna, Gumti, and Sukheta. North of the Ul, the
                    country is considered very unhealthy. This tract probably formed in ancient
                    times the bed of a lake, through which flow two rivers, the Kauriâla and Chauka,
                    changing their courses constantly, so that the whole surface is seamed with
                    deserted river beds much below the level of the surrounding country. The
                    vegetation is very dense, and the stagnant waters are the cause of endemic
                    fevers. The people reside in the neighbourhood of the low ground, as the soil is
                    more fertile and less expensive to cultivate than the forest-covered uplands.
                    South of the Ul, the scene changes. Between every two rivers or tributaries
                    stretches a plain, considerably less elevated than the tract to the north. There
                    is very little slope in any of these plains for many miles, and marshes are
                    formed, from which emerge the head-waters of many secondary streams, which in
                    the rains become dangerous torrents, and frequently cause devastating floods.
                    The general drainage of the country is from north-west to south-east. Several
                    large lakes exist, some formed by the ancient channels of the northern rivers
                    being fine sheets of water, from 10 to 20 feet deep and from 3 to 4 miles long;
                    in places they are fringed with magnificent groves. In the south there are some
                    other large natural lakes. The whole north of the district is covered with vast
                    forests—occupying an area of 650 square miles, of which 423 square miles are now
                    Government reserves. <hi rend="italic">Säl</hi> occupies about two-thirds of the
                    whole forest area. <hi rend="italic">Kankar</hi> (nodular limestone) of good
                    quality is met with, and saltpetre is manufactured in large quantities. The wild
                    animals include tigers, leopards, black buck, spotted deer, hogdeer, and <hi
                    rend="italic">nilgdi.</hi></p>
                <p>At the census of 1869 the population was returned at 746,350 (males 403,837,
                    females 342,513)—Hindus, 671,686; Mohammedans, 74,307; Christians, 96; “others,”
                    261. Allowing for recent transfers, the latest return (based on the above
                    census) gives the population at 739,283. All the towns now existing are of
                    recent foundation, none dating earlier than the 16th century. Of their origin,
                    one common tale is told. The Musalmân or Bajput founder came through the λvoods
                    and marshes, and seized upon the slight hills or hummocks upon which some Pasi
                    or Ahir patriarch ruled over a few mud huts. The rightful owner fled deeper into
                    the forest, and the intruder built a block house or a brick fort to guard
                    against his return. Only three towns in 1869 contained upwards of 5000
                    inhabitants, namely, Kheri, Muhamdi, and Oel, with an aggregate population of
                    19,087. Lakhimpur, the civil station, is the only municipality in the district.
                    The area under the chief agricultural products is returned as follows:—rice,
                    166,811 acres; wheat, 135,081; other food grains, 851,133; oil-seeds, 29,380;
                    sugar-cane, 41,065; cotton, 6739; tobacco, 8265; vegetables, 6644; fibres, 419
                    acres. Poppy and indigo are also cultivated. District manufactures are confined
                    to weaving and cotton printing for local requirements. Grain of all kinds is
                    exported, as also are turmeric, tobacco, timber, sugar, syrup, hides, bullocks,
                    and <hi rend="italic">ghi.</hi> Catechu is made in large quantities throughout
                    the north of the district, from the <hi rend="italic">khαir</hi> tree <hi
                    rend="italic">(Acacia Catechu),</hi> the heart-wood of which is chopped out and
                    boiled down by a caste called Khairis. <hi rend="italic">Khaskhas
                    (Andropogon</hi><hi rend="italic">muricatum),</hi> the roots of which are used
                    for matting <hi rend="italic">tatti</hi> screens, is exported in large
                    quantities to Benares and Patna. Two great annual religious trading fairs are
                    held at Gola Gokarannath—one in January attended by about 50,000 people, and the
                    other in February, lasting about fifteen days, at which 150,000 persons are said
                    to assemble. This great fair is increasing rapidly in importance, goods to the
                    value of about £15,000 being sold annually by traders from all parts of India.
                    The imports, which consist mainly of cotton, salt, country cloth, and English
                    piece goods, considerably exceed the exports in value. The district revenue in
                    1870 amounted to £74,132, of which £62,471 was derived from the land-tax. In
                    respect of education, Kheri is the most backward district in Oudlι. The mean
                    annual temperature is about 79° Fahr.; the mean rainfall during the eleven years
                    ending 1874 was 47 ’ 3 inches.</p>
                <p>The present district only dates its history as an administrative unit from 1858.
                    At the time of the mutiny of 1857 it was divided between the districts of
                    Muhamdi and Mallâpur, and was not constituted a separate district till the
                    reorganization of the province on the pacification of the country.</p>
