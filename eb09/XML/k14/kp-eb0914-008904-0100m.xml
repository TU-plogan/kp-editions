                    market-town of England, county of Surrey, extends for about a mile and a half
                    along the right bank of the Thames, and is distant from London about 20 miles by
                    the river and 12 miles by rail and road. The ancient wooden bridge over the
                    river, which was in existence as early as 1224, was superseded by a structure of
                    stone in 1827. The town is irregularly built, but its suburbs contain many fine
                    houses and villas embosomed in trees, and of late years it has been rapidly
                    increasing. Public walks and gardens have been constructed along the river. The
                    parish church of All Saints, chiefly Perpendicular in style, contains several
                    brasses of the 15th century; the grammar school, rebuilt in 1878, was originally
                    founded as a chantry by Edward Lovekyn in 1305, and converted into a school by
                    Queen Elizabeth. Near the parish church stood until 1779 the chapel of St Mary,
                    where, it is alleged, the Saxon kings were crowned. The ancient stone said to
                    have been used as a throne at these coronations was removed to the market-place
                    in 1850. A town hall in the Italian style was erected in 1840, the former
                    building having been a very ancient structure. There are several foundation
                    schools and a large number of charities. The growth of the town has been owing
                    chiefly to the increasing number of London business men who have made it their
                    residence, its proximity to Richmond park and Hampton Court no doubt aiding its
                    popularity. There are large market gardens in the neighbourhood, and the town
                    possesses oil-mills, flour-mills, breweries, and brick and tile works. A little
                    distance up the river are the works of several London water companies. An annual
                    cattle fair is held in November, and county assizes are held at Lent. The
                    population of the municipal borough in 1881 was 19,875.</p>
                <p>Kingston doubtless derived its name from the fact that at an early period it was
                    a royal demesne. On digging the foundation for the new bridge a large number of
                    important Roman remains were discovered, and on this account many believe that
                    it was at this spot that Caesar crossed the Thames when in pursuit of
                    Cassivelaunus. In 838 it was the seat of a witenagemot convened <pb break="no"

                    978 it was the place where the Anglo-Saxon kings were crowned. Kingston returned
                    members to parliament from the 4th of Edward II. to the 47th of Edward III. It
                    received a charter of incorporation from King John, which was confirmed and
                    extended by several subsequent monarchs. In 1264 the castle of Kingston, no
                    trace of which now remains, was taken by Henry III. In 1648 it was made the
                    rendezvous of forces designed for the release of Charles I. from the Isle of
                    Wight, but in the skirmish near the town the Royalists were defeated, and Lord
                    Francis Villiers was killed.</p>
