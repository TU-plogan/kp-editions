                    though marked off from the surrounding territory by no very definite confines,
                    may be said to lie between 12° and 16° N. lat. and between 29° 30' and 32° 30'
                    E. long. On the east it does not reach the Nile, and on the west it is usually
                    held to be separated from Darfur by a neutral strip of country. It consists for
                    the most part of a rolling steppe in which a hill of 50 feet is a landmark for a
                    day’s journey; but towards the west there are a few isolated peaks such as Jebel
                    Abu Senun and Jebel Kordofan, which rise to a height of 150 to 800 feet above
                    the plain, and in the north-west there are two considerable groups, Jebel Katul
                    and Jebel Kagga. The general elevation of the country above sea-level is given
                    as from 1410 to 1840 feet. A granitic sand with abundance of mica and felspar
                    forms the upper stratum throughout the greater part of the area; but an
                    admixture of clay, which is observable in the north, becomes strongly marked in
                    the south, where there are also stretches of black vegetable mould. Beneath
                    there appears to unfold itself an unbroken surface of mica schist. River or
                    stream there is really none, though a few temporary watercourses or <hi
                    rend="italic">khhrs</hi> exist in the rainy season; and the only permanent lakes
                    are El Birkeh, El Rahad, and Shirkeleh, which are formed by the great Khor Abu
                    Hable in the south. During the rainy season the water collects in myriads of
                    little depressions, but owing partly to rapid evaporation and partly to the
                    porous character of the soil the surface of the country is soon as dry as
                    before. The water which has found its way through the granitic sand flows over
                    the surface of the mica schist and settles in the hollows. Wells consequently
                    sunk so as to reach the solid rock obtain a supply of water more or less
                    abundant according to the spot which they happen to strike; and it is the
                    existence of these which renders human life possible in Kordofan. It is
                    estimated that (apart from those in a few areas of depression—Cagmar, Abu
                    Haraze, Bara, and Mulbes—where the sand stratum is very thin and water is
                    reached at the depth of a few feet) there are about 900 of these wells. They are
                    narrow shafts going down from 75 to 150 or 200 feet, and supported “from the
                    bottom to a little above the water-level” by the long roots of the mimosa, wound
                    round so as to form a complete casing. The water ⅛ raised by rope and bucket at
                    the cost of enormous labour, and none is available for irrigation. The very
                    cattle are trained to go a long time without drinking. Entire villages migrate
                    after harvest to the neighbourhood of some plentiful well; and in El Obeyd water
                    becomes a regular article of trade soon after the close of the rains. As there
                    is no highland area draining into Kordofan, the underground reservoirs are
                    dependent on the local rainfall, and a large number of the wells are dry during
                    many months. The rainy season lasts from June to September, rain falling every
                    three or four days in brief but violent showers. The wind during that period is
                    from the south or southwest; the air is extremely oppressive; and fevers prevail
                    among the foreign residents. In September the north winds begin to take their
                    turn, and from the middle of October they blow steadily throughout the winter,
                    and produce what Europeans consider a delightful climate. With March begins the
                    dry and sultry summer. The settled population of Kordofan is estimated at
                    164,740, the nomadic at 114,000. The former, who are scattered over the country
                    in about eight hundred and sixty villages, are of very mingled blood, especially
                    in the neighbourhood of the capital, but the Ghodiat, Gilledat, and Gowanieh
                    appear to be the original stock. Of the nomadic tribes the most noteworthy are
                    the Hasanieh, the Kababish, and the Bagara. The last-mentioned—who roam about
                    the southern parts of the country—are a dark red-bronze race remarkable for
                    their magnificent physique. The staple crop in Kordofan is the dokhn or <hi
                    rend="italic">Penicillaria typhoides.</hi> Eaten both uncooked and in various
                    culinary conditions, it forms the main food of nine-tenths of the population,
                    and <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n152/mode/1up"

                    Kordofan beer or merissa. Cattle are largely bred by the Bagara, and camels by
                    the Kababish; aud horses, goats, donkeys, and sheep are kept in small numbers.
                    Since the ostrich has been almost hunted out of the country the chief article of
                    importance for trade is the gum yielded by the many mimosa trees, which along
                    with the hijlij, the tamarisk, and the talh tend to relieve the monotony of the
                    steppe. Salt and iron ore exist within the province, but they have not become of
                    any practical value.</p>
                <p>Of the movements by which the present composite ethnology of Kordofan was
                    attained little record is recoverable. In 1790 Sheikh Nasib of Sennaar
                    subjugated the district; and under his rule the inhabitants prospered. But,
                    piqued by his neighbour’s success, Ibn Fadhl of Darfur invaded Kordofan with a
                    powerful army numbering no less than 12,000 or 14,000 camels, and completely
                    defeated the Sennaar governor Melek il Hashma. The Darfur supremacy continued
                    till 1821 when Mohammed Aly undertook the conquest of Nubia and Sennaar. The
                    defterdar, Mohammed Aly’s son-in-law, subjugated Kordofan, and continued to rule
                    it with worse than a rod of iron till he was recalled on account of his
                    cruelties.</p>
