                <p>and S. E. by the English Channel, S.W. by Sussex, and W. by Surrey. Its greatest
                    breadth north and south from Sheerness to Dungeness is 35 miles, its length
                    north-west to south-east from London to Dungeness about 60 miles, and its length
                    west to east from Surrey to North Foreland in Thanet 65 miles. The area is
                    1,004,984 acres, or 1570 square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coast Line.—</hi> About two-thirds of the boundary line of Kent
                    is formed by tidal water. The estuary of the Thames may be said to stretch from
                    London Bridge to Sheerness in the Isle of Sheppey, to the north-west of which
                    the estuary of the Medway cuts off a tongue of land whose extremity is termed
                    the Isle of Grain. Along the banks of the Thames the coast is low and marshy,
                    embankments being in several places necessary to prevent inundation. In the
                    estuary of the Medway there are a number of low marshy islands, but Sheppey
                    presents to the sea a range of chalk cliffs from 80 to 90 feet in height. The
                    marshes extend along the estuary of the Swale to Whitstable, whence stretches a
                    low line of clay and sandstone cliffs, succeeded at the Isle of Thanet by the
                    white chalk cliffs which extend southwards to Pegwell Bay. The coast from
                    Sheppey round to the South Foreland is skirted by numerous flats and sands, the
                    most extensive of which, the Goodwin sands, forming the breakwater of the
                    well-known anchorage of the Downs, are said to have formed part of the estate of
                    Earl Godwine, and to have been submerged as late as 1097. From Pegwell Bay to
                    near Deal the outline of the coast is flat, but thence it rises again into chalk
                    cliffs, which continue round the South Foreland to Folkestone, where they are
                    succeeded by the flat shingly shore bordering Romney Marsh. A considerable
                    portion of Romney Marsh has been reclaimed from the sea since the time of Julius
                    Caesar, but in nearly every other portion of the coast the sea has been gaining
                    on the land.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface and Geology.—</hi> Kent abounds in beautiful and
                    finely-wooded valleys with undulating and picturesque uplands. A tract from 7 to
                    8 miles broad lying to the south of the estuary of the Thames, and extending
                    eastwards as far as Thanet, belongs to the London Tertiary basin, and is formed
                    chiefly either of London or of plastic clay. The London Clay occupies the tongue
                    of land between the estu tries of the Thames and Medway, as well as Sheppey and
                    a district of country about 8 miles wide stretching southwards from Whitstable
                    to Canterbury, and extending eastwards to the Isle of Thanet. It reappears at
                    Pegwell Bay, and in the neighbourhood of London it rises above the plastic clay
                    into the elevation of Shooter’s Hill, with a height of about 450 feet, and a
                    number of smaller eminences. The thickness of the formation near London is about
                    400 feet, and at Sheppey it reaches 480 feet. At Sheppey it is rich in various
                    kinds of fossil fish and shells. The plastic clay, which rests chiefly on chalk,
                    occupies the remainder of the estuary of the Thames, but at several places it is
                    broken through by outcrops of chalk, which in some instances run northwards to
                    the banks of the river. The Lower Tertiaries are represented by three different
                    formations known as the Thanet beds, the Woolwich and Reading beds, and the
                    Oldhaven and Blackheath beds. The Thanet beds resting on chalk form a narrow
                    outcrop rising into cliffs at Pegwell Bay and Reculvers, and consist (1) of a
                    constant base bed of clayey greenish sand, seldom more than 5 feet in thickness;
                    (2) of a thin and local bed composed of alternations of brown clay and loam; (3)
                    of a bed of fine light buff sand, which in West Kent attains a thickness of more
                    than 60 feet; (4) of bluish grey sandy marl containing fossils, and almost
                    entirely confined to East Kent, the thickness of the formation being more than
                    60 feet; and (5) of fine light grey sand of an equal thickness, also
                    fnssiliferous. The middle seriesof the Lower Tertiaries, known as the Woolwich
                    and Reading beds, rests either on the Thanet beds or on chalk, and consists
                    chiefly of irregular alternations of clay and sand of very various colours, the
                    former often containing estuarine and oyster shells and the latter flint
                    pebbles. The thickness of the formation varies from 15 to 80 feet, but most
                    commonly it is from 25 to 40 feet The highest and most local series of the Lower
                    Tertiaries is the Oldhaven and Blackheath beds lying between the London Clay and
                    the Woolwich beds. They consist chiefly of flint pebbles or of light-coloured
                    quartzose sand, the thickness being from 20 to 30 feet, and are best seen at
                    Oldhaven and Blackheath. To the south the London basin is succeeded by the North
                    Downs, an elevated ridge of country consisting of an outcrop of chalk which near
                    Westerham on the borders of Surrey reaches an elevation of 812 feet above
                    sea-level, and at several other places more than 600 feet. It extends from
                    Westerham to Folkestone, with an irregular breadth generally of from 3 to 6
                    miles, but expanding to nearly 12 miles at Dartford and Gravesend and also to
                    the north of Folkestone. After dipping below the London Clay at Canterbury, it
                    sends out an outcrop which forms the greater part of Thanet, and towards the sea
                    is often broken off into precipitous escarpments. To the south of the Downs
                    there is a narrow valley formed by the Gault, a fossiliferous blue clay. This is
                    succeeded by an outcrop of the Lower Greensand, which extends across the country
                    from west to east with a breadth of from 2 to 7 miles, and rises into the
                    picturesque elevations of the Ragstone hills. These in several cases reach a
                    height of over 600 feet, and have a steep slope southwards, overlooking the
                    valley which extends from the borders of Sussex to Hythe. This low ground is
                    occupied chiefly by the Weald clays, which contain a considerable number of
                    marine and freshwater fossils. Along the borders of Sussex there is a narrow
                    strip of country consisting of picturesque sandy hills, whose highest elevation
                    is nearly 400 feet; and the south-west corner of the county is occupied by
                    Romney Marsh, which within a comparatively recent period has been recovered from
                    the sea.</p>
                <p>The London Clay is much used for bricks, coarse pottery, and Roman cement. Lime
                    is obtained from the Chalk and Greensand formations. Ironstone is found in the
                    Wealden clays and calcareous ironstone in the Ashdown sand, but the industry has
                    long been discontinued. The last Wealden furnace was put out in 1828.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.—</hi> The Thames, which forms the northern boundary of
                    the county, receives the Ravensbourne at Deptford, and the Darent or Dart, which
                    has a course of 18 miles, and becomes navigable at Dartford. The Medway, which
                    has a course of over 50 miles, and with its tributaries drains a basin having an
                    area of 680 square miles, is formed of several streams that rise in the
                    neighbourhood of Tunbridge Wells, and of East Grinstead in Sussex. After passing
                    Ashurst and Penshurst it receives the Eden from the west, and at Yalding in the
                    Weald the Teise and Beult. At Chatham it widens into an estuary, the greater
                    portion of its waters ultimately joining the Thames at Sheerness, and the other
                    portion passing southwards to the sea through the Swale Channel. The river is
                    tidal as high as Maidstone. The Stour, which has a course of nearly 50 miles,
                    and with its tributary the Little Stour drains an area of about 380 square
                    miles, has its origin in several streams which spring from the Lower Greensand
                    and the Chalk, the two main branches, which have their source near Lenham and
                    near Hythe respectively, uniting at Ashford. At Sarre the Stour separates into
                    two branches which insulate the Isle of Thanet, the smaller portion flowing
                    northward to the sea near Reculver, the other and main portion flowing eastward
                    to Pegwell Bay. The stream is tidal and navigable<pb break="no"

                    rises in the Lower Chalk near Lyminge, and joins at Stourmouth that branch of
                    the Stour which falls into the sea at Pegwell Bay. The Dour, a small stream
                    which gives its name to Dover, has a course of little more than 3 miles from
                    Ewell to the sea. The Rother, which has its source in Sussex, forms for some
                    distance the boundary between that county and Kent, and along with several of
                    its branches insulates the Isle of Oxney.</p>
                <p>The only canals at all in use are that which runs along the borders of Romney
                    Marsh, connecting the Rother with the sea at Hythe, but now partly filled up;
                    and that between Gravesend and Rochester, which is partly occupied by a line of
                    railway.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate, Soil, and Agriculture.—</hi> The insalubrity of
                    certain portions of the county caused by extensive marshes has been almost
                    wholly removed by draining. In the north-eastern districts the climate is a
                    little uncertain, and damage is often done to early fruit blossoms and
                    vegetation by cold easterly winds. In the large portion of the county sheltered
                    by the Downs the climate is milder and more equable, and vegetation is somewhat
                    earlier. The soil is very various in character, but on the whole rich and under
                    high cultivation. The methods of culture and the kinds of crop produced are
                    perhaps more widely diversified than those of any other county in England. Upon
                    the London Clay the land is generally heavy and stiff, but very fruitful when
                    properly manured and cultivated. The marsh lands along the banks of the Thames,
                    Medway, Stour, and Swale consist chiefly of rich chalk alluvium. The Chalk
                    formation is in some cases overlaid by London Clay, alluvium, or brickearth, but
                    in the higher chalk districts the soil is often poor and thin, and in some
                    places much mixed with flints. In the Isle of Thanet a light mould predominates,
                    which has been much enriched by fish manure. The valley of the Medway,
                    especially the district round Maidstone, which has been called the garden of
                    England, is the most fertile part of the county, the soil being a deep loam with
                    a subsoil of brick-earth. On the ragstone the soil is occasionally thin and much
                    mixed with small portions of sand and stone; but in some situations the ragstone
                    has a thick covering of clay loam, which is most suitable for the production of
                    hops and fruits. In the district of the Weald marl prevails, with a substratum
                    of clay. The soil of Romney Marsh is a clay alluvium.</p>
                <p>According to the agricultural returns for 1881, the total area under crops
                    comprehended 745,215 acres, a percentage of 73‘9 instead of 71 '7 in 1870; corn
                    crops had an area of 224,211 acres, a percentage of 22 ’ 3 instead of 25’1 in
                    1870; green crops 85,614 acres, a percentage of 8 '5 instead of 7'4; rotation
                    grasses 53,421 acres, a percentage of 5’3 instead of 6 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 2; permanent pasture 327,079 acres, a percentage of 31 ’ 8 instead of
                    28’2. The area under permanent pasture thus exceeds that under corn crops by
                    nearly a third. The area under woods in 1881 was 82,849 acres, under orchards
                    16,673, under market gardens 4221, and under nursery grounds 670. Of the corn
                    crops the most largely grown is wheat, which in 1881 occupied 84,388 acres, oats
                    coming next with 52,177 acres, and barley and bere occupying only a little less,
                    50,010 acres. Beans and pease were grown on 17,453 and 19,762 acres
                    respectively, and rye on only 421 acres. In Thanet mustard, spinach, canary seed
                    and a variety of other seeds are raised. Of green crops, turnips and swedes were
                    grown on 27,254 acres, vetches and similar crops on 22,179 acres, potatoes
                    17,815, mangolds 12,070, cabbage 5843, and carrots 452. Part of the area under
                    green crops is occupied by market gardens, which are very numerous in the
                    neighbourhood of London. The principal orchard districts are the valleys of the
                    Darent and Medway, and the Tertiary soils overlying the Chalk, between Kochester
                    and Canterbury. The county is specially famed for cherries and filberts, but
                    apples, pears, plums, gooseberries, and currants are also largely cultivated. In
                    some cases apples, cherries, filberts, and hops—the special crop of the
                    county—are grown in alternate rows. 41,476 acres were under hops in Kent in
                    1881, and in the United Kingdom only 64,943 acres. The principal hop districts
                    are the country in East Kent lying between Canterbury and Faversham, the valley
                    of the Medway in Mid Kent, and the district of the Weald. The area under hops in
                    these several districts in 1881 was 11,718, 17,353, and 11,986 acres
                    respectively,— other districts contributing only 419 acres. Much of the Weald,
                    which originally was occupied by a forest, is still densely wooded. There are
                    many fine woods scattered throughout the county, especially in the valley of the
                    Medway, oak and beech being the trees principally grown. A large extent of
                    woodland is ash and chestnut plantations—maintained for the growth of
                    hop-poles.</p>

                <p>About two-thirds of the holdings are less than 50 acres in extent, but the
                    largest area—about two-fifths of the whole—is in farms between 100 and 300
                    acres.</p>
                <p>The number of horses in 1881 was 29,450, an average of 3 ’ 9 to every 100 acres
                    under cultivation, the average for England and also for Great Britain being 4 ’
                    4. The number of horses used for. agricultural purposes was 24,177. The total
                    number of cattle in 1881 was 73,409, an average of 19‘9 (England 16 ’ 9, Great
                    Britain 18’4) to every 100 acres under cultivation. The number of cows in milk
                    or in calf was 29,485, and of other cattle 43,924. Cattle are grazed in large
                    numbers on the marsh lands along the estuaries of the rivers, and of course
                    dairy farms are very numerous in the neighbourhood of London. The number of
                    sheep in 1881 was 952,311, an average of 128’9 (England 62 <hi

                    325,187. A breed of sheep peculiar to the district, known as Kents, is grazed on
                    Romney Marsh, but Southdowns are the principal breed raised on the uplands. Pigs
                    in 1881 numbered 55,896, or an average of 7 ’ 5 (England 7, Great Britain 6 <hi

                <p>According to the landowners’ return, 1872-73, the land, exclusive of that in the
                    metropolis, was divided between 34,683 proprietors, and its gross annual value
                    was £3,357,057. Of the owners, 26,925, or more than 77 per cent., possessed less
                    than 1 acre, and the average value per acre over all was £3, 10s. 7⅛d. There
                    were four proprietors possessing above 10,000 acres each, viz., Viscount
                    Holmsdale, 15,162 acres; Lord Sondes, 14,446; Sir H. Tufton, 13,639; and the
                    Ecclesiastical Commissioners, Whitehall, 10,591. Other seventeen possessed more
                    than 5000 acres each.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures and Trade.—</hi> At one time there were extensive
                    ironworks in the Weald of Kent, and woollen cloth was also largely manufactured,
                    but the former industry is now wholly extinct, and the latter is only prosecuted
                    to a very small extent. Next to the occupations connected with the Government
                    establishments at Deptford, Woolwich, Chatham, and Sheerness (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dockyards,</hi> vol. vii. p. 310), the most important industry
                    of the county is that of paper, which is carried on on the banks of the Cray,
                    Darent, Medway, and other streams in the west of the county. Shipbuilding by
                    private firms is also prosecuted at Greenwich, Gravesend, Dover, Northfleet, and
                    Ramsgate. At Greenwich there are engineering works, soap works, and chemical
                    works; and the carriage and engine works of the South-Eastern Railway are
                    situated at Ashford. Manufactories of silk, cotton, linen, wool, and ribbons
                    give employment in various towns and villages. Bricks, tiles, pottery, and
                    cement are fabricated, especially on the banks of the Swale and Medway.
                    Lime-burning and whiting-making are also carried on. There are powder-mills at
                    Dartford, Faversham, and Tunbridge. The principal ports besides those on the
                    Thames and Medway are Whitstable, Herne Bay, Margate, Broadstairs, Ramsgate,
                    Sandwich, Deal, Dover, and Folkestone. The watering-places are Erith,
                    Greenhithe, Northfleet, Gravesend, Herne Bay, Margate, Westgate, Broadstairs,
                    Ramsgate, Deal, Dover, Folkestone, and Sandgate. Tunbridge Wells is a favourite
                    spa.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fishing.—</hi> Deep-sea fishing is largely prosecuted all round
                    the coast of Kent. Shrimps, soles, and flounders are caught in great numbers in
                    the estuaries of the Thames and Medway and along the coast of Whitstable and
                    Margate as well as at Ramsgate. The principal oyster beds are at Queenborough,
                    Rochester, Milton, Faversham, and Whitstable, and whitebait frequent the Thames
                    in immense shoals below Greenwich.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> As the main pathway of communication between

                    railway intercourse; and it is now very completely intersected with railway
                    lines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> Kent is divided into five lathes—a
                    partition peculiar to the county, and dating from Anglo-Saxon times. The lathes
                    are St Augustine, Shepway, Scray, Aylesford, and Sutton-at-Hone. The county
                    comprises 61 hundreds, the lowey of Tunbridge, the franchise and barony of
                    Bircholt, the liberty of the Isle of Sheppey, the liberty of New Romney; two
                    cities, Canterbury (21,701) and Rochester (21,590), which are also municipal and
                    parliamentary boroughs; one parliamentary borough, Chatham (46,806); five
                    boroughs which are both municipal and parliamentary, viz., Dover (28,486),
                    Gravesend (m. 23,375, p. 31,355), Hythe (m. 4069, p. 28,066), Maidstone (m.
                    29,638, p. 39,662), Sandwich (m. 2846, p. 15,566); part of the parliamentary
                    borough of Greenwich and five municipal boroughs, viz., Deal (8422), Faversham
                    (8627), Folkestone (18,887), Margate (15,889), and Tenterden (3620). The liberty
                    of New Romney and all the municipal boroughs except Gravesend and Maidstone are
                    included among the Cinque Ports. The Cinque Port districts in Kent are those of
                    Sandwich, partly in Essex, Dover, Hythe, New Romney, and a portion of Rye,
                    namely, Tenterden (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Cinque Ports,</hi> vol. v. p. 786).
                    Until 1867 Kent was for parliamentary purposes formed into only two divisions,
                    East and West Kent, but by the Reform Act of that year West Kent was divided
                    into West and Mid Kent. The city of Canterbury, which returns two members, Dover
                    and Sandwich, which return two members each, and Hythe, which returns one
                    member, are included in East Kent, which returns in all nine members. In Mid
                    Kent are included the city of Rochester, returning two members, Maidstone,
                    returning two members, and Chatham and Gravesend, returning one member each; it
                    returns in all eight members. West Kent, which returns two members, includes
                    part of the borough of Greenwich, which returns two members. The total
                    representation of the county, including Greenwich, is thus twenty-one members.
                    The county has one court of general sessions and two of quarter sessions; the
                    number of sessional divisions is sixteen, exclusive of the liberty of Romney
                    Marsh, which has petty and general sessions under its charters. The central
                    criminal court has jurisdiction over certain parishes in the county. The city of
                    Canterbury (a county in itself), the city of Rochester, and the boroughs of
                    Gravesend and Maidstone have commissions of the peace and separate courts of
                    quarter sessions, as have also the ports and boroughs of Deal, Dover, Faversham,
                    Folkestone, Hythe, Margate, Sandwich, and Tenterden. The ancient borough of
                    Queenborough, governed by an old charter, has a recorder and a court of quarter
                    sessions with a separate jurisdiction limited to misdemeanours. Summary cases
                    are dealt with by the mayor and magistrates in petty sessions. With the
                    exception of the portion included in the metropolitan police district, the shire
                    for judicial purposes belongs to the south-eastern circuit, and for police
                    purposes is divided into twelve districts, which are generally identical with
                    the petty sessional divisions. The cities of Canterbury and Rochester, the
                    boroughs of Deal, Dover, Faversham, Folkestone, Gravesend, Hythe, Maidstone,
                    Margate, Sandwich, and Tenterden, and the towns of Ramsgate (22,605) and
                    Tunbridge Wells (24,309) have their own police. Ecclesiastically, with the
                    exception of portions of two paπshes, Kent is within the dioceses of Canterbury
                    and Rochester; and it contains thirtyseven civil parishes or places, as well as
                    parts of other parishes extending into adjoining counties.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> Since 1801, when itnumbered 308,667, the
                    population has been rapidly and uninterruptedly increasing. In 1821 it was
                    427,224, and in 1841 it had increased to 549,353, in 1861 to 733,381, in 1871 to
                    848,294, and in 1881 to 977,585, of whom 477,715 were males and 499,870
                    females.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> A tribe of the Belgae from Gaul
                    had before the time of Caesar’s invasion taken possession of a large portion of
                    southern Britain, including Kent. The remarkable cromlech, Kit’s Coity House,
                    near Aylesford, belongs to this early period, as do numerous earthworks,
                    encampments, stone circles, and excavations on the coast which are now generally
                    regarded as ancient chalk pits. The spot of Caesar’s landing was probably either
                    some part of the coast between Walmer and Thanet—the neighbourhood of Deal
                    finding most supporters—or the <hi rend="italic">Portus Lemanis</hi> in Romney
                    Marsh, which is identical with the town of Lymne. In his first invasion he did
                    not penetrate farther than Kent, and the absence of lapidary inscriptions is
                    regarded as evidence that its conquest was easily effected. The principal Roman
                    road was the Watling Street, between <hi rend="italic">Dubris</hi> (Dover) and
                    London, which had much the same course as the present highway. This road was
                    joined at <hi rend="italic">Durovernum</hi> (Canterbury) by two others, one from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Portus Lemanis</hi> (Lymne) and the other from <hi
                    rend="italic">Regulbium</hi> (Reculver). The traces of the road from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Portus Lemanis</hi> are still well marked throughout its whole
                    extent, but agricultural operations have almost wholly obliterated the traces of
                    that from <hi rend="italic">Regulbium.</hi> Of two other Roman stations, <hi
                    rend="italic">Durolevum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vagniacse,</hi> the site
                    cannot be absolutely determined, but most probably the former was near
                    Faversham, and for the latter, which was somewhere between Rochester and London,
                    most opinions favour Springhead near Gravesend. There are still important
                    remains of Roman fortresses at Dover, Richborough, Reculver, and Lymne; many
                    traces of Roman villas have also been discovered; and portions of Roman
                    structures have frequently been utilized in the construction of churches and
                    other buildings. A great variety of Roman relies have been discovered in nearly
                    every part of the county. The most remarkable are profuse traces of extensive
                    potteries of purple or black ware at Upchurch on the south bank of the Medway,
                    leaden coffins elaborately ornamented, and glass and bronze vessels in various
                    Roman cemeteries. The earliest Teutonic settlement, under Hengest and Horsa,
                    took place in Kent; and, on the arrival of Augustine in 597, Canterbury became
                    the Christian metropolis of the island. Separate kings appear to have
                    occasionally ruled in East and West Kent; and a bishopric was established at
                    Rochester, in West Kent, as well as at Canterbury. Of this period of Kentish
                    history the principal antiquarian remains are the cemeteries; from those at
                    Sarre and Osengal in Thanet, and at Bifrons, Barham, Bishopsbourne, Gilton, and
                    Sittingbourne, a large number of relics of various kinds have been obtained.
                    Some old customs belonging to this period, including that of gavelkind in cases
                    of intestacy, are still extant. Kent in 823 was united by Egbert to the kingdom
                    of the West Saxons. In the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries it suffered greatly
                    from the ravages of the Danes. After the Conquest the earldom of Kent, which had
                    been held by Godwine and afterwards by Harold, was bestowed by William on his
                    brother Odo bishop of Bayeux. Among other events of historic importance the
                    following may be mentioned :—the capture of Rochester by William Rufus in 1088,
                    an incident connected with the rebellion of Odo, which was subdued in the same
                    year; the murder of Thomas à Becket at Canterbury in 1170; the submission of
                    King John to the pope’s legate at Dover in 1215; the capture of Rochester Castle
                    by King John in the same year, and of the same castle by the dauphin of France
                    in 1216, the greater part of Kent formally submitting to him with the exception
                    of Dover Castle; Wat Tyler's insurrection in 1381 and that of Jack Cade in 1450;
                    the encampment of Cornish insurgents at Blackheath in 1497, where they were
                    surprised by Henry VII.; the insurrection of Sir Thomas Wyatt, which was
                    commenced at Maidstone in 1554; the suppression of the Kentish insurrection by
                    Fairfax at Maidstone, June 1, 1648; and the burning of certain ships at Chatham
                    by tfie Dutch fleet under De Ruyter in 1667 after the fort of Sheeraess had been
                    levelled by his guns.</p>
                <p>As was to be expected from its connexion with the early history of England, and
                    from its beauty and fertility, Kent possessed a larger than average number of
                    monastic foundations. The earliest were the priory of Christ’s Church and the
                    abbey of St Peter and St Paul now called St Augustine’s, both at Canterbury,
