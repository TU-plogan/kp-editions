                    son of Thomas Ken of FurnivaΓs Inn, who belonged to an ancient stock,—that of
                    the Kens of Ken Place, in Somersetshire; his mother was a daughter of the now
                    forgotten poet, John Chalkhill, who is called by Walton an “acquaintant and
                    friend of Edmund Spenser.” It may be mentioned that Ken’s stepsister, Anne, was
                    married to Izaak Walton in 1646, a connexion which brought Ken from his boyhood
                    under the refining influence of this gentle and devout man. In 1652 he entered
                    Winchester College, and in 1656 became a student of Hart Hall, Oxford. He gained
                    a fellowship at New College in 1657, and proceeded B.A. in 1661 and M.A. in
                    1664. He was for some time tutor of his college; but the most characteristic
                    reminiscence of his university life is the mention made by Anthony Wood that in
                    the musical gatherings of the time “Thomas Ken of New College, a junior, would
                    be sometimes among them, and sing his part.” Ordained in 1662, when he was
                    twenty-five years old, he successively held the livings of Little Easton in
                    Essex, Brighstone (sometimes called Brixton) in the Isle of Wight, and East
                    Woodhay in Hampshire; in 1672 he resigned the last of these, and returned to
                    Winchester, being by this time a prebendary of the cathedral, and chaplain to
                    the bishop, as well as a fellow of Winchester College. He remained there for
                    several years, <pb facs="ht:mdp.39015074635338&amp;seq=42"

                    this time that he wrote, primarily for the same body as his prayers, his
                    morning, evening, and midnight hymns, the first two of which, beginning “Awake,
                    my soul, and with the sun” and “Glory to Thee, my God, this night,” are now
                    household words wherever the English tongue is spoken. The latter is often made
                    to begin with the line “All praise to Thee, my God, this night,” but in the
                    earlier editions over which Ken had control, the line is given as above.<note

                    Lord Selborne sufficient evidence that the alteration had Ken’s
                    authority.</p></note> In 1674 Ken paid a visit to Rome in company with young
                    Izaak Walton, and this journey seems mainly to have resulted in confirming his
                    regard for the Anglican communion. In 1679 he was appointed by Charles II.
                    chaplain to the Princess Mary, wife of William of Orange. While with the court
                    at the Hague, he incurred the displeasure of William by insisting that a promise
                    of marriage, made to an English lady of high birth by a relative of the prince,
                    should be kept; and he therefore gladly returned to England in 1680, when he was
                    immediately appointed one of the king’s chaplains. He was once more residing at
                    Winchester in 1683 when Charles came to the city with his doubtfully composed
                    court, and his residence was chosen as the home of Nell Gwynne; but Ken stoutly
                    objected to this arrangement, and succeeded in making the favourite find
                    quarters elsewhere. We find him in August of this same year accompanying Lord
                    Dartmouth to Tangiers as chaplain to the fleet, and Pepys, who was one of the
                    company, has left on record some quaint and kindly reminiscences of him and of
                    his services on board. The fleet returned in April 1684, and a few months after,
                    upon a vacancy occurring in the see of Bath and Wells, Ken, now Dr Ken, was
                    appointed bishop. It is said that, upon the occurrence of the vacancy, Charles,
                    mindful of the high and pure spirit he had shown at Winchester, exclaimed,
                    “Where is the good little man that refused his lodging to poor Neill” and
                    determined that no other should be bishop. The consecration took place at
                    Lambeth, January 25, 1685; and one of Ken’s first duties was to attend the
                    death-bed of Charles, where his wise and faithful ministrations won the
                    admiration of everybody except Bishop Burnet. In this year he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Exposition on the Church Catechism,</hi> which is perhaps better
                    known by its sub-title, <hi rend="italic">The Practice of Divine Love.</hi> His
                    public life as bishop is mainly remembered from the stand he took upon two
                    memorable occasions. In 1688, when James reissued his “Declaration of
                    Indulgence,” Ken was one of the “seven bishops” who refused to publish it. He
                    was probably influenced by two considerations :—first, by his profound aversion
                    to Roman Catholicism, to which he felt he would be giving some episcopal
                    recognition by compliance; but, second and more especially, by the feeling that
                    James by his arbitrary action was compromising the spiritual freedom of the
                    church. Along with his six brethren, Ken was committed to the Tower, June 8,
                    1688, on a charge of high misdemeanour; the trial, which took place on the 29th
                    and 30th of the month, and which resulted in a verdict of acquittal, is matter
                    of history. With the revolution which speedily followed this impolitic trial,
                    new troubles encountered Ken; for, having sworn allegiance to James, he thought
                    himself thereby precluded from taking the oath to William of Orange.
                    Accordingly, he took his place among the non-jurors, and, as ho stood firm to
                    his refusal, he was, in August 1691, superseded in his bishopric by Dr Kidder,
                    dean of Peterborough. From this time he lived mostly in retirement, finding a
                    congenial home with Lord Weymouth, his friend from college days, at Longleat in
                    Somersetshire; and, though pressed to resume his diocese in 1703, upon the death
                    of Bishop Kidder, he declined, partly on the ground of growing weakness, but
                    partly no doubt from his love for the quiet life of devotion which he was able
                    to lead at Longleat. His death took place there upon the 19th of March 1711.</p>
                <p>Although Ken wrote much poetry, besides his hymns, he cannot be called a great
                    poet; but he had that fine combination of spiritual insight and feeling with
                    poetic taste which marks all great hymnwriters. As a hymn-writer he has had few
                    equals in England; it can scarcely be said that even Kcble, though possessed of
                    much rarer poetic gifts, surpassed him in his own sphere (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hymns,</hi> vol. xιi. p. 592). In his own day he took high rank
                    as a pulpit orator, and even royalty had to beg for a seat amongst his
                    audiences; but bis sermons are now forgotten. He lives in history, apart from
                    his three hymns, mainly as a man of unstained purity and invincible fidelity to
                    conscience, weak only in a certain narrowness of view which is a frequent
                    attribute of the intense character which he possessed. As an ecclesiastic he was
                    α High Churchman of the old school.</p>
                <p>Ken’s poetical works were published in collected form by W. Hawkins, his relative
                    and executor, in 1721, and extended to four volumes; his prose works were issued
                    in 1838 in one volume, under the editorship of J. T. Round. A brief memoir was
                    prefixed by Hawkins to a selection from Ken’s works which he published in 1713;
                    and a life, in two volumes, by the Rev. W. L. Bowles, appeared in 1830. But the
                    standard biography of Ken is that of J. Lavieount Anderdon (<hi rend="italic"
