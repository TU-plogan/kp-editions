                    his younger brother), was his principal oral teacher. The valuable literary
                    treasures of his father, however, falling into his hands, Redak grew strong by
                    studying them, and, as we know, eclipsed them completely, although he lacked his
                    father’s originality. But, if Rabbi David lacked originality, he had abundance
                    of instinct for finding out the best in the works of his predecessors, and
                    abundance of genius for digesting and assimilating it till it became his own in
                    a peculiar way. Although preceded by Hayyùj, Ibn Janâh, and others, and
                    succeeded by Abraham de Balmes, Elias Levita, and others, Kimhi has maintained
                    the position of the greatest Jewish grammarian and lexicographer for six hundred
                    and fifty years. And, although much inferior as a Biblical scholar and talmudist
                    to Rashi, and as a critic and philosopher to Abraham Ibn Ezra, he has
                    outstripped both in the eyes, not only of the Christians, but to some extent
                    even of the Jews, and thus reigned supreme for more than half a millennium, as a
                    commentator on the Bible. The fact is, he united in his own person the childlike
                    simplicity of Rashi and the incisive criticism of Ibn Ezra. Add to this that he
                    was master of the Targums and Aggadoth as few before or after him, that he had
                    Hebrew, Arabic, and Greek philosophy at his fingers’ ends, and that he was
                    endowed with a truly poetical soul, and the mystery is explained how the merely
                    reproductive scholar could cause original scholars of the highest eminence, but
                    who were one-sided, to be all but forgotten. Not only have his works, in
                    whatever field they are to be found, been printed and reprinted, but the most
                    important of them are translated <pb break="no"
