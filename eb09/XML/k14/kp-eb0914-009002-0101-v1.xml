                        Giles</hi></label> (1814-1880), boys’ novelist, was born in London, February
                    28, 1814. Much of his youth was spent at Oporto, where his father was a
                    merchant, but when he joined his father in business, and afterwards when he
                    carried on business for himself, he lived chiefly in London. In 1844 his first
                    book, <hi rend="italic">The Circassian Chief</hi> appeared, and its success led
                    to the publication in 1845 of <hi rend="italic">The Prime Minister, a Story of
                        the Days of the Great Marquis of Pornbal.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lusitanian Sketches</hi> that appeared soon after describe Kingston’s
                    travels in Portugal. In 1851 <hi rend="italic">Peter the Whaler,</hi> his first
                    book for boys, came out. That and its immediate successors were received with
                    such unequivocal popularity that Kingston retired from business, and devoted
                    himself to the production of tales of adventure for boys. Within thirty years he
                    wrote upwards of one hundred and thirty such books. He travelled at various
                    times in many of the countries of Europe, and lived for a while in Portugal
                    during the civil war there. His <hi rend="italic">Western Wanderings,</hi>
                    published in 1856, describes a tour in Canada. In all philanthropic schemes
                    Kingston took deep interest; he was the promoter of the mission to seamen; and
                    he acted as secretary of a society for promoting an improved system of
                    emigration. He was a supporter of the volunteer movement in England from the
                    first. For his services in bringing about a commercial treaty between Portugal
                    and Britain he was knighted by the queen of Portugal; and his literary merits
                    were recognized at home by a grant from his own sovereign. He died at Willesden,
                    August 5,1880.</p>
                <p>Kingston’s boyish ambition had been to enter the navy, and he always kept his
                    affection for the sea. As he advanced in life he had opportunities of cruising
                    in men-of-war, besides sailing in merchantmen and his own yacht; and it was thus
                    that he gained the knowledge of practical seamanship that he used so graphically
                    in his books. Most of his stories are stories of the sea; and he generally laid
                    his plots in the old romantic days before England’s wooden walls had given place
                    to iron-clads. He was a master of the simple romance in which boys delight, and
                    knew well how to draw the peculiar compound of valour and magnanimity that forms
                    the hero to healthy boyhood. He had great assimilative power in using the
                    accounts of travellers in countries where he had never been; and his imagination
                    supplied him abundantly with gallant adventures, thrilling dangers, and
                    hairsbreadth escapes. His books are useful in insinuating knowledge whilst they
                    are giving pleasure, and they are valuable inasmuch as their whole tone is pure,
                    wholesome, and manly. Characteristic specimens of his works are <hi
                        rend="italic">The Three Midshipmen; The Three Lieutenants; The Three
                        Commanders ∙,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Three Admirals.</hi>
                    Occasionally his books were not in the form of a story; and some of them are
                    designed for adult readers.</p>
