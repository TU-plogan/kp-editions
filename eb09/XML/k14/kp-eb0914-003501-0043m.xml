                <p><label type="entry">KENILWORTH</label>, a small town of Warwickshire, is
                    pleasantly situated on a tributary of the Avon, on the railway from Coventry to
                    Leamington, 5 miles distant from both towns, and 99 miles north from London. The
                    town is only of importance from its antiquarian interest and the magnificent
                    ruins of its old castle. The most probable derivation of its name, which in
                    Domesday is written <hi rend="italic">Chinewrde,</hi> is from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cenundf,</hi> king of the Mercians, and <hi rend="italic">werthe,</hi> a
                    dwelling-place. The old royal residence of the Saxon kings was destroyed in the
                    wars between Edward and Canute. The manor of Kenilworth was bestowed by Henry I
                    on Geoffrey de Clinton, afterwards lord chiefjustice, who erected the earlier
                    portion of the present castle. By his grandson Henry de Clinton it was given to
                    King John, and it remained a royal residence until the time of Henry III., who
                    granted it to Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester. After the battle of Evesham,
                    14th August 1265, at which Simon de Montfort was slain, the rebel forces rallied
                    at the castle, when it sustained a siege of six months, but finally capitulated
                    to Henry III., who bestowed it on his son Edmund. After being used as the prison
                    of Edward II. previous to his removal to Berkeley, it came into the possession
                    of John of Gaunt, by whom it was greatly enlarged. On his son becoming king as
                    Henry IV., it was made a royal residence, and it remained in the possession of
                    the crown until Queen Elizabeth in 1562 granted it to Robert Dudley, earl of
                    Leicester, who spent a large sum in restoring it, and whose splendid
                    entertainments there to Elizabeth are described in Scott’s novel of <hi
                    rend="italic">Kenilworth.</hi> During the civil war it was dismantled by the
                    soldiers of Cromwell, and it was thenceforth abandoned to decay. Since the
                    Restoration it has belonged to the house of Clarendon. The walls of the castle
                    originally enclosed an area of 7 acres. The principal portions of the building
                    still remaining are the gatehouse, now used as a dwelling-house; CaesaPs tower,
                    the only portion built by Geoffrey de Clinton now extant, with massive walls 16
                    feet thick; the Merwyn’s tower of the novel of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kenilworth·,</hi> the great hall built by John of Gaunt with windows of very
                    beautiful design; and the Leicester buildings, which are in a very ruinous
                    condition. Not far from the castle are the remains of an Augustinian monastery
                    founded in 1122, and afterwards made an abbey. Adjoining the abbey is the parish
                    church of St Nicholas, restored in 1865, an old structure of mixed architecture,
                    and containing a fine Norman doorway, which is supposed to have been the
                    entrance of the former abbey church. The town, which possesses large tanneries,
                    is under the government of a local board. Population in 1871, 3880; in 1881,
                    4150.</p>
