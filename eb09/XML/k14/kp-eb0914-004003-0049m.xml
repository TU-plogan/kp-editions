                    nun, was, it is said, when with child sentenced to be thrown from one of the
                    precipices of Dunpelder (Traprain Law, formerly Dumpender Law, in Haddington),
                    but miraculously escaping was exposed in a boat to the mercy of the sea and
                    landed on the sand at Culenross (Culross), where she gave birth to the child. On
                    the spot where the boat reached land there was at one time a small chapel
                    dedicated to St Kentigern. According to the tradition, St Servanus (who,
                    however, lived two hundred years after Kentigern) took special care of the
                    mother and child, calling the mother Taneu (Thanew) and the child Kentigern,
                    “head master or lord.” Afterwards he also named him, on account of his
                    intelligence and the graces of his character, Munghu <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n52/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0052-0041"/> (Mungo), “dearest friend.” As, however, the
                    favour with which he was regarded by Servanus had awakened the animosity of his
                    fellow pupils, he secretly made his escape, and ultimately found his way to
                    Cathures (Glasgow), near a cemetery which had been long consecrated by St
                    Ninian. There he dwelt for some time with two brothers named Telleyr and Anguen,
                    when on account of the fame of his manner of life and his miraculous deeds the
                    king and clergy of Cumbria, in order to restore the religion of Christianity to
                    its former influence, called over a bishop from Ireland and caused Kentigern to
                    be consecrated bishop. His cathedral seat he named Glasgu, “the dear family,”
                    where he collected a number of friends and disciples who practised continence
                    and lived after the manner of the primitive church. On his life being
                    threatened, he journeyed to Menevia (St David’s) in South Wales, where he
                    founded the monastery of Llanelwy, afterwards St Asaph’s. When Roderick ascended
                    the throne of Cumbria, Kentigern returned, and after establishing his see for
                    some time at Hoddam, Dumfriesshire, he settled finally at Glasgow. He is said to
                    have died on a Sunday, and as his saint’s day is the 13th January, he probably
                    died in 603.</p>
                <p>The fragment of a life of St Kentigern, composed at the instance of Herbert,
                    bishop of Glasgow, who died in 1164, and made use of by John of Fordun, is
                    preserved in a manuscript of the British Museum. It was first printed by Cosmo
