                        or <hi rend="smallcaps">Desolation Island</hi></label>, an island in the
                    Southern Ocean, to the south-east of the Cape of Good Hope and south-west of
                    Australia, and nearly half-way between them. To the south is Heard Island, and
                    west-north-west the Crozets and the Marion Group. Kerguelen lies between 48° 39'
                    and 49° 44' S. lat., and 68° 42' and 70° 35' E. long. Its extreme length is
                    about 85 miles, and its extreme breadth 79, but the area is only about 2050
                    square miles. The island is throughout mountainous, presenting from the sea in
                    some directions the appearance of a series of jagged peaks. The various ridges
                    and mountain masses are separated by steepsided valleys, which run down to the
                    sea, forming deep fjords, so that no part of the interior is more than 12 miles
                    from the sea. The chief mountain peaks are Mount Ross (6120 feet), Mount
                    Richards (4000), Mount Crozier, (3258), Mount Wyville Thomson (3160), Mount
                    Hooker (2600), Mount Moseley (2400). The coast-line is extremely irregular, many
                    of the fjords being bounded by long, steep rocky promontories. These, at least
                    on the north, east, and south, form a series of well-sheltered harbours; as the
                    prevailing winds are westerly, the safest anchoring ground is on the north-east.
                    Christmas Harbour on the north and Royal Sound on the south are noble harbours,
                    the latter with a labyrinth of islets interspersed over upwards of 20 miles of
                    landlocked waters. The scenery is generally magnificent, and often singularly
                    picturesque. A district of considerable extent in the centre of the island is
                    occupied by snowfields, whence glaciers descend east and west to the sea. The
                    whole island, exclusive of the snowfields, abounds in freshwater lakes and pools
                    in the hills and lower ground. Hidden deep mudholes are frequent.</p>
                <p>Kerguelen’s Land is of undoubted volcanic origin, the prevailing rock being
                    basalt, sometimes intersected by trap, and indeed an active volcano and hot
                    springs are said to exist on the south-west of the island. Judging from the
                    abundant fossil remains of trees, the island must at one time have been thickly
                    clothed with woods and other vegetation, of which it has no doubt been denuded
                    by volcanic action and submergence, and possibly by change of climate. It
                    presents evidences of having at one time been subjected to powerful glaciation,
                    and to subsequent immersion and immense denudation. The soundings made by the
                    “Challenger” and “Gazelle,” and the affinities which in certain respects exist
                    between the islands, seem to point to the existence at one time of an extensive
                    land in this quarter, of which Kerguelen, Prince Edward’s Islands, the Crozets,
                    St Paul, and Amsterdam are the remains. The Kerguelen plateau rises in many
                    parts to within 1500 fathoms of the surface of the sea. Beds of coal and of red
                    earth are found at some places. The summits of the flat-topped hills about Betsy
                    Cove, in the south-east of the island,’are formed of caps of basalt. Sir J. D.
                    Hooker points out that the vegetation of Kerguelen’s Land must be of great
                    antiquity, and may have originally reached it from the American continent; it
                    has no affinities with Africa. The present climate is not favoural le <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0060-0049"/> to permanent vegetation: the island lies
                    within the belt of rain of all seasons of the year, and is reached by no drying
                    winds; its temperature is kept down by the surrounding vast expanse of sea; and
                    it lies within the line of the cold Antarctic drift. The temperature is,
                    however, very equable. During the transit expedition, the lowest winter
                    temperature was seldom less than 32°, while the summer temperature occasionally
                    approached 70°. Tempests and squalls are frequent, and the weather is rarely
                    calm. On the lower slopes of the mountains a rank vegetation exists, which, from
                    the conditions just mentioned, is constantly saturated with moisture. A rank
                    grass, <hi rend="italic">Festuca</hi><hi rend="italic">Cookii,</hi> grows
                    thickly in places up to 300 feet, with <hi rend="italic">Azorella,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Cotula plumosa,</hi><hi rend="italic">kc.</hi> Sir J. D.
                    Hooker enumerates twenty-one speciesof flowering plants, and seven of ferns,
                    lycopods, and <hi rend="italic">Char-</hi><hi rend="italic">aceae;</hi> at least
                    seventy-four species of mosses,twenty-five of <hi rend="italic">Hepaticae,</hi>
                    and sixty-one of lichens are known, and there are probably many more. Several of
                    the marine and many species of freshwater algae are peculiar to the island. The
                    characteristic feature of the vegetation, however, is the Kerguelen cabbage <hi
                        rend="italic">{Pτinglea antiscorbutiea),</hi> a perennial cruciferous plant,
                    in appearance somewhat like the garden cabbage. This cabbage and <hi
                        rend="italic">Azorella</hi> are found growing at a height of 1000 feet,
                    while on the higher rocks a very handsome conspicuous lichen <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Neuropogon Taylori),</hi> of a mingled bright sulphur-yellow and black
                    colour, is found abundantly. Fur seals are still found in Kerguelen, though
                    their numbers have been greatly reduced by reckless slaughter. One of the most
                    characteristic animals of the island is the sea elephant (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Macrorhinus</hi><hi rend="italic">leoninus),</hi> which is found in
                    considerable abundance even far up the streams that flow into the fjords. The
                    sea-leopard <hi rend="italic">{Ogmorrhinus teρtonyx)</hi> is pretty abundant on
                    the coasts. All parts of the coast and even the lower slopes are covered with
                    penguins of various species, mainly the Johnny penguin <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Pygoscelis</hi><hi rend="italic">taeuiata),</hi> rock-hopper <hi

                        rend="italic">gigantea),</hi><hi rend="italic">Halobaena coerulea,</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">Prion</hi><hi rend="italic">desolatus</hi> frequent the
                    island, as also skuas, gulls, sheathbills <hi rend="italic">{Ghionis
                        minor),</hi> albatross, terns <hi rend="italic">{Sterna</hi><hi

                    Cape pigeons. The island shelters a considerable variety of insects, many of
                    them with remarkable peculiarities of structure, and with a predominance of
                    forms incapable of flying. The island is frequented by sealers and whalers, but
                    has no permanent inhabitants. Kerguelen’s Land was discovered by the French
                    navigator Kerguelen Tremarec (born 1745, died 1797), on February 13, 1772, and
                    partly surveyed by him in the following year. It was subsequently visited by
                    Captain Cook, andalsoby Sir James C. Ross inl840inthe “Erebus” and “Terror.” It
                    has occasionally formed a refuge for shipwrecked sailors. The “Challenger” spent
                    some time at the island, and its staff visited and surveyed various parts of it
                    in January 1874. Later in the same year it was occupied for several months
                    (October 1874 to February 1875) by the expeditions sent from England, Germany,
                    and the United States to observe the transit of Venus. Still the interior is all
                    but unexplored, and we have only vague notions of a considerable part of the
                    coast. The Admiralty chart is based chiefly on mining surveys and information
                    obtained from whalers.</p>
