                    importance to our earliest years, years in which, as he said, lies the tap-root
                    of much of the thought and feeling of after life. Although the analogies of
                    nature had constantly been referred to before Froebel’s days (“First the blade,
                    then the ear, then the full corn in ear ”), and Bacon, speaking of education,
                    had said that the gardener bestows the greatest care on the young plants, the
                    Renaissance left the imparting theory of education so firmly fixed on the mind
                    of Europe that for two hundred years the developing theory could hardly get a
                    hearing, and little was done to reduce it to practice before the attempt of
                    Pestalozzi. Pestalozzi and other great thinkers (notably Comenius), who attached
                    much importance to the first years of life, looked to the mother as the sole
                    educator. But in the case of the poor the mother might not have time to attend
                    to her children; so towards the end of the last century Pestalozzi planned and
                    Oberlin formed day-asylums for young children, the benefit of which was intended
                    no less for the mother than the child. Schools of this kind took in the
                    Netherlands the name of “play school,” and in England, where they have
                    especially thriven, of “infant schools.” But Froebel’s idea of the
                    “Kindergarten” differed essentially from that of the infant schools. He
                    maintained that there was something to do for young children which even the
                    ideal mother in the ideal family could not do. The child required to be prepared
                    for society by being early associated with its equals; and young children thus
                    brought together might have their employments, especially their chief
                    employment, play, so organized for them as to draw out their capacities <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n91/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0091-0080"/> of feeling and thinking, and even of inventing
                    and creating.</p>
                <p>According to the development theory all education must be based on study of the
                    nature to be developed. Froebel’s study of the nature of children showed him
                    that their great characteristic was restlessness. This was, first, restlessness
                    of body, delight in mere motion of the limbs; and, secondly, restlessness of
                    mind, a constant curiosity about whatever came within the range of the senses,
                    and especially a desire to examine with the hand every unknown object within
                    reach. Children’s fondness for using their hands was specially noted by Froebel,
                    and he found that they delighted, not merely in examining by touch, but also in
                    altering whatever they could alter, and further that they endeavoured to imitate
                    known forms whether by drawing or by modelling in putty or clay. Besides
                    remarking in them these various activities, he saw that children were sociable
                    and needed the sympathy of companions. There was, too, in them a growing moral
                    nature, passions, affections, and conscience, which needed to be controlled,
                    responded to, cultivated. Both the restraints and the opportunities incident to
                    a well-organized community would be beneficial to their moral nature, and prove
                    a cure for selfishness.</p>
                <p>Froebel held that the essence of all education was to be found in rightly
                    directed but spontaneous action. So the children must be employed; and at that
                    age their most natural employment is play, especially, as Wordsworth has pointed
                    out, games in which they imitate and “con the parts” they themselves will have
                    to fill in after years. Froebel agreed with Montaigne that the games of children
                    were “their most serious occupations,” and with Locke that “all the plays and
                    diversions of children should be directed towards good and useful habits, or
                    else they will introduce ill ones” <hi rend="italic">{Thoughts concerning
                    Education,</hi> § 130). So he invented a course of occupations, most of which
                    are social games. Many of the games are connected with the “gifts,” as he called
                    the series of simple playthings provided for the children, the first being the
                    ball, “the type of unity.” The “gifts” are chiefly not mere playthings but
                    materials which the children work up in their own way, thus gaining scope for
                    their power of doing and inventing and creating. The artistic faculty was much
                    thought of by Froebel, and, as in the education of the ancients, the sense of
                    rhythm in sound and motion was cultivated by music and poetry introduced in the
                    games. Much care was to be given to the training of the senses, especially those
                    of sight, sound, and touch. Intuition or first-hand experience <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anschauung)</hi> was to be recognized as the true basis of knowledge, and
                    though stories were to be told, and there was to be much intercourse in the way
                    of social chat, instruction of the imparting and “learning-up” kind was to be
                    excluded. Froebel sought to teach the children not what to think but how to
                    think, in this following in the steps of Pestalozzi, who had done for the child
                    what Bacon nearly two hundred years before had done for the philosopher. Where
                    possible the children were to be much in the open air, and were each to
                    cultivate a little garden.</p>
                <p>To judge by. all appearances at the present date (1881), the kindergarten will be
                    an important institution in the education of the future. The first kindergarten
                    was opened at Blankenburg, near Rudolstadt, in 1840, but after a needy existence
                    of eight years was closed for want of funds. In 1851 the Prussian Government
                    declared that “schools founded on Froebel’s principles or principles like them
                    could not be allowed.” But the idea had far too much vitality to be starved or
                    frowned down. Although its progress has not been rapid, it has been constant. As
                    early as 1854 it was introduced into England by the then famous Ronges, and
                    Henry Barnard reported on it that is was ‘ ‘ by far the most original,
                    attractive, and philosophical form of infant development the world has yet seen”
                    <hi rend="italic">(Report to Governor of Connecticut,</hi> 1854). But the
                    attempt failed, and though there are now a Froebel Society, an institution for
                    training young women to conduct kindergartens, and also some good kindergartens,
                    Froebel’s idea has hardly yet found a home in Britain. The great propagandist of
                    Froebelism, the Baroness Marenholtz-Bülow, drew the attention of the French to
                    the kindergarten from the year 1855, and Michelet declared that Froebel had
                    “solved the problem of human education.” In the department of the Seine the
                    “Salles d’asile” now consist of a class for children from two to four years old,
                    and a “Froebel class” of children from four to six. In Italy the kindergarten
                    has been introduced by Madame Salis-Schwabe, and is used in the education of the
                    poor. In Austria it is recognized and regulated by the government, though the
                    Volks-Kindergiirten are not numerous. But by far the greatest developments of
                    the kindergarten system are in the United States and in Belgium. Dr William T.
                    Harris, assisted by Miss Blow, tried the experiment of making the kindergarten a
                    part of the public education in St Louis eight years ago, and there are now no
                    less than 8000 children, all over five years of age, in the St Louis public
                    kindergartens. In Belgium the mistresses of the “Écoles gardiennes” have for
                    some time been instructed in the “idea of the kindergarten” and “Froebel’s
                    method,” and in 1880 the minister of public instruction, Van Humbeeck, issued a
                    programme for the “Écoles Gardiennes Communales,” which is both in fact and in
                    profession a kindergarten manual. This programme attributes the improvement in
                    infant schools to “le souffle puissant de Froebel”; and, after explaining that
                    the method to be adopted is based on the laws which govern the development of
                    the child, the minister continues: “In its great principles as well as in its
                    main applications this method is that created by the genius of Froebel.” This
                    estimate of Froebel’s principles contrasts strangely with the Prussian
                    minister’s thirty years earlier.</p>
