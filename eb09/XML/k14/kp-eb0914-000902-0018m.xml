                    among the spurs of Hindu Kush, has been already spoken of under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hindu Kush</hi> (vol. xi. p. 838). Since that was published, a
                    work <hi rend="italic">[Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh,</hi> Calcutta, 1880) has
                    come from the pen of Major Biddulph, the only European known to have visited the
                    state, and we here enter a very few corrections or new particulars from his
                    work. The geographical position of Kâshkâr is likely to give it great interest
                    in the future. A considerable part of Upper Kâshkâr belongs to Yassin, in the
                    Gilgit basin (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gilgit,</hi> vol X. p. 597). Indeed the
                    left bank of the Chitrâl river, down to within 20 miles of Chitrâl itself,
                    belongs to Yassin. The chief place of this Upper Kâshkâr is Mastûj (vol. X. p.
                    596). The rulers of the two states are of the same blood, sprung from a
                    Khorâsâni adventurer who immigrated hither about the first half of the 17th
                    century, aud are respectively descended from two brothers of his family, Shâh
                    Katôr and Shah Khûshwakt, who lived a century later. The two royal families are
                    hence known as <hi rend="italic">Katoré</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Khûshwaktê</hi> respectively; they generally act in concert, though neither is
                    dependent on the other. We know not the origin of the former name, but most
                    probably it is connected with an ancient tribal name in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Kâfiristân</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.).</hi> The ruler of Chitrâl is known
                    both as <hi rend="italic">Mihtar,</hi> or “Prince,” and by the pretentious title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Badshcιh.</hi> He has five viziers, of whom the chief, or
                    Dewân-begi, has charge of the king’s slave-agency, an important part of the
                    reigning system. Under this the rulers of Chitrâl have come to regard the sale
                    of their subjects as a legitimate and ordinary supplement to tlιeir revenue. But
                    of late the market has become circumscribed. The population of the kingdom is
                    estimated at 200,000, not including the tributary tribe of Bashgali Kafirs, who
                    occupy a nearly parallel valley on the west, confluent with that of Kâshkâr. The
                    ethnology of Kâshkâr is very intricate. The largest, and probably aboriginal,
                    population are called <hi rend="italic">Kho.</hi> Their language, <hi
                    rend="italic">Khowâr,</hi> is closely allied to the dialects of the Kafir
                    tribes. There are also tribes in a depressed position, immigrants from the other
                    side of the watershed, and speaking the language of Munjân, a hill canton of the
                    Oxus valley, calling themselves <hi rend="italic">Yidghâh.</hi> In the lower
                    part of the valley is a race, also with a peculiar language, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Gabar</hi> (mentioned by Sultan Baber), and some broken tribes of
                    Siâhposh, &lt;Lc. All these constitute the lower or <hi rend="italic">ryot</hi>
                    class, who alone pay regular revenue, cannot hold slaves, and are styled <hi
                    rend="italic">fakir mushkin</hi> (“poor beggars ”). Above them are several
                    privileged classes, descended from the founders of the reigning family, or from
                    older ruling families also of foreign blood. We may add that Chitrâl is
                    identical with the <hi rend="italic">Shang-mi</hi> of Hwen Tsang (644 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ad</hi>), see .7. <hi rend="italic">R. Λs. Soc.,</hi> new ser.,
                    vol. vi. p. 114. A somewhat later Chinese record gives, as an alternative name
                    of Shang-mi, <hi rend="italic">Khiu-wei,</hi> which evidently contains the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kh &gt;</hi> just mentioned. In this <hi rend="italic">Kho</hi>
                    also we have probably an element of <hi rend="italic">Choaspes,</hi> the Greek
                    name of the Chitrâl river. A singular point in Chitrâl history is the fact that
                    it was invaded by a Chinese army about the middle of last century, probably in
                    1759-60, and continued to send occasional tribute to China at least to 1769,
                    t&gt;., twelve years after the battle of Plassy. This was brought to notice by
                    the present writer in 1872 («7. <hi rend="italic">R. G. S.,</hi> xlii. 477),
                    when tracing the curious history of the name <hi rend="italic">Bolor.</hi> And
                    now Major Biddulph has found in the country itself the memory of the Chinese
                    invasion, and thus entire corroboration of the identification of the Chinese <hi
                    rend="italic">Poloeul</hi> or Bυlor with Kâshkâr. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h.
                    y.)</hi></p>
