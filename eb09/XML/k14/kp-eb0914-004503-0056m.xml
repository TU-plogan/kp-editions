                    the duchy of Wurtemberg, of which town his grandfather was burgomaster. He was
                    the eldest child of an ill-assorted and ill-starred union. His father, Henry
                    Kepler, was a reckless soldier of fortune; his mother, Catherine Gulden-mann,
                    the daughter of a small proprietor of Leonberg, had a violent temper,
                    unmitigated by even the rudiments of culture. Under these circumstances her
                    husband found campaigning in Flanders under Alva a welcome relief from domestic
                    life; and, after having lost his fortune by a forfeited security and tried
                    without success the trade of tavern-keeping in the village of Elmendingen, he
                    finally, in 1589, severed an irksome tie by the desertion of his family. The
                    misfortune and misconduct of his parents were not the only troubles of young
                    Kepler’s childhood. He recovered from small-pox in his fourth year with crippled
                    hands and eyesight permanently impaired; and a constitution enfeebled by
                    premature birth had to withstand successive shocks of severe illness. His
                    schooling began at Leonberg in 1577—the year, as he himself tells us, of a great
                    comet; domestic bankruptcy, however, occasioned his transference to field-work,
                    in which he was exclusively employed for several years. Bodily infirmity,
                    combined with mental aptitude, were eventually considered to indicate a
                    theological vocation; he was accordingly, in 1584, placed at the seminary of
                    Adelberg, and thence removed, two years later, to that of Maulbronn. A brilliant
                    examination for the degree of bachelor procured him, in 1588, admittance on the
                    foundation to the university of Tübingen, where he laid up a copious store of
                    classical erudition, and imbibed Copernican principles from the private
                    instructions of his teacher and life-long friend, Michael Maestlin. As yet,
                    however, he had little knowledge of, and less inclination for, astronomy; and it
                    was with extreme reluctance that he turned aside from the more promising career
                    of the ministry to accept, early in 1594, the vacant chair of that science at
                    Gratz, placed at the disposal of the Tübingen professors by the Lutheran states
                    of Styria.</p>
                <p>The best-recognized function of German astronomers in that day was the
                    construction of prophesying almanacs, greedily bought by a credulous public, and
                    quickly belied by the future they pretended to disclose. Kepler thus found that
                    the first duties required of him were of an astrological nature, and set himself
                    with characteristic alacrity to master the rules of the art as laid down by
                    Ptolemy and Cardan. He, moreover, sought in the events of his own life a
                    verification of the theory of planetary influences; and it is to this practice
                    that we owe the summary record of each year’s occurrences which, continued
                    almost to his death, affords for his biography a slight but sure foundation. His
                    thoughts, however, were already working in a higher sphere. He early attained to
                    the settled conviction that for the actual disposition of the solar system some
                    abstract intelligible reason must exist, and this, after much meditation, he
                    believed himself to have found in an imaginary relation between the “five
                    regular solids” and the number and distances of the planets. He notes with
                    exultation July 9, 1595, as the date of the pseudo-discovery, the publication of
                    which in <hi rend="italic">Prodromus Dissertationum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cosmographicαrum</hi><hi rend="italic">seu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mysterium</hi><hi rend="italic">Cosrno-graphicum</hi> (Tübingen, 1596) procured
                    him much fame, and a friendly correspondence with the two most eminent
                    astronomers of the time, Tycho Brahe and Galileo.</p>
                <p>Soon after his arrival at Gratz, Kepler contracted an engagement with Barbara von
                    Mühleck, a wealthy Styrian heiress, who, at the age of twenty-three, had already
                    survived one husband and been divorced from another. Before her relatives could
                    be brought to countenance his pretensions, Kepler was obliged to undertake a
                    journey to Würtemberg to obtain documentary evidence of the somewhat obscure
                    nobility of his family, and it was thus not until April 27, 1597, that the
                    marriage was celebrated. In the following year the archduke Ferdinand, on
                    assuming the government of his hereditary dominions, issued an edict <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n57/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0057-0046"/> of banishment against Protestant preachers and
                    professors. Kepler immediately fled to the Hungarian frontier, but, by the
                    favour of the Jesuits, was recalled and reinstated in his post The gymnasium,
                    however, was deserted; the nobles of Styria began to murmur at subsidizing a
                    teacher without pupils; and he found it prudent to look elsewhere for
                    employment. He first turned to his native country; but his refusal to subscribe
                    unconditionally to the rigid formula of belief adopted by the theologians of
                    Tübingen permanently closed against him the gates of his <hi rend="italic">alma
                    mater.</hi> His embarrassment was relieved by a letter from Tycho Brahe offering
                    him the position of assistant in his observatory near Prague, which, after a
                    preliminary visit of four months, he accepted. The arrangement was made just in
                    time; for on August 7, 1600, he received definitive notice to leave Gratz, and,
                    having leased his wife’s property, departed with his family for Prague,
                    September 30. His relations with Tycho were not of an entirely agreeable
                    character. The Danish astronomer, though benevolent, was haughty and
                    overbearing; Kepler’s natural irritability was aggravated by prolonged fever, by
                    pecuniary anxieties, and by domestic mismanagement. Nevertheless, after one
                    violent quarrel, smoothed over by mutual concessions, they maintained an
                    amicable intercourse, unexpectedly terminated by Tycho’s death, October 24,
                    1601.</p>
                <p>A brilliant and prosperous career seemed by this event to be thrown open to
                    Kepler. The emperor Rudolph II. immediately appointed him to succeed his patron
                    as imperial mathematician, although at a reduced salary of 500 florins; the
                    invaluable treasure of Tycho’s observations was, after some futile opposition on
                    the part of his heirs, placed at his disposal; and the laborious but Congenial
                    task was entrusted to him of completing the tables to which the grateful Dane
                    had already affixed the title of <hi rend="italic">Pudolphine.</hi> The first
                    works executed by him at Prague were, however, a homage to the astrological
                    proclivities of the emperor. In <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fundamentis astrologiae certioribus</hi> (Prague, 1602) he declared his purpose
                    of preserving and purifying the grain of truth which he believed the science to
                    contain. Indeed, the doctrine of “aspects” and “influences” fitted excellently
                    with his mystical conception of the universe; and enabled him to discharge with
                    a semblance of sincerity the most lucrative part of his professional duties.
                    Although he strictly limited his prophetic pretensions to the estimate of
                    tendencies and probabilities, his forecasts were none the less in demand. Shrewd
                    sense and considerable knowledge of the world came to the aid of stellar lore in
                    the preparation of “prognostics” which, not unfrequently hitting off the event,
                    earned him as much credit with the vulgar as his cosmical speculations with the
                    learned. He drew the horoscopes of the emperor and Wallenstein, as well as of a
                    host of lesser magnates; but, though keenly alive to the unworthy character of
                    such a trade, he made necessity his excuse for a compromise with superstition.
                    “Nature,” he wrote, “which has conferred upon every animal the means of
                    subsistence, has given astrology as an adjunct and ally to astronomy.” He
                    dedicated to the emperor in 1603 a treatise on the “great conjunction” of that
                    year <hi rend="italic">(Judicium de</hi><hi rend="italic">trigono igneo)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and he published his observations on a brilliant star which
                    appeared suddenly, September 30, 1604, and. remained visible for seventeen
                    months, in <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">stella</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nova in pede Serpentarii</hi> (Prague, 1606). While sharing the
                    opinion θf Tycho as to the origin of such bodies by condensation of nebulous
                    matter from the Milky Way, he attached a mystical signification to the
                    coincidence in time and place of the sidereal apparition with a triple
                    conjunction of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.</p>
                <p>The main task of his life was not meanwhile neglected. This was nothing less than
                    the foundation of a new astronomy, in which physical cause should replace
                    arbitrary hypothesis. A preliminary study of optics led to the publication, in
                    1604, of his <hi rend="italic">Astronomies pars optica,</hi> containing
                    important discoveries in the theory of vision, and a notable approximation
                    towards the true law of refraction. But it was not until 1609 that, the “great
                    Martian labour” being at length completed, he was able, in his own figurative
                    language, to lead the captive planet to the foot of the imperial throne. From
                    the time of his first introduction to Tycho he had devoted himself to the
                    investigation of the orbit of Mars, which, on account of its relatively large
                    eccentricity, had always been especially recalcitrant to theory, and the results
                    appeared in <hi rend="italic">Astronomia</hi><hi rend="italic">ηoυα
                    alτLολογητο</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ι</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    multifarious writings, two of the cardinal principles of modern astronomy—the
                    laws of elliptical orbits and of equal areas—were established;<note

                    >Astronomy,</hi> vol. ii. p. 752.</p></note> important truths relating to
                    gravity were enunciated, and the tides ascribed to the influence of lunar
                    attraction; while an attempt to explain the planetary revolutions in the then
                    backward condition of mechanical knowledge produced a theory of vortices closely
                    resembling that afterwards adopted by Descartes. Having been provided, in August
                    1610, by Ernest, archbishop of Cologne, with one of the new Galilean
                    instruments, Kepler began, with unspeakable delight, to observe the wonders
                    revealed by it. He had welcomed with a little essay called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertatio</hi><hi rend="italic">cum Huncio</hi><hi rend="italic">Sidereo</hi>
                    Galileo’s first announcement of celestial novelties; he now, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Dioptrwe</hi> (Augsburg, 1611), expounded the theory of refraction
                    by lenses, and suggested the principle of the “astronomical” or inverting
                    telescope. Indeed the work may be said to have founded the branch of science to
                    which it gave its name.</p>
                <p>The year 1611 was marked by Kepler as the most disastrous of his life. The death
                    by small-pox of his favourite child was followed by that of his wife, who, long
                    a prey to melancholy, was at last, July 3, carried off by typhus. In his review
                    of their conjugal life, remorse for frequent outbursts of impatience towards his
                    shiftless though well-meaning helpmate took the place of regret for her loss.
                    Public calamity was added to private bereavement. On the 23d of May 1611
                    Matthias, brother of the emperor, assumed the Bohemian crown in Prague,
                    compelling Rudolph to take refuge in the citadel, where he died on the 20th of
                    January following. Kepler’s fidelity in remaining with him to the last did not
                    deprive him of the favour of his successor. Payment of arrears, now amounting to
                    upwards of 4000 florins, was not, however, in the desperate condition of the
                    imperial finances, to be hoped for; and he was glad, while retaining his
                    position as court astronomer, to accept (in 1612) the office of mathematician to
                    the states of Upper Austria. His residence at Linz was troubled by the harsh
                    conduct of the pastor Hitzler, iiι excluding him from the rites of his church on
                    the ground of supposed Calvinistic leanings—a decision confirmed, with the
                    addition of an insulting reprimand, on his appeal to Würtemberg. In 1613 he
                    appeared with the emperor Matthias before the diet of Ratisbon as the advocate
                    of the introduction into Germany of the Gregorian calendar; but the attempt was
                    for the time frustrated by anti-papal prejudice. The attention devoted by him to
                    chronological subjects is evidenced by the publication about this period of
                    several essays in which he sought to prove that the birth of Christ took place
                    five years earlier than the commonly accepted date.</p>
                <p>Kepler’s second courtship forms the subject of a highly characteristic letter
                    addressed by him to Baron Stralendorf, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n58/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0058-0047"/> in which he reviews the qualifications of eleven
                    candidates for his hand, and explains the reasons which decided his choice in
                    favour of a portionless orphan girl named Susanna Reutlinger. The marriage was
                    celebrated at Linz, October 30, 1613, and seems to have proved a happy and
                    suitable one. The abundant vintage of that year drew his attention to the
                    defective methods in use for estimating the cubical contents of vessels, and his
                    essay on the subject (Worn <hi rend="italic">Stereometria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Doliorum,</hi> Linz, 1613) entitles him to rank among those who prepared the
                    discovery of the infinitesimal calculus. His observations on the three comets of
                    1618 were published in <hi rend="italic">De Cometis,</hi> contemporaneously with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Harmonice</hi><hi rend="italic">Mundi</hi> (Augsburg,
                    1619), of which the first lineaments had been traced twenty years previously at
                    Gratz. This extraordinary production is memorable as having announced the
                    discovery of the “third law ”—that of the sesquiplicate ratio between the
                    planetary periods and distances. But the main purport of the treatise was the
                    exposition of an elaborate system of celestial harmonies depending on the
                    various and varying velocities of the several planets, of which the sentient
                    soul animating the sun was the solitary auditor, The work exhibiting this
                    fantastic emulation of extravagance with genius was dedicated to James I. of
                    England, and the compliment was acknowledged with an invitation to that island,
                    conveyed through Sir Henry Wotton. Notwithstanding the distracted state of his
                    own country, however, he refused to abandon it, as he had previously, in 1617,
                    declined the post of successor to Magini in the mathematical chair of
                    Bologna.</p>
                <p>The insurmountable difficulties presented by the lunar theory forced Kepler,
                    after an enormous amount of fruitless labour, to abandon his design of
                    comprehending the whole scheme of the heavens in one great work to be called <hi
                    rend="italic">Hipparchus,</hi> and he then threw a portion of his materials into
                    the form of a dialogue intended for the instruction of general readers. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Epitome Astronomies</hi><hi rend="italic">Copemicanae</hi> (Linz
                    and Frankfort, 1618-21), a lucid and attractive textbook of Copernican science,
                    was remarkable for the prominence given to “physical astronomy,” as well as for
                    the extension to the Jovian system of the laws recently discovered to regulate
                    the motions of the planets. The first of a series of ephemerides, calculated on
                    these principles, was published by him at Linz in 1617; and in that for 1620,
                    dedicated to Napier, he for the first time employed logarithms. This important
                    invention was eagerly welcomed by him, and its theory formed the subject of a
                    treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Chilias Logarithmorum,</hi> printed in 1624,
                    but circulated in manuscript three years earlier, which largely contributed to
                    bring the new method into general use in Germany.</p>
                <p>His studies, were, however, interrupted by a painful family trouble. The restless
                    disposition and unbridled tongue of Catherine Kepler his mother created for her
                    numerous enemies in the little town of Leonberg; while her unguarded conduct
                    exposed her to a species of calumny at that time but too readily circulated and
                    believed. As early as 1615 suspicions of sorcery began to be spread against her,
                    which she, with more spirit than prudence, met with an action for libel. The
                    suit was, by the connivance of the judicial authorities, purposely protracted,
                    and at length, August 5, 1620, the unhappy woman, then in her seventy-fourth
                    year, was arrested on a formal charge of witchcraft. Kepler immediately hastened
                    to Würtemberg, and devoted a whole year to the zealous advocacy of her cause. It
                    was owing to his indefatigable exertions that, contrary to general expectation,
                    she was acquitted after having suffered thirteen months’ imprisonment, and
                    endured with undaunted courage the formidable ordeal of “territion,” or
                    examination under the imminent threat of torture. She survived her release only
                    a few months, dying April 13, 1622.</p>
                <p>Kepler’s whole attention was now devoted to the production of the new tables.
                    “Germany,” he wrote, “does not long for peace more anxiously than I do for their
                    publication.” Financial difficulties, however, combined with civil and religious
                    convulsions, long delayed the accomplishment of his desires. From June 24 to
                    August 29, 1626, Linz was besieged, and its inhabitants reduced to the utmost
                    straits by bands of insurgent peasants. The pursuit of science needed a more
                    tranquil shelter; and accordingly, on the raising of the blockade, Kepler
                    obtained permission to transfer his types to Ulm, where, in September 1627, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rudolphine Tables</hi> were at length given to the world.
                    Although by no means free from errors, their value appears from the fact that
                    they ranked for a century as the best aid to astronomy. Appended were tables of
                    logarithms and of refraction, together with Tycho’s catalogue of 777 stars,
                    enlarged by Kepler to 1005.</p>
                <p>The work of Kepler’s life was now virtually completed, but not so its
                    vicissitudes. His claims upon the insolvent imperial exchequer amounted by this
                    time to 12,000 florins. The emperor Ferdinand II., too happy to transfer the
                    burden, countenanced an arrangement by which Kepler entered the service of the
                    duke of Friedland (Wallenstein), who assumed the full responsibility of the
                    debt. Tn July 1628 Kepler accordingly arrived with his family at Sagan in
                    Silesia, where he applied himself to the printing of his ephemerides up to the
                    year 1636, and whence he issued, in 1629, a <hi rend="italic">Notice to the
                    Cτιrious in Things Celestial,</hi> warning astronomers of approaching transits.
                    That of Mercury was actually seen by Gassendi in Paris, November 7, 1631 (being
                    the first passage of a planet across the sun ever observed); that of Venus,
                    predicted for the 6th of December following, was invisible in western Europe.
                    Wallen stein’s promises to Kepler were but imperfectly fulfilled. In lieu of the
                    sums due, he offered him a professorship at Rostock, which Kepler declined,
                    being unwilling to compromise his claim. An expedition to Ratisbon, undertaken
                    for the purpose of representing his case to the Diet, terminated his life.
                    Shaken by the journey, which he had performed entirely on horseback, he was
                    attacked with fever, and died at Ratisbon, November 15 (N. S.), 1630, in the
                    fifty-ninth year of his age. An inventory of his effects found among his papers
                    showed him to have been possessed of no inconsiderable property at the time of
                    his death It is true that he had often been severely straitened; but there is
                    reason to believe that his complaints on the subject were to some extent
                    exaggerated. By his first wife he had five, and by his second seven children, of
                    whom only two, a son and a daughter, reached maturity.</p>
                <p>The character of Kepler’s genius was one of which it is especially difficult to
                    arrive at a just estimate. His irresistible tendency towards mystical
                    speculation formed a not less fundamental quality of his mind than its strong
                    grasp of positive scientific truth. Without assigning to each element its due
                    value, no sound comprehension of his modes of thought can be attained. His idea
                    of the universe was essentially Pythagorean and Platonic. He started with the
                    conviction that the arrangement of its parts must correspond with certain
                    abstract conceptions of the beautiful and harmonious. His imagination, thus
                    kindled, animated him to those severe labours of which his great discoveries
                    were the fruit. His demonstration that the planes of all the planetary orbits
                    pass through the centre of the sun, coupled with his clear recognition of the
                    sun as the moving power of the system, entitles him to rank as the founder of
                    physical astronomy. But the fantastic relations imagined by him of planetary
                    movements and distances to musical intervals and geometrical constructions
                    seemed to himself discoveries no less admirable than the achievements which have
                    secured his lasting fame. Outside the boundaries of the solar system, the
                    metaphysical side of his genius, no longer held in check by experience, fully
                    asserted itself. The Keplerian like the Pythagorean cosmos was threefold,
                    consisting of the centre, or sun, the surface, being the sphere of the fixed
                    stars, and the intermediate space, filled with <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n59/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0059-0048"/> ethereal matter. It is a mistake to suppose that
                    he regarded the stars as so many suns. He quotes indeed the opinion of Giordano
                    Bruno to that effect, but with dissent. Among his happy conjectures may be
                    mentioned that of the sun’s axial rotation, postulated by him as the physical
                    cause of the revolutions of the planets, and soon after confirmed by the
                    discovery of sun-spots; the suggestion of a periodical variation in the
                    obliquity of the ecliptic; and the explanation as an effect of a solar
                    atmosphere of the radiance observed to surround the totally eclipsed sun.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to consider without surprise the colossal amount of work
                    accomplished by Kepler under numerous disadvantages. His health was uncertain,
                    his powers of calculation indifferent, his interruptions numerous, his cares at
                    times overwhelming. But his iron industry counted no obstacles, and secured for
                    him the highest triumph of genius, that of having given to mankind the best that
                    was in him. In private character he was amiable and affectionate; his generosity
                    in recognizing the merits of others secured him against the worst shafts of
                    envy; and a life marked by numerous disquietudes was cheered and ennobled by
                    sentiments of sincere piety.</p>
                <p>Kepler’s extensive literary remains, purchased by the empress Catherine II. in
                    1724 from some Frankfort merchants, and long inaccessibly deposited in the
                    observatory of Pulkowa, have at length been completely brought to light, under
                    the able editorship of Dr Ch. Frisch, in the first complete edition of Kepler’s
                    works. This important publication <hi rend="italic">{Joannis Kepleri opera
