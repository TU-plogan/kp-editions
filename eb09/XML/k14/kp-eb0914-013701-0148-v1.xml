                            rend="smallcaps">Francis</hi></label> (1790-1838), a distinguished
                    Hungarian poet, critic, and orator, was born at Szöderneter, in Transylvania, on
                    the 8th of August 1790. His parents both died during his childhood, leaving him
                    to the care of a trusted female servant. At an early age Kölcsey was sent to the
                    Calvinistic school at Debreczen, where he acquired a sound knowledge of the
                    Latin and Greek classics, as also of the leading Hungarian and German poets. In
                    his fifteenth year he made the acquaintance of Kazinczy, and zealously adopted
                    his linguistic reforms. In 1809 Kölcsey went to Pest with the intention of
                    following the legal profession, and became a “notary to the royal board.” The
                    public career of a lawyer, however, proving distasteful to him, he soon left the
                    city, and, secluding himself at Cseke in Szatmâr county, devoted his time to
                    aesthetical study, poetry, criticism, and the defence of the theories of
                    Kazinczy. Kölcsey’s early metrical pieces contributed to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Transylvanian Museum</hi> did not attract much attention, whilst his severe
                    criticisms of Csokonai, Kis, and especially Berzsenyi, published in 1817,
                    rendered him very unpopular. From 1821 to 1826 he published many separate poems
                    of great beauty in the <hi rend="italic">Aurora, Hebe,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Aspasia,</hi> and other magazines of polite literature. Having by these
                    means again risen iu the estimation of the literary public, he was induced by
                    Paul Szemere to join him in the production of a new periodical, styled <hi
                        rend="italic">Diet cs Literatura</hi> (“Life and Literature”), which
                    appeared from 1826 to 1829, in 4 vols., and gained for Kölcsey the highest
                    reputation as a critical writer. About this time his powers as an orator began
                    to be displayed in his capacity of upper notary to the county of Szatmàr. From
                    1832 to 1835 he sat in the Hungarian diet, where his extreme liberal views and
                    his singular eloquence soon rendered him famous as a parliamentary leader. In
                    the meantime he had not been inactive as a literary savant. Elected on the 17th
                    November 1830 a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, he took part in its
                    first grand meeting; in 1832 be delivered his famous oration on Kazinczy, and in
                    1836 that on his former opponent Daniel Berzsenyi. When in 1838 Baron Wesselényi
                    was unjustly thrown into prison upon a charge of treason, Kölcsey eloquently
                    though unsuccessfully conducted his defence; and he died about a week afterwards
                    (2 4th of August) from internal inflammation. His collected works, in 6 vols.,
                    were published at Pest, 1840-48, and his journal of the diet of 1832-36 appeared
                    in 1848. A monument erected to the memory of Kölcsey was unveiled at
                    Szatmâr-Németi on the 25th of September 1864.</p>
