                    at Weimar, where his father was a councillor of legation. Having attended the
                    gymnasium of Weimar, he went in his sixteenth year to the university of Jena,
                    and afterwards studied about a year in Duisburg. In 1780 he completed his legal
                    studies, and was admitted an advocate. Through the influence of Count Görtz,
                    Prussian ambassador at the Russian court, he became secretary at St Petersburg
                    to the governor-general Von Baur, by whom he was recommended to the empress. In
                    1783 he received the appointment of assessor to the high court of appeal in
                    Revel, where he married a daughter of lieutenant-general Von Essen. He was
                    ennobled in 1785, and became president of the magistracy of the province of
                    Esthonia. Before leaving Germany he had published some unimportant writings; in
                    Revel he acquired a considerable reputation by his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leiden</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic">Orteηbergischeη</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Familie</hi> (1785), his <hi rend="italic">Kleine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gesammelte Schriften</hi> (1787-91), and his two plays, <hi
                    rend="italic">Menschenhass und Reue</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Indianer</hi><hi rend="italic">in England</hi> (1789). The good
                    impression produced by these works was almost effaced by a cynical book, <hi
                    rend="italic">Doctor Bahrdt</hi><hi rend="italic">mit der eisernen Stirn,</hi>
                    which appeared with the name of Knigge on the title page. After the death of his
                    first wife Kotzebue retired from the Russian service, and resided for some time
                    in a country house which he had built near Narva. At this time he manifested
                    extraordinary literary activity, publishing within a few years, besides <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">jüngste</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Kinder</hi><hi rend="italic">meiner Laune</hi> (in 5 volumes), upwards of
                    twenty plays. In 1798 he accepted the office of dramatist to the court theatre
                    of Vienna, resigning it in about two years with a pension of 1000 florins. On
                    his way to St Petersburg, where his sons were being educated, he was arrested in
                    April 1800, and sent to Siberia. Fortunately he had written a comedy which
                    flattered the vanity of Paul I.; and a translation of this play so delighted the
                    emperor that Kotzebue was brought back, received an estate from the crown lands
                    in Livonia, and was made director of the German theatre in St Petersburg. He
                    returned to Germany when the emperor Paul died, and in 1802 was admitted into
                    the Academy of Sciences at Berlin. Here, in association with Merkel, he edited
                    <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Freimuthige,</hi> and began his <hi
                    rend="italic">Almanach dramatischer Spiele,</hi> which he continued to issue
                    until his death. He also wrote several plays in Berlin, and made some enemies by
                    the bitterness with which he attacked Goethe. Towards the end of 1806 he was
                    again settled in Russia, and in the security of his estate in Esthonia wrote
                    many satirical articles against Napoleon in <hi rend="italic">Die Biene</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Die Grille.</hi> As councillor of state he was attached in
                    1816 to the department for foreign affairs in St Petersburg, and in 1817 he went
                    to Germany as a sort of spy in the service of Russia, with a salary of 15,000
                    roubles. In his weekly journal (the <hi rend="italic">Literarisches
                    Wochenblatt')</hi> he scoffed at the pretensions of those Germans <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n156/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0156-0145"/> who demanded free institutions, and became an
                    object of such general dislike that he was obliged to leave Weimar for Mannheim.
                    He was especially detested by young enthusiasts for liberty; and one of them,
                    Karl Ludwig Sand, a theological student, formed a deliberate resolution to kill
                    him. On the 23d of March 1819 Sand called at Kotzebue’s house in Mannheim, and
                    stabbed him to the heart, crying, “Here, thou betrayer of the Fatherland!” The
                    assassin was executed, and the Government of Germany made his crime an excuse
                    for placing the universities under strict supervision. Besides his plays and the
                    other works already mentioned, Kotzebue wrote a history of the German empire and
                    a book on the ancient history of Prussia, neither of which has solid merit. He
                    was also the author of <hi rend="italic">Erinnerungen aus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Paris</hi> (1804), and <hi rend="italic">Erinnerungen von einer</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Heise</hi><hi rend="italic">aus Livland nach</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pom</hi><hi rend="italic">und Neapel</hi> (1805). He wrote more than one
                    hundred plays, the majority of which are now forgotten. Although destitute of
                    poetic insight, he had remarkable facility in the invention of effective
                    situations; and a respectable place in German literature is secured for some of
                    his comedies by the liveliness with which their characters are portrayed, and by
                    the sprightliness of their dialogue. There is a complete edition of his dramatic
                    works in 28 volumes (1797-1823), another in 44 volumes (1827-29), and a third in
                    40 volumes (1840-41).</p>
