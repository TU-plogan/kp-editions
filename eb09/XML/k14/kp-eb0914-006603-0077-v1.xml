                    sun,” a geographical term originally applied to the eastern quarter of the four,
                    named from the cardinal points, into which the ancient monarchy of the
                    Sassanians was divided.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>See Nöldeke’s translation of Tabari, p. 155.</p></note> After the
                    Arabic conquests the name was retained both as the designation of a definite
                    province and in a looser sense. Under the new Persian empire the expression has
                    gradually become restricted to the north-eastern portion of I’ersia proper, of
                    which it now forms the largest province. The boundaries of this vast region have
                    scarcely anywhere been accurately determined, and have constantly fluctuated,
                    especially towards the north and east. Speaking generally, however, the province
                    is conterminous on the east with Afghanistan and Sistan, north with Astrabad and
                    the re-recently organized Russian trans-Caspian territory, northeast with the
                    Turkoman country, west with Mazandaran and Irak-Adj emi, south with Farsistan
                    and Kirman. It lies mainly within 33° 30'-38° 30' N. lat. and 53°-61° E. long.,
                    extending 500 miles north-west and south-east and 300 north and south, with
                    total area of about 150,000 square miles, and a population estimated at from
                    800,000 to over 1,000,000.</p>
                <p>The surface in the north, south-west, and partly in the east is distinctly
                    mountainous to a far greater extent than is commonly supposed. The ranges
                    generally run in two or more parallel ridges, enclosing extensive longitudinal
                    valleys, and running in the normal direction from northwest to south-east. The
                    whole of the north is occupied by an extensive highland system forming a
                    continuation of the Hindu Kush and Paropamisus, and stretching from the</p>
                <p>Herat valley between the Iranian plateau and the Turkestan depression north-west
                    to the south-east corner of the Caspian. This system, for which there is no
                    general name, but which is now sometimes spoken of collectively as the
                    Kuren-Dagh or Kopet-Dagh, from its chief sections, forms in the east three
                    ranges, the Hazar-Masjid, Binalud-Kuh, and Jagatai, enclosing the Meshhed-Kuchan
                    valley and the Jagatai plain. The former is watered by the Kashaf-rud, or river
                    of Meshhed, flowing east to the Hari-rud, their junction forming the Tejend,
                    which sweeps round the Daman-i-Koh, or northern skirt of the outer range in the
                    direction of the Caspian or Usboi (old bed of the Oxus), but now losing itself
                    in the desert long before reaching them. The Jagatai plain is watered by the
                    Kai-Mura river, formed by the junction of the Kara-su and several other head
                    streams, and flowing south-west to the Great Salt Desert. In the west the
                    northern highlands also develop three branches, the Kuren-Dagh stretching
                    through the Great and Little Balkans to the Caspian at Krasnovodsk Bay, the
                    Ala-Dagh forming a continuation of the Binalud-Kuh and the Astrabad mountains
                    merging south-westwards in the Elburz system. The Kuren and Ala Daghs enclose
                    the valley of the Atrek, which flows mainly west to the Caspian at Hasan Kuli
                    bay. The western offshoots of the Ala Dagh and the Astrabad mountains enclose in
                    the same way the valley of the Gurgan, which also flows westwards to the
                    south-east corner of the Caspian. The outer range has probably a mean altitude
                    of 8000 feet, the highest known summits being the Hazar-Masjid (10,500 feet) and
                    the Kara-Dagh (980J); it is crossed by the Maidan-Kuni and Allaho-Akhbar (4200
                    feet) passes leading from Kuchan north to the Daragez district. The central
                    range seems to be still higher, culminating with the Shah Jahan Kuh (11,000
                    feet), the Kuh Ala Dagh (12,300), and Kuh Khorkhud (12,500). The southern
                    ridges, although generally much lower, have the highest point of the whole
                    system in the Shah-Kuh (13,000 feet) at the junction of the Astrabad and Elburz
                    ranges.</p>
                <p>Another system runs diagonally right across the province from Yezd in the
                    south-west to the Hari-rud valley in the north-east, throwing off the Kuh
                    Shorab, Kuh Shutari (10,000 feet), and Kuh Nastanji (8000 feet) in the Tabbas
                    district Towards Sistan the country is also very mountainous, with several
                    nearly parallel ridges stretching from near Τύη south-east to the Ham un lake or
                    swamp.</p>
                <p>Beyond the Atrek and others watering the northern valleys there are scarcely any
                    rivers, and most of these are brackish and intermittent, losing themselves in
                    the Dasht-i-Kavir or Great Salt Desert, which occupies the central and western
                    parts of the province, and which is separated by the diagonal range from the
                    more sandy and drier desert of Lut in the south. The true character of the
                    kavfr, which forms the distinctive feature of east Persia, has scarcely yet been
                    determined, some regarding it as the bed of a dried-up sea, others as developed
                    by the saline streams draining to it from the surrounding highlands. Collecting
                    in the central depressions, which have a mean elevation of scarcely more than
                    500 feet above the Caspian, the water of these streams is supposed to form a
                    saline efflorescence with a thin whitish crust beneath which the moisture is
                    retained for a considerable time, thus producing those dangerous and slimy
                    quagmires which in winter are covered with brine, in summer with a thick
                    incrustation of salt. “The waters of all springs and rivers contain salts in
                    minute quantities, but the rivers of Persia are often so salt as to be
                    undrinkable. The salts brought down by the rivers are deposited in the marsh,
                    which thus gets salter year by year. It dries up during the fierce summer heats,
                    to become a marsh again when the winter floods occur. This process is repeated
                    for ages, and in the course of time <pb break="no"

                <p>The surface of Khorasan thus consists mainly of highlands, saline swampy deserts,
                    and fertile well-watered upland valleys. Of the last, occurring mainly in the
                    north, the chief are the longitudinal valley stretching from near the Herat
                    frontier through Meshhed, Kuchan, and Shir van to Bunjurd, and the Daragez
                    district, which lies on the northern skirt of the outer range projecting into
                    the Akhal Tekke domain, now Russian territory. These fertile tracts produce rice
                    and other cereals, some cotton, tobacco, saffron, and especially melons and
                    other fruits in great profusion, 45 ft of splendid grapes being sold in Daragez
                    for ninepence. Other products are manna, gums, and great quantities of
                    asafoetida, which is not used by the natives but exported to India. The chief
                    manufactures are the famous Khorasan sabres, firearms, stoneware, armour, fine
                    carpets and rugs, velvets, woollens, cottons, and sheepskin pelisses.</p>
                <p>The population is far from homogeneous, consisting of Iranians (Tajiks, Kurds,
