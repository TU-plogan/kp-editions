                    wingless, and furnished with a beak or sucker attached to its breast, by which
                    it fixes itself immovably on its food plant, and through which it draws its
                    nourishment. The male insect is unknown, two insects mistaken for it being,
                    according to Planchon, parasitic hymenoptera of the chalcidian group, living in
                    the kermes grains. In the month of May, when full grown, the insects are
                    globose, 6 to 7 millim. in diameter, of a reddish-brown colour, and covered with
                    an ash-coloured powder. They are found attached to the twigs or buds by a
                    circular lower surface 2 millim. in diameter, and surrounded by a narrow zone of
                    white cottony down. At this time there are concealed under a cavity, formed by
                    the approach of the abdominal wall of the insect to the dorsal one, thousands of
                    eggs of a lively red colour, and smaller than poppy seed, which are protruded
                    and ranged regularly beneath the insect. At the end of May or the beginning of
                    June the young escape by a small orifice, near the point of attachment of the
                    parent. They are then of a fine red colour, elliptic and convex in shape, but
                    rounded at the two extremities, and bear two threads half as long as their body
                    at their posterior extremity. At this period they are extremely active, and
                    swarm with extraordinary rapidity all over the food plant, and in the course of
                    two or three days attach themselves to fissures in the bark or buds, but rarely
                    to the leaves. In warm and dry summers the insects breed again in the months of
                    August and September, according to Eméric, and then they are more frequently
                    found attached to the leaves. Usually, however, they remain immovable and
                    apparently unaltered until the end of the succeeding March, when their bodies
                    become gradually distended and lose all trace of abdominal rings. They then
                    appear full of a reddish juice resembling discoloured blood. In this state, or
                    when the eggs are ready to be extruded, the insects are collected. In some cases
                    the insects from which the young are ready to escape are dried in the sun on
                    linen cloths—care being taken to prevent the escape of the young from the cloths
                    until they are dead. The young insects are then sifted from the shells, made
                    into a paste with vinegar, and dried on skins exposed to the sun, and the paste
                    packed in skins is then ready for exportation to the East under the name of
                    “pâte d’écarlate.”</p>
                <p>In the pharmacopoeia of the ancients kermes triturated with vinegar was used as
                    an outward application, especially in wounds of the nerves. From the 9th to the
                    16th <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n61/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0061-0050"/> century this insect formed an ingredient in the
                    “confectio alkermes,” a well known medicine, at one time official in the London
                    pharmacopoeia as an astringent and corroborant in doses of 20 to 60 grains or
                    more. Syrup of kermes was also prepared. Both these preparations have now fallen
                    into disuse, the latter being replaced by the syrup of cochineal.</p>
                <p>To dye spun worsted with kermes, the material is first boiled for half an hour
                    with bran in water, and then for two hours in a fresh bath containing one-fifth
                    of Roman alum and one-fifth of tartar, to which “souι∙ water” is commonly added.
                    It is then taken out and laid in a linen bag for some days in a cool place. In
                    order to obtain a full colour it is then put in a warm bath as at the first
                    boiling, the bath containing as much kermes as is equal to three-fourths or even
                    the whole weight of the worsted used. For cloth one-fourth less of the salt and
                    kermes was required. The colour imparted by kermes has much less bloom than the
                    scarlet made with cochineal, hence the former has fallen into disuse.</p>
                <p>Mineral kermes is an amorphous tersulphide of antimony, prepared by a variety of
                    processes, and containing a variable proportion of teroxide of antimony and
                    sometimes a little alkaline antimonite. The oldest method consists in boiling
                    the finely powdered sulphide with a solution of an alkaline carbonate and
                    leaving the hot filtered solution to cool, the kermes being deposited on
                    cooling. In another method dilute nitric acid was added to the alkaline solution
                    to precipitate the kermes mineral. Mineral kermes is a brown red powder becoming
                    blackish-grey when washed with boiling water. By fusion and slow cooling it is
                    converted into a day-like mass devoid of crystalline structure, in which it
                    differs essentially from the pure amorphous sulphide.</p>
