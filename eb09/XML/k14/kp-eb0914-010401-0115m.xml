                    the author of various works connected with Biblical literature, was the son of a
                    mason at Plymouth, where he was born December 4th, 1804. In childhood he was
                    weak and sickly, and he received only a very meagre school education; but his
                    untoward and miserable circumstances did not prevent the growth of a passionate
                    love of books and an eager thirst for learning. By a fall sustained while
                    assisting his father in his trade he received severe general injuries and lost
                    permanently the sense of hearing. No longer able to support himself by manual
                    labour, he endeavoured to do so by preparing rude drawings and coloured cards in
                    large capital letters, but at last in November 1819 he found it necessary to
                    seek refuge in the workhouse, where he was employed in making list shoes. In
                    1821 he was bound apprentice to a shoemaker in Plymouth, who, however, treated
                    him with such oppressive tyranny that he appealed to the magistrates, and got
                    his indenture cancelled, upon which he again obtained admission to the
                    workhouse. Not long afterwards a fund was-raised in his behalf, and in 1823 he
                    was sent to board with the clerk of the guardians, having his time at his own
                    disposal, and the privilege of making use of a public library. After preparing a
                    small volume of miscellanies, which was published by subscription, he became a
                    pupil of Mr Groves, a dentist in Exeter, and in this art rapidly acquired
                    proficiency. Through the same gentleman he in 1825 obtained more congenial
                    employment in the printing office of the Church Missionary Society at Islington,
                    from which he was after two years transferred to the same society’s
                    establishment at Malta. There he remained only six months, but shortly after his
                    return to England he accompanied Mr Groves in the capacity of tutor to his two
                    sons on a Christian mission to Baghdad, where he obtained that personal
                    knowledge of Oriental life and habits which he afterwards applied with such tact
                    and skill in the illustration of Biblical scenes and incidents. On account of
                    the ravages of the plague the missionary establishment was broken up, and in
                    1832 Kitto returned to England. On arriving in London he was engaged in the
                    preparation of various serial publications of the Society for the Diffusion of
                    Useful Knowledge, the most important of which were the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pictorial History of Palestine</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Pictorial
                    Bible.</hi> Henceforth his life was one of congenial but incessant literary
                    labour. The <hi rend="italic">Cyclopaedia</hi><hi rend="italic">of Biblical
                    Literature,</hi> edited under his superintendence, appeared in two volumes,
                    1843-45, and has passed through three editions; and his <hi rend="italic">Daily
                    Bible Illustrations</hi> (8 vols., 1849-53) still retain a wide popularity among
                    general readers. On the morning after he had finished the last volume of this
                    work Kitto was seized with a paralytic stroke, and from that time he was
                    incapacitated for literary work. In 1850 he had received an annuity of £100 from
                    the royal civil list; and on his illness an additional fund was raised on his
                    behalf. In the autumn of 1854 he removed with his family to Cannstatt on the
                    Neckar, where on the 25th November he was seized with an attack which in a few
                    hours proved fatal.</p>
