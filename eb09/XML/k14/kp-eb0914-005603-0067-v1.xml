                    native state in Sind, India, lying between 26° 10' and 27’ 46' N. lat., and 68°
                    14' and 70° 13' E. long., bounded on the N. by ShikArpur district, S. by
                    JAisalmir state, E. by Hyderabad district, and W. by the Indus river, with an
                    area of 6109 square miles. Like other parts of Sind, Khairpur consists of a
                    great alluvial plain, very rich and fertile in the neighbourhood of the Indus
                    and the irrigation canals, the remaining area being a continuous series of
                    sand-hill ridges covered with a stunted brushwood, where cultivation is
                    altogether impossible. A small ridge of limestone hills passes through the
                    northern part of the state, being a continuation of a ridge known as the Ghar,
                    running southwards from Rohri. The state is watered by five canals drawn off
                    from the Indus, besides the Eastern NAra, a canal which follows an old bed of
                    the Indus. In the desert tracts are pits of <hi rend="italic">natron,</hi>
                    forming a source of revenue to the chief; as many as a thousand camel loads are
                    annually exported to northern and central India, as well as to the seaboard,
                    each load being taxed at 5s.</p>
                <p>A census taken in 1872 returned the population at 130,350, or 21 per square mile.
                    The Moslems chiefly belong to the Rajur tribe. The Hindus are principally
                    Rajputs of the Soda Thakur clan, who inhabit the extreme eastern part of the
                    state. They are a well-built and sturdy race, of nomadic habits, their wealth
                    consisting in herds of camels, oxen, sheep, and goats. The principal food grain
                    crops are jodr <hi rend="italic">{Hοlcus sorghum), bdιjrd</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The chief or mir of Khairpur belongs to a Baluchi family, known as the Talpur,
                    which rose on the fall of the Kalhorâ dynasty of Sind. About 1813, during the
                    troubles in Cabul incidental to the establishment of the Bârakzai dynasty, the
                    mfrs were able to refuse the tribute which up to that date had been somewhat
                    irregularly paid to the rulers of Afghanistan. In 1832 the individuality of the
                    Khairpur state was recognized by the British Government in a treaty, under which
                    the use of the river Indus and the roads of Sind were secured. When the first
                    Cabul expedition was decided on, the mir of Khairpur, Ali Murad, cordially
                    supported the British policy; and the result was that, after the battles of
                    Miani and Daba had put the whole of Sind at the disposal of the British,
                    Khairpur was the only state allowed to retain its political existence under the
                    protection of the paramount power.</p>
