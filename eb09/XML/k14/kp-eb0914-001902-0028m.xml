                    pours itself into the Bay of Bengal through two principal mouths in Tanjore
                    district. Its total length is about 475 miles; the estimated area of its basin,
                    28,000 square miles. It is known to devout Hindus as Dakshini Ganga, or the
                    Ganges of the South, and the whole of its course is holy ground. According to
                    the legend there was once born upon earth a girl named Vishnumâyâ or Lopâmudrâ,
                    the daughter of Brahma; but her divine father permitted her to be regarded as
                    the child of a mortal, called Kâvera-muni. In order to obtain beatitude for her
                    adoptive father, she resolved to become a river whose waters should purify from
                    all sin. Hence it is that even the holy Ganges resorts underground once in the
                    year to the source of the Kâveri, to purge herself from the pollution contracted
                    from the crowd of sinners who have bathed in her waters. The course of the
                    Kâveri in Coorg is very tortuous. Its bed is generally rocky; its banks are high
                    and covered with luxuriant vegetation. On entering Mysore it passes through a
                    narrow gorge, but presently widens to an average breadth of from 300 to 400
                    yards. Its bed continues rocky, so as to forbid all navigation; but its banks
                    are here bordered with a rich strip of cultivation. In its course through
                    Mysore, the channel is interrupted by twelve anicuts or dams for the purpose of
                    irrigation. From the most important of these, known as the Madadkatte, an
                    artificial channel is led to a distance of 72 miles, irrigating an area of
                    10,000 acres, yielding a revenue of £7000, and ultimately bringing a
                    water-supply into the town of Mysore. In Mysore state the Kâveri forms the two
                    islands of Seringapatam and Sivasamudram, which vie in sanctity with the island
                    of Srirangam lower down in Trichinopoli district. Around the island of
                    Sivasamudram are the celebrated falls of the Kâveri, unrivalled for romantic
                    beauty. The river here branches into two channels, each of which makes a descent
                    of about 200 miles in a succession of rapids and broken cascades. After entering
                    the Madras presidency, the Kâveri forms the boundary between the Coimbatore and
                    Salem districts, until it strikes into Trichinopoli district. Sweeping past the
                    historic rock of Trichinopoli, it breaks at the island of Srirangam into two
                    channels, which enclose between them the delta of Tanjore, the garden of
                    southern India. The northern channel is called the Coleroon (Kolidam); the other
                    preserves the name of Kâveri. On the seaward face of its delta are the open
                    roadsteads of Negapatam and French Kârikal. The only navigation on any portion
                    of its course is carried on in boats of basket-work. It is in the delta that the
                    real value of the river for irrigation becomes conspicuous. The most ancient
                    irrigation work is a massive dam of unhewn stone, 1080 feet long, and from 40 to
                    60 feet broad, across the stream of the Kâveri proper, which is supposed to date
                    back to the 4th century, is still in excellent repair, and has supplied a model
                    to British engineers. The chief modern work is the anicut across the Coleroon,
                    2250 feet long, constructed by Sir Arthur Cotton between 1836 and 1838.</p>
