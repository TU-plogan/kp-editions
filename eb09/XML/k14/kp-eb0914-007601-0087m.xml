                <p><label type="entry">KILLDEER</label>, a common and well-known American Plover, so
                    called in imitation of its whistling cry, the <hi rend="italic">Charadrius
                    vociferιisoi</hi> Linnaeus, and the <hi rend="italic">Aegialitis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vocifera</hi> of modern ornithologists. About the size of a Snipe,
                    it is mostly sooty-brown above, but showing a bright buff on the tail coverts,
                    and in flight a white bar on the wings; beneath it is pure white except two
                    pectoral bands of deep black. It is one of the finest as well as the largest of
                    the group commonly known as Ringed Plovers or Ring Doterels,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The word Doterel seems
                    properly applicable to a single species only, the <hi rend="italic">Charadrius
                    rnorinellus</hi> of Linnaeus, which, from some of its osteological characters,
                    may be fitly regarded as the type of a distinct genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eudrornias.</hi> Whether any other species agree with it in the peculiarity
                    alluded to is at present uncertain.</p></note> forming the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Aegialitis</hi> of Boie. Mostly wintering in the south or only on
                    the sea-shore of the more northern States, in spring it spreads widely over the
                    interior, breeding on the newly-ploughed lands or on open grass-fields. The nest
                    is made in a slight hollow of the ground, and is often surrounded with small
                    pebbles and fragments of shells. Here the hen lays her pear-shaped,
                    stone-coloured eggs, four in number, and always arranged with their pointed ends
                    touching each other, as is indeed the custom of most Limicoline birds. The
                    parents exhibit the greatest anxiety for their offspring on the approach of an
                    intruder: the lien runs off with drooping wings and plaintive cries, while the
                    cock sweeps around, gesticulating with loud and angry vociferations. It is the
                    best-known bird of its Family in the United States, throughout which it is found
                    in all suitable districts, but less abundantly in the north-east than further
                    south or west. In Canada it does not range further to the northward than 56° N.
                    lat., and it is not known to occur in Greenland, or hardly in Labrador, though
                    it is a passenger in Newfoundland every spring and autumn.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A single example is said to have been shot
                    rear Christchurch, in Hampshire, in April 1857 <hi rend="italic">ll'&gt;is,</hi>

                    the Antilles, but it is not recorded from any of the islands to the windward of
                    Porto Rico. However, in the other direction it goes very much further south,
                    travelling down the Isthmus of Panama and the west coast of South America to
                    Peru. The Killdeer has several other congeners in America, among which may be
                    noticed <hi rend="italic">Ae.</hi><hi rend="italic">semipalmata,</hi> so
                    curiously resembling the ordinary Ringed Plover of the Old World, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ae.</hi><hi rend="italic">hiaticula,</hi> except that it has its
                    toes connected by a web at the base; and <hi rend="italic">Ae.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nivosa,</hi> a bird inhabiting the western parts of both the
                    American continents, which in the opinion of some authors is only a local form
                    of the widely-spread <hi rend="italic">Ae.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >alexandrνna</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cantiana,</hi> best known by its English
                    name of Kentish Plover, from its discovery near Sandwich towards the end of the
                    last century, though it is far more abundant in many other parts of the Old
                    World. The common Ringed Plover, <hi rend="italic">Ae.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >hiaticula,</hi> has many of the habits of the Killdeer, but is much less often
                    found away from the sea-shore, though a few colonies may be found in dry warrens
                    in certain parts of England many miles from the coast, and in Lapland at a still
                    greater distance. In such localities it has the curious habit of paving its nest
                    with small stones (whence it is locally known by the name of “Stone-hatch”), a
                    habit almost unaccountable unless regarded as an inherited instinct from
                    shingle-haunting ancestors.</p>
                <p>About thirty species all apparently referable with propriety to the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Aegialitis</hi> have been described, but probably so many do not
                    exist. Some, as the Kentish Plover above named, have a very extended
                    distribution, for that, letting alone its supposed American habitat, certainly
                    occurs in greater or less numbers on the coasts of China, India, and Africa
                    generally. On the other hand there is one, the <hi rend="italic">Ae.
                    sanctae-helenae,</hi> which seems to be restricted to the island whence it takes
                    its scientific name, and where it is called the “Wire-bird” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ibis,</hi> 1873, p. 260). Nearly allied to <hi rend="italic">Aegialitis</hi>
                    are two genera peculiar to the New Zealand subregion— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thinornis,</hi> which does not call for any particular remark, ànd the
                    extraordinary <hi rend="italic">Anarhynchus,</hi> which deserves a few words. Of
                    this there is but one species, <hi rend="italic">Ae.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >frontalis,</hi> the Wrybill, so called from its bill being congenitally bent in
                    the middle and diverted to the right side—a formation supposed to give the bird
                    greater facility in seeking its food, chiefly arthropods that lurk under stones,
                    round which it may be seen running from left to right. Mr Buller <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ji. Hew Zealand,</hi> p. 219) connects with this habit the
                    curious fact that the black pectoral band worn by the bird is “narrower and of a
                    less decided colour on the left side of the breast,” whence he infers that “the
                    law of natural selection has operated to lessen the colouring on the side of the
                    bird more exposed to Hawks and other enemies while the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anarhyηchus</hi> is hunting for its daily food.” Be that as it may, it does not
                    detract from the wonderful nature of this asymmetry of the bill, which is
                    comparable indeed with that found in so large a number of Cetaceans among
                    mammals, but with nothing known among birds, for in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Crossbills</hi> (g ’.v.) the bones of the mandibles are not affected, and in
                    certain Owls <hi rend="italic">(Hyctala)</hi> the distortion of the ear-bones is
                    not externally visible. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n. )</hi></p>
