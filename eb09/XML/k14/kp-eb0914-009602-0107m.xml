                <p><label type="entry">KIRKCALDY</label>, a royal and parliamentary burgh and
                    seaport on the south-east coast of Fifeshire, Scotland, 12 miles north from
                    Edinburgh. The chief topographical feature of the town is its length, which is
                    nearly 4 miles within the municipal boundary, as extended by Act of Parliament
                    in 1876. Formerly there was little besides one main street with lanes and
                    shorter streets branching from it, but during the last five-and-twenty years a
                    large number of new streets and villas have been built along the high ground to
                    the north. The parish, however, is a very small one, the landward part (now
                    Abbotshall) having been disjoined in 1650. In population and most other
                    statistical respects Kirkcaldy is the principal town in the county, and the
                    tenth in Scotland, ranking next after Perth and Kilmarnock. The valuation of the
                    burgh in 1881, including railways, was £87,622, and the census of the same year
                    showed a population of 23,632. Besides some importations of flax, timber,
                    whiting, &amp;c., the chief regular trade of the port is that carried on by
                    means of coasting vessels with Leith, Glasgow, and London. The annual harbour
                    revenue is about £2000, and that of the customhouse £52,000.</p>
                <p>The linen manufacture, begun in the early part of the 18th century, has long been
                    the staple industry, the town being one of the chief centres of the trade in
                    Scotland. The spinning of flax by machinery was introduced into the district in
                    1792, and in 1807 steam was added as a motive power. At present there are six
                    mills with 18,830 spindles, employing when in full operation about 1450 persons.
                    There is also an extensive net factory. Twelve power-loom factories, with an
                    aggregate of 2100 looms, broad and narrow, employ fully that number of
                    operatives. In these, as in the spinning mills, a large proportion of the
                    workers, about 80 per cent., are females. Hand-loom weaving has almost entirely
                    disappeared. The principal fabrics manufactured are sheetings, ticks, hollands,
                    towellings, diapers, dowlas, &amp;c.; and one or two firms are now making cotton
                    goods to some extent. There are three bleachfields, with 180 workpeople. Next in
                    importance to the various branches of the linen manufacture are the floor-cloth
                    works. First introduced by the late Mr Michael Nairn, the production of
                    floor-cloth at Kirkcaldy has for some years been the largest in the world. There
                    are six factories employing about 930 workpeople. The linoleum manufacture has
                    also been successfully established. In 1877 the Messrs Nairn built the first
                    factory in Scotland for this branch of industry, and its success has resulted in
                    the formation of other two companies. The three firms employ an aggregate of
                    nearly 450 hands. A large amount of machinery, including steam-engines, boilers,
                    sugar-mills, rice-mills, and the like, is also manufactured in Kirkcaldy. There
                    are eight works in operation, several of them extensive, and about 800 men and
                    lads are employed. Among miscellaneous works may be noted two potteries (one of
                    them including a tile-work with 400 operatives), malting barns, flour-mills,
                    several dye-works, a brewery, and a large printing and lithographic
                    business.</p>
                <p>The educational, ecclesiastical, and literary institutions of Kirkcaldy are
                    numerous. There are seven public schools, with 3490 children on the roll, and
                    nearly as many private and ladies’ schools, with about 350 in attendance. In
                    addition there are three schools belonging to Philp’s trust, at which 500
                    children receive gratuitous education and clothing; the revenue of the trust for
                    the purposes of these three schools was £2115 in 1880. There are <pb break="no"

                    being St Brycedale Free church. The town has two public libraries, one of them
                    with nearly 10,000 volumes; and there are three weekly newspapers.</p>
                <p>For much of its recent prosperity Kirkcaldy is indebted to the water scheme, for
                    which an Act was obtained in 1867, and an Amendment Act in 1870. The sum
                    authorized to be expended by these bills was £53,000, but an Extension Act was
                    passed in 1881 giving power to raise £40,000 additional when required. An
                    extensive system of drainage is also in process. A sheriff-substitute has
                    recently been appointed for the Kirkcaldy district.</p>

                    parliament.</p>
                <p>An <hi rend="italic">Bcclesιa de Kirkcaldie</hi> is mentioned in the list printed
                    by Sibbald of the churches in the county of Fife in the year 1176. In 1240 it
                    was bestowed by David, bishop of St Andrews, on the abbey of Dunfermline. The
                    name of Kirkcaldy also occurs in the map of the civil divisions of Scotland in
                    the 13th century prefixed to Professor Cosmo Innes’s <hi rend="italic">Scotland
                    in the Middle Ages.</hi> In 1334 the town, with its harbour, was given by David
                    II. to the abbey of Dunfermline, and in 1450 it was “disponed” by Richard, abbot
                    of Dunfermline, to the bailies and council of Kirkcaldy.</p>
                <p>The commerce of the place has suffered many fluctuations. In 1573, as we learn
                    from the <hi rend="italic">Register of the Privy Council,</hi> the district of
                    Kirkcaldy had the largest manufacture of salt in Scotland, and about 1650 it was
                    assessed as the sixth town in the kingdom. About 1644 there were one hundred
                    ships belonging to the port, in 1760 only three, in 1792 the number had risen to
                    twenty-nine, and in 1843 to ninety-one. Since then, chiefly owing to the
                    abandonment of the whale-fishing, and the insufficiency of the harbour to admit
                    large vessels, the trade of the port has considerably declined. The number of
                    vessels belonging to it may be stated at twenty-seven. A considerable extension
                    of the present harbour is among the possibilities of the future.</p>

                    wizard fame, was bora about a mile from the burgh boundary. (T. H. )</p>
