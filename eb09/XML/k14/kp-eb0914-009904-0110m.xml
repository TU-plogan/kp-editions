                    Scotland, and the chief town of the Orkney Islands, is situated near the centre
                    of the island group, at the southeast corner of a well-sheltered bay on the east
                    side of the island of Pomona, 240 miles north of Edinburgh by steamer, 58 north
                    of Wick, and 54 north of Thurso. It consists principally of an irregular street
                    about a mile in length running along the margin of the bay, and so narrow that
                    carts and similar vehicles in many places cannot pass each other. The houses are
                    generally substantially built, with the gables facing the street nearly as
                    frequently as the fronts. In courts leading from the main street there are many
                    ancient buildings, formerly occupied during winter by the leading families of
                    the islands. The more modern portion of the town is built with great regularity,
                    and in the suburbs there are several good villas surrounded by gardens. The most
                    prominent feature of the town is the cathedral, dedicated to St Magnus, the
                    patron saint of Orkney, a stately cruciform structure with a length of 226 feet
                    from east to west and a breadth of 56 feet. It was founded by Earl Ronald in
                    1137,'and the older portion, embracing the greater part of the present building,
                    is in the Norman style of architecture. The choir was lengthened by Bishop
                    Stewart in 1511, and the western extremity of the nave was completed by Bishop
                    Reid, who succeeded to the bishopric in 1540. The building has undergone
                    extensive repairs during the present century. The choir is used as the parish
                    church. The bells were presented by Bishop Maxwell, the predecessor or Bishop
                    Reid, but the larger or tenor bell was recast in 1862. The cathedral contains a
                    number of old monuments. Adjoining it are the ruins of the bishop’s palace,
                    where King Haco died in 1263, and also the earl’s palace, which after the
                    forfeiture of the earl of Orkney was given to the bishops for their residence.
                    There is a grammar school, which was endowed by Bishop Reid, and also several
                    charitable institutions. The town has no manufactures of importance, and its
                    prosperity depends chiefly on its being the capital and principal port of the
                    islands. It is often touched by ships passing to Norway and the Baltic. The
                    harbour is amply sufficient for the shipping of the port, and a fine iron pier
                    was erected in 1867. There is regular steam communication with Lerwick, and with
                    Leith by Aberdeen and Wick. Kirkwall (a name derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >kirk,</hi> church, and <hi rend="italic">vdgr</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >vaag,</hi> bay), was a place of some size when the islands were in the
                    possession of the Norsemen, and by James III. it was created a royal burgh. It
                    unites with the other burghs in the Wick district in returning a member to
                    parliament. The population of the parliamentary burgh in 1881 was 3923.</p>
