                <p><label type="entry">KOHÁT</label>, a district in the lieutenant-governorship of
                    the Punjab, India, is situated between 32° 47' and 33° 53' N. lat., and between
                    70’ 34' and 72° 17' E. long., and is bounded on the N. by Peshâwar, on the E. by
                    the Indus river, on the S. by Bannu district, and on the W. by the Kurarn river
                    and the Waziri hills. It consists chiefly of a bare and intricate mountain
                    region, deeply scored with river valleys and ravines, but enclosing a few
                    scattered patches of cultivated lowland. The eastern or Khatak country
                    especially comprises a perfect labyrinth of ranges, which fall, however, into
                    two principal groups, to the north and south of the Teri Toi river. The Miranzâi
                    valley, in the extreme west, appears by comparison a rich and fertile tract. In
                    its small but carefully tilled glens, the plane, palm, fig, and many orchard
                    trees flourish luxuriantly; while a brushwood of wild olive, mimosa, and other
                    thorny bushes clothes the rugged ravines upon the upper slopes. Occasional
                    grassy glades upon their sides form favourite pasture grounds for the Waziri
                    tribes. The Teri Toi, rising on the eastern limit of Upper Miranzâi, runs due
                    eastward to the Indus, which it joins 12 miles north of Makhad, dividing the
                    district into two main portions. The drainage from the northern half flows
                    southward into the Teri Toi itself, and northward into the parallel stream of
                    the Kohât Toi. That of the southern tract falls northwards also into the Teri
                    Toi, and southwards towards the Kuram and the Indus. The frontier mountains,
                    continuations of the Safed Koh system, attain in places a considerable
                    elevation, the two principal peaks, Dupa Sir and Mazeo Garh, just beyond the
                    British frontier, being 8260 and 7940 feet above the sea respectively. The
                    Waziri hills, on the south, extend like a wedge between the boundaries of Bannu
                    and Kohât, with a general elevation of less than 4000 feet. The salt mines are
                    situated in the low line of hills crossing the valley of the Teri Toi, and
                    extending along both banks of that river. The deposit has a width of a quarter
                    of a mile, with a thickness of 1000 feet; it sometimes forms hills 200 feet in
                    height, almost entirely composed of solid rock-salt, and may probably rank as
                    one of the largest veins of its kind in the world. The most extensive exposure
                    occurs at Bahâdur Khel, on the south bank of the Teri Toi. Petroleum springs
                    exude from a rock at Panoba, 23 miles east of Kohât; and sulphur abounds in the
                    northern range.</p>
                <p>The census of 1868 extended over an area of 2838 square miles, and disclosed a
                    total population of 145,419 (males, 79,323; females, 66,096). The Mohammedans
                    numbered 136,565, as against 6544 Hindus, 1837 Sikhs, and 473 “others.” The
                    Hindus chiefly belong to the trading castes. Among the Mohammedans, 6313 rank as
                    Sayyids; but the Pathâns form by far the largest division. Only one town, Kohat,
                    contains a population exceeding 5000 inhabitants. Since the annexation of the
                    Punjab, cultivation has extended from 64,772 acres in 1848 to 163,015 acres in
                    1873-74. The agricultural staples include wheat and barley for the spring
                    harvest, with rice, millet, Indian corn, and pulses for the autumn crops.
                    Tobacco, mustard, and oil-seeds also cover small areas, and cotton of inferior
                    quality is grown in favourable years. The area under wheat in 1873-74 was
                    returned as 36,600 acres; barley, 17,070; millets, 23,705; Indian corn, 12,050;
                    rice, 4710 acres. Cultivation has now nearly reached its utmost limit. The
                    principal industry of the district is centred in the salt mines. Of these five
                    are now open, from which 294,680 cwts. of salt were quarried in 1870-71. Gun
                    barrels manufactured near Kohât town have a considerable reputation along the
                    north-western frontier. Coloured scaτfs, woollen carpets, country cloth, and
                    pottery are also turned out at Kohât, Hangu, and Teri. The frontier military
                    road forms the chief channel of communication, practicable throughout for
                    wheeled conveyances and artillery. The district has altogether 249 miles of
                    road, all unmetalled, and in many cases mere tracks, passable at best by camels,
                    and sometimes only by bullocks or ponies. The total imperial revenue raised in
                    the district in 1851-52 amounted to £9824, which in 1872-73 had risen to
                    £19,443; of which the land-tax contributed £8951, and salt £8556. Education
                    remains in a very backward stage. Four Government or aided schools and
                    forty-three indigenous schools had a total roll of only 745 pupils in 1872-73.
                    From its proximity to the hills, the temperature of the district is
                    comparatively cool, except during the summer months.</p>

                <p>2 miles from the southern base of the Afridi Hills. The population in 1868,
                    including the cantonment, was 11,274. The town is built on undulating ground,
                    within an amphitheatre of hills, and is surrounded by a slight wall, 12 feet in
                    height. Its principal manufacture is that of gun barrels. The cantonment and
                    civil station lie to the east and north-east of the native city. The cantonment
                    has accommodation for about 3000 troops.</p>
