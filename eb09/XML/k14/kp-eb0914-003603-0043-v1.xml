                <p><label type="entry">KENSINGTON</label>, a western suburb of London in the parish
                    of Kensington, parliamentary borough of Chelsea, and county of Middlesex, a mile
                    and a half west of Hyde Park Corner. The parish includes the suburbs of
                    Brompton, Earl’s Court, part of Little Chelsea, the Gravel Pits, Notting Hill,
                    and part of Kensal Green. Kensington palace and Kensington gardens, however, lie
                    in the parish of St Margaret’s, Westminster. The suburb of Kensington, which has
                    developed out of the village of Kensington, lies to the west of Kensington
                    gardens, and consists principally of a long and in places narrow street, the
                    modern improvements of which with the surrounding additions have almost entirely
                    obliterated all traces of the “old court suburb” associated with the
                    distinguished personages of former times. From the High street others branch off
                    at intervals, and the elevated ground to the north is almost wholly occupied
                    with villas embosomed in woods. To the south of the High street is Kensington
                    square, where at one time were the residences of many of the principal
                    attendants on the court. The principal public buildings in the suburb are the
                    parish church in the Decorated style, erected in 1869 at a cost of £35,000, the
                    elegant new town-hall, the vestry hall, the grammar school, the Roman Catholic
                    college, opened in 1874, several monasteries and convents, and various schools
                    and charities. The site of Old Gore House, at one time the residence of Mr
                    Wilberforce and afterwards of the Countess of Blessington, is now occupied by
                    the Royal Albert Hall and the gardens of the Horticultural Society. These as
                    well as Kensington gardens and the South Kensington museum with its national

                        >London.</hi> Kensington palace, a plain and irregular brick structure,
                    originally surrounded by grounds extending to about 350 acres, was at one time
                    the residence of Lord Chancellor Finch, afterwards earl of Nottingham, of whom
                    it was bought by William HI. Additions were made to it by William HL, George I.,
                    George II., and the duke of Sussex. The palace was the birthplace of Queen
                    Victoria. Kensington house, which stood near the palace gate, and was at one
                    time the residence of the duchess of Portsmouth, mistress of Charles II., was
                    pulled down in 1873 to make way for the mansion of Baron Albert Grant The
                    population of the registration subdistrict in 1871 was 91,664, which in 1881 had
                    increased to 120,125. The population of the parish in 1881 was 162,924.</p>
                <p>The manor of Kensington, which is written in Domesday book <hi rend="italic"
                        >Chenesitun,</hi> has an area of 1140 acres. Some trace the origin of the
                    word to the old Saxon name for king, others to a family of the name of Chenesi,
                    others to “Caen,” the old name for wood. The manor was originally occupied by
                    the great Middlesex forest, the trees of which were abundant in the time of
                    Henry VIII. In Domesday it is mentioned as being held by Aubrey de Vere of the
                    bishop of Coutances. Soon after this it became the absolute property of the De
                    Veres, who were afterwards created earls of Oxford. In the reign of Elizabeth it
                    passed into the possession of the Argylls, by whom it was sold to Sir Walter
                    Cope, whose daughter married Henry Rich, earl of Holland. Holland House, in the
                    Elizabethan style, the original mansion of the manor of Kensington, was erected
                    by Sir Walter Cope in 1697, and enlarged and adorned by the third Lord Holland
                    (see vol. xii. p. 100). The manor is at present held by Lord Kensington. See
