                <p><label type="entry">KENTUCKY</label>, one of the central States of the United
                    States of America, is situated between 36° 30' and <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    W. long., and is bounded on the N. by Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, on the W. by
                    Missouri, on the S. by Tennessee and Virginia, and on the E. by Virginia and
                    West Virginia. It extends from east to west 458 miles, and its greatest width
                    from north to south is 171 miles.</p>
                <p>The area of the State has been variously estimated at from 37,000 to 40,000
                    square miles. The surface is an elevated plateau sloping from the great
                    Appalachian uplift on the south-east, to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers on the
                    north and west. Only that portion of the State including and lying between the
                    Pine or Laurel Mountain and the Cumberland range may be said to partake of the
                    mountain structure. These parallel ranges have an elevation of from 2000 to 3000
                    feet above sea-level, whilst the mountains in the Cumberland valley between
                    these ranges have an elevation of 3500 feet. The Cumberland river, near where it
                    passes through a break in Pine Mountain, is at low-water mark 960 feet above the
                    sea. Some of the hills immediately to the north are as high as Pine Mountain,
                    gradually decreasing in height to the western edge of the Appalachian
                    coal-field, where the greatest elevation is less than 1600 feet above the sea.
                    The topography can be understood by reference to the accompanying sketch map of
                    the geology of the State. The eastern coal-field, with an area over 10,000
                    square miles, has an elevation of 650 on the Ohio river to 1400 feet on the
                    south-western edge on the Tennessee line, and 3500 feet on the southeastern
                    border of the State. The great central or “Blue Grass region” (Lower Silurian on
                    map) has an area of about 10,000 square miles, and an elevation of from 800 to
                    1150 feet. Although elevated several hundred feet above the drainage level, the
                    surface is that of a gently undulating plateau, with a pleasing topography. The
                    Upper Silurian and Devonian, with an area of about 2500 square miles, have an
                    elevation of 450 on the north-west and 800 on the north-eastern end to 1100 feet
                    where these formations curve around the Lower Silurian on the southwest. In this
                    region are wide stretches of very level country, often with insufficient
                    drainage. Around this central region extends from the mouth of Salt river to the
                    mouth of the Scioto a continuous ridge known as Muldrows Hill, King’s Mountain,
                    Big Hill, and other local names, having an abrupt escarpment on its inner
                    circle, and sloping away from the central uplifted dome of the Blue Grass
                    region, as a broken plateau on the east, and an almost level plateau on the west
                    where the subcarboniferous limestone determines the topography. This range of
                    hills is one of the prominent features in the State. The subcarboniferous has an
                    area of about 10,000 square miles, with an elevation of from 350 to 600 feet on
                    the south-western to 950 in the central region. In the eastern portion of this
                    formation the streams have cut deep gorges in the limestone, but in its central
                    part only the larger streams are open to daylight, and most of the drainage is
                    subterraneous, which gives to that region a peculiar topography,—the surface
                    being a series of slight round or oval depressions, through which the surface
                    water escapes to the streams below. Whenever the small passage way leading
                    downwards from one of these sinks becomes closed, a “pond” is formed. In this
                    formation are the numerous caverns for which this State is noted. The western
                    coal field has an area of about 4000 square miles and an elevation of from 400
                    feet along the Ohio river to 850 feet in its south-eastern portion. The
                    Quaternary, with an area of about 2500 square miles, has an elevation of about
                    280 feet on the river bottom lands and from 350 to 450 on the uplands. The
                    average elevation for the entire State is over 1000 feet above the sea, and the
                    numerous streams penetrating all portions have cut their channels deep enough to
                    secure ample drainage, and exemption from the dangers of floods, with the
                    exception of very limited areas.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Divers.—</hi> The State has a river boundary of 813 miles of
                    navigable streams :—the Chatterawha or Big Sandy on the east for 120 miles, the
                    Ohio on the north for 643 miles, and the Mississippi on the west for 50 miles.
                    The Chatterawha, Licking, Kentucky, Cumberland, and Tennessee rivers have their
                    sources in the Appalachian coalfield, and flow through the State to the Ohio
                    river. The Green and Tradewater rivers drain the western coal-field. Kentucky
                    has many hundred miles of navigable rivers, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n53/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0053-0042"/> connecting with the Mississippi system, and
                    furnishing a most advantageous means of cheap transport for coal, timber,
                    &amp;c. A system of river improvement, begun by the State some years ago, by
                    which the Green and Barren rivers from Bowling Green downwards, and also the
                    lower portion of the Kentucky river, were made continuously navigable, is being
                    prosecuted still further by the United States Government. It is now possible to
                    float down logs, rafts, flat boats, &amp;c., from almost the fountain heads of
                    the rivers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate is very mild and salubrious. The
                    mean annual temperature ranges in different parts of the State from 50° to <hi
                    rend="italic">55</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> o</hi> Fahr. The extreme
                    range is less than in the States north and west. The lowest record at the United
                    States Signal Service Station during the exceptionally cold months of December
                    1880 and January 1881 was - 8°. During the very hot summer of 1881 the maximum
                    temperature was greater as far north as Chicago than in Kentucky. Cattle remain
                    upon pasture during the entire winter, with but little additional food, and
                    there is seldom a day, winter or summer, when a man may not perform a full day’s
                    work in the open air. The healthfulness of the climate is attested by the low
                    death-rate and by the strength and vigour of the population. The tabulated
                    measurements of the United States volunteers during the civil war show that the
                    soldiers born in Kentucky and Tennessee exceeded all others in height, weight,
                    circumference of head, circumference of chest, and ratio of weight to stature.
                    The speed and endurance of the Kentucky horse, and the superior development of
                    all kinds of domestic animals, are well known. The annual rainfall ranges in
                    various parts of the State from 45 to 50 inches, and is probably still higher in
                    the Cumberland Mountains.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> With the exception of the more recent formations
                    in the portion of the State west of the Tennessee river and along the valleys of
                    some of the streams, Kentucky is composed entirely of Palaeozoic strata, having
                    present all of the various groups found in the Ohio valley, from the calciferous
                    sandrock (3α of Dana’s <hi rend="italic">Table of Formations)</hi> to and
                    including the carboniferous. The united thickness of the various groups is not
                    great in Kentucky,—probably not aggregating over 5000 feet. The entire State is
                    included within the area of the great Appalachian uplift. In the south-east the
                    disturbance is greater, the strata often being inclined at a high angle, the
                    successive undulations gradually diminishing toward the northwest. This
                    disturbance in the south-east is emphasized by the Great Pine Mountain fault,
                    extending parallel to the axis of the Appalachian uplift, entirely through the
                    south-eastern portion of the State, and bringing to the surface in the
                    Coal-measures rocks as low as the Clinton group of the Upper Silurian. The axis
                    of the greatest geological elevation in the State is parallel to the above, and
                    passes in a north-easterly and south-westerly direction through the counties of
                    Montgomery, Clark, Madison, Garrard, Jessamine, and Boyle, shown on the map by
                    the deflexion of the Kentucky river from its general course towards the Ohio
                    river. This uplift brings to the surface the lowest rocks exposed in the
                    State,—the “bird’s eye” limestone of the Trenton (4α of Dana), and the dolomite,
                    known as “Kentucky river marble,” including what is probably the equivalent of
                    the calciferous sandrock of the New York section. These lower rocks of the
                    Kentucky section form a triangular area having its depressed apex north-west of
                    Frankfort, and its elevated base in the counties named above. Through these
                    formations, having a thickness of over 400 feet, the picturesque gorge of the
                    Kentucky river has been cut. Next in ascending order we have 150 feet of blue,
                    fossiliferous limestone, containing characteristic forms of the Trenton of New
                    York, and 800 feet of limestone and shales containing the fossils of the Hudson
                    river or Cincinnati groups (4c of Dana). These groups make up the well-known ‘ ‘
                    Blue Grass” region of Kentucky, celebrated for fertility of soil, high
                    agricultural development, and superiority of the horses and other domestic
                    animals produced. The soils of the most fertile portion of this region are
                    derived from the 150 feet immediately above the bird’s eye limestone. These
                    rocks are very rich in phosphate of lime, and with careful tillage and proper
                    rotation of crops the lands are not exhausted by cultivation. The blue
                    limestones of central Kentucky are very prolific in fossil forms.</p>
                <p>Surrounding this central region are the rocks of the Upper Silurian, averaging in
                    thickness about 100 feet. East of Louisville this formation is about 25 miles
                    wide, and in eastern central Kentucky about 10 miles wide, decreasing in
                    thickness and in superficial extent toward the south-western portion. The rocks
                    are mostly magnesian limestone rich in fossil forms, of which the most
                    characteristic are the beautiful chain corals. The soils of this formation are
                    less fertile than those derived from the blue shell limestone and marly shales
                    of the Lower Silurian. Above the latter formation, and forming the outer portion
                    of the semicircle or irregular triangle extending around the great central
                    uplift, are the corniferous limestones of the Devonian (9c of Dana). The
                    principal exposure is seen at the falls of the Ohio below Louisville, at low
                    water presenting probably the most beautiful and extensive natural cabinet of
                    corals in the world,—a reef of corals, perfectly preserved in minutest
                    structure, and of exquisite beauty. The soils derived from these rocks are of
                    almost equal fertility to the best soils of the blue limestone, and the
                    topography is equally pleasing to the eye. The next formation in order is the
                    black shale (10c of Dana) of the Devonian, with a thickness of about 150 feet in
                    the north-east, and decreasing gradually to the south and west. This formation
                    is peculiar from the high percentage of petroleum contained in the shale. Before
                    the discovery of oil-wells oil was distilled from these shales, and the oil in
                    the productive wells of Kentucky is derived from the same source. Where this
                    shale determines the topography the lands are generally flat, often with
                    insufficient drainage, and are not so productive as analyses would seem to
                    warrant. Doubtless underdraining will increase the yield.</p>
                <p>The Subcarboniferous roc⅛s, consisting of the several groups identified by fossil
                    remains with the Waverly, Keokuk, Warsaw, St Louis, and Chester groups (13α,
                    13δ, and 13c of Dana), composed of sandstones, shales, and limestones, with a
                    total thickness of over 1000 feet, cannot here be described in detail. Muldrows
                    Hill, representing the retreating escarpment of formations which formerly
                    extended over the central Blue Grass region, is composed of these rocks, capped
                    at Big Hill in Madison county with the carboniferous conglomerate. The
                    subcarboniferous limestone region of western and southern Kentucky, drained by
                    the Green and Cumberland rivers, is characterized for the most part by an
                    excellent soil, well adapted to the growth of Indian corn, wheat, barley, and
                    other cereals, producing a very fine quality of tobacco, and certain grasses in
                    great !&gt;erfection. This formation is noted for the numerous caverns of arge
                    size and great beauty,—the best known being the’ celebrated Mammoth Cave in
                    Edmonson county, which is the largest known cavern in the world. Here many miles
                    of subterranean passages have been excavated by the eroding action of water
                    charged with carbonic acid, assisted in places by the action of the atmosphere.
                    The caverns are beautified by columns and stalagmites formed by the deposition
                    of carbonate of lime from the percolating waters, and by exfoliation of sulphate
                    of lime, taking the form of flowers, rosettes, and other shapes, rendered more
                    beautiful by their power of reflecting light. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammoth
                    Cave.</hi></p>
                <p>The detailed survey of the Carboniferous strata of Kentucky is not yet completed,
                    but enough is known to justify the assertion that the total area in the State is
                    over 14,000 square miles,—10,000 square miles of the Appalachian coal-field and
                    4000 square miles of the western or Illinois coal-field. In the eastern field
                    two workable coals are found below and twelve above the carboniferous
                    conglomerate. The eastern field is remarkable for the thickness of some of the
                    coal strata and the purity of coals, for the large area of excellent cannel
                    coals, and for the ease with which the coals may be mined, being mostly elevated
                    above the drainage level. The thickest portion of the measures is in the
                    synclinal trough between the Pine and Cumberland Mountains,—there being a
                    vertical thickness of over 2200 feet of Coal-measure rocks above the drainage
                    level. In the south-eastern portion of the eastern field an excellent coking
                    coal has been traced over a wide area. This coal ranges from 4 feet to 8 feet in
                    thickness, can be mined cheaply, and has a very low percentage of ash and
                    sulphur. The western coal-field is a broad synclinal, its axis almost parallel
                    to the general direction of Green river, crossed by undulations the axes of
                    which extend from northeast to south-west. No workable coal has been opened
                    below the conglomerate, which is thinner than in eastern Kentucky. Twelve coals
                    are present in the measures above the conglomerate. Some of these coals are of
                    excellent quality, although the percentage of sulphur is larger than in the best
                    of the eastern Kentucky coals. The soils of the Coal-measures are variable in
                    quality. Some of the most productive lands in the State are in the western
                    coal-field. In the eastern field are very fertile valleys, and the uplands in
                    the Cumberland valley are quite productive. Even the poorest of the Coalmeasure
                    soils are well adapted to certain grasses and fruits, and will yield good
                    returns from intelligent culture.</p>
                <p>There only remain to be noticed the Quaternary strata. The region west of the
                    Tennessee river, and the level plains bordering the principal rivers and above
                    high-water level, are composed of a homogeneous buff-coloured silicious loam
                    known as the “bluff” or loess formation (205 of Dana). This is, with the
                    exception of the alluvial “bottoms” along the rivers, the most recent formation
                    in Kentucky. The deposit has a thickness of from 40 to 50 feet. Owing partly to
                    the presence of numerous land and freshwater shells <hi rend="italic">(Helix,
                    Cyclostoma, Pupa,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cyclas,</hi> &amp;c.), this formation is

                    the soils are of marked fertility. This bluff loam rests upon a coarse gravel,
                    varying in thickness from a few inches to 30 feet, composed mainly of water-worn
                    pebbles from the carboniferous conglomerate, and slightly water-worn angular
                    pebbles of chert and hornstone from the lower subcarboniferous and corniferous
                    groups, and coarse angular sand. Intermingled throughout are silicified

                    order are beds of white sand and clay and shales of the Eocene (Tertiary), only
                    slightly exposed in the extreme western part of the State, where the streams
                    have cut deepest. Nowhere in the State have evidences of glacial action been
                    found. Over the uplifted Blue Grass region are often thick deposits of what has
                    been called drift material; but such deposits are composed altogether of
                    silicified remains from the several formations above the Lower Silurian, and the
                    evidences are conclusive that they are the remains of rocks decomposed <hi

                    have been discovered in Kentucky. The amount of coal hitherto mined has not been
                    as large as the quantity and quality in the State would justify, but the
                    increased facilities of transport have stimulated production, and the output
                    will increase from year to year. In 1870 the amount mined was 150,582 tons, and
                    in 1880 1,050,095 tons, a larger percentage of increase than in any other State
                    in the Union. Iron ores of good quality abound in various parts of the State. In
                    Bath county is a large deposit of Clinton ore similar to the red fossil ore
                    occurring in this formation from New York to Alabama. The same ore probably is
                    iu position along the western base of Pine Mountain. Along the south-eastern
                    border of the State it extends for many miles in Tennessee and Virginia with a
                    thickness of from 18 inches to 7 feet, where the very near proximity to the
                    excellent coking coal of Kentucky renders it of peculiar value in determining
                    the future development of that portion of the State. In the Cumberland valley of
                    western Kentucky a high grade limonite is abundant in the subcarboniferous
                    limestone, and in eastern Kentucky a superior iron-ore rests upon the top of the
                    St Louis group of this formation. Excellent carbonates and limonites abound in
                    the eastern Coal-measures, and have been mined extensively in the north-eastern
                    part of the State. In the Lower Coal-measures of western Kentucky are a number
                    of iron-ore strata ranging in thickness from a few inches to 5 feet.</p>
                <p>Galena associated with sulphate of baryta occurs in veins in the lower members of
                    the blue limestone of central Kentucky, and also in the subcarboniferous strata
                    in the lower Cumberland valley, where it is associated with valuable deposits of
                    fluor-spar.</p>
                <p>Petroleum has been produced from wells in Barren county for a number of years.
                    The oil is here derived from the Devonian black shale. Heavy lubricating oil is
                    produced from the same formation in Wayne county. There is a wide area in the
                    State where petroleum may be obtained by boring.</p>
                <p>Salt-brine is obtained from wells in the eastern coal-field, and in the
                    subcarboniferous limestone of western Kentucky.</p>
                <p>Fire and pottery clays abound in the Coal-measures; pottery clays occur in the
                    surface deposits in valleys of central Kentucky, and in the flat lands where the
                    soil is derived from the decomposition of the Devonian black shale, and the
                    argillaceous shales of the Waverly group. In the Tertiary shales, below the
                    gravel bed west of the Tennessee river, are pottery-clays, and fire-clays occur
                    iu great abundance.</p>
                <p>Building stones of great variety abound in almost every section.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forests.—</hi> Probably two-thirds of the State is yet covered
                    by virgin forests of valuable timbers. At the time of the settlement of the
                    State by the whites it was covered by forests excepting a portion of the
                    south-western part known as the “Barrens,” which was a prairie covered by tall
                    grass known as “barren-grass.” Here only the roots of certain hardy trees had
                    withstood the annual burning of the dry grasses; from these roots “sprouts” grew
                    every year, only to be destroyed by fire, and the roots or base grew
                    horizontally under the soil. When the country was settled and the fires checked,
                    the saplings springing from these roots soon grew into trees, and the region was
                    speedily covered with a dense growth,—the prevailing timbers being black-jack
                    oak <hi rend="italic">(Quercus</hi><hi rend="italic">nigra),</hi> post oak <hi
                    rend="italic">(Q. obtusiloba),</hi> and black oak (Q. <hi rend="italic"
                    >tinctoria).</hi> The outline of these barrens was almost identical with the
                    outline of the cavernous group of the subcarboniferous limestone. On the lower
                    limestones and shales of the Subcarboniferous, the most valuable timbers
                    remaining are yellow poplar <hi rend="italic">(Biriodendron tulipifera),</hi>
                    white oak <hi rend="italic">(Q. alba),</hi> the hickories, and some black walnut
                    <hi rend="italic">(Juglans</hi><hi rend="italic">nigra).</hi> The several
                    divisions of the Lower Silurian are characterized by a variation in the forest
                    growth. On the lower rocks the most characteristic timbers are over-cup oak <hi
                    rend="italic">(Q∙ macrocarpa),</hi> white oak, shell bark hickory <hi
                    rend="italic">(Carya alba),</hi> black walnut, and black ash <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Fraximιs sambucifolia).</hi> The prevalent timbers-on the best soils of this
                    region are—sugar maple <hi rend="italic">(Acer saccharinum),</hi> blue ash <hi
                    rend="italic">(Fr.</hi><hi rend="italic">quadrangulata),</hi> black walnut,

                    Kentucky coffee-tree <hi rend="italic">(Gymnoclad/us).</hi> On the soils derived
                    from the silicious member of the Cincinnati group, the prevalent timbers are
                    yellow poplar, beech, white and red oak, and hickory. White oak is the
                    prevailing timber on the upper portion. On the Upper Silurian lands the timbers
                    are mainly white oak, of superior quality, sweet gum <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Liguidambar styraciflua),</hi> and water maple <hi rend="italic">(A.
                    rubrum).</hi> The growth on the corniferous limestone is very similar to that on
                    the best soils of the blue limestone, with the exception that beeches and yellow
                    poplars are more numerous. On the black shale of the Devonian are over-cup oak,
                    black oak, sweet gum, beech, and elm, and, in places where the soil is well
                    drained, yellow poplar, wild cherry, and black walnut. The growth on the flat
                    lands of the Waverly is elm, beech, sweet gum, and white oak; on the uplands
                    chestnut, oak <hi rend="italic">(Q.</hi><hi rend="italic">Prinus),</hi> and
                    small hickories, and on the thin uplands the above timbers and yellow pine <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pinus mitis).</hi> The great stores of valuable timbers are in
                    the Coal-measures. In eastern Kentucky there is an area of 10,000 square miles
                    of virgin forests of white oak, ash, hickory, wild cherry, and other valuable
                    timbers. On the outcrop of the conglomerate sandstone, on the western edge of
                    the coal-field, and on the top and eastern slope of Pine Mountain, and the
                    western slope of Cumberland Mountain, the prevailing timbers are chestnut, oak,
                    and yellow pine, and hemlock <hi rend="italic">(Abies canadensis)</hi> where the
                    streams have cut deep in the rocks, with an undergrowth of rhododendrons and
                    kalmias, and on the drier slopes azaleas. The above is also the growth where the
                    conglomerate is thick on the eastern outcrop of the western coal-field. In the
                    valley of Red river, on the conglomerate series, there is an area of about
                    40,000 acres where the prevalent timber is white pine <hi rend="italic">(P.
                    strobus).</hi> There are fine forests remaining on the Quaternary west of the
                    Tennessee river. On the lowlands are forests of large cypress <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Taxodium distyckum).</hi> In this region the <hi rend="italic">Catalpa</hi><hi

                    >(Populus angulata)</hi> on the banks of streams. Many valuable timbers, in
                    addition to the above, are to be had in various parts of the State. Owing to the
                    large demands for timber on the treeless prairies, and the rapid exhaustion of
                    timbers in the States north of the Ohio river, the extensive forests of Kentucky
                    have an especial value.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soilsand Agriculture.—</hi> With, the exception of the area
                    west of the Tennessee river, all the soils are derived from the decomposition of
                    rocks <hi rend="italic">in situ.</hi> The soils over an area of about 22,000
                    square miles are derived from the decomposition of limestones of various
                    geological horizons. The soils of the Blue Grass region, derived from the
                    decomposition of phosphatic limestone and shales, and the soils of a portion of
                    the subcarboniferous limestone groups, are of great fertility, and are easily
                    restored by a judicious rotation with clover and grasses.</p>
                <p>The State was peopled almost exclusively with agriculturists from Virginia and
                    Maryland, and agriculture has remained the favourite occupation. Out of a total
                    population of 1,321,011 in 1870 only 44,197 were engaged in manufacturing,
                    mechanical, and mining industries. The peculiarity of Kentucky agriculture is
                    its great diversity. It will be seen from the United States census that in each
                    decade from 1810 to the present time the State ranked first in the production of
                    one or more staple articles. Thus in 1840, though sixth in rank of population,
                    it was the first in the production of wheat and hemp, and the second in the
                    production of swine, Indian corn, and tobacco. In 1850 it ranked first in the
                    production of Indian corn, flax, and hemp, and second in swine, mules, and
                    tobacco. In 1870, when it was the eighth State in population, and the eighth in
                    the total value of agricultural products (notwithstanding over one-half the area
                    of the State was in virgin forests), it ranked first in the production of hemp
                    and tobacco, sixth in Indian corn, and eighth in wheat. In 1880 it ranked fir st
                    in the production of hemp and tobacco, and seventh in Indian corn and rye. The
                    decline in the relative position in the production of Indian com and wheat was
                    not caused by a decreased production, but by the increased production of those
                    cereals by States in the west where these are almost the exclusive crops. In
                    Kentucky a more diversified agriculture is found to be more profitable. Especial
                    care has been devoted to the importation and improvement of domestic animals,
                    until the State has become the great centre for fine stock of all kinds. In
                    arriving at this pre-eminence, the breeders have doubtless been assisted by the
                    climate, the water, and the perfection of pasturage. The blue grass (<hi
                    rend="italic">Poa</hi><hi rend="italic">pratensis)</hi> attains perfection in
                    this region, making a beautiful turf; it grows in the shade of woodlands, and
                    affords an excellent winter pasture. Virginia, in early times, imported choice
                    horses from England (when the breeders there paid attention to endurance). The
                    Kentucky breeders have kept those strains pure, and have from time to time added
                    by importations from England, until a race horse having endurance and speed is
                    the result. Probably over 75 per cent, of the winnings on the American turf is
                    by Kentucky-bred horses. The attention of many of the Kentucky stock breeders of
                    late years has been turned to breeding trotting horses, with very marked
                    results. The production of the very fleet trotting horses of Kentucky is the
                    result of intelligent breeding, under favourable conditions.</p>
                <p>Kentucky is the principal tobacco-growing State in the Union. In 1870, of the
                    total of 262,735,371 lb produced in the United States, Kentucky produced
                    105,305,869 lb; and in 1880, out of the total of 473,107,573 lb, Kentucky
                    produced 171,121,134 lb. The ten principal tobacco-groλving counties are :—</p>

                <p>Hemp, since the early settlement of the State, has been a favourite crop, more
                    especially in the Blue Grass region, contrary to an accepted, opinion it has not
                    here proved an exhausting crop where retted upon the land. Wheat succeeds almost
                    as well after hemp as after clover sod. The yield of hemp for the year 1880 was
                    about 15,000 tons. Cotton is grown only to a limited extent west of the
                    Tennessee river, the total production amounting in 1880 to 1367 bales. The total
                    number of farms in 1870 was 118,422, the average size being 158 acres. In 1850
                    the average size of farms was 227 acres, and in 1860 211 acres. Over 60 per
                    cent, of the area returned as farms was unimproved or in timber. The area
                    returned as improved or under fence was less than one-third the area of the
                    State.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> Before the freeing of the slaves, domestic
                    manufacturing on the farm was carried on to a large extent, and as late as 1870
                    the State ranked second in the value of domestic or home manufactures. The total
                    value of manufactures was in 1850 $21,712,210; in 1860, $37,931,240; andin 1870,
                    $54,625,809. The increase since 1870 has been larger than before, and the State
                    will soon rank high as a manufacturing State. There has been a great increase in
                    the manufacture of corn whisky in the past few years. The total production for
                    the year ending June 30, 1881, was 31,869,047 gallons. The amount of iron
                    manufactured was 86,732 tons in 1870, and 123,751 tons in 1880.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government, Taxation,</hi> &amp;c.—The State government was
                    modelled after that of Virginia. The governor is elected for four years, and
                    cannot be his own successor. One-half of the senate is elected every two years,
                    and the members of the lower house are elected for two years. There are 117
                    counties, each presided over by a judge and a board of magistrates. The gross
                    receipts for the fiscal year ending October 10, 1880, were $2,445,401, and the
                    gross expenditure $2,379,343. About one million dollars per annum is given to
                    public schools, which amount can be supplemented by local taxation in counties
                    or school districts. The State tax is 45⅜ cents on each $100 worth of property,
                    and as property is rated at a low valuation taxes are light. Of the above amount
                    25 cents are for the purposes of revenue, 20 cents for the public schools, and ⅜
                    cent for the State agricultural and mechanical college. The State is practically
                    free from debt, owing but $180,000, and having on deposit an amount more than
                    enough to pay that sum when the State bonds may fall due. The State has in
                    addition about $750,000 worth of productive assets.</p>

                    On January 1, 1881, there were 1598 miles of railway in operation in the State.
                    The number of miles constructed since 1870 has been greater than before for the

                <p><hi rend="italic">History. —</hi> The region now known as Kentucky was embraced
                    in the grant to the colony of Virginia by the British crown, and in the early
                    part of the last century was an unknown region “beyond the mountains,” included
                    in Augusta county, Virginia. This region was in 1776 formed into a separate
                    county called Kentucky county. Previous to this the land had been somewhat
                    explored by adventurous hunters, the most notable being Daniel Boone, who led a
                    small party from North Carolina in 1769. Virginia had given bounties of lands to
                    her troops for services in the French Indian wars, and the glowing accounts
                    brought from beyond the mountains induced many expeditions for surveying and
                    locating lands. Kentucky was at this time a favourite hunting ground for the
                    various tribes of Indians of the north and south, and the occupation by the
                    whites was resisted by all the means known to Indian warfare. The first
                    settlement was made at Harrod’s station, now Harrodsburg, in 1774. In the year
                    following Boone and party built a group of rude block houses, called a fort, on
                    the banks of the Kentucky river, at Boonesboro ’, and in 1776 other “stations”
                    were built in central Kentucky, and the work of clearing and cultivating the
                    land began. In the midst of Indian forays and border wars, the traditions of law
                    prevailed, and a court of quarter sessions was established at Harrodsburg in
                    1776. Col. G. Rogers Clark, the hero of early Kentucky, planned an expedition in
                    1778 against the British forts in the north-west; marching swiftly, with less
                    than 200 men, through miles of wilderness, he captured Kaskaskia and Vincennes,
                    and secured to Virginia the imperial territory of Illinois.</p>
                <p>Separated by several hundred miles of uninhabited forest from the “settlements”
                    in Virginia, and feeling the necessity of a government that would enable them to
                    make a vigorous defence against the Indians, the people held many conventions
                    and petitioned for a separate government, which was granted by Virginia, and in
                    1792 Kentucky was admitted as a State into the Federal Union. Virginia had
                    granted large bounties of land to her soldiers of the war for independence, and
                    also treasury land warrants in redemption for her depreciated currency. The
                    lands were located in Kentucky, and a large emigration from Virginia and
                    Maryland was the result. The population in 1790 was 73,667, of whom 61,133 were
                    white, 114 free coloured, and 12,430 slaves. From 1790 to 1800 the population
                    increased 300 per cent. In the second war with England, which broke out in 1812,
                    the Kentuckians marched to the defence of the north-west, and suffered heavy
                    loss in the reverse at the river Kasin; but afterwards 4000 volunteers, under
                    Governor Shelby, participated in the victory on the banks of the Thames. As
                    early as 1827 the State began a system of internal improvements under which many
                    miles of macadamized roads were made, and the navigation of the rivers improved.
                    The State expenditure for these purposes, independent of the county and
                    individual subscriptions, amounted to more than $5,000,000/</p>
                <p>On the outbreak of the war with Mexico in 1846, the governor of Kentucky called
                    for 5000 men, and 13,700 quickly answered the call. In that war the Kentucky
                    troops bore a conspicuous and honourable part. The finding of gold in
                    California, the granting of lands in the west, the aid in the construction of
                    railways, and the consequent fever for speculation in western lands, were a
                    severe drain on the productiveness of the State. The lines of railway connecting
                    the sea-board cities with the great west crossed the mountains north of
                    Kentucky. This and the disinclination to compete with slave labour carried the
                    great tide of immigration and commerce north of Kentucky. When the great civil
                    war began in 1861, Kentucky was a slave State; most of the productions of the
                    State found remunerative markets in the cotton-growing States, and there were
                    many business and social ties binding the State with the south. Whilst
                    sympathizing with the Southern States, the majority of the people loved the
                    Union, and the State determined to assume a position of armed neutrality, and if
                    possible act as a mediator between the sections. The governor of the State
                    refused (April 1861) to furnish the quota of men demanded by the Federal
                    Government, a refusal approved by the State legislature by an almost unanimous
                    vote. Arms were sent into Kentucky by the Federal Government, and camps
                    established. The Confederate forces moved into the State on Septembers, and the
                    Federal on September 7. The governor, in obedience to a resolution of the
                    legislature, demanded the withdrawal of the Confederates, as violators of the
                    neutrality of the State. Their refusal to do so except on condition that the
                    Fédérais should also withdraw, led to an outbreak of hostilities, in which the
                    people of the State were divided, many joining both armies. The Federal forces
                    held the State almost continuously during the war, and 91,900 men were recruited
                    in it for the Union armies, including 8704 home guards or militia called into
                    active service, and about 11,000 coloured volunteers. On the other hand, about
                    40,000 Kentuckians went south and joined the Confederate forces. When the war
                    ended, and the Kentucky soldiers from the two armies returned to their homes,
                    laws passed under the excitement of civil war were repealed; fraternal peace
                    followed quickly, and the people of the State, accepting the new conditions,
                    entered upon a new era, with hope for a peaceful and prosperous future. (J. R.
