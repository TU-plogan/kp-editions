                    (1794-1871), novelist, was born at Passy on the 21 st of May 1794, and died at
                    Paris on the 29th of August 1871. He was a posthumous child, his father, who was
                    a banker of Dutch extraction, having been one of the numerous victims of the
                    Terror, and dying on the scaffold with Hebert and Clootz, not as an extreme
                    republican, but as “suspect” of foreign relations. The family was one of some
                    rank in the Netherlands, and an uncle of the novelist attained to the position
                    of minister of the interior in his native country. Paul de Kock, however,
                    remained all his life a citizen of France. He began life as a banker’s clerk,
                    which occupation he soon quitted for literature. But his natural taste, or the
                    memory of his father’s death, kept him far apart from the republican party, and
                    he was perhaps the most remarkable literary continuator of the <hi rend="italic"

                    concerned. His life was almost entirely uneventful, its chief incident being a
                    burglary which was committed at his country house at Romainville in his later
                    days. For the most part he resided on the Boulevard St Martin, and was one of
                    the most inveterate of Parisians.</p>
                <p>Paul de Kock began to write very early, and continued to produce novels almost
                    until the end of his long life. But his period of greatest and most successful
                    activity was the Restoration and the early days of Louis Philippe. The
                    comparative “patavinity” of his style, and the fact of his standing aloof from

                    relatively less popular in France itself than abroad, where he was considered as
                    the special painter of life in Paris. Major Pendennis’s remark that he had read
                    nothing of the novel kind for thirty years except Paul de Kock, “who certainly
                    made him laugh,” is likely to remain one of the most durable of his
                    testimonials, with as a companion the legendary question of a foreign sovereign
                    to a Frenchman who was paying his respects, “Vous venez de Paris et vous devez
                    savoir des nouvelles. Comment se porte Paul de Kock '?” The disappearance of the
                        <hi rend="italic">grisette</hi> and of the cheap dissipation which Murger
                    pathetically laments in more than one of his works practically made Paul de Kock
                    obsolete, and his want of style affected him as unfavourably as it did his
                    dramatic analogue Scribe. But to the student of manners his vivid and by all
                    accounts truthful portraiture of low and middle class life in the first half of
                    the 18th century at Paris will never lose its value, and, though he can hardly
                    be said to hold a high place in literature, he is a remarkable follower of
                    Restif de la Bretonne, and may be said to be in a sense the last of the 18th
                    century school of novelists.</p>
                <p>It has been said that the works of Paul de Kock are very numerous. In the fullest
                    list that we have seen they amount to about a hundred, some of them being
                    decidedly voluminous. With the exception of a few not very felicitous excursions
                    into the historical romance, they are all stories of middle class Parisian life,
                    of <hi rend="italic">guinguettes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cabarets</hi> and
                    equivocal adventures of one sort or another. The most famous of all is <hi
                        rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Barbier de Paris,</hi> which has been
                    translated into almost every European language. Of equal literary merit, and,
                    considering the style, of singular freedom from objectionable characteristics,
                    is <hi rend="italic">André le</hi><hi rend="italic">Savoyard,</hi> a remarkable
                    story, full of narrative power, and one of the happiest examples of the working
                    up of simple and commonplace details into an interesting whole. A certain
                    sameness pervades most of Paul de Kock’s work. It is almost untouched by the
                    influences of the romantic movement, and has none of the strong sentiments of
                    the school which derived from the author’s contemporary Balzac. But there is a
                    good deal of human nature in it, a good deal of accurate observation, and an
                    almost total absence of the revolting and the preposterous. Paul de Kock was the
                    Charles de Bernard of low life, and greater praise of its kind could hardly be
                    given to any writer.</p>
