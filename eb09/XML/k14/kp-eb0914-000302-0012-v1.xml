                <p><label type="entry">KARASU-BAZAR</label>, a town of Russia, in the government of
                    Taurida, near the rivers Tunas and Karasu, in 45° 3' N. lat. and 34° 26' E.
                    long., 27 miles from Simpheropol on the road to Theodosia. The site is low, but
                    it is surrounded by hills, one of which, the Ak-Kaya or White Rock, not only
                    affords protection from the north wind, but so reflects the sunshine upon the
                    town that it enjoys a much milder climate than the surrounding region. The dirty
                    streets full of petty traders, the gloomy bazaar with its multitude of small
                    shops, the market squares, the blind alleys, the little gates in the dead
                    court-yard walls, all give the place the stamp of a Tartar or Turkish town, and
                    remind the visitor that here was after 1763 the seat of the Crimean khans. In
                    1861 there were twenty-four mosques, but several have fallen into decay; in one
                    of them is the tomb of Yakubaga-Rudzvitch, the founder of the well-known Crimean
                    family. Of the numerous caravanserais, the Tash-Khan is the most notable —a
                    strong half-fortified building erected in 1656. Placed on the high road between
                    Simpheropol and Kertch, and in the midst of a country rich in corn-land,
                    vineyards, and gardens, Karasu-Bazar used to be a chief seat of commercial
                    activity in the Crimea; but it is gradually declining in importance. The
                    population consists of Armenians, Greeks, Jews, Tartars, and (in smaller
                    numbers) Russians. The bulk of the trade is in the hands of the Armenians, and
                    they are also the owners of the great proportion of <pb break="no"

                    Jews are what are known as Krimtchaks, or sometimes as Constan tinopo!itan Jews.
                    From the ordinary “rabbinical Jews” of Russia they differ by wearing the Tartar
                    costume and by the use of the Tartar tongue, instead of the German jargon. They
                    are engaged in making leather, Tartar knives, Tartar embroidery, and similar
                    articles. The population of Karasu-Bazar is given by the St Petersburg <hi
                        rend="italic">Calendar</hi> for 1874 as 14,397. Round about the town lie
                    cemeteries of unusual extent.</p>
                <p>By Thunman and others Karasu-Bazar has been identified with the Greek town of
                    Mauron-Kastron, but Professor Bruhn thinks that, as there has never apparently
                    been any fortress at Karasu-Bazar, the site of the “Black Castle” is more
                    probably at Mangup-Kale. The caves of Akkaya, however, give evidence of early
                    occupation of the spot. When in 1736 Khan Feta Ghirei was driven by the Russians
                    from Bakhchisarai he settled at Karasu-Bazar, but next year the town was
                    captured, plundered, and burned by General Douglas. In 1784 it was the temporary
                    seat of the Russian administration of the Crimea.</p>
