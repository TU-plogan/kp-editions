                <p><label type="entry">KNOT</label>, a Limicoline bird very abundant at certain
                    seasons on the shores of Britain and many countries of the northern hemisphere.
                    Camden in the edition of his <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi> published in 1607
                    (p. 408) inserted a passage not found in the earlier issues of that work,
                    connecting the name with that of King Canute, and this account of its origin has
                    been usually received. But no other evidence in its favour is forthcoming, and
                    Camden’s statement is merely the expression of an opinion,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>His words are simply “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Knotts,</hi> i. <hi rend="italic">Cαnuti aues,</hi> vt opinor e Dania enim
                    aduolare creduntur.” In the margin the name is spelt “Cnotts,” and he possibly
                    thought it had to do with a well-known story of that king. Knots undoubtedly
                    frequent the sea-shore, where Canute is said on one occasion to have taken up
                    his station, but they generally retreat, and that nimbly, before the advancing
                    surf, which he is said in the story not to have done.</p></note> so that there
                    is perhaps ground for believing him to have been mistaken, and that the clue
                    afforded by Sir Thomas Browne, who <hi rend="italic">(circa</hi> 1672) wrote the
                    name “Gnatts or Knots,” may be the true one.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>‘ In this connexion we may compare the French <hi
                    rend="italic">maringoνin,</hi> ordinarily a gnat or mosquito, but also, among
                    the French Creoles of America, a small shore-bird, either a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Τringa</hi> or an <hi rend="italic">Aegialitis,</hi> according to Descourtilz
                    (<hi rend="italic">Voyage,</hi> ii. p. 249). See also Littré’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionnaire,</hi><hi rend="italic">sub voce.</hi></p></note> Still the
                    statement was so determinedly repeated by successive authors that Linnaeus
                    followed them in calling the species <hi rend="italic">Tnnga canutus,</hi> and
                    so it remains with nearly all modern ornithologists.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There are few of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lirnicolae,</hi> to which group the Knot belongs, that present greater changes
                    of plumage according to age or season, and hence before these phases were
                    understood the species became encumbered with many synonyms, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Tringa</hi><hi rend="italic">cinerea, ferruginea, grisea,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">islandica,</hi><hi rend="italic">naevia,</hi> and so forth. The
                    confusion thus caused was mainly cleared away by Montagu and
                    Temminck.</p></note> Rather larger than a Snipe, but with a short, Plover-like
                    bill and legs, the Knot visits the coasts of some parts of Europe, Asia, and
                    North America at times in vast flocks; and, though in temperate climates a good
                    many remain throughout the winter, these are nothing in proportion to those that
                    arrive towards the end of spring, in England generally about the 15th of May,
                    and after staying a few days pass northward to their summer quarters, while
                    early in autumn the young of the year throng to the same places in still greater
                    numbers, being followed a little later by their parents. In winter the plumage
                    is ashy-grey above (save the rump, which is white) and white beneath. In summer
                    the feathers of the back are black, broadly margined with light orange-red,
                    mixed with white, those of the rump white, more or less tinged with red, and the
                    lower parts are of a nearly uniform deep bay or chestnut. The birds which winter
                    in temperate climates seldom attain the brilliancy of colour exhibited by those
                    which arrive from the south; the luxuriance generated by the heat of a tropical
                    sun seems needed to develop the full richness of hue. The young when they come
                    from their birthplace are clothed in ashy-grey above, each feather banded with
                    dull black and ochreous, while the breast is more or less deeply tinged with
                    warm buff. Much curiosity has long existed among zoologists as to the egg of the
                    Knot, of which not a single identified or authenticated specimen is known to
                    exist in collections. Yet more than sixty years ago the species was found
                    breeding abundantly on the North Georgian (now commonly called the Parry)
                    Islands by Parry’s memorable expedition, as well as soon after on Melville
                    Peninsula by Captain Lyons, and again during the recent voyage of Sir</p>
                <p>George Nares on the northern coast of Grinnell Land and the shores of Smith
                    Sound, where Major Feilden obtained examples of the newly-hatched young <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1877, p. 407), and observed that the parents fed
                    largely on the buds of <hi rend="italic">Saxifraga</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >oppositifolia.</hi> These are the only localities in which this species is
                    known to breed, for on none of the arctic lands lying to the north of Europe or
                    Asia has it been unquestionably observed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The <hi rend="italic">Tringa canutus</hi> of Payer’s

                    rend="italic">maritima,</hi> which species is not named among the birds of Franz

                    wanderings are very extensive, as it is recorded from Surinam, Brazil,
                    WalvischBay in South Africa, China, Queensland, and New Zealand. Formerly this
                    species was extensively netted in England, and the birds fattened for the table,
                    where they were esteemed a great delicacy, as witness the entries in the
                    Northumberland and Le Strange Household Books; and the British Museum contains
                    an old treatise on the subject—“The maner of kepyng of knotts, after Sir William
                    Askew and my Lady, given to my Lord Darcy, 25 Hen. VIII.” <hi rend="italic"
