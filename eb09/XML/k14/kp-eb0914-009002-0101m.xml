                    1814. Much of his youth was spent at Oporto, where his father was a merchant,

                    out. That and its immediate successors were received with such unequivocal
                    popularity that Kingston retired from business, and devoted himself to the
                    production of tales of adventure for boys. Within thirty years he wrote upwards
                    of one hundred and thirty such books. He travelled at various times in many of
                    the countries of Europe, and lived for a while in Portugal during the civil war
                    there. His <hi rend="italic">Western Wanderings,</hi> published in 1856,
                    describes a tour in Canada. In all philanthropic schemes Kingston took deep
                    interest; he was the promoter of the mission to seamen; and he acted as
                    secretary of a society for promoting an improved system of emigration. He was a
                    supporter of the volunteer movement in England from the first. For his services
                    in bringing about a commercial treaty between Portugal and Britain he was
                    knighted by the queen of Portugal; and his literary merits were recognized at
                    home by a grant from his own sovereign. He died at Willesden, August 5,1880.</p>
                <p>Kingston’s boyish ambition had been to enter the navy, and he always kept his
                    affection for the sea. As he advanced in life he had opportunities of cruising
                    in men-of-war, besides sailing in merchantmen and his own yacht; and it was thus
                    that he gained the knowledge of practical seamanship that he used so graphically
                    in his books. Most of his stories are stories of the sea; and he generally laid
                    his plots in the old romantic days before England’s wooden walls had given place
                    to iron-clads. He was a master of the simple romance in which boys delight, and
                    knew well how to draw the peculiar compound of valour and magnanimity that forms
                    the hero to healthy boyhood. He had great assimilative power in using the
                    accounts of travellers in countries where he had never been; and his imagination
                    supplied him abundantly with gallant adventures, thrilling dangers, and
                    hairsbreadth escapes. His books are useful in insinuating knowledge whilst they
                    are giving pleasure, and they are valuable inasmuch as their whole tone is pure,
                    wholesome, and manly. Characteristic specimens of his works are <hi
                    rend="italic">The Three Midshipmen; The Three Lieutenants; The Three Commanders
                    ∙,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Three Admirals.</hi> Occasionally his books
                    were not in the form of a story; and some of them are designed for adult
                    readers.</p>
