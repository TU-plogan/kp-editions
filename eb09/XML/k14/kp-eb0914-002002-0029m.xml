                    government survey, is 23,998 square miles. By the Volga and its tributary the
                    Kama the surface of the government is divided into three regions of differing
                    aspect: the first, to the right of the main river, is traversed by deep ravines
                    sloping to the north-east and by two ranges of hills, one of which, keeping
                    company with the river, has a height of 300 to 500 feet; the second, between the
                    left bank of the Volga and the left bank of the Kama, is an open steppe; and the
                    third, between the left bank of the Volga and the right bank of the Kama,
                    resembles in its eastern part the first region, and in its western part is
                    covered with forest. Marls, limestones, and sandstones, Permian or Triassic, are
                    the main rocks; the Jurassic formation appears in a small part of the Tetyushi
                    district; and Tertiary rocks stretch along the left bank of the Volga. There are
                    no minerals of importance; but mineral springs (iron, sulphur, and naphtha)
                    exist in several places. The Volga is navigable in all the 198 miles of its
                    course through Kazan, as well as the Kama (120 miles); and the Vyatka, the
                    Kazanka, the Rutka, the Tsivil, the Greater Kotshaga, the Ilet, and the Bezdna
                    are not without value as waterways. About four hundred small lakes are
                    enumerated within the government; the Upper and Lower Kaban supply the city of
                    Kazan with water.</p>
                <p>About 7,123,610 acres (more than 46 per cent, of the surface) are arable, upwards
                    of 1,324,900 acres (over 8 per cent.) are meadow land, and 5,190,960 acres
                    (nearly 34 per cent.) are under forest. Rye and oats form the principal crops;
                    barley, wheat, buckwheat, and potatoes are also grown. In 1879 the official
                    returns gave 1,048,092 as the number of sheep in the government, and of these
                    13,748 were of fine woolled breeds; the horned cattle amounted to 359,362, the
                    horses to 426,564, the swine to 192,190, and the goats to 45,822. No fewer than
                    8066 persons were engaged in beekeeping, and the produce of this department was
                    valued at £29,945. Industrial activity is on the increase; the number of the
                    smaller manufacturing establishments is diminishing, but those which remain (272
                    in 1879, employing 8399 hands) are greatly increasing in production. The total
                    value of their manufacture in 1879 was £2,034,137. Apart from the regular
                    factories, there is a large industrial activity. The weaving and dyeing of linen
                    and hemp goods gave employment in 1879 to 13,485 men; wool-combing, &amp;c., to
                    3428; flour and malt making to 3680, and the forest industries, wood-cutting,
                    tar-boiling, &amp;c., to 10,423. The aggregate commerce of the towns is
                    estimated at £3,695,000. Of the seventy-six annual fairs, the chief are the
                    timber fair of Kozmodemyansk, and those of Tchistopol and Tcheboksarui.
                    Administratively Kazan is divided into twelve districts :—Kazan, Sviyazhsk,
                    Tcheboksarui, Tsivilsk, Yadrin, Kozmodemyansk, Tsarevokokshaisk, Mamaduish,
                    Tchistopol, Laisheff, Spassk, Tetyushi. Besides the city of Kazan, the following
                    are the largest towns :—Tchistopol (20,293 inhabitants in 1879), Laisheff
                    (5098), Tcheboksarui (4560), Kozmodemyansk (4508), Mamaduish (4068). The total
                    population of the government in 1879 was 1,872,437 (194,343 in the towns,
                    1,678,094 in the country districts). The males in the former case numbered
                    109,915, and the females 84,428; and in the latter the males 820,144, and
                    females 857,950. An increase of 267,732 has taken place since 1862. More than
                    half of the inhabitants are of non-SIavonic origin; and the Mohammedans number
                    over half a million.</p>
                <p>The formation of the Kazan government dates from the year 1708; at first it
                    contaiued a large portion of south-eastern Russia, but in 1781 the present
                    limits were determined. The division into twelve districts was made in 1802.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Kazan,</hi> chief town of the above government, is situated
                    in 55° 48' N. lat. and 49° 26' E. long., 528 miles east of Moscow and 970 miles
                    from St Petersburg. The summer course of the Volga lies several miles to the
                    south-west, and is gradually increasing its distance; but when the river is at
                    its height in spring the intervening space is laid under water, and the
                    steamers, which at other times stop at the mouth of the Kazanka, are able to
                    approach the town. Though the hill on which the citadel stands is only about 40
                    feet high, it forms a striking relief to the level country in front. Contrary to
                    what might be expected from its history, the town is almost completely destitute
                    of Oriental colouring; but the number and brightness of the Greek churches helps
                    to relieve the general air of modern and commonplace regularity. The cathedral
                    of the Annunciation was founded in 1562 by Gury, the first bishop of the diocese
                    of Kazan; and the Bogoroditskii convent was erected in 1579 for the reception of
                    the “Black Virgin of Kazan,” which was removed in 1821 to the famous Kazan
                    cathedral in St Petersburg. Of pre-Russian buildings there is hardly a trace;
                    the red brick Sumbek tower, 245 feet high, is an object of great veneration to
                    the Tartars, who consider it as the burial-place of one of their saints; but its
                    similarity to the towers of Moscow proves its Muscovite origin. As an
                    intellectual centre Kazan is the most important city of eastern Russia in
                    Europe. The gymnasium, founded in 1750, was the third national institution for
                    secondary education established in the empire; and the university, which dates
                    from 1801, has become a great seat of Oriental scholarship. It has four
                    faculties, with fifty-six teachers and about seven hundred students. The library
                    contains about 85,000 volumes; but the most valuable part of its manu · script
                    collection has been removed to St Petersburg. There is an astronomical
                    observatory; and from the university press are issued a learned journal <hi
                    rend="italic">(L·vyestiya i Zapiskx)</hi> and a very considerable number of
                    works, especially in Oriental philology. The ecclesiastical academy founded in
                    1846 contains the old library of the Solovki monastery, of importance for the
                    history of Russian sects. Schools are maintained by the Tartar population, which
                    still occupies some of the suburbs; and Tartar text-books (by Radloff) after the
                    European type have been introduced. As a seat of commerce and industry Kazan
                    holds a respectable place. Its leather goods, especially those of the finer
                    qualities, are in repute; and it also manufactures alcohol, flour, cotton and
                    hemp goods, starch, stearine, tallow, and albumen. The trade connexion of the
                    Tartar merchants more particularly is a very extensive and important one. The
                    population <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n30/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0030-0021"/> of the town, which was 63,084 in 1863, had
                    increased in 1879 to 134,434, of whom 13,635 are Tartars.</p>
                <p>The present government of Kazan was the centre of a great Bulgarian kingdom, the
                    first historical monarchy of north-eastern Russia. On the ruins of this kingdom
                    the Mongolian (Tartar) “kingdom of Kazan” was founded in the 15th century by
                    Ulu-Mahmet, whose descendants continued to rule till the destruction of their
                    city by Ivan the Terrible iu 1552. Of the town of Kazan the early notices are of
                    doubtful interpretation; but according to S. Μ. Shpilevski the Kazan mentioned
                    in 1376 must be Bulgar (the present Bolgarui in the district of Spassk), the
                    “Great Town” of the Bulgarians, the ruins of which are among the most notable in
                    the Kazan region; and the Kazan of even some of the later chronicles is to be
                    identified with Koshan on the Kama. Nor is the present the original of Kazan
                    proper; on the banks of the Kazanka are extensive remains of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iski</hi> (Tartar for “Old") <hi rend="italic">Kazan,</hi> near a modern
                    village of the same name. Kazan was laid waste by Pugatchcff, and the
                    conflagrations of 1815 and 1825 were especially destructive. During the French
                    invasion the Moscow university took asylum in the town.</p>
                <p>The name of Kazan Tartars is given, not only to those of the government of Kazan,
                    but to those of Ufa, Samara, Vyatka, Saratoff, Penza, Nizhni Novgorod, Orenburg,
                    and Tamboff. In 1870 they amounted altogether to 1,050,000. In many ways they
                    differ considerably from those of Astrakhan, the Crimea, &amp;c. They have
                    pretty certainly incorporated a good deal of Bulgarian blood.</p>
                <p>The history of Kazan has been written by Turnerelli (1841), Lepteff, Kurbski, and
                    others. The evidence of Arabic, Tartar, and Russian writers in regard to the
                    antiquities of town and government has been collected by Shpilevski <hi
                    rend="italic">(Izv. i Zap. Imp. Kaz. Un.,</hi> 1877, pp. 1-585). A bibliography
                    of the Oriental books published in the town is given in the <hi rend="italic"
