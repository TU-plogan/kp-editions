                <p><label type="entry">KNIGHTHOOD</label> and CHIVALRY are two words which are
                    nearly but not quite synonymous; that is, they may often, although they cannot
                    always, be used precisely in the same way and exactly in the same sense. What we
                    mean by the order of knighthood is to all intents and purposes what we mean by
                    the order of chivalry. But in some of the more special applications of the
                    several terms diversities in their respective significations manifest
                    themselves. We could not, for example, say of anybody that he had received the
                    honour of chivalry, or that he had lived in the age of knighthood. Again, we
                    should speak of lands as held in chivalry not in knighthood, and of the rank or
                    degree of knighthood not of chivalry. But taken together the two words
                    knighthood and chivalry designate a single subject of inquiry, which presents
                    itself under three different although connected and in a measure intermingled
                    aspects. It may be regarded in the first place as a mode or variety of feudal
                    tenure, in the second place as a personal attribute or dignity, and in the third
                    place as a scheme of manners or social arrangements. It is under these three
                    general aspects that the subject is to be dealt with here. For the more
                    important religious as distinguished from the military orders of knighthood or
                    'chivalry the reader is referred to the headings <hi rend="smallcaps">St John

                <p>Our words <hi rend="italic">knight</hi> and <hi rend="italic">knighthood</hi> are
                    merely the modern forms of the Anglo-Saxon or Old English <hi rend="italic"
                    >cniht</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cnihthad.</hi> Of these the primary
                    signification of the first was a boy or youth, and of the second that period of
                    life which intervenes between childhood and manhood. But some time before the
                    middle of the 12th century they had acquired the meaning they still retain of
                    the French <hi rend="italic">chevalier</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >chevalerie.</hi> In a secondary sense <hi rend="italic">cniht</hi> meant a
                    servant or attendant answering to the German <hi rend="italic">Knecht,</hi> and
                    in the Anglo-Saxon Gospels a disciple is described as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >learning cniht.</hi> In a tertiary sense the word appears to have been
                    occasionally employed as equivalent to the Latin <hi rend="italic">miles—</hi>
                    usually translated by <hi rend="italic">thegn—</hi> which in the earlier Middle
                    Ages was used as the designation of the domestic as well as of the martial
                    officers or retainers of sovereigns and princes or great personages.<note

                    gradually superseded the word thegn.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    description of an attendant of the king, appears to have meant more especially a
                    military attendant. As Dr Stubbs says, “the thegn seems to be primarily the
                    warrior gesith”—the gesithas forming the chosen band of companions <hi
                    rend="italic">(comites)</hi> of the German chiefs <hi rend="italic"
                    >(principes)</hi> noticed by Tacitus—“he is probably the gesith who had a
                    particular military duty in his master’s service”; and he adds that from the
                    reign of Athelstan “the gesith is lost sight of except very occasionally, the
                    more importaut class having become thegns, and the lesser sort sinking into the
                    rank of mere servants of the king.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Stubbs, <hi rend="italic">Constitutional History,</hi> vol.
                    i. p. 156.</p></note> It is pretty clear, therefore, that the word <hi
                    rend="italic">cniht</hi> could never have superseded the word thegn in the sense
                    of a military attendant, at all events of the king. But besides the king, the
                    ealdormen, bishops, and king’s thegns themselves had their thegns, and to these
                    it is more than probable that the name of <hi rend="italic">cniht</hi> was
                    applied. Under the singular system of joint responsibility and suretyship which
                    was characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon government, the practice of commendation
                    had attained to extraordinary dimensions. He who was unattached to some
                    superior—the lordless man—was indeed regarded as a kind of outlaw; and, if he
                    refused or neglected to choose a lord for himself, his kindred were bound to
                    present him to the county court and select a lord for him. Hence a relation
                    which was for the most part merely personal, but which only required the
                    addition of land holding—an addition, it can scarcely be doubted, sometimes
                    made—to render it in all respects feudal, was widely and firmly established in
                    England long before the Norman Conquest. The mutual rights and obligations of
                    lord and man, in a far more advanced condition than they appear as between
                    hlaford and gesith at an earlier period, were perfectly familiar to the
                    Anglo-Saxons, and it was only in part due to the influence of the Normans that
                    they were subsequently transformed into the mutual rights and obligations of
                    lord and tenant. Around the Anglo-Saxon magnates were collected a crowd of
                    retainers and dependants of all ranks and conditions; and there is evidence
                    enough to show that among them were some called <hi rend="italic">cηihtas</hi>
                    who were not always the humblest or least considerable of their number.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stubbs, vol. i. pp. 156, 366;
                    Turner, vol. iff. pp. 125-129.</p></note> The testimony of Domesday also
                    establishes the existence in the reign of Edward the Confessor of what Dr Stubbs
                    describes as a “large class” of landholders who had commended themselves to some
                    lord, and he regards it as doubtful whether their tenure had not already assumed
                    a really feudal character. But in any event it is manifest that their condition
                    was in many respects similar to that of a vast number of unquestionably feudal
                    and military tenants who made their appearance after the Norman Conquest. If
                    consequently the former were called <hi rend="italic">cnihtas</hi> under the
                    Anglo-Saxon régime, it seems sufficiently probable that the appellation should
                    have been continued to the latter—practically their successors—under the
                    Anglo-Norman régime. And if the designation of knights was first applied to the
                    military tenants of the earls, bishops, and barons—who although they held their
                    lands of mesne lords owed their services to the king—the extension of that
                    designation to the whole body of military tenants need not have been a very
                    violent or prolonged process. Assuming, however, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >knight</hi> was originally used to describe the military tenant of a noble
                    person, as <hi rend="italic">cniht</hi> had sometimes been used to describe the
                    thegn of a noble person, it would, to begin with, have defined rather his social
                    status than the nature of his services. But those whom the English called <hi
                    rend="italic">knights</hi> the Normans called <hi rend="italic">chevaliers,</hi>
                    by which term the nature of their services was defined, while their social
                    status was left out of considera tion. And at first <hi rend="italic"
                    >chevalier</hi> in its general and honorary signification seems to have been
                    rendered not by <hi rend="italic">knight</hi> but by <hi rend="italic"
                    >rider,</hi> as may be inferred from the Saxon Chronicle, wherein it is recorded
                    under the year 1085 that William the Conqueror “dubbade his sunu Henric to
                    ridere.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ingram’s
                    edition, p. 290.</p></note> But, as Mr Freeman says, “no such title is heard of
                    in the earlier days of England. The thegn, the ealdorman, the king himself,
                    fought on foot; the horse might bear him to the field, but when the fighting
                    itself came he stood on his native earth to receive the onslaught of her
                    enemies.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Comparative Politics,</hi> p. 74.</p></note> In this perhaps we
                    may behold one of the most ancient of British insular prejudices, for on the
                    Continent the importance of cavalry in warfare was already abundantly
                    understood. It was by means of their horsemen that the Austrasian Franks
                    established their superiority over their neighbours, and in time created the
                    Western empire anew, while from the word <hi rend="italic">caballarius,</hi>
                    which occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Capitularies</hi> in the reign of
                    Charlemagne, came the words for knight in all the Romance languages.<note

                    1069.</p></note> In Germany the chevalier was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ritter,</hi> but neither <hi rend="italic">rider</hi> not <hi rend="italic"
                    >chevalier</hi> prevailed against <hi rend="italic">knight</hi> among ourselves.
                    And it was long after <hi rend="italic">knighthood</hi> had acquired its present
                    mean ing with us that <hi rend="italic">chivalry</hi> was incorporated into our
                    language. It may be remarked too in passing that in official Latin, not only in
                    England but all over Europe, <hi rend="italic">miles</hi> held its own against
                    both <hi rend="italic">eques</hi> and <hi rend="italic">caballarius.</hi></p>
                <p>Concerning the origin of knighthood or chivalry as it existed in the Middle
                    Ages,—implying as it did a formal assumption of and initiation into the
                    profession of arms,— nothing beyond more or less probable conjecture is
                    possible. The mediaeval knights had nothing to do in the way of derivation with
                    the “equites” of Rome, the knights of King Arthur’s Round Table, or the Paladins
                    of Charlemagne. But there are grounds for believing that some of the rudiments
                    of chivalry are to be detected in early Teutonic customs, and that they may have
                    made some advance among the Franks of Gaul. We know from Tacitus that the German
                    tribes in his day were wont to celebrate the admission of their young men into
                    the ranks of their warriors with much circumstance and ceremony. The people of
                    the district to which the candidate belonged were called together; his
                    qualifications for the privileges about to be conferred upon him were inquired
                    into; and, if he were deemed fitted and worthy to receive them, his chief, his
                    father, or one of his near kinsmen presented him with a shield and a lance.
                    Another custom apparently common to the Goths and the Franks was the ceremony of
                    adoption by arms. By means of a solemn investiture with warlike weapons, the two
                    parties to the formality or rite thenceforth acquired the artificial characters
                    of father and son, not, as in the Roman practice of adoption, for any purpose of
                    succession or inheritance, but in a purely honorary and complimentary manner.
                    Selden and Du Cange concur in tracing the ceremony of “dubbing to knighthood”
                    directly to the ceremony of the “adoptio per arma.” Among the Lombards the sons
                    of their kings were forbidden to sit at the tables of their fathers until they
                    had been invested with arms, and this, it is further said, by some foreign
                    prince or potentate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Mills, <hi rend="italic">History of Chivalry,</hi> vol. i. p. 36.</p></note>
                    But among the Franks we find, from the authorities cited by Du Cange,
                    Charlemagne girding his son Louis the Pious, and Louis the Pious girding his son
                    Charles the Bald with the sword, when they arrived at manhood.<note

                    >Gloss.,</hi><hi rend="italic">s.v.</hi> “Arma.”</p></note> These cases can
                    hardly be referred, as the Lombard usages may, to the “adoptio per arma.” Yet it
                    is indisputable that in the investiture of Louis and Charles with the sword some
                    ceremony was observed which was deemed worthy of record, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n123/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0123-0112"/> not for its novelty, but as a thing of recognized
                    importance. It does not follow that a similar ceremony extended to personages
                    less exalted than the sons of kings and emperors. But if it did we must
                    naturally suppose that it applied in the first instance to the mounted warriors
                    who formed the most formidable portion of the warlike array of the Franks. It
                    was among the Franks indeed, and possibly through their experiences in war with
                    the Saracens, that cavalry first acquired the pre-eminent place which it long
                    maintained in every European country. In early society, where the army is not a
                    paid force but the armed nation, the cavalry must necessarily consist of the
                    noble and wealthy, and cavalry and chivalry, as Mr Freeman observes,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Freeman, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comparative Politics,</hi> p. 73.</p></note> will be the same. Since then we
                    discover in the <hi rend="italic">Capitularies</hi> of Charlemagne actual
                    mention of “caballarii” as a class of warriors, it may reasonably be concluded
                    that formal investiture with arms applied to the “caballarii,” if it was a usage
                    extending beyond the sovereign and his heir apparent. “But,” as Hallam says, “he
                    who fought on horseback and had been invested with peculiar arms in a solemn
                    manner wanted nothing more to render him a knight;” and so he concludes, in view
                    of the verbal identityof “chevalier” and “caballarius,”that “we may refer
                    chivalry in a general sense to the age of Charlemagne.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hallam, <hi rend="italic">Middle Ages,</hi>
                    vol. iii. p. 392.</p></note> Yet, if the “caballarii” of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Capitularies</hi> are really the precursors of the later knights, it remains a
                    difficulty that the Latin name for a knight is “miles,” although “caballarius”
                    became in various forms the vernacular designation.</p>
                <p>Before it was known that the chronicle ascribed to Ingulf of Croyland is really a
                    fiction of the 13th or 14th century, the knighting of Heward or Hereward by
                    Brand, abbot of Burgh (now Peterborough), was accepted from Selden to Hallam as
                    an historical fact, and knighthood was supposed, not only to have been known
                    among the Anglo-Saxons, but to have had a distinctively religious character
                    which was contemned by the Norman invaders. The genuine evidence at our command
                    altogether fails to support this view. When William of Malmesbury describes the
                    knighting of Athelstan by his grandfather Alfred the Great, that is, his
                    investiture “with a purple garment set with gems and a Saxon sword with a golden
                    sheath,” there is no hint of any religious observance. In spite of the silence
                    of our records, Dr Stubbs thinks that kings so well acquainted with foreign

                    introduce into England the institution of chivalry then springing up in every
                    country of Europe; and he is supported in this opinion by the circumstance that
                    it is nowhere mentioned as a Norman innovation. Yet the fact that Harold

                    not yet a knight, which in the case of so tried a warrior would imply that
                    “dubbing to knighthood” was not yet known in England even under Edward the
                    Confessor, or, as Mr Freeman thinks, that in the middle of the 11th century the
                    custom had grown in Normandy into “something of a more special meaning” than it
                    bore in England. William of Normandy was knighted by his overlord Henry I. of
                    France, and of the Conqueror’s sons he himself, as we have already seen,

                <p>It was under William Rufus, according to Mr Freeman, that the chivalrous and
                    financial sides of feudalism sprang together into sudden prominence in
                    England—the first as represented by the Red King, and the second as represented
                    by his minister Ranulf Flambard.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In one sense tenure in chivalry was practically coextensive with European
                    feudalism, while in another sense it was strictly speaking peculiar to England
                    after the Norman Conquest, and Ireland after the English Conquest. We have no
                    earlier information of the details of the feudal organization of Normandy than
                    we have of the feudal organization of England, and therefore it is impossible to
                    say how far the second was copied from the first, or the first assimilated to
                    the second. But at all periods there was apparently sufficient difference
                    between the Norman “fief de hauberc” and the English knight’s fee to prevent the
                    one from being pronounced in the proper meaning of the term the counterpart of
                    the other. Into Ireland, however, the English system of tenures was imported
                    without change of conditions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    William I. was only completed under Henry II., and at the time of the
                    subjugation of Ireland there was already established a distinction between the
                    feudal arrangements which had been made before and after the death of Henry I.,
                    as the “old” and the “new” feoffments. That Henry H.’s method of dealing with
                    the conquered lands of Ireland was an exact imitation of William I.’s method of
                    dealing with the conquered lands in England cannot therefore be assumed. But
                    both kings had at their disposal a large extent of territory which they granted
                    to their vassals on terms necessarily very similar. In the reign of Henry II.
                    the knight’s fee was what may be called the “unit” of the system of tenures
                    which had grown up in England since the Norman Conquest. In the <hi

                    and that a barony consisted of thirteen and a third knights’ fees, a statement
                    which seems to have been accepted without misgiving until it was refuted by

                    number of the knights’ fees which they comprised. It was certainly not a fixed

                    “servitium unius militis,” which was afterwards the technical designation of a

                    yet acquired the special meaning which was subsequently assigned to it. Among
                    the “milites” of Domesday are persons of very various conditions, from ordinary
                    soldiers and the inferior tenants of manors to Hamo the sheriff and the earl of

                    Mr Freeman, “for thinking that William directly or systematically introduced any
                    new kind of tenure into the holding of English lands. There is nothing to
                    suggest any such belief either in the chronicles of his reign, in the survey
                    which is his greatest monument, in the genuine, or even in the spurious, remains
                    of his legislation. The code of laws which bears William s name, but which is
                    assuredly none of his enacting, is in all but a very few points a mere
                    confirmation of the old English law. And the few points of innovation have
                    nothing to do with feudal tenures. But when we come to the reign next but one we
                    are met by a document which shows us that within thirteen years after the
                    Conqueror’s death not only the military tenures but the worst abuses of the
                    militarytenures were in full force in England. The great charter of Henry I.,
                    the groundwork of the greater charter of John, and thereby the groundwork of all
                    later English legislation, is filled with promises to abolish the very same
                    class of abuses which were at last swept away by the famous statute of Charles
                    II.” (Freeman, <hi rend="italic">Norm. Cong.,</hi> vol. v. p. 372 <hi

                    in the Black Book o( the Exchequer were made in the reign of Henry II., both the
                    principle and system of knights’ fees were fully and definitively established.
                    Hence this change must have been effected in the interval between the
                    compilation of these two records. It cannot be supposed that the numerous grants
                    of land made by William I. to his adherents were exempt from military obligation
                    of one kind or another. But no original grant of his or of either of his
                    immediate successors to any lay vassal is in existence to inform us what the
                    exact nature of those military obligations was; and, arguing from the grants to
                    various ecclesiastical vassals, Dr Stubbs regards it as unlikely that such gifts
                    were made on any expressed condition or accepted with a distinct pledge to
                    provide a certain contingent of knights for the king’s service.<note

                    the Norman Conquest, he contends, all landholders having been bound to the duty
                    of national defence, and a certain quantity of land having customarily furnished
                    a fully armed man, the old rate of military obligation was in all probability
                    continued in the case of the new grantees after the Conquest. Nothing in
                    Domesday implies that the conditions of military service differed under the old
                    and the new monarchy, and hence Dr Stubbs concludes that “the form in which
                    knights’ fees appear when called on by Henry II. for scutage was most probably
                    the result of a series of compositions by which the great vassals relieved their
                    lands from a general burden by carving out particular estates the holders of
                    which performed the services due from the whole; it was a matter of convenience
                    and not of tyrannical pressure.” And, although Selden, and Madox after him,
                    adhere to the common and ancient tradition that William the Conqueror made his
                    grants conditional on the service of some particular number of knights in every
                    case, they substantially agree in regarding the knight’s fee in its special
                    meaning as the consequence of subinfeudation. From the reign of Henry II. to the
                    reign of Edward I., indeed, what may be called grants in gross from the king and
                    grants in detail from the mesne lords were the ordinary methods of erecting
                    knights’ fees and providing for the discharge of the personal and pecuniary
                    obligations with which they were burdened.</p>
                <p>Although the feudal services and incidents of a knight’s fee appear to have been
                    ascertained with perfect clearness, the exact nature of a knight’s fee
                    itself—what it was or in what it consisted—has been the subject of a great deal
                    of controversy. As the demands both personal and pecuniary which were made on
                    the holder of each knight’s fee were uniform, it is reasonable to conclude that
                    all such fees were in some way equivalent to one another. But whether their
                    equivalence was inferred from the quantity of land they contained or from the
                    amount of revenue derived from them has been much debated, and cannot be said to
                    be even now finally settled. Selden, indeed, roundly affirms that “the legal
                    value of knights’ fees was never in truth estimable either by any certain number
                    of acres or quantity of revenue (though some have erroneously determined them by
                    both), but only by the services or number of knights reserved.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Titles of
                    Honor,</hi> p. 613.</p></note> But if this were the case it is difficult to
                    understand how parts of a knight’s fee such as a half or a third could have been
                    held, as they unquestionably were held, under reduced burdens calculated in
                    proportion to the full burdens of a whole knight’s fee. According to the
                    analogies of the Anglo-Norman policy in other departments of its manifestation,
                    it might have been expected with some degree of confidence that the knight’s fee
                    would have been a combination of the property qualification of the thegn and the
                    feudal attributes of the “fief de hauberc,” that is, of the latter superinduced
                    upon the former. Before the Norman Conquest the property qualification of a
                    thegn was five hides of land, for which a fully equipped warrior was to be
                    furnished for the national defence in the king’s host or “fyrd”; and there is no
                    evidence to rebut the presumption that after the Norman Conquest a similar rate
                    of military obligation was continued. It is not, however, without hesitation
                    that Dr Stubbs arrives at what seems to be rather a provisional than a final
                    determination on the subject. In one passage he observes that “the name of thegn
                    covers the whole class which after the Conquest appears under the name of
                    knights, with the same qualification in land and nearly the same
                    obligations.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stubbs,
                    <hi rend="italic">Con. Hist.,</hi> vol. i. p. 156.</p></note> In another
                    passage, on the contrary, he says that “it cannot even be granted that a
                    definite area of land was necessary to constitute a knight’s fee; for although
                    at a later period and in local computations we may find four or five hides
                    adopted as a basis of calculation, where the particular knight’s fee is given
                    exactly, it affords no ground for such a conclusion.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> p. 264 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi></p></note> On the whole he thinks it must be held that
                    its extent was determined not by acreage but by rent or valuation, and that “the
                    common quantity was really expressed in the twenty librates, the twenty pounds’
                    worth of annual value, which until the reign of Edward I. was the qualification
                    for knighthood.” That this was the established appraisement of the knight’s fee
                    very soon after the Norman Conquest Dr Stubbs infers from the circumstance that
                    Archbishop Lanfranc maintained ten knights to answer for the military service
                    due from the convent of Christ Church in consideration of land worth two hundred
                    pounds a year which on that account was assigned to him.<note anchored="true"

                    was twenty pounds at the enactment of both Magna Charta and the statute “De
                    Militibus,” he cites various writs for distraint of knighthood which, if indeed
                    some of them were not merely writs of array, would show that it varied
                    irregularly from ten to forty pounds in amount between the reigns of Edward T.
                    and Henry VI.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Coke, <hi

                    resoιted to “knight-money” as a means of raising a revenue. The aggregate number
                    of knights’ fees throughout England in feudal times is very variously stated by
                    tradition. The assertion of Ordericus Vitalis in the reign of Stephen that the
                    Conqueror settled his military fiefs so as to provide 60,000 knights for his
                    service was accepted, not only <pb break="no"

                    writers of weight from Selden to Hallam. But 60,000 knights’ fees at £20 a year
                    gives about twelve times the whole national income from land as it appears in

                <p>All tenure in chivalry was founded on homage and fealty, to which were added the
                    various services and liabilities under which the different fiefs or tenements
                    were held. Homage consisted in the mutual acknowledgment by the lord and tenant
                    that the latter was the vassal or man of the former, accompanied as evidence
                    thereof by certain solemn acts of obeisance on the one hand and of acceptance
                    and patronage on the other. Hence homage could be done only by the tenant in
                    person to the lord in person. Connected with and following on homage was fealty,
                    which was an undertaking or oath on the part of the tenant that he would be true
                    and faithful to his lord in consideration of the lands which he held of him, and
                    that he would duly and fully observe the several conditions of his tenure, which
                    declaration might be received on behalf of the lord by anybody whom he might
                    appoint for the purpose. Every tenant in chivalry owed service to his lord in
                    peace as well as in war, and was bound to attend him in his court not less than
                    in the field. The civil obligations of tenants by knight-service were to assist
                    their lords in the administration of justice and to support them on occasions of
                    ceremony and display. The chief vassals of the king, the earls and barons, were
                    the homagers and peers of the great court-baron of the kingdom, and in turn
                    their under-tenants were the homagers and peers of their palatine and baronial
                    courts. The military obligations of tenants by knightservice were discharged
                    either in the king’s armies or in the castles of the king and his principal
                    feudatories. In the first case the holder of a knight’s fee was bound to serve
                    in the royal host fully equipped and on horseback at his own expense for forty
                    days in every year when called upon,—a tenant in chief serving under the direct
                    command of the sovereign or his officers, and an under tenant in the martial
                    retinue of his immediate lord. But in the second case the duties of the tenant
                    were not defined by any general rule or custom, and the terms of his service of
                    “castle guard” depended on the special stipulations of his grant or
                    feoffment.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    subjected to various other burdens which in course of time became the most
                    important incidents of their tenure. On the death of a tenant, his heir, if he
                    was of full age, was compelled on taking up his inheritance to pay a fine to his
                    lord. This was called a relief if he was an under tenant, or “primer seisin” if
                    he was a tenant in chief, and amounted in the first instance to one quarter’s
                    profits, and in the second to one whole year’s profits, of his estate.<note

                    Carta,</hi> sect. 2.</p></note> The tenant was also liable to render what were
                    called aids to his lord for three purposes, namely, to ransom him from
                    captivity, to make his eldest son a knight, and to provide a portion for his
                    eldest daughter on her marriage. Of these three aids ransom was only a very rare
                    and exceptional demand, while those “pur faire fitz chivaler” and “pur file
                    marier” were of course of frequent and ordinary occurrence. Wardship and
                    marriage, however, were the main incidents of tenure by knight-service after the
                    military obligations which formed its essential characteristic, and they were
                    always the most unpopular and oppressive of them. When on the death of the
                    tenant the heir was under the age of twenty-one or the heiress under the age of
                    fourteen, the lord became the “guardian in chivalry” of his or her person and
                    lands until he reached the age of twenty-one or she reached the age of sixteen,
                    when on the payment of half a year’s income of their estate in lieu of all
                    reliefs and “primer seisins” the wards were entitled to sue out their livery or
                    “ousterlemain.” In the meantime the lord had all the profits of the lands, and
                    was not bound to render any account of them, while he was at liberty to assign
                    or sell his guardianship with its attendant rights and immunities unimpaired.
                    Moreover, he was entitled to dispose of his male, as well as his female, wards
                    in marriage to any person of equal or similar rank to their own, and if they
                    rejected the match recommended by him, or married without his consent, they
                    incurred the forfeiture to him of a sum of money equivalent to what was termed
                    the value of their marriage, that is, the price which was to have been given or
                    might have been reasonably expected to be given for it. Nor could the tenant by
                    knight-service part with his lands without the payment of a fine on alienation
                    to his lord, to whom they altogether passed on his neglect to fulfil his feudal
                    obligations or on the extinction of his heirs. Again, whether he was an under
                    tenant or a tenant in chief, his lands escheated to the king if he was convicted
                    of treason, while if he was convicted of any other felony they escheated to his
                    immediate lord, the king—if he were not the immediate lord —entering into
                    possession of them for a year and a day. It had also become customary from a
                    comparatively early period to compel the tenants of knights’ fees to take upon
                    themselves the honorary distinction of knighthood, and it is remarkable that
                    this appears to have been most systematically insisted on after the actual
                    render of military service had been universally commuted to a money equivalent,
                    and when even that money equivalent itself under its original name of escuage or
                    scutage was passing or had passed away.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“In the nineteenth of Henry III., all the sheriffs of
                    England were commanded by close writs under the great seal to make proclamation
                    that all they who held of the king in chief one knight’s fee or more and were
                    not as yet knighted should get themselves knighted before the ensuing Christmas,
                    as they loved the tenements and fees they held of the king. Two years before the
                    king had seized the lands and chattels of Roger de Sumery, including the honour
                    of Dudley, because he did not come to the king to be girded with the belt of
                    knighthood” (Madox, <hi rend="italic">Baronia Anglica,</hi> p. 130). “There can
                    be no doubt,” Dr Stubbs says, “that this practice was one of the influences
                    which blended the minor tenants-in-chief with the general body of the free
                    holders; possibly it led also to the development of the military spirit which in
                    the following century [he is speaking of the reign of Edward I.] sustained the
                    extravagant designs of Edward III., and was glorified under the name of

                    the king’s writ subjected the offender, if he was capable of bearing arms, and
                    between the ages of twenty-one and sixty, to a fine. And thus in the progress of
                    events knight-service tended to become more and more divorced from its primary
                    uses and intentions, and to survive merely as a series of oppressive exactions
                    and idle ceremonies. During the centuries which followed the enactment of the
                    statute of “Quia Emptores,” the king gradually added the character of immediate
                    lord over nearly all the lands held in chivalry within the realm to the
                    character of lord paramount which had been his from the beginning. When
                    feudalism was as firmly established and as fully developed as it ever was in
                    England, a single officer in each county, called the king’s escheator, who was
                    appointed annually by the lord treasurer, was considered sufficient to watch
                    over the royal “droits of seignory <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> and to
                    prevent the evasion of them. But when nothing save the name and the hardships of
                    feudalism remained, the Court of Wards and Liveries was erected, and the
                    scandals and abuses to which its jurisdiction gave rise under the Tudors and the
                    first two Stuarts speedily assumed the proportions of an almost intolerable
                    grievance. Towards the end of the reign of James I. the general discontent
                    resulted in an attempt to abolish tenures in chivalry altogether, compensation
                    being proposed to the king and the mesne lords in the form of a fixed rent in
                    the place of their feudal dues, “which motion, though it proceeded not to
                    effect,” says Coke, “yet we thought it well to remember, hoping that so good a
                    motion . . . will some time or other . . . take effect and be established.”<note

                    by the Long Parliament, which by resolution of both Houses in 1645 put an end to
                    the Court of Wards and Liveries, and converted all tenures in chivalry into free
                    and common soccage. But it was not until eleven years later that, by an Act of
                    the Commonwealth in 1656, legislative sanction was conferred on these
                    ordinances. Their substance, however, had been embodied in one of the articles
                    of the treaty of Newport between Charles I. and the Parliamentarians, and the
                    king was then to have been indemnified by means of a revenue charged on the
                    lands relieved, amounting to a hundred thousand pounds a year. At the
                    Restoration a tax on lands held in chivalry was proposed in place of
                    knight-service, but an alternative scheme for an excise on beer and some other
                    liquors received the preference. It was not, however, until the abolition of
                    purveyance as well as knight-service had been included in the measure, since
                    known as the 12th Charles II. cap. 24, by way of concession to the claims of the
                    yeomanry and peasantry, that it was permitted to pass, and then only amid
                    vigorous protests from many quarters.</p>
                <p>Regarded as a method of military organization, the feudal system of tenures was
                    always far better adapted to the purposes of defensive than of offensive
                    warfare. Against invasion it furnished a permanent provision both in men-at-arms
                    and strongholds; nor was it unsuited for the campaigns of neighbouring counts
                    and barons which lasted for only a few weeks, and extended over only a few
                    leagues. But when kings and kingdoms were in conflict, and distant and prolonged
                    expeditions became necessary, it was speedily discovered that the unassisted
                    resources of feudalism were altogether inadequate. The barons and knights who
                    fought on horseback were in their own country attended by the yeomen and
                    townsmen who fought on foot. But in foreign wars the feudal cavalry alone were
                    available, and the infantry were nearly all and always mercenary troops. Again,
                    although the period for which the holders of fiefs were bound to military
                    service had originally been uncertain and unlimited, it gradually became an
                    established rule, to which the exceptions were everywhere trifling and rare,
                    that it should be restricted in various countries to from forty to sixty days in
                    each year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Du Cange, <hi

                    like an extended scale would have been impossible if the terms of the feudal
                    engagement had been strictly observed. In these circumstances it became
                    customary to retain the feudal tenants under arms as stipendiaries after their
                    ordinary and legitimate obligations had been fulfilled. But this arrangement was
                    exceedingly inconvenient in practice to sovereigns and their feudatories alike.
                    It implied to the former the expenditure of large sums of money, then very
                    difficult to raise, on what was frequently an inferior commodity, and to the
                    latter the neglect of their estates and of all their peaceful duties and
                    diversions. It became therefore the manifest interest of both parties that
                    personal services should be commuted into pecuniary payments. In the early times
                    of feudalism the refusal or omission to discharge the military obligations
                    attached to a fief entailed immediate forfeiture. But the usage of fining the
                    delinquents in such cases, at first arbitrarily and afterwards in a fixed
                    amount, grew up all over Europe, while in England from the reign of Henry II. to
                    the reign of Edward II. escuage or scutage was regularly levied, originally as
                    an amerciament and subsequently as an ordinary war-tax on tenants by
                    knight-service.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Henry
                    II. adopted the knight’s fee instead of the hide as the basis of rating (in
                    levying taxes) for the knights and barons, and under him escuage or scutage
                    became “an honourable commutation for personal service.” Littleton defines
                    knight-service as tenure by “homage, fealty, and escuage”; and, although scutage
                    may have been the name for the personal service represented by the tax, it had
                    of course long been replaced by the tax itself when he wrote in the reign of

                    for war were placed at the free disposal of sovereigns, and, although the
                    feudatories and their retainers still formed the most considerable portion of
                    their armies, the conditions under which they served were altogether changed.
                    Their military service was now the result of special agreement, by which they
                    undertook in consideration of certain payments to themselves and their
                    followers, with whom they had entered into similar arrangements, to attend in a
                    particular war or campaign with a retinue of stipulated composition and
                    strength. In the reign of Edward I., whose warlike enterprises after he was king
                    were confined within the four seas, this alteration does not seem to have
                    proceeded very far, and Scotland and Wales were subjugated by what was in the

                    and Henry VI. during the century of intermittent warfare between England and
                    France were recruited and sustained entirely on the principle of contract. On
                    the Continent the systematic employment of mercenaries was both an early and a
                    common practice. But the transition from the feudal régime to the régime of
                    standing armies was everywhere sudden and abrupt as compared with the same
                    process among ourselves.</p>
                <p>Besides consideration for the mutual convenience of sovereigns and their
                    feudatories, there were other causes which materially contributed towards
                    bringing about the changes in the military system of Europe which were finally
                    accomplished in the 13th and 14th centuries. During the crusades vast armies
                    were set on foot in which feudal rights and obligations had no place, and it was
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n127/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0127-0116"/> seen that the volunteers who flocked to the
                    standards of the various commanders were not less but even more efficient in the
                    field than the vassals they had hitherto been accustomed to lead. It was thus
                    established that pay, the love of enterprise, and the prospect of plunder,—if we
                    leave zeal for the sacred cause which they had espoused for the moment out of
                    sight,—were quite as useful for the purpose of enlisting troops and keeping them
                    together as the tenure of land and the solemnities of homage and fealty.
                    Moreover, the crusaders who survived the difficulties and dangers of an
                    expedition to Palestine were seasoned and experienced although frequently
                    impoverished and landless soldiers, ready to hire themselves to the highest
                    bidder, and well worth the wages they received. Again, it was owing to the
                    crusades that the church took the profession of arms under her peculiar
                    protection, and thenceforward the ceremonies of initiation into it assumed a
                    religious as well as a martial character. Nor was this by any means a merely
                    gratuitous patronage of bloodshed on her part. In the ages of faith and
                    chivalry, magic and sorcery were the terrors alike of the pious and the brave,
                    and the blessings of the priest on the warrior, his weapons, and his armour were
                    always regarded as the surest safeguards against the influence of hostile spells
                    and enchantments. To distinguished soldiers of the cross the honours and
                    benefits of knighthood could hardly be refused on the ground that they did not
                    possess a sufficient property qualification,—of wlιich perhaps they had in fact
                    denuded themselves in order to their own and their retinue’s equipment for the
                    Holy War. And thus the conception of knighthood as of something wholly distinct
                    from and independent of feudalism both as a social condition and a personal
                    dignity arose and rapidly gained ground. It was then that the analogy was first
                    detected which was afterwards more fully developed between the order of
                    knighthood and the order of priesthood, and that an actual union of monachism
                    and chivalry was effected by the establishment of the religious orders of which
                    the Knights Templars and the Knights Hospitallers were the most eminent
                    examples. As comprehensive in their polity as the Benedictines or Franciscans,
                    they gathered their members from, and soon scattered their possessions over,
                    every country in Europe. And in their indifference to the distinctions of race
                    and nationality they merely accommodated themselves to the spirit which had
                    become characteristic of chivalry itself, already recognized, like the church,
                    as a universal institution which comprised and knit together the whole warrior
                    caste of Christendom into one great fraternity irrespective alike of feudal
                    subordination and territorial boundaries. Somewhat later the adoption of
                    hereditary surnames and armorial bearings marked the existence of a large and
                    noble class who either from the subdivision of fiefs or from, the effects of the
                    custom of primogeniture were very insufficiently provided for. To them only two
                    callings were generally open, that of the churchman and that of the soldier, and
                    the latter as a rule offered greater attractions than the former in an era of
                    much licence and little learning. Hence the favourite expedient for men of
                    birth, although not of fortune, was to attach themselves to some prince or
                    magnate in whose military service they were sure of an adequate maintenance, and
                    might hope for even a rich reward in the shape of booty or of ransom.<note

                    that we must look for at all events the rudimentary beginnings of the military
                    as well as the religious orders of chivalry. Of the existence of any regularly
                    constituted companionships of the first kind there is no trustworthy evidence
                    until between two and three centuries after fraternities of the second kind had
                    been organized. Soon after the greater crusading societies had been formed
                    similar orders, such as those of St James of Compostella, Calatrava, and
                    Alcantara, were established to fight the Moors in Spain instead of the Saracens
                    in the Holy Land. But the members of these orders were not less monks than
                    knights, their statutes embodied the rules of the cloister, and they were bound
                    by the ecclesiastical vows of celibacy, poverty, and obedience. From a very
                    early stage in the development of chivalry, however, we meet with the singular
                    institution of brotherhood in arms; and from it the ultimate origin if not of
                    the religious fraternities at any rate of the military companionships is usually
                    derived.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Du Cange, <hi

                    relation was created between two or more knights by voluntary agreement which
                    was regarded as of far more intimacy and stringency than any which the mere
                    accident of consanguinity implied. Brothers in arms were supposed to be partners
                    in all things save the affections of their “lady-loves.” They shared in every
                    danger and every success, and each was expected to vindicate the honour of
                    another as promptly and zealously as his own. Their engagements usually lasted
                    through life, but sometimes only for a specified period or during the
                    continuance of specified circumstances, and they were always ratified by oath,
                    occasionally reduced to writing in the shape of a solemn bond and often
                    sanctified by their reception of the eucharist together. Romance and tradition
                    speak of strange rites—the mingling and even the drinking of blood—as having in
                    remote and rude ages marked the inception of these martial and fraternal
                    associations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Du Cange,

                    Lac,</hi> among other romances.</p></note> But in later and less barbarous times
                    they were generally evidenced and celebrated by a formal and reciprocal exchange
                    of weapons and armour. In warfare it was customary for knights who were thus
                    allied to appear similarly accoutred and bearing the same badges or cognizances,
                    to the end that their enemies might not know with which of them they were in
                    conflict, and that their friends might be unable to accord more applause to one
                    than to another for his prowess in the field. It seems likely enough therefore
                    that, at or soon after the period when the crusades had initiated the
                    transformation of feudalism into chivalry as a military system, bodies banded
                    together by engagements of fidelity, although free from monastic obligations,
                    wearing a uniform or livery, and naming themselves after some special symbol or
                    some patron saint of their adoption, were neither unknown nor even uncommon. And
                    such bodies raised by or placed under the command of a sovereign or grand
                    master, regulated by statutes, and enriched by ecclesiastical endowments would
                    have been precisely what in after times such orders as the Garter in England,
                    the Golden Fleece in Burgundy, the Annunciation in Savoy, and the St Michael and
                    Holy Ghost in France actually were.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    was very differently esteemed from the knight who succeeded to them as an
                    incident of his feudal tenure. In rank and the external ensigns of rank under
                    the sumptuary regulations of the age they were equal. But it was the first and
                    not the second who was welcomed in court and camp, who was invited to the “round
                    tables” which the Arthurian romances brought into fashion among the potentates
                    of mediaeval Europe, and more particularly Edward III. and Philip VI. And thus
                    it became the ambition of every aspirant to knighthood to gain it by his
                    exploits rather than to claim it merely as his right by virtue of his position
                    and estate. But there was one qualification for knighthood <pb break="no"

                    and which was rigorously exacted abroad. Nobody could be legitimately created a
                    knight who was not a gentleman of “name and arms,” that is, who was not
                    descended on both sides at the least from grandparents who were entitled to
                    armorial bearings. And this condition is embodied in the statutes of every order
                    of knighthood, religious or military, which can trace its origin to a period
                    when chivalry was a social institution.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    anybody who attempted to take part in a tournament without the qualification of

                    commonly referred to as “sixteen quarters,” beginning with “three descents” in
                    England, “four lines” in France, “four quarters” in the empire, and “four
                    branches” in Scotland. The books where this subject may be pursued are far too
                    numerous to mention. Guillim (<hi rend="italic">Display of Heraldry,</hi> p. 66)
                    and Nisbet <hi rend="italic">{System of Heraldry,</hi> vol. ii. p. 147) speak of
                    it as concerning England and Scotland. See also Ashmole’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Order of the Garter,</hi> p. 284. But in England knighthood has always been
                    conferred to a great extent independently of these considerations. At almost
                    every period there have been men of obscure and illegitimate birth who have been
                    knighted. Ashmole cites Sandars’s <hi rend="italic">Flandria</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Illustrata</hi> to the effect that “the degree of knighthood is of
                    so great splendour and fame that it bestows gentility not only upon a man meanly
                    born but also upon his descendants, and very much increaseth the honour of those
                    who are well descended.” And he adds that “it is a maxim laid down by a learned
                    civilian (Tiraquel, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Nobilitate')</hi>
                    that knighthood ennobles, insomuch that whosoever is a knight it necessarily
                    follows that he is also a gentleman <hi rend="italic">{Militia</hi><hi

                    understood to have conferred whatsoever is requisite for the completing of that
                    which he bestows.” By the common law, if a villain were made a knight he was
                    thereby enfranchised and accounted a gentleman, and if a person under age and in
                    wardship were knighted both his minority and wardship terminated.— <hi

                    constable and the marshal or marshals held the chief commands, their authority
                    being partly joint and partly several. Attendant on them were the heralds, who
                    were the officers of their military court, wherein offences committed in the
                    camp and field were tried and adjudged, and among whose duties it was to carry
                    orders and messages, to deliver challenges and call truces, and to identify and
                    number the wounded and the slain. The main divisions of the army were
                    distributed under the royal and other principal standards, smaller divisions
                    under the banners of some of the greater nobility or of knights banneret, and
                    smaller divisions still under the pennons of knights or, as in distinction from
                    knights banneret they came to be called, knights bachelors. All knights whether
                    bachelors or bannerets were escorted by their squires. But the banner of the
                    banneret always implied a more or less extensive command, while every knight was
                    entitled to bear a pennon and every squire a pencel. All three flags were of
                    such a size as to be conveniently attached to and carried on a lance, and were
                    emblazoned with the arms or some portion of the bearings of their owners. But
                    while the banner was square the pennon, which resembled it in other respects,
                    was either pointed or forked at its extremity, and the pencel, which was
                    considerably less than the others, always terminated in a single tail or
                    streamer.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Grose’s <hi

                    already indicated, it became the custom from the time of the crusades to seek
                    out and as far as possible to establish analogies between the institutions of
                    chivalry and the church. In the military grades of the squire, the knight, and
                    the banneret, therefore, were of course seen the representatives of the clerical
                    grades of the deacon, the priest, and the bishop.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The same analogy may be drawn between
                    bachelors, masters, and doctors; barristers, serjeants, and judges; or

                    ceremonies of ordination were unquestionably imitated in the ceremonies of
                    knighting, there is no reason for supposing that the resemblance, such as it
                    was, which obtained between the chivalrous and the ecclesiastical series of
                    degrees was otherwise than accidental. Moreover, it failed in at least two
                    material respects, namely, that squirehood although the usual was not the
                    necessary preliminary to knighthood, and that in all the attributes of
                    knighthood as knighthood a knight bachelor was as fully and completely a knight
                    as a knight banneret. If indeed we look at the scale of chivalric subordination
                    from another point of view, it seems to be more properly divisible into four
                    than into three stages, of which two may be called provisional and two final.
                    The bachelor and the banneret were both equally knights, only the one was of
                    greater distinction and authority than the other. In like manner the squire and
                    the page were both in training for knighthood, but the first had advanced
                    further in the process than the second. It is true that the squire was a
                    combatant while the page was not, and that many squires voluntarily served as
                    squires all their lives owing to the insufficiency of their fortunes to support
                    the costs and charges of knighthood. But in the ordinary course of a chivalrous
                    education the successive conditions of page and squire were passed through in
                    boyhood and youth, and the condition of knighthood was reached in early manhood.
                    Every feudal court and castle was in fact a school of chivalry in which the sons
                    of the sovereign and his vassals, or of the feudatory and his vassals, together
                    commonly with those of some of their allies or friends, were reared in its
                    principles and habituated to its customs and observances. And, although princes
                    and great personages were rarely actually pages or squires, the moral and
                    physical discipline through which they passed was not in any important
                    particular different from that to which less exalted candidates for knighthood
                    were subjected.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sainte

                    and practices of hunting and hawking. When he was between fifteen and sixteen he
                    became a squire. But no sudden or great alteration was made in his mode of life.
                    He continued to wait at dinner with the pages, although in a manner more
                    dignified according to the notions of the age. He not only served but carved and
                    helped the dishes, proffered the first or principal cup of wine to his master
                    and his guests, and carried to them the basin, ewer, or napkin when they washed
                    their hands before and after meat. He assisted in clearing the hall for dancing
                    or minstrelsy, and laid the tables for chess or draughts, and he also shared in
                    the pastimes for which he had made preparation. He brought his master the “vin
                    de coucher” at night, and made his early refection ready for him in the morning.
                    But his military exercises and athletic sports occupied an always increasing
                    portion of the day. He accustomed himself to ride the “great horse,” to tilt at
                    the quintain, to wield the sword and battle-axe, to swim and climb, to run and
                    leap, and to bear the weight and overcome the embarrassments of armour. He
                    inured himself to the vicissitudes of heat and cold, and voluntarily suffered
                    the pains or inconveniences of hunger and thirst, fatigue, and sleeplessness. It
                    was then too that he chose his “lady-love,” whom he was expected to regard with
                    an adoration at once earnest, respectful, and the more meritorious if concealed.
                    And when it was considered that he had made sufficient advancement in his
                    military accomplishments, he took his sword to the priest, who laid it on the
                    altar, blessed it, and returned it to him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    relegating most of his domestic duties to his younger companions, or he entered
                    the service of some valiant and adventurous lord or knight of his own selection.
                    He now became a “squire of the body,” and truly an “armiger” or “scutifer,” for
                    he bore the shield and armour of his leader to the field, and, what was a task
                    of no small difficulty and hazard, cased and secured him in his panoply of war
                    before assisting him to mount his courser or charger. It was his function also
                    to display and guard in battle the banner of the baron or banneret or the pennon
                    of the knight he served, to raise him from the ground if he were unhorsed, to
                    supply him with another or his own horse if his was disabled or killed, to
                    receive and keep any prisoners he might take, to fight by his side if he was
                    unequally matched, to rescue him if captured, to bear him to a place of safety
                    if wounded, and to bury him honourably when dead. And after he had worthily and
                    bravely borne himself for six or seven years as a squire, the time came when it
                    was fitting that he should be made a knight.</p>
                <p>Two modes of conferring knighthood appear to have prevailed from a very early
                    period in all countries where chivalry was known. In both of them the essential
                    portion seems to have been the accolade. But while in the one the accolade
                    constituted the whole or nearly the whole of the ceremony, in the other it was
                    surrounded with many additional observances. As soon as we have any historical
                    evidence of their separate and distinct existence, we discover them as severally
                    appropriated, the first to time of war and the second to time of peace.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There are several obscure
                    points as to the relation of the longer and shorter ceremonies, as well as the
                    origin and original relation of their several parts. There is nothing to show
                    whence came “dubbing” or the “accolade.” It seems certain that the word “dub”
                    means to strike, and the usage is as old as the knighting of Henry by William
                    the Conqueror <hi rend="italic">{supra,</hi> pp. 111, 112). So, too, in the
                    empire a dubbed knight is “ritter geschlagen.” The “accolade” may etymologically
                    refer to the embrace, accompanied by a blow with the hand, characteristic of the
                    longer form of knighting. The derivation of “adouber,” corresponding to “dub,”
                    from “adoptare,” which is given by Du Cange, and would connect the ceremony with
                    “adoptio per arma,” is certainly inaccurate. The investiture with arms, which
                    formed a part of the longer form of knighting, and which we have seen to rest on
                    very ancient usage, may originally have had a distinct meaning. We have observed
                    that Lanfranc invested Henry I. with amis, while William “dubbed him to rider.”
                    If there was a difference in the meaning of the two ceremonies, the difficulty
                    as to the knighting of Earl Harold <hi rend="italic">{supra,</hi> p. 112) is at
                    least partly removed.</p></note></p>
                <p>In one of the oldest records of chivalry quoted by Selden, under the heading of
                    “Comment on doit faire et creer ung Chivalier,” it is stated that, “quant ung
                    Escuier que a longement voyage et este en plusiers faicts d’armes et que a de
                    quoy entretenir son estate et qu’il est de grant maison et rich et qu’il se

                    vaillant chivalier. Alors doit venir devant luy et demander ‘chivalier au nom de
                    Dieu et de Sainct George donnez moy le ordre’ et le dit chivalier ou chiefe de
                    guerre doit tirer l’espee nue vers le diet demaundeur et doit dire en frappant
                    trois fois sur iceuly: ‘ Je te fais chivalier au nom de Dieu et de mon seigneur
                    Sainct George, pour la foy et justice loyalment garder et Γeglise, femes,
                    vesves, et orphelins defender.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    as well as the words of the exhortation. Sometimes the first were “avancez
                    chevalier au nom de Dieu,” or “au nom de Dieu, Saint Michel, et Saint George je
                    te fais chevalier and the second “soyez preux, hardi, et loyal,” “be a good
                    knight in the name of God”; or “soyez bon chevalier,” or “be a good knight,”
                    merely. In this form a number of knights were made before and after almost every
                    battle between the 11th and the 16th centuries, and its advantages on the score
                    of both convenience and economy gradually led to its general adoption both in
                    time of peace and time of war. On extraordinary occasions indeed the more
                    elaborate ritual continued to be observed. But recourse was had to it so rarely
                    that among us about the beginning of the 15th century it came to be exclusively
                    appropriated to a special kind of knighthood. When Segar, garter king of arms,
                    wrote in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, this had been accomplished with such
                    completeness that he does not even mention that there were two ways of creating
                    knights bachelors. “He that is to be made a knight,” he says, “is striken by the
                    prince with a sword drawn upon his back or shoulder, the prince saying, ‘ Soys
                    Chevalier,’ and in times past was added ‘Saint George.’ And when the knight
                    rises the prince sayeth ‘Avencez.’ This is the manner of dubbing knights at this
                    present, and that term ‘dubbing’ was the old term in this point, not ‘creating.’
                    This sort of knights are by the heralds called knights bachelors.”<note

                    ordinarily the sword of state, on either of his shoulders, and says, “Rise,”
                    calling him by his Christian name with the addition of “Sir” before it.<note

                <p>Very different were the solemnities which attended the creation of a knight when
                    the complete procedure was observed. “The ceremonies and circumstances at the
                    giving this dignity,” says Selden, “in the elder time were of two kinds
                    especially, which we may call courtly and sacred. The courtly were the feasts
                    held at the creation, giving of robes, arms, spurs, and the like, whence in the
                    stories of other nations so in those of ours ‘ armis militaribus donare ’ or ‘
                    cingulo militari,’ and such more phrases are the same with ‘ militem facere ’ or
                    to make a knight. The sacred were the holy devotions and <pb break="no"

                    receiving of the dignity, whence also ‘ consecrare militem ’ was to make a
                    knight. Those of the first kind are various in the memories that preserve them,
                    and yet they were rarely or never without the girding with a sword until in the
                    later ages wherein only the stroke on the neck or shoulder according to the use
                    at this day hath most commonly supplied it.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    639.</p></note> Of these “ceremonies and circumstances” Selden gives several
                    examples, especially those of the knighting of Geoffrey of Anjou by Henry I., of
                    Alexander III. of Scotland by Henry III. of England, and of Edward Prince of
                    Wales (afterwards Edward II.) by his father Edward I. But the leading authority
                    on the subject is an ancient tract written in French, which will be found at
                    length either in the original or translated by Segar, Dugdale, Byshe, and
                    Nicolas, among other English writers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    given as “the order and manner of creating Knights of the Bath in time of peace
                    according to the custom of England,” and consequently dates from a period when
                    the full ceremony of creating knights bachelors generally had gone out of
                    fashion. But as Ashmole, speaking of Knights of the Bath, says, “if the
                    ceremonies and circumstances of their creation be well considered, it will
                    appear that this king [Henry IV.] did not institute but rather restore the
                    ancient manner of making knights, and consequently that the Knights of the Bath
                    are in truth no other than knights bachelors, that is to say, such as are
                    created with those ceremonies wherewith knights bachelors were formerly created”
                    (Ashmole, <hi rend="italic">Order of the Garter,</hi> p. 15). It is singular
                    that Dugdale in his translation of this ancient formulary has accidentally
                    omitted the actual dubbing or accolade. See also Selden, <hi rend="italic"

                    explains his reasons for transcribing it, “tant à cause du detail que de la

                    pourtant alors fort serieusement,” while he adds that these ceremonies were
                    essentially identical in England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.</p>
                <p>The process of inauguration was commenced in the evening by the placing of the
                    candidate under the care of two “esquires of honour grave and well seen in
                    courtship and nurture and also in the feats of chivalry,” who were to be
                    “governors in all things relating to him.” Under their direction, to begin with,
                    a barber shaved him and cut his hair. He was then conducted by them to lμs
                    appointed chamber, where a bath was prepared hung within and without with linen
                    and covered with rich cloths, into which after they had undressed him he
                    entered. While he was in the bath two “ancient and grave knights” attended him
                    “to inform, instruct, and counsel him touching the order and feats of chivalry,”
                    and when they had fulfilled their mission they poured some of the water of the
                    bath over his shoulders, signing the left shoulder with the cross, and

                    the ancient and grave knights “in nomine patris,” &amp;c. In both, however, the
                    cross is to be kissed by the officiating knight after he had signed it with the
                    water.</p></note> He was then taken from the bath and put into a plain bed
                    without hangings, in which he remained until his body was dry, when the two
                    esquires put on him a white shirt and over that ‘ ‘ a robe of russet with long
                    sleeves having a hood thereto like unto that of an hermit.” Then the “two
                    ancient and grave knights” returned and led him to the chapel, the esquires
                    going before them “sporting and dancing” with “the minstrels making melody.” And
                    when they had been served with wines and spices they went away leaving only the
                    candidate, the esquires, “the priest, the chandler, and the watch” who kept the
                    vigil of arms until sunrise, the candidate passing the night ‘ ‘ bestowing
                    himself in orisons and prayers.” At daybreak he confessed to the priest, heard
                    matins, and communicated in the mass, offering a taper and a piece of money
                    stuck in it as near the lighted end as possible, the first “to the honour of
                    God” and the second “to the honour of the person that makes him a knight.”
                    Afterwards he was taken back to his chamber, and remained in bed until the
                    knights, esquires, and minstrels went to him and aroused him. The knights then
                    dressed him in distinctive garments, and they then mounted their horses and rode
                    to the hall where the candidate was to receive knighthood; his future squire was
                    to ride before him bareheaded bearing his sword by the point in its scabbard
                    with his spurs hanging from its hilt. And when everything was prepared the
                    prince or subject who was to knight him came into the hall, and, the candidate’s
                    sword and spurs having been presented to him, he delivered the right spur to the
                    “most noble and gentle” knight present, and directed him to fasten it on the
                    candidate’s right heel, which he kneeling on one knee and putting the
                    candidate’s right foot on his knee accordingly did, signing the candidate’s knee
                    with the cross, and in like manner by another “noble and gentle” knight the left
                    spur was fastened to his left heel. And then he who was to create the knight
                    took the sword and girded him with it, and then embracing him he lifted his
                    right hand and smote him on the neck or shoulder, saying, “Be thou a good
                    knight,” and kissed him. When this was done they all went to the chapel with
                    much music, and the new knight laying his right hand on the altar promised to
                    support and defend the church, and ungirding his sword offered it on the altar.
                    And as he came out from the chapel the master cook awaited him at the door and
                    claimed his spurs as his fee, and said, “If you do anything contrary to the
                    order of chivalry (which God forbid), I shall hack the spurs from your
                    heels.”</p>
                <p>As may be gathered from Selden, Favyn, La Colombiers, Menestrier, and Sainte
                    Balaye, there were several differences of detail in the ceremony at different
                    times and in different places. But in the main it was everywhere the same both
                    in its military and its ecclesiastical elements. In the <hi rend="italic"

                    Reformation forms for the blessing or consecration of new knights are included,
                    and of these the first and the last are quoted by Selden.<note anchored="true"

                    of investiture with arms in the empire.</p></note> But the full solemnities for
                    conferring knighthood seem to have been so largely and so early superseded by
                    the practice of dubbing or giving the accolade alone that in England it became
                    at last restricted to such knights as were made at coronations and some other
                    occasions of state. And to them the particular name of knights of the bath was
                    assigned, while knights made in the ordinary way were called in distinction from
                    them knights of the sword, as they were also called knights bachelors in
                    distinction from knights banneret.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    first creation of Knights of the Bath under that designation was at the
                    coronation of Henry IV.; and before the Order of the Bath as a companionship or
                    capitular body was instituted the last creation of them was at the coronation of
                    Charles II. But all knights were also knights of the spur or “equites aurati,”
                    because their spurs were golden or gilt,—the spurs of squires being of silver or
                    white metal,—and these became their peculiar badge in popular estimation and
                    proverbial speech. In the form of their solemn inauguration too, as we have
                    noticed, the spurs together with the sword were always employed as the leading
                    and most characteristic ensigns of knighthood.<note anchored="true"

                <p>With regard to knights banneret various opinions have been entertained as to both
                    the nature of their dignity and the qualifications they were required to possess
                    for receiving it at different periods and in different countries. On the
                    Continent the distinction which is commonly but incorrectly made by us between
                    the nobility and the gentry has never arisen, and it was unknown here while
                    chivalry existed and heraldry was understood. Here, as elsewhere in the old
                    time, a nobleman and a gentleman meant the <pb break="no"

                    conditions of descent was entitled to armorial bearings. Hence Du Cange divides
                    the mediaeval nobility of France and Spain into three classes :—first, barons or
                    ricos hombres; secondly, chevaliers or caballeros; and thirdly, écuyers or
                    infanzons; and to the first, who with their several special titles constituted
                    the greater nobility of either country, he limits the designation of banneret
                    and the right of leading their followers to war under a banner, otherwise a
                    “drapeau quarré” or square flag.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    “bannerherr” or “dominus vexillifer” of the empire. And he also shows especially
                    from the parliament rolls that the term banneret has been occasionally employed
                    in England as equivalent to baron, where, for example, in the reign of Richard
                    II. among “divers other earls and barons there mentioned by name <hi

                    lords of parliament were always created bannerets as well as barons at their
                    investiture, “part of the ceremony consisting in the display of a banner, and
                    such ‘ barones majores ’ were thereby entitled to the privilege of having one
                    borne by a retainer before them to the field of a quadrilateral form.”<note

                    of parliament and bannerets were also called bannerents, banrents, or baronets,
                    and in England banneret was often corrupted to baronet. “Even in a patent passed
                    to Sir Ralph Fane, knight under Edward VI., he is called <hi rend="superscript">
                    t</hi> baronettus ’ for ‘ bannerettus. ’”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    657.</p></note> In this manner it is not improbable that the title of baronet
                    may have been suggested to the advisers of James I. when the Order of Baronets
                    was originally created by him, fcr it was a question whether the recipients of
                    the new dignity should be designated by that or some other name.<note

                    conferinge of the title of vidom,” wherein it is said that “the title of vidom
                    (vicedominus) was an ancient title used in this kingdom of England both before

                    there is no doubt that as previously used it was merely a corrupt synonym for
                    banneret, and not the name of any separate dignity. On the Continent, however,
                    there are several recorded examples of bannerets who had an hereditary claim to
                    that honour and its attendant privileges on the ground of the nature of their
                    feudal tenure.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Selden,

                    probable that bannerets were in every country merely the more important class of
                    feudatories, the “ricos hombres” in contrast to the knights bachelors, who in
                    France in the time of St Louis were known as “pauvres hommes.” In England all
                    the barons or greater nobility were entitled to bear banners, and therefore Du
                    Cange’s observations would apply to them as well as to the barons or greater
                    nobility of France and Spain. But it is clear that from a comparatively early
                    period bannerets whose claims were founded on personal distinction rather than
                    on feudal tenure gradually came to the front, and much the same process of
                    substitution appears to have gone on in their case as that which we have marked
                    in the case of simple knights. According to the <hi rend="italic">Sallade</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Division</hi><hi rend="italic">du</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Honde,</hi> as cited by Selden, bannerets were clearly in the
                    beginning feudal tenants of a certain magnitude and importance and nothing more,
                    and different forms for their creation are given in time of peace and in time of
                    war.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Selden, <hi

                    the warlike form alone is given, and it is quoted by both Selden and Du Cange.
                    From the latter a more modern version of it is given by Daniel as the only one
                    generally in force. “Quand un bachelier,” says the ceremonial in question, “a
                    grandement servi et suivi la guerre et que il a terre assez et qu’il puisse
                    avoir gentilshommes ses hommes et pour accompagner sa bannière il peut
                    licitement lever bannière et non autrement; car nul homme ne doit lever bannière
                    en bataille s’il n’a du moins cinquante hommes d’armes, tous ses hommes, et les
                    archiers et les arbelestriers qui y appartiennent, et s’il les a, il doit à la

                    venir au connetable ou aux maréchaux ou à celui qui sera lieutenant de l’ost
                    pour le prince et requirir qu’il porte bannière, et s’il lui octroyent doit
                    sommer les hérauts pour témoignage et doivent couper la queue du pennon.”<note

                    earliest contemporary mention of knights banneret is in France, Daniel says, in
                    the reign of Philip Augustus, and in England, Selden says, in the reign of
                    Edward I. But in neither case is reference made to them in such a manner as to
                    suggest that the dignity was then regarded as new or even uncommon, and it seems
                    pretty certain that its existence on one side could not have long preceded its
                    existence on the other side of the Channel. Sir Alan Plokenet, Sir Ralph
                    Daubeney, and Sir Philip Daubeuey are entered as bannerets on the roll of the
                    garrison of Caermarthen castle in 1282, and the roll of Carlaverock records the
                    names and arms of eighty-five bannerets who accompanied Edward I. in his
                    expedition into Scotland in 1300. Selden quotes some and refers to many of the
                    wardrobe accounts of Edward II. in which contracts with and payments to
                    bannerets are mentioned, observing that “under these bannerets divers knights
                    bachelors and esquires usually served, and according to the number of them the
                    bannerets received wages.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    exact contingent was which they were expected to supply to the royal host is
                    doubtful. In the authorities collected by Selden, Du Cange, and Daniel it varies
                    from teu and twenty-five to fifty men-at-arms with their attendants. Grose seems
                    to prefer the medium estimate of a hundred mounted combatants in all, that
                    number forming a square of ten in each face, and being the lowest equivalent of
                    the more modern squadron.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    But, however this may be, in the reign of Edward III. and afterwards bannerets
                    appear as the commanders of a military force raised by themselves and marshalled
                    under their banners— although paid through them by the sovereign—who were
                    moreover always persons of property and soldiers of distinction. At the same
                    time their status and their relations both to the crown and their followers were
                    the consequences of voluntary contract not of feudal tenure. It is from the
                    reigns of Edward III. and Richard II. also that the two best descriptions we
                    possess of the actual creation of a banueret have been transmitted to us. During
                    Edward the Black Prince’s expedition of 1367 into Spain, Sir John Chandos, one
                    of the founder Knights of the Garter, was made a banneret on the morning of the
                    day on which the battle of Navarrete was fought. When the troops were drawn up
                    in order before the action commenced, “Sir John Chandos,” says Froissart,
                    “advancedin front of the battalions with his banner uncased in his hand. He
                    presented it to the prince, saying, ‘ My lord, here is my banner; I present it
                    to you that I may display it in whatever manner shall be most agreeable to you;
                    for, thanks to God, I have <pb break="no"

                    maintain the rank which it ought to hold.’ The prince, Don Pedro, being present
                    took the banner in his hands, which was blazoned with a sharp stake gules on a
                    field argent; after having cut off the tail to make it square, he displayed it,
                    and returning it to him by the handle said, ‘ Sir John, I return you your
                    banner; God give you strength and honour to preserve it.’ Upon this Sir John
                    left the prince, went back to his men with the banner in his hand, and said to
                    them, ‘ Gentlemen, behold my banner and yours; you will therefore guard it as it
                    becomes you.’ His companions taking the banner replied with much cheerfulness
                    that ‘ if it pleased God and St George they would defend it well and act
                    worthily of it to the utmost of their abilities.’”<note anchored="true"

                    At a later period some distinction appears to have been made between bannerets
                    who were created under the royal standard, the king himself being present with
                    his army in open war, and bannerets who were created only by the king’s
                    lieutenants, as Sir John Chandos and Sir Thomas Trivet were created. But no such
                    distinction seems to have existed in the reigns of Edward III. and Richard II.;
                    and, although it was doubtless of more ancient origin, the earliest contemporary
                    evidence of its existence is of the reign of James L, when bannerets whether of
                    one or two classes had practically disappeared. Sir Thomas Smith, writing
                    towards the end of the 16th century, says, after noticing the conditions to be
                    observed in the creation of bannerets, “but this order is almost grown out of
                    use in England;”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    during the controversy which arose between the new order of baronets and the

                    Sir Ralph Fane, Sir Francis Bryan, and Sir Ralph Sadler were created bannerets
                    by the Lord Protector Somerset after the b∖ttle of Pinkie in 1547, and the
                    better opinion is that this was the last occasion on which the dignity was
                    conferred. It has been stated indeed that Charles I. created Sir John Smith a
                    banneret after the battle of Edgehill in 1642 for having rescued the royal
                    standard from the enemy. But of this there is no sufficient proof. It was also
                    supposed that George III. had created several naval officers bannerets towards
                    the end of the last century, because he knighted them on board ship under the
                    royal standard displayed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    were not distinguished from knights bachelors merely because they were created
                    under the standard or banner of the sovereign, but further because their own
                    pennons were converted into or exchanged for banners.</p>
                <p>On the Continent the degree of knight bachelor disap peared with the military
                    system which had given rise to it. It is now therefore peculiar to the United
                    Kingdom, where, although very frequently conferred by letters patent, it is yet
                    the only dignity which is still even occasionally created— as every dignity was
                    formerly created—by means of a ceremony in which the sovereign and the subject
                    personally take part. Everywhere else dubbing or the accolade seems to have
                    become obsolete, and no other species of knighthood, if knighthood it can be
                    called, is known except that which is dependent on admission to some particular
                    order. It is a common error to suppose that baronets are hereditary knights.
                    Baronets are not knights unless they are knighted like anybody else; and, so far
                    from being knights because they are baronets, one of the privileges granted to
                    them shortly after the institution of their dignity was that they, not being
                    knights, and their successors and their eldest sons and heirs apparent should,

                    than traditional nicknames, and do not by any means imply that the persons to
                    whom they are applied are knights in a legitimate sense. Notwithstanding,
                    however, that simple knighthood has gone out of use abroad, there are

                    duke of Burgundy, in 1429, and of the Annunciation founded by Charles HL, duke
                    of Savoy, in 1518—now that the orders of St Michael founded by Louis XL and of
                    the Holy Ghost founded by Henry III. of France, in 1469 and 1578, are either
                    extinct or in abeyance—none of the foreign military as distinguished from the
                    religious orders of knighthood have any actual historical connexion with
                    chivalry. The orders of the Genet of France and the Oak of Navarre of course are
                    to be classed as mere fictions with the order of the Round Table of Britain. But
                    the pretensions of almost every other foreign order to extreme antiquity, as for

                    the Seraphim of Sweden, if they are less obviously extravagant, are not more
                    susceptible of verification. It has nearly always been the practice even in
                    modern days to represent the establishment as the revival or reorganization of
                    an order. We ourselves have seven orders of knighthood, the Garter, the Thistle,
                    St Patrick, the Bath, the Star of India, St Michael and St George, and the
                    Indian Empire; and, while the first is undoubtedly the oldest as well as the
                    most illustrious anywhere existing, a fictitious antiquity has been claimed <pb

                    second and fourth, although the third, fifth, sixth, and seventh appear to be as
                    contentedly as they are unquestionably recent.</p>
                <p>It is, however, certain that the “most noble” Order of the Garter at least was
                    instituted in the middle of the 14th century, when, to use Hallam’s words, the
                    court of England “was the sun as it were of that system which embraced the
                    valour and nobility of the Christian world,” when “chivalry was in its zenith,
                    and in all the virtues which adorned the knightly character none were so
                    conspicuous as Edward III. and the Black Prince.” But in what particular year
                    this event occurred is and has been the subject of much difference of opinion.
                    All the original records of the order until after 1416 have perished, and
                    consequently the question depends for its settlement not on direct testimony but
                    on inference from circumstances. The dates which have been selected vary from
                    1344 to 1351, and it is a matter of some historical interest and importance to
                    determine so far as it is practicable which of them is probably accurate, since
                    Dr Stubbs cites the fact of “Edward III. celebrating his great feast on the
                    institution of the Order of the Garter in the midst of the Black Death” as a
                    “typical illustration” of the heartlessness and want of sympathy between classes
                    which he holds to have been characteristic of the age.<note anchored="true"

                    the country raged until the end of September 1349. Hence Dr Stubbs apparently
                    agrees with Ashmole (who based his opinion on the preamble to the two earliest
                    but evidently not contemporary copies of the statutes) in referring the
                    institution of the order and the accompanying feast to St George’s Day in the

                    that, although it is not impossible that Edward III. may have determined to
                    found an order of knighthood in 1344, when he invited knights of all countries
                    to jousts at Windsor and revived the feast of the Round Table, of which
                    Froissart speaks, yet “the details of the Order of the Garter were not settled
                    (even if the institution itself was contemplated), the companions appointed, nor
                    the name or ensigns established until the latter part of 1347 or early in

                    without going fully into the evidence, which may be examined at length in
                    Nicolas and Beltz, it is indisputable that in the wardrobe account from
                    September 1347 to January 1349, the 21st and 23d Edward III., the issue of
                    certain habits with garters and the motto embroidered on them is marked for St
                    George’s Day, that similar vestments for the king and others on occasions not
                    connected with the order are recorded as having been delivered in 1347 at the
                    Christmas games at Guildford and the tournaments at Bury, Windsor, Lichfield,
                    and Eltham, that the letters patent relating to the preparation of the royal
                    chapel of Windsor are dated in August 1348, and that in the treasury accounts of
                    the Prince of Wales there is an entry in November 1348 of the gift by him of
                    “twenty-four garters to the knights of the Society of the Garter.”<note

                    manifestly already fully constituted in the autumn of 1348, was not in existence
                    before the summer of 1346 Sir Harris Nicolas holds on the ground that nobody who
                    was not a knight could under its statutes have been admitted to it, and that
                    neither the Prince of Wales nor several others of the original companions were
                    knighted until the middle of that year. Mr Beltz, following a suggestion of
                    Anstis, had endeavoured to overcome this difficulty by assuming that the Black
                    Prince had been knighted in his infancy, and that he was made a banneret at the
                    age of fifteen. But, although it was not unusual for the sons of sovereigns and
                    great feudatories to be knighted when they were children, and even at their
                    baptism, it is beyond question, as Sir Harris Nicolas points out, that in
                    England only commoners could be formally created bannerets. All knights of or
                    above the rank of a baron were at once entitled to bear their banners in the
                    field. And that the Prince of Wales was knighted on the landing of Edward III.’s
                    expedition against France at La Hogue in July 1346 there can be no doubt. It
                    seems pretty clear, however, that the Order of the Garter was instituted and the
                    great feast celebrated, not in the midst of the Black Death, but at any rate
                    some months before its ravages commenced. Regarding the occasion there has been
                    almost as much controversy as regarding the date of its foundation. The <hi
                    rend="superscript"> κ</hi> vulgar and more general story,” as Ashmole calls it,
                    is that of the countess of Salisbury’s garter. But commentators are not at one
                    as to which countess of Salisbury was the heroine of the adventure, whether she
                    was Katherine Montacute or Joan the Fair Maid of Kent, while Heylyn rejects the
                    legend as “a vain and idle romance derogatory both to the founder and the order,
                    first published by Polydor Vergil, a stranger to the affairs of England, and by
                    him taken upon no better ground than <hi rend="italic">fama vulgi,</hi> the
                    tradition of the common people, too trifling a foundation for so great a
                    building,” and Anstis says that “it is now no more credited than the absurd,
                    ridiculous relation of Micheli Marquez that this order, termed from the Greek
                    language Periscelidis Ordo, was erected to the memory of one Periscelide, a true
                    fairy queen, or the whimsical dream of Mr Joshua Barnes in his far-fetched
                    derivation of it from the Cabiri among the Samothracians.”<note anchored="true"

                    allegation that “the king may have picked up a garter at some solemn ball or
                    festivity,”—the queen’s garter, as some have said,—while she and not he made use
                    of the memorable words “Honi soit qui mal y pense.”<note anchored="true"

                    p. 182.</p></note> Another legend is that contained in the preface to the
                    Register or Black Book of the order, compiled in the reign of Henry VIIT., by
                    what authority supported is unknown, that Richard I., while his forces were
                    employed against Cyprus and Acre, had been inspired through the instrumentality
                    of St George with renewed courage and the means of animating his fatigued
                    soldiers by the device of tying about the legs of a chosen number of knights a
                    leathern thong or garter, to the end that being. thereby reminded of the honour
                    of their enterprise they might be encouraged to redoubled efforts for victory.
                    This was supposed to have been in the mind of Edward III. when he fixed on the
                    garter as tire emblem of the order, and it was stated so to have been by Taylor,
                    master of the rolls, in his address to Francis I. of France on his investiture
                    in 1527.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Beltz, <hi

                    account of the matter is that, “King Edward having given forth his own garter as
                    the signal for a battle which sped fortunately (which with Du Chesne we conceive
                    to be that of Cressy, fought almost three years after the setting <pb break="no"

                    with the author of the ‘ Nouveau Théâtre du Monde ’ that of Poictiers, which
                    happened above seven years after the foundation of the order and whereat King
                    Edward was not present), the victory, we say, being happily gained, he thence
                    took occasion to institute this order, and gave the garter (assumed by him for
                    the symbol of unity and society) preeminence among the ensigns of it, whence
                    that select number whom he incorporated into a fraternity are frequently styled
                    ‘equites aureae periscelidis’ and vulgarly knights of the garter.” <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Ashmole and Beltz also see in the order a reference
                    to the king’s French claims, and remark that the colour of the garter is the
                    tincture of the field of the French arms. But, as Sir Harris Nicolas points
                    out,—although Ashmole is not open to the correction, — this hypothesis rests for
                    its plausibility on the assumption that the order was established before the
                    invasion of France in 1346. And he further observes that “a great variety of
                    devices and mottoes were used by Edward III.; they were chosen from the most
                    trivial causes and were of an amorous rather than of a military character.
                    Nothing,” he adds, “is more likely than that in a crowded assembly a lady should
                    accidentally have dropped her garter; that the circumstance should have caused a
                    smile in the bystanders; and that on its being taken up by Edward he should have
                    reproved the levity of his courtiers by so happy and chivalrous an exclamation,
                    placing the garter at the same time on his own knee, as ‘ Dishonoured be he who
                    thinks ill of it.’ Such a circumstance occurring at a time of general festivity,
                    when devices, mottoes, and conceits of all kinds were adopted as ornaments or
                    badges of the habits worn at jousts and tournaments, would naturally have been
                    commemorated as other royal expressions seem to have been by its conversion into
                    a device and motto for the dresses at an approaching hastilude.” <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> Moreover, Sir Harris Nicolas contends that the order
                    had no loftier immediate origin than a joust or tournament. It consisted of the
                    king and the Black Prince, and twenty-four knights divided into two bands of
                    twelve like the titters in a hastilude —at the head of the one being the first,
                    and of the other the second; and to the companions belonging to each, when the
                    order had superseded the Round Table and had become a permanent institution,
                    were assigned stalls either on the sovereign’s or the prince’s side of St
                    George’s Chapel. That Sir Harris Nicolas is accurate in this conjecture seems
                    probable from the selection which was made of the “founder knights.” As Mr Beltz
                    observes, the fame of Sir Reginald Cobham, Sir Walter Manny, and the earls of
                    Northampton, Hereford, and Suffolk was already established by their warlike
                    exploits, and they would certainly have been among the original companions had
                    the order been then regarded as the reward of military merit only. But, although
                    these eminent warriors were subsequently elected as vacancies occurred, their
                    admission was postponed to that of several very young and in actual warfare
                    comparatively unknown knights, whose claims to the honour may be most rationally
                    explained on the assumption that they had excelled in the particular feats of
                    arms which preceded the institution of the order. The order was dedicated to St
                    George of Cappadocia and St Edward the Confessor, and its feast or solemn annual
                    convention was kept at Windsor on St George’s Day, the 23d of April, with little
                    interruption from the reign of Edward III. to the reign of Queen Elizabeth. But
                    a few years after the Restoration the celebration was altogether discontinued.
                    The original companionship had consisted of the sovereign and twenty-five
                    knights, and no change was made in this respect until 1786, when the sons of
                    George III. and his successors were made eligible notwithstanding that the
                    chapter might be complete. In 1805 another alteration was effected by the
                    provision that the lineal descendants of George II. should be eligible in the
                    same manner, except the Prince of Wales for the time being, who was declared to
                    be “a constituent part of the original institution”; and again in 1831 it was
                    further ordained that the privilege accorded to the lineal descendants of George
                    II. should extend to the lineal descendants of George I. The power of making and
                    modifying the statutes of the order as exemplified in these innovations had from
                    the beginning belonged to the whole fraternity, and it was only in the reign of
                    Charles II. that it was surrendered to the sovereign. But the knights still
                    continued at any rate formally to elect their companions, and the gorgeous and
                    elaborate ceremonies of installation were still regarded as requisite to the
                    full reception of knights elect. Since the beginning of the reign of George
                    III.,however, both chapters and installations became more and more occasional,
                    and it is now the established custom for the sovereign altogether to dispense
                    with them. Although, as Sir Harris Nicolas observes, nothing is now known of the
                    form of admitting ladies into the order, the description applied to them in the
                    records during the 14th and 15th centuries leaves no doubt that they were
                    regularly received into it. The queen consort, the wives and daughters of
                    knights, and some other women of exalted position, were designated “Dames de la
                    Fraternité de St George,” and entries of the delivery of robes and garters to
                    them are found at intervals in the Wardrobe Accounts from the 50th Edward III.
                    (1376) to the 10th of Henry VII. (1495), the first being Isabel, countess of
                    Bedford, the daughter of the one king, and the last being Margaret and
                    Elizabeth, the daughters of the other king. The effigies of Margaret Byron, wife
                    of Sir Robert Harcourt, K.G., at Stanton Harcourt, and of Alice Chaucer, wife of
                    William de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, K.G., at Ewelme, which date from the reigns
                    of Henry VI. and Edward IV., have garters on their left arms. At a chapter in
                    1637 an attempt was made to revive the practice of issuing the ensigns of the
                    order to ladies. Sir James Palmer, acting as deputy for Sir Thomas Rowe, the
                    chancellor of the order, moved the sovereign that the wives of the knights
                    companions might have the privilege of wearing “a garter of the order about
                    their arms and an upper robe at festival times, according to ancient usage.” The
                    matter was referred by Charles I. to the queen, and another chapter was
                    appointed for the purpose of taking it into final consideration. But owing to
                    the civil war nothing further was done in the matter. At present the officers of
                    the order are five—the prelate, chancellor, register, king of arms, and
                    usher—the first, third, and fifth having been attached to it from the
                    commencement, while the fourth was added by Henry V. and the second by Edward
                    IV. The prelate has always been the bishop of Winchester; the chancellor was
                    formerly the bishop of Salisbury, but is now the bishop of Oxford; the
                    registership and the deanery of Windsor have been united since the reign of
                    Charles I.; the king of arms, whose duties were in the beginning discharged by
                    Windsor herald is garter principal king of arms; and the usher is the gentleman
                    usher of the Black Rod.</p>
                <p>The other orders of knighthood subsisting in the British empire must be spoken of
                    more briefly. The “most ancient” Order of the Thistle was founded by James II.
                    in 1687, and dedicated to St Andrew. It consisted of the sovereign and eight
                    knights companions, and fell into abeyance r.t the Revolution of 1688. In 1703
                    it was revived by Queen Anne, when it was ordained to consist of the sovereign
                    and twelve knights companions, the number being increased to sixteen by statute
                    in 1827. The “most illustrious” Order <hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi><hi

                <p>of St Patrick was instituted by George III, in 1788, to consist of the sovereign,
                    the lord lieutenant of Ireland as grand master, and fifteen knights companions,
                    enlarged to twenty-two in 1833. The “most honourable” Order of the Bath was
                    established by George I. in 1725, to consist of the sovereign, a grand master,
                    and thirty-six knights companions. This was a pretended revival of an order
                    supposed to have been created by Henry IV. at his coronation in 1399. But, as we
                    have before shown, no such order existed. Knights of the Bath, although they
                    were allowed precedence before knights bachelors, were merely knights bachelors
                    who were knighted with more elaborate ceremonies than others and on certain
                    great occasions. After the so-called revival the grand mastership merged in the
                    crown on the death of John, duke of Montagu, the first tenant of the office in
                    1749, and in 1815 and again in 1847 the constitution of the order was
                    remodelled. Exclusive of the sovereign, royal princes, and distinguished
                    foreigners, it is limited to fifty military and twenty-five civil knights grand
                    crosses, one hundred and twenty-three military and eighty civil knights
                    commanders, and six hundred and ninety military and two hundred and fifty civil
                    companions. The “most distinguished” Order of St Michael and St George was
                    founded by the prince regent, afterwards George IV., in 1818, in commemoration
                    of the British protectorate of the Ionian Islands, “for natives of the Ionian
                    Islands and of the island of Malta and its dependencies, and for such other
                    subjects of his majesty as may hold high and confidential situations in the
                    Mediterranean.” By statute of 1832 the lord high commissioner of the Ionian
                    Islands was to be the grand master, and the order was directed to consist of
                    fifteen knights grand crosses, twenty knights commanders, and twenty-five
                    cavaliers or companions. After the repudiation of the British protectorate of
                    the Ionian Islands, the order was placed on a new basis, and by letters patent
                    of 1868 and 1877 it was extended and provided for such of “the natural born
                    subjects of the crown of the United Kingdom as may have held or shall hold high
                    and confidential offices within her Majesty’s colonial possessions, and in
                    reward for services rendered to the crown in relation to the foreign affairs of
                    the empire.” It is now limited to fifty knights grand crosses, of whom the first
                    or principal is grand master, exclusive of extra and honorary members, of one
                    hundred and fifty knights companions, and two hundred and sixty companions. It
                    ranks between the “most exalted” Order of the Star of India and the Order of the
                    Indian Empire, of both of which the viceroy of India for the time being is <hi
                    rend="italic">ex officio</hi> grand master. Of these the first was instituted in
                    1861 and enlarged in 1876, and the second was established in 1878 in
                    commemoration of the Queen’s assumption of the imperial style and title of the
                    empress of India. Of the Star of India there may be thirty knights grand
                    commanders, seventy-two knights commanders, and one hundred and fifty-four
                    companions, while of the Indian Empire there may be an unlimited number of
                    companions, among whom the councillors of her majesty for her Indian empire are
                    included by virtue of their office and for life.</p>
                <p>It h is been the general opinion, as expressed by Sainte Palaye and Mills, that
                    formerly all knights were qualified to confer knighthood.<note anchored="true"

                    questioned whether the privilege was thus indiscriminately enjoyed even in the

                    testimony of the romance writers; historical evidence, however, tends to limit
                    the proposition, and the sounder conclusion appears to be, as Sir Harris Nicolas
                    says, that the right was always restricted in opera tion to sovereign princes,
                    to those acting under their authority or sanction, and to a few other personages
                    of exalted rank and station.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    seen that bishops and abbots could make knights in the 11th and 12th

                    1583, and Robert, earl of Essex, in 1595, while under James I. an ordinance of

                    captain of Guisnes, it was considered necessary that he should be authorized in
                    express terms to confer knighthood, which was also done by Edward VI. iu his own

                    it was a common practice for sovereigns and princes to dub each odιer knights
                    much as they were afterwards, and are now, in the habit of exchanging the stars

                    about Queen Elizabeth and Sir Thomas Arundel afterwards Lord Arundel of Wardour,
                    and her disinclination that “her sheep should bear a stranger’s mark,” and
                    “dance after the whistle of every foreigner,” had reference to a countship of
                    the empire, and not to knighthood or an order of chivalry. Even to the end of
                    the last century indeed any knight duly dubbed abroad was fully accepted as a
                    knight in England. Hence when in 1792, at the request of the king of Sweden,
                    George III. invested Sir Sidney Smith with the grand cross and collar of the
                    Swedish Order of the Sword, it was expressly announced that he “was not knighted

                    necessary for the reception by a British subject of any foreign order of
                    knighthood, but further that such permission shall not authorize “the assumption
                    of any style, appellation, rank, precedence, or privilege appertaining to a
                    knight bachelor of the United Kingdom.” Moreover, no permission of the kind will
                    be granted “unless the foreign order shall have been conferred in consequence of
                    active and distinguished service before the enemy either at sea or in the
                    field,” or unless the person receiving it shall have been “actually and

                <p>Since knighthood was accorded either by actual investiture or its equivalent, a
                    counter process of degradation was regarded as necessary for the purpose of
                    depriving anybody who had once received it of the rank and condition it implied.
                    And in this respect there can be no doubt that the order of chivalry was
                    designedly assimilated to the order of priesthood.<note anchored="true"

                    away those things from the clerk wherewith he was so invested at his taking the
                    order from which he is to be degraded, so the ceremonies of degradation of a
                    knight were in ancient times such as that the sword with which he was girt at
                    his knighting and the spurs that were put on him were to be publicly taken off
                    from him, and some other solemnities were sometimes in it.”<note anchored="true"

                    England are exceedingly few, so few indeed that two only are mentioned by Segar,
                    writing in 1602, and Daliaway says that only three were on record in the College
                    of Arms when he wrote in 1793. But in illustration of the statement of Coke that
                    “when a knight is degraded one of his punishments is ‘ quod clypeus suus
                    gentilicius reversus erit,’ and how his arms be reversed that he beareth none,”

                    however, the earliest known example of degradation from knighthood is that of
                    Sir Andrew Harclay, who was created earl of Carlisle by Edward II., and was
                    attainted of high treason in the year following his creation. He was tried and
                    condemned at Carlisle in 1323 by special commission under Edmund of Woodstock,
                    earl of Kent, the king’s half-brother. A part of his sentence, as preserved in
                    the record, was in the following words: “que vous soietz degrade, que vous
                    perdetz noun de count pur vous et pur vous heirs a touts jours que vous soietz
                    deceynt del espée que vous esporeuns d’orrees soient coupez de talouns,” which
                    having been done, according to Holingshed, Sir Anthony Lucy, the sheriff of
                    Cumberland, said to him, “Andrew, thou art no knight, but thou art a knave,”
                    when judgment for treason was pronounced on him, and he was immediately

                    England in 1468, but the sentence as preserved by Stowe seems to indicate that
                    the ceremonies of degradation were to be remitted.<note anchored="true"

                    they had belonged.</p>
                <p>Roughly speaking, the age of chivalry properly so called may be said to have
                    extended from the beginning of the crusades to the end of the Wars of the Roses.
                    Within the limits of that period, which comprised about four hundred years, all
                    that was peculiarly characteristic of it arose, attained to maturity, and fell
                    into decay. It is true that some of its spirit and many of its external forms
                    lingered on throughout the greater part of the 16th century. But the chivalry of
                    Francis I. and Charles V. bore much the same relation to the chivalry of Edward
                    III. and the Black Prince that the romance of Don Quixote bears to the romance
                    of Amadis de Gaul. As a practical military system chivalry was entirely at an
                    end. The revolution<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0137-0126"/> in the mode of warfare which had commenced under
                    Edward III. was completed under Henry VIII., and it was on their infantry and
                    artillery rather than on their cavalry that commanders had come principally to
                    rely. Knights still disported themselves in the lists as bravely and gallantly
                    as of old, but neither their arms nor their armour availed them aught against
                    the cannon and muskets they were compelled to encounter in the field. And even
                    in the way of pageantry and martial exercise chivalry was not destined to be of
                    long continuance. In England tilts and tourneys, in which her father had so much
                    excelled, were patronized to the last by Queen Elizabeth, and were even
                    occasionally held until after the death of Henry, Prince of Wales. But on the
                    Continent the Comte de Montgomerie’s lance proved as fatal to them as it did to
                    the French king Henry at Paris. By that time, however, chivalry had ceased to
                    exist as a social institution as well as a military régime. Its standard of
                    conduct, the code of honour, indeed remained as it in some measure still
                    remains, the test of propriety and the guide of manners in the higher ranks of
                    society all over Europe. But the order of knighthood as an order formally and
                    particularly dedicated to the service of “God and the Ladies,”—“I blush,” says
                    Gibbon, “to unite such discordant names,”—and bound by solemn and express
                    engagements to vindicate justice, to avenge wrong, and to defend the weak, the
                    unprotected, and the oppressed, had disappeared. It was under this shape,
                    however, that chivalry manifested itself during the earlier and more vigorous
                    stages of its development, and played its part among the chief and certainly
                    among the most remarkable of those influences which .moulded the form and
                    directed the course of Western civilization in mediaeval times. The common
                    offspring of feudalism and the church, it derived its resources and its
                    sanctions from each of its parents in turn, and stood forth as at once the
                    spiritual representative of the one and the temporal representative of the
                    other. Whatever may have been its inherent vices and defects, it is at any rate
                    indisputable that it embodied some of the noblest sentiments and engendered many
                    of the worthiest actions of contemporary mankind. It animated poetry and art; it
                    created romance and heraldry; it determined individual ethics, modified the
                    policy of states, and generally inspired the energies while it controlled the
                    destinies of all those nations, especially England and France, which were then
                    as they now are the most enlightened as well as the most powerful in the world.
                    Under ecclesiastical teaching war came to be regarded from a judicial standpoint
                    as, to use the words of Bacon, “the highest trial of right when princes and
                    states that acknowledge no superior on earth shall put themselves upon the
                    justice of God for the deciding of their controversies by such success as it

                    and armies esteemed themselves happy if they marched beneath a consecrated
                    standard. Even in the field and while engaged in mortal conflict Christian
                    knights acknowledged the duties and courtesies of their order. And if they were
                    taken prisoner they could count on consideration from their captors, and on
                    their freedom when they paid their stipulated ransom. Moreover, when they took
                    prisoners they knew that they could safely release them on parole to raise their
                    ransom, and that they would return to captivity if their ransom could not be
                    raised.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sainte Palaye,

                    of chivalry that the best and most humane portions of the laws of war in so far
                    as actual combatants are concerned have their origin. But war, although it was
                    the principal, was uot the exclusive or the continuous occupation of mediaeval
                    knighthood. When not in the camp the home of the knight was in the court or the
                    castle, and it was there that his prowess in the past campaign or present
                    tournament was rewarded, often it might be rather generously than discreetly by
                    the ladies in whose cause he was partly enrolled. Hence, although at no period
                    were women held in greater outward respect by men, it is probable that at no
                    period did more licence in the association of the sexes prevail; and it is a
                    strange comment on the manners of the times that the single word “gallantry”
                    should have grown to signify both bravery and illicit love.<note anchored="true"

                    vol. iii. p. 398.</p></note> But, if chastity was not among the cardinal virtues
                    of chivalry, the catalogue of them included valour, loyalty, courtesy, and
                    munificence; and, had they been practised with the zeal with which they were
                    inculcated, they would have gone far towards redeeming the dissoluteness of
                    private manners with which they were connected. Valour was of course the primary
                    qualification of a knight, and the imputation of cowardice the most damaging
                    that could be cast upon him. But loyalty, which implied the strictest fidelity
                    to all his engagements to his sovereign or lord, his “ladylove,” and his friends
                    and foes alike, was only second to it in importance. Next came courtesy, which
                    meant not only ceremonious politeness but also spontaneous modesty of carriage,
                    self-denial, and careful respect for the feelings of others. And last came
                    munificence, a disdain for money, readiness to relieve want and reward services,
                    hospitality, and liberality in all things. In a celebrated passage Burke
                    describes chivalry as “the unbought grace of life, the cheap defence of nations,
                    the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise.” “Never never more,” he
                    says, “shall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex, that proud
                    submission, that dignified obedience, that subordination of the heart which kept
                    alive even in servitude itself the spirit of an exalted freedom;” and, he adds,
                    “that sensibility of principle, that chastity of honour which felt a stain like
                    a wound, which inspired courage whilst it mitigated ferocity, which ennobled
                    whatever it touched, and under which vice itself lost half its evil by losing
                    all its grossness.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    1790.</p></note> A very different estimate of chivalry is expressed by Mr
                    Freeman. “The chivalrous spirit,” he contends, “is above all things a class
                    spirit. The good knight is bound to endless fantastic courtesies towards men and
                    still more towards women of a certain rank; he may treat all below that rank
                    with any degree of scorn and cruelty. The spirit of chivalry implies the
                    arbitrary choice of one or two virtues to be practised in such an exaggerated
                    degree as to become vices, while the ordinary laws of right and wrong are
                    forgotten. The false code of honour supplants the laws of the commonwealth, the
                    law of God, and the eternal principles of right. Chivalry again in its military
                    aspect not only encourages the love of war for its own sake without regard to
                    the cause for which war is waged, it encourages also an extravagant regard for a
                    fantastic show of personal daring which cannot in any way advance the objects of
                    the siege or campaign which is going on. Chivalry in short is in morals very
                    much what feudalism is in law: each substitutes purely personal obligations,
                    obligations devised in the interests of an exclusive class, for the more homely
                    duties of an honest man and a good citizen.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    represent the extremes of praise and of depreciation,—it may be assumed that at
                    all events an approximation to the truth concerning the ethical effects of
                    chivalry or knighthood is somewhere to be found. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f.
