                    rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi></label> (1788-1830), one of the most genial,
                    prolific, and gifted poets of Hungary, and especially celebrated as the
                    regenerator of the national drama, was born on the 6th of February 1788, at Tét,
                    in the county of Györ. His birth cost his mother her life, which unfortunate
                    circumstance preyed upon the father’s mind and caused him to view the child with
                    feelings akin to aversion. The austerity of his father and the loss of his
                    mother were, however, in a great measure made amends for to Kâroly by the love
                    of his elder sister Teréz, who tended him during his early years with maternal
                    care, and remained devoted to him through his whole life. In 1799 he was sent to
                    the gymnasium at Györ (Raab), where he made only moderate progress in his
                    studies, whilst the impetuosity of his disposition often involved him in
                    trouble. Placed as a cadet in Duke Eszterhâzy’s regiment in 1804, he saw a good
                    deal of service, rising to the rank of captain. In 1811 he quitted the army with
                    the intention of marrying. Offended at this step, his father withdrew from him
                    all support, and his affianced bride rejected him upon finding him at variance
                    with his father. His sister, then the wife of Captain Gâbor Farkas, offered him
                    an asylum in her home, where he remained during the winter of 1811-12; but,
                    unwilling to eat the bread of dependence, Kâroly removed to Pest and afterwards
                    to Vienna, where he tried to live by his skill in painting. He at this time
                    began assiduously to study the works of Shakespeare, Schiller, and Lessing,
                    became a frequent visitor at the Vienna theatre, and made the acquaintance of
                    its official poet Theodore Körner, whose drama <hi rend="italic">Zrvnyi</hi> was
                    written at Kisfaludy’s suggestion. Rendered impatient by ill success, he soon
                    left Vienna, and <pb break="no"

                    through Germany, Switzerland, France, and Italy as far as Rome, obtaining as
                    before a precarious livelihood as an artist. At length subdued by misfortune,
                    and longing for his home and a more honourable career, he in 1817 sought by the
                    aid of his sister reconciliation with his father, who, though still hard to be
                    entreated, allowed him a slight pecuniary assistance. Although not without
                    friends at Pest, where he now took up his abode, he continued to support himself
                    by his brush until the spring of 1819. It was on the 3d of May in this year that
                    the successful performance at Pest of his national drama, in five acts, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Tatars in Hungary,</hi> placed the name of Kâroly Kisfaludy on
                    the roll of literary fame. It was rapidly followed by other dramas, all of which
                    met with popular favour. Not only was he now admired by his own countrymen, but
                    by means of the German translations of Gaal in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theater</hi><hi rend="italic">der Magyaren</hi> (Brünn, 1820) he soon became
                    known abroad. Freed from pecuniary embarrassment, Kâroly Kisfaludy was now able
                    to devote his best energies to literature, poetry, and the drama. In 1822 he
                    started an annual under the name ef <hi rend="italic">Aurora,</hi> which he
                    continued to edit until the year of his death. Although its success was great
                    and his popularity continued to increase, he became ever more and more critical
                    with regard to his own productions; and, if his earlier pieces must be regarded
                    rather as the outcome of natural talent than as the result of matured
                    consideration, his later productions bear evidence to the high culture of his
                    mental powers. In recognition of his exceptional literary merit, he was in 1826
                    rewarded with the prize of the Marczibânyi foundation; about this time also he
                    came into possession of the estate at Tét through the death of his father.
                    Towards the close of 1829 his health began to fail, and, though he rallied for a
                    time, consumption, accelerated by the news of his sister’s death, brought his
                    career to a close on the 21st November 1830, at the early age of forty-two,
                    while his friends were rejoicing at the tidings of his election as a member of
                    the Hungarian academy of sciences. The first edition of his collected works was
                    published by Toldy in 10 vols. (Buda, 1831). To the <hi rend="italic">Kisfaludy

                    many of the foregoing particulars.</p>
