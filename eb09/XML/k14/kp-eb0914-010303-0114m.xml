                    once perhaps the most familiar bird-of-prey in Great Britain, and now one of the
                    rarest. Three or four hundred years ago foreigners were struck with its
                    abundance in the streets of London, and the evidence of two of them, one being
                    the eminent naturalist Belon, has been already given <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 736, note). It was doubtless the scavenger in
                    ordinary of that and other large towns (as a kindred species now is in Eastern
                    lands), except where its place was taken by the Raven; for Sir Thomas Browne <hi
                    rend="italic">{circa</hi> 1662) wrote of the latter at Norwich—“in good plentie
                    about the citty which makes so few Kites to be seen hereabout.” Wolley has well
                    remarked of the modem Londoners that few “who see the paper toys hovering over
                    the parks in fine days of summer, have any idea that the bird from which they
                    derive their name used to float all day in hot weather high over the heads of
                    their ancestors.” Even at the beginning of the present century the</p>
                <p>“Kites that swim sublime In still repeated circles, screaming loud,”</p>
                <p>formed a feature of many a rural landscape in England, as they had done in the
                    days of Cowper. But an evil time soon came upon the species. It must have been
                    always hated by the henwife, but the resources of civilization in the shape of
                    the gun and the gin were denied to her. They were, however, employed with fatal
                    zeal by the gamekeeper; for the Kite, which had long afforded the supremest
                    sport to the falconer, was now left friendless,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>George, third earl of Orford, died in 1791,
                    and Colonel Thornton, who with him had been the latest follower of this highest
                    branch of the art of falconry, broke up his hawking establishment not many years
                    after. There is no evidence that the pursuit of the Kite was in this or any
                    other country reserved to kings or privileged persons, but the taking of it was
                    quite beyond the powers of the ordinary trained Falcons, and in older days
                    practically became limited to those of the sovereign. Hence the Kite had
                    attached to it, especially in Fiance, the epithet of “royal,” which has still
                    survived in the specific appellation of <hi rend="italic">regalis</hi> applied
                    to it by many ornithologists. The scandalous work of Sir Antony Weldon <hi
                    rend="italic">{Court and Character of King James,</hi> p. 104) bears witness to
                    the excellence of the Kite as a quarry in an amusing story of the “British
                    Solomon,” whose Master-Falconer, Sir Thomas Monson, being determined to outdo
                    the performance of the French king’s falconer, who, when sent to England to show
                    sport, “could not kill one Kite, ours being more magnanimous then the French
                    Kite,” at last succeeded, after an outlay of £1000, in getting a cast of Hawks
                    that took nine Kites running—“never missed one." On the strength of this, James
                    was induced to witness a flight at Royston, “but;the Kite went to such a mountee
                    as all the field lost sight of Kite and Hawke and all, and neither Kite nor
                    Hawke were either seen or heard of to this present.”</p></note> and in a very
                    few years it seems to have been exterminated throughout the greater part of
                    England, certain woods in Huntingdonshire and Lincolnshire and in the Western
                    Midlands, as well as Wales, excepted. In these latter a small remnant still
                    exists; but the well-wishers of this beautiful species are naturally chary of
                    giving information that might lead to its further persecution. In Scotland there
                    is no reason to suppose that its numbers suffered much diminution until about
                    1835 or even later, when the systematic destruction of “vermin” on so many moors
                    was begun. In that kingdom, however, it is now as much restricted to certain
                    districts as in England or Wales, and those districts it would be most
                    inexpedient to indicate.</p>
                <p>The Kite is, according to its sex, from 25 to 27 inches in length, about one half
                    of which is made up by its deeply-forked tail, capable of great expansion, and
                    therefore a powerful rudder, enabling the bird while soaring on its wide wings,
                    more than 5 feet in extent, to direct its circling course with scarcely a
                    movement that is apparent to the spectator below. Its general colour is pale
                    reddish-brown or cinnamon, the head being greyish-white, but almost each feather
                    has the shaft dark. The tail-feathers are broad, of a light red, barred with
                    deep brown, and furnish the salmon-fisher with one of the choicest materials of
                    his “flies.” The nest, nearly always built in the crotch <pb break="no"

                    with many strange substances collected as chance may offer, but among them

                    the Kite builds, look to lesser linen”—very necessary no doubt to the
                    laundresses of former days when the bird commonly frequented their drying
                    grounds.</p></note> seem always to have a place. The eggs, three or four in
                    number, are of a dull white, spotted and blotched with several shades of brown,
                    and often lilac. It is especially mentioned by old authors that in Great Britain
                    the Kite was resident throughout the year; whereas on the Continent it is one of
                    the most regular and marked migrants, stretching its wings towards the south in
                    autumn, wintering in Africa, and returning in spring to the land of its
                    birth.</p>
                <p>There is a second European species, not distantly related, the <hi rend="italic"

                    most authors,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Sharpe
                    <hi rend="italic">(Cat. Birds Brik Museum,</hi> i. p. 322) calls it <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. korschun</hi>; but the figure of S. G. Gmelin’s <hi

                    a general dull blackish-brown plumage and a less forked tail. In some districts
                    this is much commoner than the red Kite, and on one occasion it has appeared in
                    England. Its habits are very like those of the species already described, but it
                    seems to be more addicted to fishing. Nearly allied to this Black Kite are the

                    Burmah, and some of the Malay countries as well. All these may be considered
                    true Kites, while those next to be mentioned are more aberrant forms. First
                    there is <hi rend="italic">Elanus,</hi> the type of which is <hi rend="italic"
                    >E. caeruleus,</hi> a beautiful little bird, the Blackwinged Kite of English
                    authors, that comes to the south of Europe from Africa, and has several

                    scriptus</hi> of Australia being most worthy of notice. An extreme development
                    of this form is found in the African <hi rend="italic">Nauclerus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rwcourU,</hi> as well as in <hi rend="italic">Elanοides

                    remarkable for its length of wing and tail, which gives it a marvellous power of
                    flight, and serves to explain the unquestionable fact of its having twice
                    appeared in Great Britain. To <hi rend="italic">Elanus</hi> also <hi
