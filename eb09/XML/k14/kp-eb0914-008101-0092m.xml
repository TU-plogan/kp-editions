                    >isρida</hi> of ornithologists, one of the most beautiful and well-known of
                    European birds, being found, though nowhere very abundantly, in every country of
                    this quarter of the globe, as well as in North Africa and South-Western Asia as
                    far as Sindh. Its blue-green back and rich chestnut breast render it conspicuous
                    as it frequents the streams and ponds whence it procures its food, by plunging
                    almost perpendicularly into the water, and emerging a moment after with the
                    prey— whether a small fish, a crustacean, or an aquatic insect—it has captured.
                    In hard frosts it resorts to the sea-shore, but a severe winter is sure to
                    occasion a great mortality in the species, for many of its individuals seem
                    unable to reach the tidal waters where only in such a season they could obtain
                    sustenance; and to this cause rather than any other (though, on account of its
                    beauty and the utility of its feathers in making artificial flies, it is shot
                    and netted in great numbers) is perhaps to be ascribed its general scarcity.
                    Very early in the year it prepares its nest, which is at the end of a tunnel
                    bored by itself in a bank, and therein the six or eight white, glossy,
                    translucent eggs are laid, sometimes on the bare soil, but often on the
                    fishbones which, being indigestible, are thrown up in pellets by the birds; and,
                    in any case, before incubation is completed these <hi rend="italic"
                    >rejectamenta</hi> accumulate so as to form a pretty cupshaped structure that
                    increases in bulk after the young are hatched, but, mixed with their fluid
                    excretions and with decaying fishes brought for their support, soon becomes a
                    dripping fetid mass.</p>
                <p>The Kingfisher is the subject of a variety of legends and superstitions, both
                    classical and mediaeval. Of the latter one of the most curious is that having
                    been originally a plain grey bird it acquired its present bright colours by
                    flying towards the sun on its liberation from Noah’s ark, when its upper surface
                    assumed the hue of the sky above it and its lower plumage was scorched by the
                    heat of the setting orb to the tint it now bears.<note anchored="true"

                    than this, the Kingfisher was supposed to possess many virtues. Its dried body
                    would avert thunderbolts, and if kept in a wardrobe would preserve from moths

                    know how the faithful but unfortunate Ceyx and Alcyone were changed into
                    Kingfishers—birds which bred at the winter solstice, when through the influence
                    of Aeolus, the wind-god and father of the fond wife, all gales were hushed and
                    the sea calmed so that their floating nest might ride uninjured over the waves
                    during the seven proverbial “Halcyon Days”; while a variant or further
                    development of the fable assigned to the Halcyon itself the power of quelling
                    storms.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In many of the

                <p>The common Kingfisher of Europe is the representative of a well-marked Family of
                    birds, the <hi rend="italic">Alcedinidae</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Halcyonidae</hi> of ornithologists, which is considered by some

                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hornbill, voL</hi> xii. p. 169); but the affinity can
                    scarcely be said as yet to be proved; and to the present writer there seems to
                    be at least some ground for believing that a nearer alliance is to be found in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Galbulidae.</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Jacamar,</hi>
                    vol. xiii. p. 531), <hi rend="italic">Momotidae</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    and perhaps some other Families—though all may possibly be discovered to belong
                    to one and the same larger group. Be that as it may, the present Family forms
                    the subject of a work by Mr Sharpe,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">A Monograph oj the</hi> Alcedinidae <hi

                    of its class, and reflects infinite credit on its then youthful author, whose
                    treatment of his subject was most successful. Herein are described one hundred
                    and twenty-five species, nearly all of them being beautifully figured by Mr
                    Keulemans, and that number may be taken even now as approximately correct; for,
                    while the validity of a few has been denied by some eminent men, nearly as many
                    have since been made known, and it seems likely that two or three more described
                    by older writers may yet be rediscovered. These one hundred and twenty-five
                    species Mr Sharpe groups in nineteen genera, and divides into two Sub-families,
                    <hi rend="italic">Alcedininae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dacelorwnae</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The name of this latter
                    Sub-family as constituted by Mr Sharpe would seem to be more correctly <hi

                    1801 by Lacépède, being the oldest included in it. The word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dacelo,</hi> invented by Leach in 1815, is simply an anagram of <hi
                    rend="italic">Alcedo,</hi> and, though of course without any etymological
                    meaning, has been very generally adopted.</p></note><hi rend="italic">f</hi> the
                    one containing five and the other fourteen genera. With existing materials
                    perhaps no better arrangement could have been made, but in the absence of
                    anatomical knowledge it is certainly not to be deemed conclusive, and indeed the
                    method since published by Sundevall <hi rend="italic">(Tentamen,</hi> pp. 95,
                    96) differs from it not inconsiderably. Here, however, it will be convenient to
                    follow that of Mr Sharpe. Externally, which is almost all we can at present say,
                    Kingfishers present a great uniformity of structure. One of their most
                    remarkable features is the feebleness of their feet, and the union
                    (syndactylism) of the third and fourth digits for the greater part of their
                    length; while, as if still further to show the comparatively functionless
                    character of these members, in two of the genera, <hi rend="italic">Alcyone</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Ceyx,</hi> the second digit is aborted, and the birds have
                    but three toes. In most forms the bill does not differ much from that of the
                    common <hi rend="italic">Alcedo</hi><hi rend="italic">ispida,</hi> but in <hi
                    rend="italic">Syma</hi> its edges are serrated, while in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carcineutes, Dacelo,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Melidora</hi> the maxilla is
                    prolonged, becoming in the last a very pronounced hook. Generally the wings are
                    short and rounded, and the tail is in many forms inconspicuous; but in <hi
                    rend="italic">Tanysi-ρtera,</hi> one of the most beautiful groups, the middle
                    pair of feathers is greatly elongated and spatulate, while this genus possesses
                    only ten rectrices, all the rest having twelve. Sundevall relies on a character
                    not noticed by Mr Sharpe, and makes his principal divisions depend on the size
                    of the scapulars, which in one form a mantle, and in the other are so small as
                    not to cover the back. The <hi rend="italic">Alcedinidae</hi> are a cosmopolitan
                    Family, but only one genus, <hi rend="italic">Ceryle,</hi> is found in America,
                    and that extends as well over a great part of the Old World, though not into the
                    Australian Region, which affords by far the greater number both of genera and
                    species, having no fewer than ten of the former and fifty-nine of the latter
                    peculiar to it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>In habits Kingfishers display considerable diversity, though all, it would seem,
                    have it in common to sit at times motionless on the watch for their prey, and on
                    its appearance to dart upon it, seize it as they fly or dive, and return to a
                    perch where it may be conveniently swallowed. But some species, and especially
                    that which is the type of the Family, are not always content to await at rest
                    their victim’s showing itself. They will hover like a Hawk over the waters that
                    conceal it, and, in the manner already described, precipitate themselves upon
                    it. This is particularly the way with those that are fishers in fact as well as
                    in name; but no inconsiderable number live almost entirely in forests, feeding
                    on insects, while reptiles furnish the chief sustenance of others. The last is
                    characteristic of at least one Australian form, which manages to thrive in the
                    driest districts of that country, where not a drop of water is to be found for
                    miles, and the air is at times heated to a degree that is insupportable by most
                    animals. The limits of this article forbid an entrance upon details of much
                    interest, but the Belted Kingfisher of North America, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ceryle</hi><hi rend="italic">alcyon,</hi> is too characteristic a bird of that
                    country to be passed in silence, though its habits greatly resemble those of the
                    European species before described; and the so-called “Laughing Jackass” of New
                    South Wales and South Australia, <hi rend="italic">Dacelo gigas—</hi> with its
                    kindred forms, <hi rend="italic">D. leachi,</hi><hi rend="italic">D.
                    cervina,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D. occidentalis,</hi> from other parts of
                    the country—likewise requires special notice. Attention must also be called to
                    the speculations of Mr Sharpe (op. <hi rend="italic">cit.,</hi> pp.
                    xliv.-xlvii.) on the genetic affinity of the various forms of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcedinidae,</hi> and it is to be regretted that hitherto no light has been
                    shed by palaeontologists on this interesting subject, for the only fossil
                    referred to the neighbourhood of the Family is the <hi rend="italic">Halcyoτnis
