                    father was Aaron Kean, stage carpenter, and his mother was a strolling actress,
                    Ann Carey, granddaughter of Henry Carey, the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >National Anthem,</hi> and the natural son of George Savile, marquis of Halifax.
                    When only in his fourth year Kean made his first appearance on the stage as
                    Cupid in one of Noverre’s ballets at the opera-house. His fine black eyes, his
                    bright vivacity and cleverness, and his ready affection to those who treated him
                    with kindness, made him in childhood a universal favourite, but the harsh
                    circumstances of his lot, and the want of proper restraint, while they developed
                    strong self-reliance, fostered wayward tendencies. About 1794 a few persons
                    benevolently provided the means of sending him to school, where he mastered his
                    tasks with remarkable ease and rapidity; but finding its restraint intolerably
                    irksome, he shipped himself as a cabin boy at Portsmouth. Soon discovering that
                    he had onlv escaped to a more rigorous bondage, ho <pb break="no"

                    histrionic mastery which deceived even the physicians at Madeira. On his return
                    to England he sought the protection of his uncle Moses Kean, mimic,
                    ventriloquist, and general entertainer, who, besides continuing his pantomimic
                    studies, introduced him to the study of Shakespeare. At the same time Miss
                    Tidswell, an actress who had been specially kind to him from infancy, taught him
                    the principles of acting. On the death of his uncle he was taken charge of by
                    Miss Tidswell, and under her direction he began the systematic study of the
                    principal Shakespearean characters, displaying even at this early period the
                    peculiar originality of his genius by interpretations entirely different from
                    those of Kemble. His brilliant talents and interesting countenance induced a Mrs
                    Clarke of Guildford Street, Russell Square, to adopt him, but the unlucky remark
                    of a visitor so touched his sensitive pride that he suddenly left her house and
                    went back to his old surroundings. In his fourteenth year he obtained an
                    engagement to play leading characters for twenty nights in York Theatre,
                    appearing as Hamlet, Hastings, and Cato. Shortly afterwards, while he was in the
                    strolling troupe of Richardson, the rumour of his abilities reached the ear of
                    King George III., who commanded him to recite at Windsor Castle. It is affirmed
                    that this incident led some gentlemen to send him to Eton College; but the next
                    three years of his life, from 1803 to 1806, are without authentic record. In
                    1807 he played leading parts in the Belfast theatre along with Mrs Siddons, who
                    said that he “played very very well,” but that “there was too little of him to
                    make a great actor.” An engagement in 1808 to play leading characters in
                    Beverley’s provincial troupe was brought to an abrupt close by his marriage with
                    Miss Chambers, the leading actress, and for several years after his prospects
                    were so dark that, when contemplating the possibility of a debut in London, he
                    was in the habit of exclaiming, “If I succeed I shall go mad.” In 1814, however,
                    the committee of Drury Lane theatre, the fortunes of which were then so low that
                    bankruptcy seemed inevitable, resolved to give him a chance among the
                    “experiments” they were making to win a return of popularity. His debut there on
                    the 26th January as Shylock roused the audience to almost uncontrollable
                    enthusiasm, and successive appearances in Richard III., Hamlet, Othello,
                    Macbeth, and Lear only served to demonstrate to the fullest the greatness of his
                    powers and his complete mastery of the whole range of tragic emotion.</p>
                <p>Probably the irregular habits of Kean, even from the period when he became
                    famous, were prejudicial to the refinement of his taste, and latterly they
                    tended to exaggerate his special defects and mannerisms. The adverse decision in
                    the divorce case Cox <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Kean, and his consequent
                    separation from his wife, roused against him such bitter feeling as almost
                    compelled him to retire permanently into private life. Ultimately he was
                    received with all the old favour, but the contest by its effects both on his
                    bodily health and on his feelings had made him so dependent on the use of
                    stimulants that the gradual deterioration of his gifts was inevitable. Still,
                    even in their decay his great powers triumphed during the moments of his
                    inspiration over the absolute wreck of his physical faculties, and compelled
                    admiration when his gait had degenerated into a weak hobble, when the lightning
                    brilliancy of his eyes had become dull and bloodshot, and the tones of his
                    matchless voice were marred by rough and grating hoarseness. His last appearance
                    on the stage was at Covent Garden, on the 25th March 1833, when he played
                    Othello to his son’s Iago. At the words “Villain, be sure in scene 3 of act iii.
                    he suddenly broke down, and fell insensible into his son’s arms. He died at
                    Richmond, 15th May 1833.</p>
                <p>It was especially in the impersonation of the great creations of Shakespeare’s
                    genius that the varied beauty and grandeur of the acting of Kean were displayed
                    in their highest form, although probably his most powerful character was Sir
                    Giles Overreach, the effect of his first impersonation of which was such that
                    the pit rose <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse,</hi> and even the
                    actors and actresses themselves were overcome by the terrific dramatic illusion.
                    His only personal disadvantage as an actor was his small stature. His
                    countenance was strikingly interesting and unusually mobile; he had a matchless
                    command of facial elocution; his fine eyes scintillated even the slightest
                    shades of emotion and thought; his voice, though weak and harsh in the upper
                    register, possessed in its lower range tones of penetrating and resistless
                    power, and a thrilling sweetness like the witchery of the finest music; above
                    all, in the grander moments of his passion, his intellect and soul seemed to
                    rise beyond material barriers and to glorify physical defects with their own
                    greatness. Kean specially excelled as the exponent of passion. In Othello, Iago,
                    Shylock, and Richard III., characters utterly different from each other, but in
                    which the predominant element is some form of passion, his identification with
                    the personality, as he had conceived it, was as nearly as possible perfect, and
                    each isolated phase and aspect of the plot was elaborated with the n⅛iιjμtest
                    attention to details, and yet with an absolute subordination of these to the
                    distinct individuality he was endeavouring to portray. If the range of character
                    in which Kean attained supreme excellence was narrow, no one except Garrick has
                    been so successful in so many great impersonations. Unlike Garrick, he had no
                    true talent for comedy, but in the expression of biting and saturnine wit, of
                    grim ⅛ιnd ghostly gaiety, he was unsurpassed.</p>
