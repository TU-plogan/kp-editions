                <p><label type="entry">KNOT</label>. In the scientific sense, a knot is an endless
                    physical line which cannot be deformed into a circle. A physical line is
                    flexible and inextensible, and cannot be cut,—so that no lap of it can be drawn
                    through another.</p>
                <p>The founder of the theory of knots is undoubtedly Listing. In his “Vorstudien zur
                    Topologie” <hi rend="italic">(Göttinger Studien,</hi> 1847), a work in many
                    respects of startling originality, a few pages only are devoted to the subject.
                    He treats knots from the elementary notion of twisting one physical line (or
                    thread) round another, and shows that from the projection of a knot on a surface
                    we can thus obtain a notion of the relative situation of its coils. He
                    distinguishes “reduced” from “reducible” forms, the number of crossings in the
                    reduced knot being the smallest possible. The simplest form of reduced knot is
                    of two species, as in figs. 1 and 2. Listing points out that these are formed,
                    the first by right-handed, the second by left-handed twisting. In fact, if three
                    half twists be given to a long strip of paper, and the ends be then pasted
                    together, the two edges become one line, which is the knot in question. We may
                    free it by slitting the paper along its middle line; and then we have the
                    juggler’s trick of putting a knot on an endless unknotted band. One of the above
                    forms cannot be deformed into the other. The one is, in Listing’s language, the
                    “perversion” of the other, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> its image in a plane
                    mirror. He gives a method of symbolizing reduced knots, but shows that in this
                    method the same knot may, in certain cases, be represented by different symbols.
                    It is clear that the brief notice he has published contains a mere sketch of his
                    investigations.</p>
                <p>The most extensive dissertation on the properties of knots is that of Tait <hi
                    rend="italic">(Trans. Hoy. Soc. Pdin.,</hi> 1876-7). It was for the most part
                    written in ignorance of the work of Listing, and was suggested by an inquiry
                    concerning vortex atoms (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Atom).</hi> Tait starts with
                    the almost self-evident proposition that, if any plane closed curve have double
                    points only, in passing continuously along the curve from one of these to the
                    same again an even number of double points has been passed through. Hence the
                    crossings may be taken alternately over and under. On this he bases a scheme for
                    the representation of knots of every kind, and employs it to find all the
                    distinct forms of knots which have, in their simplest projections, 3, 4, 5, 6,
                    and 7 crossings only. Their numbers are shown to be 1, 1, 2, 4, and 8. The
                    unique knot of three crossings has been already given as drawn by Listing. The
                    unique knot of four crossings merits a few words, because its properties lead to
                    a very singular conclusion. It can be deformed into any of the four forms—figs.
                    3 and 4 and their perversions. Knots which can be deformed into their own
                    perversion Tait calls “amphi-cheiral,” and he has shown that there is at least
                    one knot of this kind for every even number of crossings. He shows also that
                    “links” (in which two endless physical lines are linked together) possess a
                    similar property; and he then points out that there is a third mode of making a
                    complex figure of endless physical lines, without either knotting or linking.
                    This may be called “lacing” or “locking.” Its nature is obvious from fig. 5, in
                    which it will be seen that no one of the three lines is knotted, no <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n139/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0139-0128"/> two are linked, and yet the three are inseparably
                    fastened together.</p>
                <p>The rest of Tait’s paper deals chiefly with numerical characteristics of knots,
                    such as their “knottiness,” “beknottedness,” and “knotfulness.” He also shows
                    that any knot, however complex, can be fully represented by three closed plane
                    curves, none of which has double points, and no two of which intersect. It may
                    be stated here that the notion of beknottedness is founded on a remark of Gauss,
                    who in 1833 considered the problem of the number of interlinkings of two closed
                    circuits, and expressed it by the electrodynamic measure of the work required to
                    carry a unit magnetic pole round one of the interlinked curves, while a unit
                    electric current is kept circulating in the other. This original suggestion has
                    been developed at considerable length by Boeddicker <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Erweiterung der Gaussschen Theorie der Verschlingungen,</hi> Stuttgart, 1876).
                    This author treats also of the connexion of knots with Riemann’s surfaces.</p>
                <p>It is to be noticed that, although every knot in which the crossings are
                    alternately over and under is irreducible, the converse is not generally true.
                    This is obvious at once from fig. 6, which is merely the three-crossing knot
                    with a doubled string— what Listing calls “paradromic.”</p>
                <p>Klein, in the <hi rend="italic">Mathematische Annalen,</hi> ix. 478, has proved
                    the remarkable proposition that knots cannot exist in space of four
                    dimensions.</p>
