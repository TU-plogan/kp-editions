                    abandoned in favour of the scheme to which he devoted the best years of his
                    life. The first three cantos of <hi rend="italic">The Messiah,</hi> which were
                    planned in prose in Jena, he finished in Leipsic; and they were published
                    anonymously in the <hi rend="italic">Bremische Beiträge</hi> in 1748. The name
                    of the author was soon known, and Klopstock suddenly found himself the most
                    popular poet of his generation. In 1748 he accepted the position of tutor to a
                    private family in Langensalza, and in 1750 he went to Zürich, whither he was
                    invited by Bodmer, the translator of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> who
                    had been deeply impressed by the early cantos of <hi rend="italic">The</hi><pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0120-0109"/><hi rend="italic">Messiah.</hi> In Zürich
                    Klopstock received from Frederick V. of Denmark, on the recommendation of his
                    minister Count Bernstorff, an invitation to settle in Copenhagen with a pension
                    of 400 thalers. The invitation was accepted; and on his way to the Danish
                    capital he met at Hamburg the lady who, in 1754, became his wife—Margarethe
                    (Meta) Moller, an enthusiastic admirer of his poetry. She died in 1758; and
                    after her death Klopstock edited her writings, which give evidence of a tender,
                    sensitive, and deeply religious spirit. In 1771 Klopstock left Copenhagen, and
                    followed his friend Count Bernstorff to Hamburg, where, in 1773, he issued the
                    last five cantos of <hi rend="italic">The Messiah.</hi> After spending about a
                    year at the court of the margrave of Baden in Carlsruhe, he returned to Hamburg
                    with the title of hofrath and a pension, which he retained along with the
                    pension of the king of Denmark. During the rest of his life he remained in
                    Hamburg, where in 1792 he married Johanna Elizabeth von Winthem, a widow who had
                    been for many years one of his most intimate friends. He died on the 14th of
                    March 1803, and was buried beside his first wife in the village of Ottensen,
                    near Hamburg. Besides <hi rend="italic">The Messiah</hi> he wrote many odes; and
                    in several dramas he celebrated the deeds of the ancient German hero, Arminius,
                    while in others he dealt with the earliest narratives of the Old Testament. He
                    was also the author of <hi rend="italic">Fragmente über Sprache und Dichtkunst,
                    Grammatische Gespräche,</hi> and a book entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gelehrtenrepublik.</hi> In these works he made important contributions to
                    philology and to the history of German poetry. Klopstock’s dramatic writings are
                    without value: many of his odes, especially those on subjects taken from
                    northern mythology, are so vague as to be hardly intelligible; and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Messiah</hi> lacks plastic force, unity of conception, and
                    precision of style. His best odes, however, and many passages of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Messiah</hi> are still admitted to be marked by lyrical genius
                    of a high order; and all German critics recognize that he exercised a salutary
                    influence on the literature of his age by helping to deliver it from slavish
                    adherence to foreign models.</p>
                <p>An edition of his works in 12 octavo volumes was published in Leipsic, 1798-1817;
                    and among later editions may be mentioned one in 12 volumes, 1823-26, another in
                    9 vols., 1839, and a third in 11 vols., 1844-45. Klopstock’s writings are
                    included in Hempel’s <hi rend="italic">Nationalbibliothek,</hi> and there is a
                    new edition, with notes, by Bock (Stuttgart, 1876). See K. F. Cramer, <hi
