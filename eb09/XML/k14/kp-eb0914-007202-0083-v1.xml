                    of Leinster, is situated between 52° 51' and 53° 26' N. lat., and between 6° 28'
                    and 7° 11' W. long., and is bounded on the W. by Queen’s county and King’s
                    county, N. by Meath, E. by Dublin and Wicklow, and S. by Carlow. The area is
                    418,497 acres, or 654 square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The greater part of Kildare belongs to the
                    carboniferous plain which occupies the central portion of Ireland. In the east
                    of the county this plain is bounded by elevations belonging to the clay slate
                    formations bordering on the granite mountains of Dublin and Wicklow; in the
                    south it is encroached upon by the granite formations of Carlow; and in the
                    centre it is interrupted by an elevated plateau terminated on the south by the
                    hills of Dunmurry, consisting chiefly of grauwacke and clay slates, and on the
                    north by the Hill of Allen, a conical rock of porphyry and greenstone, which
                    rises abruptly from the Bog of Allen to the height of 300 feet. Marble of very
                    fine quality is obtained in the quarries to the west of the town of Kildare, and
                    copper ore is said to have been found in the hills of Dunmurry.</p>

                    its tributary the Blackwater rises in the north part of the county, but soon
                    passes into Meath; the Barrow, which forms the boundary of Kildare with Queen’s
                    county, and receives the Greese and the Lane shortly after entering Kildare; the
                    Lesser Barrow, which flows southward from the Bog of Allen to near Rathangan;
                    and the Liffey, which enters the county near Ballymore Eustace, and flowing
                    north-west and then north-east quits it at Leixlip, having received the Morrel
                    between Celbridge and Clane, and the Ryewater at Leixlip. The northern border of
                    the county is traversed by the Royal Canal, which connects Dublin with the
                    Shannon at Cloondara. Further south the Grand Canal, which connects Dublin with
                    the Shannon at Shannon Harbour, occupies the valley of the Liffey until at
                    Sailins it enters the Bog of Allen, passing into King’s county near the source
                    of the river Boyne. Several branch canals connected with it afford communication
                    with the southern districts of the county.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Agriculture.—</hi> Owing in a considerable degree
                    to the large extent of bog, the climate of the northern districts is very moist,
                    and fogs are frequent, but the eastern portion is drier, and the climate of the
                    Liffey valley is very mild and salubrious. The soil, whether resting on the
                    limestone or on the clay slate, is principally a rich deep loam inclining
                    occasionally to clay, easily cultivated and very fertile if properly drained,
                    which too often is not the case. About 40,000 acres in the northern part of the
                    county are included in the Bog of Allen, which is, however, intersected in many
                    places by elevated tracts of firm ground. To the south of the town of Kildare is
                    the Curragh, an undulating down of about 8000 acres in extent, and presenting to
                    the eye a beautiful sward of vivid green unbroken by a single tree or shrub. The
                    common is the property of the crown, and is occupied as a sheep walk, while a
                    portion of it forms the principal race-course of Ireland. It is now also the
                    headquarters of a military division. The most fertile and highly cultivated
                    districts of Kildare are the valleys of the Liffey and a tract in the south
                    watered by the Greese. The demesne lands along the valley of the Liffey are
                    finely wooded. More attention Is paid to drainage and the use of manures on the
                    larger farms than is done in many other parts of Ireland, but the small farms
                    are mostly cultivated in the usual slovenly manner. The pastures which are not
                    subjected to the plough are generally very rich and fattening.</p>

                <p>The total area under crop in 1881 was 120,953 acres, or 29 per cent, of the whole
                    acreage of the county. In 1880 239,406 acres, a percentage of 57'2, were under
                    grass, 360 acres lay fallow, 7332 were woods, 37,540 bog and marsh, 983 baιτen
                    mountain land, and 15,404 water, roads, and fences. The area under crop in 1850
                    was 147,507 acres, the diminution in 1881 being more than accounted for by a
                    fall of 34,932 in the area under cereals. On the other hand, the area under
                    grass increased between 1850 and 1881 by 47,156 acres. Between 1850 and 1881 the
                    area under wheat, for which the rich deep soil in the valley of the Liffey is
                    well suited, declined from 22,737 to 4120, and that under oats from 45,791 to
                    23,761, or nearly one-half, while the area under barley was nearly doubled,
                    being 13,883 in 1881. The area under potatoes declined from 12,158 acres in
                    .1850 to 9348 acres in 1881, and, notwithstanding a large increase in pasturage
                    and in the number of cattle, the area under turnips only increased from 9622 to
                    11,501.</p>
                <p>Horses have increased from 13,521 in 1855 to 13,795 in 1881. The number used for
                    agricultural purposes was 8205. Little attention is paid to the breed, and the
                    supply is obtained chiefly outside the limits of the county. Cattle in 1855
                    numbered 74,480, and in 1881 had increased to 92,252. ΔIilch cows numbered only
                    12,578, and have diminished since 1855 by 3612. There has been great improvement
                    in the breeds of cattle, crosses with the shorthorned or the Durham being now
                    the most common. Sheep numbered 127,614 in 1855, 133,996 in 1880, andll7,760
                    in!881. They are grazed chiefly on the Curragh, and are now principally
                    Leicesters or crosses with that breed, l·igshave diminished since 1855 from
                    15,993 to 12,936. Goats in 1881 numbered 3835, and poultry 224,310.</p>

                    1878, the county in 1873 was divided among 1768 owners, possessing altogether
                    412,490 acres, with a rateable valuation of £338,233. Of the owners 848, or 48

                    water-power, the county is almost wholly destitute of manufactures; but there
                    are a few small cotton, woollen, and paper mills, as well as breweries and
                    distilleries, and several corn mills. Large quantities of turf are exported to
                    Dublin by the canal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> The Great Western line crosses the county at
                    its northern boundary near Leixlip, Maynooth, Kilcock, and Enfield, and the
                    Great Southern and Western passes through nearly its whole extent by Naas,
                    Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevan, and Athy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The county comprises fourteen baronies,
                    and contains 107 civil parishes, five parts of parishes, and 1240 townlands.
                    Judicially it is within the home circuit, and is divided into fourteen petty
                    sessions districts and three parts of petty sessions districts. Assizes are held
                    at Naas, and quarter sessions at Athy, Kildare, Maynooth, and Naas. The county
                    contains portions of the six poor-law unions of Athy, Baltinglass, Carlow,
                    Celbridge, Edenderry, and Naas. The military stations at Newbridge and the
                    Curragh constitute the Curragh military district, and the barracks at Athy and
                    Naas are included in the Dublin military district. There are three
                    townships—Athy, Naas, and Newbridge. The principal other towns are Maynooth
                    (which is the seat of a Roman Catholic college), Celbridge, Kildare,
                    Monasterevan, Kilcullen, Leixlip, Kilcock, Castledermot, Ballymore Eustace, and
                    Rathangam Previous to the Union Kildare returned ten members to parliament, of
                    whom eight represented boroughs; but now it sends only two, who sit as members
                    for the county.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> According to the census return of 1659 the
                    population amounted to only 13,825, of whom 796 were English and 13,029 Irish.
                    In 1760 it was estimated at 51,726. According to the parliamentary return of
                    1821 it was 99,065, and by 1841 it had increased to 115,190, butin 1851 had
                    diminished to 96,495, in 1861 to 90,946, in 1871 to 83,614, and in 1881 to
                    76,102, of whom 40,859 were males and 35,243 females. In several other counties
                    there is an excess of males over females, but it is much larger in Kildare than
                    in any other, which is the more remarkable that between 1851 and 1880 there has
                    been also an excess of male emigrants, the total number of emigrants being
                    13,651 males and 11,765 females, or 27 ’ 9 per cent, &lt;&gt;f the population of
                    1861. The rate of marriages in 1880 to every 1000 of the population was 3’6, of
                    births 22Ό, and of deaths 16 '9, the rates for Ireland being 3 ’ 8, 24 0, and 19
                    3. The number of natives of England and Wales residing in the county in 1841 was
                    406, and in 1871 they had increased to 5270; of natives of Scotland. there were
                    151 in 1841 and 574 in 1871. The number of Roman Catholics in 1881 was 66,184;
                    of Protestant Episcopalians, 8616; of Presbyterians, 754; of Methodists, 344. In
                    1871 there were none who spoke Irish only, but 554 spoke Irish and English. The
                    number who could read and write in 1871 was 43,783; 11,472 could read but could
                    not write, and 28,359 could neither read nor write.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The early inhabitants of the county are perhaps
                    to be identified with Ptolemy’s Coriondi. Afterwards it formed part of the
                    district of Caellan or Galen, which also included portions of Wicklow and
                    Carlow, the principal chieftain being a representative of the family of Hy
                    Caellan or M‘Kelly, who had their residence at the moat of Ardscull near Naas.
                    According to a tale in the Book of Leinster the original name of Kildare was <hi
                        rend="italic">Drwim Criaidh</hi> (Drumcree), which it retained until the
                    time of St Brigit, after which it was changed to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cilldara,</hi> the church of the oak, from a very old oak under whose
                    shadow the saint bad constructed her cell. For some centuries it was under the
                    government of the Macmurroughs, kings of Leinster, but along with the remainder
                    of Leinster it was granted by Henry II. to Strongbow. On the division of the
                    palatinate of Leinster among the five granddaughters of Strongbow, Kildare fell
                    to Sibilla, the fourth daughter, who married William de Ferrars, earl of Derby.
                    Through the marriage of the only daughter of William de Ferrars it passed to
                    William de Vesey—who, when challenged to single combat by John Fitz Thomas,
                    baron of Offaly, for accusing him of treason, fled to France. His lands were
                    thereupon in 1297 bestowed on Fitz Thomas, who in 1316 was created earl of
                    Kildare, and in 1317 was appointed sheriff of Kildare, the office remainingin
                    the family until the attainder of Gerald, the ninth earl, in the reign of Henry
                    VIII. Kildare was a liberty of Dublin until 1296, when an Act was passed
                    constituting it a separate county.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities.—</hi> In the county there are several old gigantic
                    pillar stones, the principal being those at Punchestown, Harristown,
                    Jigginstown, and Mullamast. Among the more remarkable earthworks are the raths
                    at Mullamast, Knockcaellagh near Kilcullen, Ardscull near Naas, and elsewhere,
                    and the numerous sepulchral mounds in the Curragh. Of the round towers the
                    finest is that of Kildare, which is 130 feet high; there are remains of others
                    at Taghadoe, Kilcullen, Oughterard, and Castledermot. At one time there were an
                    immense number of religious houses in the county. There are remains of a
                    Franciscan abbey at Castledermot. At Graney there are the ruins of an
                    Augustinian nunnery and also portions of a building said to have belonged to the
                    Knights Templars. The town of Kildare has ruins <hi rend="italic">of no</hi>
                    less than four monastic buildings, among others the nunnery founded by St
                    Brigit. The site of a monastery at Old Kilcullen, said to date from the time of
                    St Patrick, is marked by two stone crosses, one of which is curiously
                    sculptured. The fine abbey of Monasterevan is now the seat of the marquis of
                    Drogheda. On the Liffey are the remains of Great Connel Abbey near Celbridge, of
                    St Wolstan’s near Celbridge, and of New Abbey. At Moone, where there was at one
                    time a 1 ’ ranciscan monastery, there are the remains of a very old cross with
                    curious sculpturings. Among the old castles may be mentioned those of Athy and
                    Castledermot, built about the time of the Anglo-Norman invasion; Maynooth
                    Castle, built by the Fitzgeralds; Kilkea, originally built by the seventh earl
                    of Kildare, and restored within the present century; and Timolin, erected in the
                    reign of King John.</p>
