                    (1711-1794), count of Rietberg, Austrian statesman, was born at Vienna, February
                    2, 1711. As the fifth and youngest son of an Austrian count, he was destined at
                    first for the church, but on the death of his brothers he turned his attention
                    to statesmanship. He was sent by Maria Theresa on embassies to Rome and
                    Florence, and was engaged at Turin in strengthening the alliance between
                    Austria, Sardinia, and Great Britain against the Bourbons. In the meantime he
                    had acquired the countship of Rietberg by marriage. In 1744 he was sent as
                    minister to the court of the duke of Lorraine, governor-general of the Austrian
                    Netherlands. During the duke’s absence, Kaunitz administered affairs ably; and,
                    when the French besieged Brussels in 1746, he secured a free retreat for the
                    Austrian troops to Antwerp. After a brief retirement on account of his health,
                    Kaunitz reappeared on the political stage at the congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in
                    1748, where he laid the foundation of his reputation, and earned the rank of
                    minister of state. During his stay as ambassador at Paris, from 1750 to 1752, he
                    concluded a secret alliance between Austria and France, a diplomatic stroke
                    which involved the complete reversal of the former hostile attitude of the two
                    powers, and which was rewarded by his appointment as chancellor of state or
                    prime minister. In 1756 he was made chancellor of the Netherlands and of Italy.
                    For nearly forty years he continued in this capacity to direct the affairs of
                    Austria, steadily cultivating the French and Russian alliances, and jealously
                    watching the rising power of Prussia, against which he formed the coalition of
                    1756. At the partition of Poland in 1772 he secured Galicia for Austria; and it
                    was during his ministry also that Bukowina (1776) and the so-called “Inn
                    quarter” came under the Austrian crown. He enjoyed the unbounded confidence of
                    Maria Theresa, and was an active agent in furthering the reforms under her and
                    her son Joseph II. He showed himself a liberal patron of education and art, as
                    well as an accomplished statesman. Under Joseph II. and Leopold II. his
                    influence waned, and he resigned all his offices at the accession of Francis II.
                    in 1792. In 1764 he was created a prince of the empire. He died June 27,
                    1794.</p>
