                    (1791-1813), German patriot and poet, was born at Dresden, September 23, 1791.
                    His father, a prosperous lawyer, made his house in Dresden a centre of literary,
                    musical, and artistic society, and was an intimate friend of Schiller; and his
                    mother, a daughter of the copper-plate engraver Stock of Leipsic, enjoyed
                    Goethe’s friendship through life, and in her later years claimed it for her son.
                    Theodor Körner was at first so delicate a child that his parents made the
                    paternal vineyard—the same in which Schiller sat and wrote <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Carlos</hi> a few years before—his summer schoolroom. They prescribed for
                    lessons, gymnastics, riding, swimming, fencing, and the like, till the delicate
                    boy grew into a young athlete, with a joyous, affectionate disposition which won
                    the hearts of all who knew him. Partly at the Kreuzschule in Dresden, but
                    chiefly with private tutors at home, Körner now studied languages, history, and
                    mathematics. He was an adept at various kinds of fine wood-turning, could
                    sketch, and play the guitar; but his happiest hours were spent over the volumes
                    of Goethe and Schiller—the household gods; and under their influence the boy
                    began to write verses which his parents forbore to praise, but which displayed,
                    even then, much of the facility and grace of his later poems. At the age of
                    seventeen he went to the school of mines in Freiberg, and worked
                    enthusiastically for two years at mathematics, mineralogy, and chemistry. The
                    poems he wrote during this period were collected and published under the title
                    <hi rend="italic">Knospen.</hi> From Freiberg Körner went to the university of
                    Leipsic, where for some months he studied philosophy, history, and anatomy. He
                    founded there a poetical association, and became a member of the “Macaria” and
                    more than one student club; but he was unfortunately drawn into the hostilities
                    then rife between two parties in the university, and, after fighting several
                    party duels, was at last forced to leave the town to escape the results of a
                    street fray in which he took part. From Leipsic he went to Berlin, and then to
                    Vienna, with letters to his father’s old friends, the Prussian ambassador Von
                    Humboldt and Friedrich Schlegel. Two little pieces which he wrote for the stage,
                    <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Braut</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Der
                    grüne</hi><hi rend="italic">Domino,</hi> were acted at the Vienna Court Theatre
                    in July 1812 with great success; and, with the consent of his parents, he gave
                    up all his former plans, with the hope of being able to make a living by
                    literature alone. His other works followed with astonishing rapidity. In some
                    fifteen months appeared some dozen dramatic pieces and the librettos of a few
                    operas <hi rend="italic">(Das Fischermädchen, Der vierjährige Posten,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Die Bergknappen),</hi> besides many short poems. One after the
                    other all his plays were received at the Vienna Theatre with applause. <hi
                    rend="italic">Zriny,</hi> founded on an heroic incident in Hungarian history,
                    was the favourite with the public; but Goethe praised <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Braut, Der grüne</hi><hi rend="italic">Domino,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Die Sühne.</hi> In January 1813, at the age of one and
                    twenty, Körner was appointed poet to the court theatre in Vienna. With the
                    preparation of the libretto of an opera, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Rückkehr</hi><hi rend="italic">des Ulysses,</hi> for Beethoven,
                    and with the writing, printing, and stage preparation of his plays, the young
                    poet’s hands were now full; very busy and very happy he describes himself in his
                    letters. His betrothal to a young Viennese lady, known now only as the “Toni” of
                    his correspondence, was another source of happiness; but this bright career came
                    suddenly to an end. In the early spring of 1813 there was published the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fatherland:s Call to Arms in the Struggle for Liberation,</hi> and
                    Körner was one of the first to answer the summons. He left Vienna in March, and
                    at Breslau joined the Prussian free-corps then forming under the command of
                    Lützow. When the corps was solemnly consecrated in the village church at Rogau a
                    few days later, the service was opened with a chorale, set to Körner’s words,
                    “Dem Herrn Allein die Ehre”; and almost immediately afterwards, when Petersdorf
                    was sent on a mission to Dresden, to try to unite the Saxons in the common
                    cause, the young poet was sent with him, and on this occasion published his
                    spirited prose <hi rend="italic">Address to the People of Saxony.</hi> Here
                    Körner saw his parents and friends for the last time. In April he was made
                    lieutenant by the vote of his comrades; and a little later, having left the
                    infantry, he was made adjutant to Lützow himself. At Kitzen, near Leipsic,
                    during the three weeks’ armistice, he was severely wounded through the treachery
                    of the enemy, but after several adventures escaped to Carlsbad, where he
                    remained till he was well enough to resume his former post. Lützow’s free corps
                    was in almost daily action when the young adjutant was welcomed back. His
                    cheerful zeal and self-denying helpfulness had endeared him to all his comrades,
                    and it was his wild war songs, sung by many voices to old national melodies
                    round the camp <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n153/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0153-0142"/> fires at night, that helped to spread that
                    fervour in the corps which made it peculiarly terrible to the enemy. The poems
                    written by him at this time are published under the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leyer</hi><hi rend="italic">und Schwert.</hi> They include the lines “Abschied
                    vom Leben,” which were composed during the night when he lay wounded in the wood
                    by Kitzen. The letters written by Körner to his parents at this time are tender
                    and thoughtful—often aflame with patriotic fervour, but with now and then a ring
                    of intense sadness which forebodes the end. This was very near. His last poem,
                    “Das Schwertlied,” was scribbled in his pocket-book at dawn on the 26th of
                    August, when the corps was prepared for action; and he was reading it to a
                    friend when the order to attack was given. It is the wildest of all his
                    warsongs, a love-rhapsody to his sword,—the soldier’s bride; and it was this
                    poem that suggested the refrain of Mrs Hemans’s beautiful verses to his memory.
                    In the engagement that followed, on the high road between Gadebusch and
                    Schwerin, Körner, as adjutant, fought at Liitzow’s side. The French were in
                    great force, but were overcome and fled. Among the hottest in pursuit was
                    Körner, who was mortally wounded, as he rode through a wood, by a shot from one
                    of the fugitive <hi rend="italic">tirailleurs</hi> who lay hidden there. He was
                    buried with full military honours under an old oak on the road from Lübelow to
                    Dreikrug, by the village of Wöbbelin, where there is now a monument to his
                    memory.</p>
                <p>Körner’s position in the literature of his country is a peculiar one. He was not
                    quite two and twenty when he died, and his works are necessarily but
                    first-fruits—might all be included in the modest title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Knospen</hi> —-^plentiful indeed, and full of promise of flowers to come. His
                    earlier poems were hardly more than graceful and pleasing, and even his popular
                    dramas scarcely entitle him to a nigh place in the literature of his country. It
                    was with the war that Korner ’ s true inspiration came. Had he lived a lifetime,
                    he could never have excelled the productions of those few impassioned weeks; but
                    the homage which all Germany paid, and still pays, to the young poet’s memory is
                    due, not to his lyric genius alone, but to his bright youth also, and heroic
                    death. His works have passed through many editions. That published in one
                    volume, with a preface by Karl Streckfuss (Berlin, 1879), includes a sketch of
                    his life, extracts from his letters, a few English translations of his poems,
                    and stanzas to his memory by German and English poets, of which last Felicia
                    Hernans is the chief. There is an indifferent English translation of the life of
                    Körner by his father, with selections from his works, by G. F. Richardson, 2
