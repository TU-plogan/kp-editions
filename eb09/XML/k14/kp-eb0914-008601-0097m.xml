                    Leinster, Ireland, is situated between 52° 50' and 53° 25' N. lat., and between
                    6° 59' and 8° 1' W. long., and is bounded on the N. by Meath and Westmeath, on
                    the W. by Roscommon, Galway, and Tipperary, on the S. by Tipperary and Queen’s
                    county, and on the E. by Kildare. It is oblong in shape, but of very irregular
                    outline. Its greatest breadth from north to south is 39 miles, and its greatest
                    length from east to west 45 miles. The area is 493,019 acres, or about 770
                    square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The greater part of the county is occupied by
                    the limestone strata of the central plain. In the southeast the Slieve Bloom
                    mountains, composed of clay-slate surrounded by sandstone, form the boundary
                    between King’s county and Queen’s county, and run into the former county from
                    south-west to north-east for a distance of about 20 miles, consisting of a mass
                    of lofty and precipitous crags through which there are two narrow passes, the
                    Black Gap and the Gap of Glandine. In the northeast Croghan Hill, a beautiful
                    green eminence consisting of trap conglomerate, rises to the height of over 700
                    feet. The remainder of the county is flat, but a range of low limestone hills
                    crosses its north-eastern division to the north of the Barrow. In the centre of
                    the county from east to west a large portion is occupied by the Bog of Allen.
                    Along the Slieve Bloom mountains iron is found in small <pb break="no"

                    potter’s clay. Excellent clay-slate flags are quarried. In several places there
                    are bands of foliated limestone, of a greenish hue and granular in texture,
                    which fojms a very useful manure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers,—</hi> The county shares in the advantage of the
                    navigation of the Shannon, which skirts its western side and forms its boundary
                    line with Roscommon and Galway. The Brosna, which issues from Loch Ennell in
                    West Meath, enters the county near the town of Clara, and flowing
                    south-westwards across its north-west corner, discharges itself into the Shannon
                    after receiving the Clodagh and the Broughill. A small portion of the
                    north-eastern extremity is skirted by the Boyne. The Barrow forms the
                    south-eastern boundary with Queen’s county. The Little Brosna, which rises in
                    the Slieve Bloom mountains, forms the boundary of King’s county with Tipperary,
                    and falls into the Shannon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate, Soil, and Agriculture.—</hi> Notwithstanding the large
                    area occupied by bogs, the climate is generally salubrious, and it is less moist
                    than that of several neighbouring districts. The soil naturally is not of great
                    fertility except in special cases, but is capable of being rendered so by the
                    judicious application of bog and lime manures according to its special defects.
                    It is generally either a deep bog or a shallow gravelly loam. On the former soil
                    corn crops are late in ripening during wet seasons, which on the other hand are
                    specially suitable for the gravelly soils. On the borders of the Slieve Bloom
                    mountains there are some very rich and fertile pastures, and there are also
                    extensive grazing districts on the borders of West Meath, which are chiefly
                    occupied by sheep. Along the banks of the Shannon there are some fine tracts of
                    meadow land. With the exception of the tract occupied by the Bog of Allen, the
                    remainder of the county is nearly all under tillage, the most productive portion
                    being that to the north-west of the Hill of Croghan.</p>

                <p>The total area under crops in 1881 was 119,751 acres—24 ’ 2 per cent, of the
                    total acreage of the county. In 1880 238,(&gt;67 acres (48 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4 per cent.) were under grass, 424 fallow, 8551
                    woods, 108,773 (the large percentage of 22 ’ 1) bog, 6043 mountain, and 16,327
                    water, roads, and fences. The area under corps in 1850 was 138,538 acres, or
                    24,314 more than in 1880 and 18,787 more than in 1881. The area under cereals
                    declined between 1850 and 1881 from 70,668 to 40,263, that under wheat
                    decreasing from 20,410 to only 1436, that under oats from 38,787 to 23,082; but
                    that under other cereals, of which nearly the whole acreage is under barley,
                    increased from 11,471 to 15,745. Between 1851 and 1880 the area under grass
                    increased by 46,427 acres, a change due in a considerable degree to reclamation.
                    The area under meadow and clover only increased from 40,348 to 44,765 acres. The
                    area under green crops between 1851 and 1881 diminished from 30,561 to 29,178
                    acres, that under potatoes diminishing from 17,907 to 15,762, while that under
                    turnips increased from 9418 to 9863. Anciently nearly the whole of the county
                    was covered by a vast forest, and on the borders of Tipperary it is still richly
                    wooded.</p>
                <p>Horses, which are a much better breed than the average of Ireland, increased from
                    12,990 in 1850 to 13,505 in 1881. The number in 1881 used for agricultural
                    purposes was 8889. Mules increased from 817 to 1209, and asses from 4212 to
                    6221. Cattle in 1850 numbered 47,978, and in 1881 had increased to 68,165. Cows
                    in 1881 numbered 14,749. Dairies are numerous in the northern part of the county
                    on the borders of Meath, but in other districts cattlefeeding is more largely
                    prosecuted than dairy farming. Sheep, which are pastured chiefly on the hilly
                    districts, and have been much improved by crossing, in 1850 numbered 68,552, and
                    in 1880 had increased to 97,570. Goats since 1850 have declined in numbers from
                    4032 to 3910. Pigs have increased from 15,450 to 20,526, and poultry from
                    158,154 to 271,873.</p>
                <p>According to the corrected summary for 1878 of the landowners return, the laud in
                    1873 was divided among 1140 owners, of whom 353, or 31 per cent., possessed less
                    than 1 acre. The annual rateable valuation was £243,204, giving an average value
                    per acre of 9s. lid. Forty-six proprietors possessed more than 2000 acres,
                    thirteen had upwards of 5000 acres, and five upwards of 10,000 acres, viz., Lord
                    Digby, 29,722; Earl of Rosse, 22,513; Earl of Charlevillβ, 20,632; Marquis of
                    Downshire, 13,679; and Coh T. Bernard, 13,153.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways, &lt;kc.—</hi> A branch of the Great South-Western
                    Railway traverses the county by Portarlington, Clara, and Banagher, and there is
                    also a branch of the same line from Roscrea to Parsonstown. The Grand Canal
                    traverses the county from Edenderry in the east to the Shannon in the west.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The county comprises twelve baronies,
                    forty-two civil parishes and nine parts of parishes, and 1160 townlands. It
                    contains portions of five poor-law unions, viz., Edenderry, Mountmellick,
                    Parsonstown, Roscrea, and Tullamore. The county includes part of the
                    parliamentary borough of Portarlington (the remainder being in Queen’s county),
                    and two townships, Parsonstown and Tullamore. Assizes are held at Tullamore and
                    quartersessions at Parsonstown, Philipstown, and Tullamore. King’s county is in
                    the Dublin military district, and there are barrack stations at Parsonstown,
                    Banagher, Philipstown, Shannon Bridge, and Tullamore. Previous to the Union,
                    King’s county returned six members to parliament, two for the county, and two
                    for each of the boroughs, of Philipstown and Banagher, but since then only the
                    two county members have been returned.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.</hi> —The total population of the county in 1659
                    was 8310, of whom 7085 were Irish and 1225 English. The estimate of De Burgo in
                    1760 made it 45,618. In 1821 it had increased to 131,088 and in 1841 to 147,551,
                    but in 1851 it had diminished to 112,798, in 1871 to 75,900, and in 1881 to
                    72,668, of whom 36,942 were males and 35,726 were females. The number of
                    emigrants from 1st May 1851 to 31st December 1880 was 41,798, or 46 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 4 per cent, of the population in 1861, 21,437 being
                    males and 20,361 females. The marriage rate in 1880 to every 1000 of the
                    estimated population was 3 ’ 9, the birth rate 23 ’ 5, and the death rate 18’2.
                    In 1881 the Roman Catholics numbered 64,984, the Protestant Episcopalians 6750,
                    the Presbyterians 285, the Methodists 421, and all other denominations 228. The
                    number of natives of England and Wales in the county in 1841 was 293, which had
                    increased in 1871 to 1087; the natives of Scotland in the same years were 109
                    and 203. The number in 1871 who could speak Irish and English was 245, and in
                    1861 it was 396. In 1871 there were 34,360 persons who could read and write,
                    13,157 who could read but could not write, and 28,383 who could neither read nor
                    write.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> King’s county, with portions of Tipperary,
                    Queen’s county, and Kildare, at an early period formed one kingdom under the
                    name of Hy Fa!gia or Offalia, a title which it retained after the landing of the
                    English. Subsequently it was known as. Glenmallery, Western Glennιallery pretty
                    nearly corresponding to the present King’s county, and Eastern Glenmallery to
                    Queen’s-county. The principal septs of the district were the O’Connors and the
                    O’Carrolls, whose estates and those of the other leading families were forfeited
                    about the middle of the 16th century. By a statute of 1557 the western district
                    was constituted a shire under the name of King’s county in honour of Philip—the
                    principal town, formerly the seat of the O’Connors, being called Philipstown;
                    and the eastern district at the same time received the name of Queen’s county in
                    honour of Mary. The subjugation of King’s county was, however, not completely
                    accomplished till about the beginning of the 17th century, when the O’Connors
                    and their followers were totally routed and dispersed by Sir Oliver Lambert.
                    After the Cromwellian wars a large number of estates were forfeited on account
                    of the insurrectionary action taken by the leading gentry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities.—</hi> Perhaps the oldest antiquarian relic is the
                    large pyramid of white stones in the Slieve Bloom mountains called the Temple of
                    the Sun or the White Obelisk. There are a considerable number of Danish raths,
                    and a chain of moats commanding the passes of the bogs extended throughout the
                    county. The most important ecclesiastical ruins are tkose of the seven churches
                    of Clonmacnoise on the Shannon in the north-west of the county, where an abbey
                    was founded by St Kieran in 548. Afterwards it was formed into a see, which was
                    united with that of Meath in 1568. Within the old walls there are several small
                    chapels erected over the graves of ancient chieftains, and also one or two
                    richly ornamented crosses. Adjoining the ecclesiastical ruins are the remains of
                    round towers and of an old castle. Amongst the more famous religious houses in
                    addition to Clonmacnoise were Durrow Abbey, founded by St Columba in 550;
                    Monasteroris, founded in the 14th century by John Bermingham, earl of Louth; and
                    Seirkyran Abbey, founded in the beginning of the 5th century. The principal old
                    castles are Rathmore, probably the most ancient in the county; Banagher,
                    commanding an important pass on the Shannon; Leap Castle, in the Slieve Bloom
                    mountains; and Birr or Parsonstown, now the seat of the earl of Rosse, whose
                    father erected there the well-known great telescope.</p>
