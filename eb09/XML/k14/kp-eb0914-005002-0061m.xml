                    of Munster, between 51° 41' and 52° 23' N. lat., and between 9° 7' and 10° 30'
                    W. long., bounded on the W. by the Atlantic Ocean, N. by the estuary of the
                    Shannon, which separates it from Clare, E. by Limerick and Cork, and S.E. by
                    Cork. Its greatest length from north to south is 60 miles, and its greatest
                    breadth from east to west 58 miles. The area comprises 1,159,358 acres, or 1811
                    square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> Kerry, with its combination of mountain, sea,
                    and plain, possesses some of the finest scenery of the British Islands. The
                    portion of the county south of Dingle Bay consists of mountain masses
                    intersected by valleys formed by narrow bands of carboniferous rocks. These
                    masses are composed chiefly of red and green sandstones, grits, and slates, with
                    beds of conglomerate in which are sometimes found pebbles of bright red jasper.
                    The formation is almost entirely unfossiliferous, but on the Geological Survey
                    maps it is marked as Old Red Sandstone. At one time the mountains were covered
                    by a great forest of fir, birch, and yew, which was nearly all cut down to be
                    made use of in smelting iron, and the constant pasturage of cattle prevents the
                    growth of young trees. In the north-east, towards Killarney, the formation rises
                    abruptly from the Carboniferous Limestone rocks into the rugged range of
                    Macgillicuddy’s Reeks, the highest summit of which, Carntual, has a height of
                    3414 feet. The next highest summit to Carntual is Caper, 3200 feet, and several
                    others are over 2500 feet. Lying between the precipitous sides of the Tomies,
                    the Purple Mountains, and the Reeks is the famous gap of Dunloe. A small portion
                    of country at the south-west of the Dingle promontory is occupied by Upper
                    Silurian strata, which in the middle of the promontory are covered by vast
                    strata of grits, slates, and sandstones known as the Dingle beds, but of unknown
                    age. This formation attains at Brandon Hill a height of 3127 feet. Resting
                    unconformably on these beds are the Old Red Sandstone strata which occupy the
                    remainder of the promontory and also a small tract of country at Kerry Head. The
                    remainder of Kerry is occupied by the Coal-measures which are separated from the
                    mountain masses of Old Red Sandstone by a narrow and irregular band of
                    Carboniferous Limestone or Carboniferous Slate, which abounds in fossils. The
                    Coal-measures, which rest conformably on the Carboniferous Limestone, form a
                    succession of undulating hills rising sometimes to a height of over 1000 feet.
                    All the three measures of coal are represented, but the seams of coal are very
                    thin, and the workable portions are outside the limits of the county. In the
                    upper part of the Kenmare valley <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n62/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0062-0051"/> some copper veins occur in the Old Red Sandstone,
                    but they are workable only when they enter the limestone. Silver with zinc and
                    lead with zinc are found in a few places. In the coal formation there are some
                    veins both of iron and lead. The Valentia flags and slates are largely exported
                    to England. Amethysts were at one time obtained near Kerry Head.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coast Line. —</hi> The sea-coast, which for the most part is
                    wild and mountainous, is much indented by inlets, the largest of which, Tralee
                    Bay, Dingle Bay, and Kenmare River, lie in synclinal troughs, the anticlinal
                    folds of the rocks forming extensive promontories. Between Kenmare River and
                    Dingle Bay the land is separated by mountain ridges into three valleys. The
                    extremity of the peninsula between Dingle Bay and Tralee Bay is very
                    precipitous, and Mount Brandon, rising abruptly from the ocean, is skirted at
                    its base by a road from which magnificent views are obtained. From near the
                    village of Ballybunion to Kilconey Point near the Shannon there is a remarkable
                    succession of caves, which have evidently been excavated by the sea. The
                    principal islands are the picturesque Skelligs, Valentia Island, and the
                    Blasquet Islands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Divers and Lakes.—</hi> The principal rivers are the
                    Blackwater, which, rising in the Dunkerran mountains, forms for a few miles the
                    boundary line between Kerry and Cork, and falls into the Kenmare River; the
                    Ruaughty, which with a course resembling the arc of a circle falls into the head
                    of the Kenmare River; the Inny and Ferta, which flow westward, the one into
                    Ballinskellig Bay and the other into Valentia Harbour; the Flesk, which flows
                    northward through the lower lake of Killarney, after which it takes the name of
                    the Laune, and flows north-westward to Dingle Bay; the Cara, which rises in the
                    mountains of Dunkerran, and after forming several lakes falls into Castlemaine
                    Harbour; the Maine,, which flows from Castle Island southwestwards to the sea at
                    Castlemaine Harbour, receiving in its course the northern Flesk, which rises in
                    the mountains that divide Cork from Kerry; and the Feale, Gale, and Brick, the
                    junction of which forms the Cashin, a short tidal river which flows into the
                    estuary of the Shannon. The lakes of Kerry are not numerous, and none of them
                    are of great size, but those of Killarney form one of the most important
                    features in the striking and picturesque mountain scenery amidst which they are
                    situated. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Killarney.)</hi> The other principal lakes
                    in the county are Lough Currane near Ballinskellig, and Lough Cara near
                    Castlemaine Harbour. Near the summit of Manger ton Mountain an accumulation of
                    water in a deep hollow forms what is known as the Devil’s Punchbowl, the surplus
                    water, after making a succession of cataracts, flowing into Lough Kittane at the
                    foot of the mountain. There are chalybeate mineral springs near Killarney, near
                    Valentia Island, and near the mouth of the Inny; sulphurous chalybeate springs
                    near Dingle, Castlemaine, and Tralee; and a saline spring at Magherybeg in
                    Corkaguiney, which bursts out of clear white sand a little below high water
                    mark.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">CUmαtβ and Agriculture.—</hi> Owing to the vicinity of the sea
                    and the height of the mountains, the climate is very moist and unsuitable for
                    the growth of cereals, but it is so mild even in winter that the pasturage on
                    the mountains retains perpetual greenness. Arbutus and other trees indigenous to
                    warm climates grow in the open air, and several flowering plants are found which
                    are unknown in England. In the northern parts of the county the land is
                    generally coarse and poor, except in the valleys, where a rich soil has been
                    formed by rocky deposits. In the Old Red Sandstone valleys there are many very
                    fertile regions, and several extensive districts now covered by bog admit of
                    easy reclamation so as to form very fruitful soil, but other tracts of boggy
                    land scarcely promise a profitable return for labour expended on their
                    reclamation. The lower slopes of the mountains afford a very rich pasturage for
                    cattle even in winter, while large flocks of sheep and goats graze on the upper
                    ridges.</p>
                <p>According to the classified summary of owners for 1876 there were no fewer than
                    twenty-eight proprietors who possessed upwards of 10,000 acres, and ten
                    possessed upwards of 20,000 acres, viz., Francis C. Bland, 25,576; Sir Edward
                    Denny, Baronet, 21,479; Robert Drummond, 29,780; Edward Bouchier Hartopp,
                    24,222; Henry A. Herbert, 47,238; earl of Kenmare, 91,080; marquis of Lansdowne,
                    94,983; earl of Listowel, 25,964; Richard Mahoney, 26,173; Lord Ventry, 93,629.
                    Altogether the number of owners was 1116, possessing 1,153,373 acres, at an
                    annual valuation of £283,198. Of the owners 637, or 57 per cent., possessed less
                    than 1 acre, the total possessed by these owners being only 172 acres. The
                    average annual valuation was 4s. 10d. per acre.</p>

                <p>In some of the larger farms the best modern systems of agriculture are practised,
                    but especially on the small farms the primitive form of lazy-bed culture is that
                    almost wholly in use, with alternate crops of oats and potatoes. The total area
                    under crops in 1881 was 165,568 acres, 14‘2 per cent, of the acreage of the
                    county. In 1880 there were 586,600 acres (50 6 per cent.) under grass, 18,348
                    were woods, 105,884 bogs, 248,808 mountain, and 39,392 water, roads, and fences.
                    There has been an increase in the area under crops since 1850 of 16,694 acres,
                    but this is wholly due to an increase of 37,906 in the area under meadow and
                    clover, which in 1881 was 90,068, while between 1851 and 1880 the area under
                    grass increased by 133,489, or more than a fourth. The area under cereals in
                    1881 was 33,169 acres, a decline of 18,849, or more than a third since 1850,
                    wheat declining from 4502 to 1032, and oats from 30,190 to 27,533. Between 1850
                    and 1880 the diminution has been very slight in the area under green crop, from
                    43,129 acres to 41,968, that under potatoes increasing from 30,963 to 31,179,
                    but that under turnips declining from 10,434 to 5723. Flax occupied 300 acres in
                    1850, and only 39 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Horses have increased from 13,129 in 1850 to 15,367 in 1881. The number of horses
                    used for agricultural purposes in 1881 was 11,159. Mules between 1850 and 1881
                    increased from 1871 to 2311, while asses increased from 3417 io 8765. Cattle in
                    1850 numbered 147,748, and in 1881 had increased to 209,733. Cows numbered
                    104,971, dairy farming being very largely followed. The Kerry breed of
                    cattle—small finely-shaped animals, black or red in colour, with small upturned
                    horns—are famed for the quality both of their flesh and milk, and are now in
                    considerable demand for the parks surrounding mansion houses. The “dexter,” a
                    cross between the Kerry and an unknown breed, is larger but without its fine
                    qualities. Sheep between 1850 and 1871 had risen from 59,931 to 129,618, but in
                    1881 they had declined to 82,929. Little regard is paid to the breed, but those
                    in most common use have been crossed with a merino breed from Spain. Goats,
                    which share with sheep the sweet pasturage of the higher mountain ridges, have
                    increased between 1850and 1881 from 17,382 to 23,442. Pigs since 1850 have
                    increased from 36,246 to 45,630. Poultry have more than doubled in numbers,
                    increasing from 183,115 to 485,076.</p>

                    from the wild and mountainous character of a great part of Kerry, foxes are
                    numerous, and otters and badgers are not uncommon. The alpine hare is very
                    abundant. The red deer inhabits the mountains round Killarney. The golden eagle
                    was at one time frequently seen in the higher mountain regions, but is now
                    rarely met with. The sea eagle haunts the lofty marine cliffs, the mountains,
                    and the rocky islets. The osprey is occasionally seen, and also the peregrine
                    falcon. The merlin is common. The common owl is indigenous, the long-eared owl
                    resident, and the short-eared owl a regular winter visitor. Rock pigeons breed
                    on the sea-cliffs, and the turtle dove is an occasional visitant. The common
                    quail is becoming rare. The great grey seal is found in Brandon and Dingle
                    Bays.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Αfanufactures.—</hi> At thebeginning of the century there was a
                    considerable linen trade in Kerry, but this is now nearly extinct, the chief
                    manufacture being that of coarse woollens and linens for home use. At Killarney
                    a variety of articles are made from the wood of the arbutus. A considerable
                    trade in agricultural produce is carried on at Tralee, Dingle, and Kenmare, and
                    in slate and stone at Valentia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fisheries.—</hi> The number of vessels engaged in the deep sea
                    and coast fisheries is about 600, employing about 2500 men and boys. From the
                    passing of the Act 37 and 38 Viet, up to 31st December 1880 the total amount of
                    money advanced on loan fur fishery purposes in Kerry has been £10,872, and upto
                    the same date the repayments have amounted to £6879. The loans during the year
                    1880 amounted to £2146. The sum advanced for Kerry fisheries is more than
                    one-third of the whole sum advanced for Ireland. Perhaps on no part of the coast
                    are the fishing localities so nume-roιιs<pb break="no"

                    nets, although the stations of Dingle and Kenmare are prosperous and well
                    provided. Fine salmon are obtained in the rivers and in some of the larger
                    lakes. The shellfish are large and abundant.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The county comprises nine baronies, and
                    contains eighty-five civil parishes and two parts of parishes, and 2682
                    townlands. There are six poor-law unions wholly within the county, viz.,
                    Cahirciveen, Dingle, Kenmare, Killarney, Listowel, and Tralee, and part of one,
                    namely Glin, the remaining portion being in Limerick. The county includes one
                    parliamentary borough, Tralee, which in 1881 had a population of 9664, the
                    township of Killarney, and the towns of Dingle and Listowel. There are in the
                    county twenty-four petty sessions districts and one part of a petty sessions
                    district. Assizes are held at Tralee, and quarter sessions are held in the towns
                    of Dingle, Kenmare, Killarney, Listowel, and Tralee. The county is within the
                    Cork military district, and there is a barrack station at Tralee. The
                    headquarters of the constabulary force is at Tralee, and subinspectors are
                    stationed at Cahirciveen, Dingle, Kenmare, Killarney, and Listowel. Previous to
                    the Union the county returned eight members to parliament, two for the county,
                    and two for each of the boroughs of Tralee, Dingle, and Ardfert. At the Union
                    the number was reduced to three, two for the county and one for the borough of
                    Tralee.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> At the census of 1659 the population of Kerry
                    was 8390, of whom 7824 were Irish and 566 English. De Burgo estimates it at
                    56,628 in 1760, and the census of 1821 gives it as 216,185. In 1841 it had
                    increased to 294,095, but in 1851 had diminished to 238,619, in 1861 to 201,800,
                    and in 1871 to 196,586. The increase to 200,448 in 1881, notwithstanding that
                    Kerry has suffered severely from agricultural distress, is sufficiently
                    accounted for by an increase in the number of the smaller class of holdings. The
                    number of males in 1881 was 100,715, and of females 99,733. The annual rate of
                    marriages in 1880 to every 1000 of estimated population was 2 <hi

                    -</hi> 4. The total number who emigrated from 1st May 1851 to 31st December 1880
                    was 121,826. The number of persons not of Irish birth in Kerry at the census of
                    1841 was 615, and in 1871 it was 1194. The number in 1871 who could speak Irish
                    only was 1209, and the number who could speak Irish and English 69,959. The
                    number of Roman Catholics in 1881 was 193,917, of Protestant Episcopalians 5767,
                    of Presbyterians 224, of Methodists 271, and of all other persuasions 264.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi> — The county is said to have derived its name
                    from Ciar, who, along with his tribe the <hi rend="italic">Ciarraidhe,</hi> is
                    stated to have inhabited about the beginniug of the present era the territory
                    lying between Tralee and the Shannon. That portion lying south of the Maine was
                    at a later period included in the kingdom of Desmond. Kerry suffered frequently
                    from invasions of the Danes in the 9th and 10th centuries, until they were
                    finally overthrown at the battle of Clontarf in 1014. In 1172 Dermot MacCarthy,
                    king of Cork and Desmond, made submission to Henry II. on certain conditions,
                    but was nevertheless gradually compelled to retire within the limits of Kerry,
                    which was made shire ground in 1210. An English adventurer Raymond le Gros
                    received from this MacCarthy a large portion of the county round Lixnaw. Thomas,
                    grandson of Raymond, and king’s sheriff in the counties of Cork, Waterford, and
                    Kerry, was in 1295 made lord chief-justice of Ireland. Of his two sons John the
                    eldest was created earl of Kildare, and Maurice in 1329 became earl of Desmond,
                    and with certain exceptions received all the royal liberties which the king had
                    in the county of Kerry. After the attainder of Thomas, earl of Desmond, in 1467,
                    his kinsmen took up arms against the English, until at last the king was glad to
                    guarantee the earl’s elder son the full possession of his father’s privileges.
                    In consequence, however, of the rebellion of Gerald the sixteenth earl, the
                    estates of the Desmonds, 574,628 acres in extent, were in 1583 forfeited to the
                    crown, and parcelled into manors and seignories of 12,000, 8000, 6000, and 4000
                    acres, which were divided among English noblemen and gentlemen. The Irish took
                    advantage of the disturbed state of England at the time of the: Puritan
                    revolution to attempt the overthrow of the English rule in Kerry, and ultimately
                    obtained possession of Tralee, but in 1652 the rebellion was completely subdued,
                    and a large number of estates were afterwards confiscated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities.—</hi> There are remains of a round tower at
                    Aghadoe near Killarney, another, a small cell at Lough Curτane, and a third, one
                    of the finest and most perfect specimens of the round tower in Ireland, at
                    Rattoo, not far from Ballybunion. On the summit of a hill to the north of
                    Kenmare River is the remarkable stone fortress known as Staigue Fort. There are
                    several stone cells in the principal Skellig island, where at one time there
                    were monastic remains which have now been swept away by the sea. The principal
                    groups of sepulchral stones are those on the summits of the Tomie mountains, a
                    remarkable stone fort at Cahirciveen, a circle of stones with cromlech in the
                    parish of Tuosist, and others with inscriptions near Dingle. The most notable
                    monastic ruins are those of Innisfallen, founded by St Finian, a disciple of St
                    Columba, and the fine remains of Muckross Abbey, founded by the Franciscans, but
                    there are also monastic remains at Ardfert, Castlemaine, Derrynane, Kilcoleman,
                    Lislaghtin, and 0’Domey. Among old ruined churches of interest may be mentioned
                    those of Aghadoe, Kilcrohane, Lough Currane, Derrynane, Kilmakilloge, and
                    Muckross. The cathedral of Ardfert, founded probably in 1253, was partly
                    destroyed during the Cromwellian wars, but was restored in 1831. Some
                    interesting portions of the old building still remain. There are a large number
                    of old feudal castles.</p>
