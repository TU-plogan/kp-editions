                    Angelica</hi></label> (1740-1807). This once popular artist and Royal
                    Academician was born at Coire in the Grisons, October 30, 1740 or 1741. Her
                    baptismιl nιme was Maria-Anne-Angelica-Catharine. Her father, John Joseph
                    Kauffmann, was a poor man and mediocre painter, but apparently very successful
                    in teaching his precocious daughter. She rapidly acquired several languages,
                    read incessantly, and showed marked talents as a musicim. Her greatest progress,
                    however, was in painting; and in her twelfth year she had become a notability,
                    with bishops and nobles for her sitters. In 1754 her father took her to Milan,
                    where she diligently studied the great masters. Later visits to Italy of long
                    duration appear to have succeeded this excursion, and in 1763 she visited Rome,
                    returning to it again in 1764. From Rome she passed to Bologna and Venice, being
                    everywhere fêted and caressed, as much for her talents as for her personal
                    charms. Writing from Rome in August 1764 t » his friend Franke, Winckelmann
                    refers to her exceptional popul ιrity. She was then painting his picture, a half
                    length, of which she also made an etching. She spoke Italian as well as German,
                    he says; and she also expressed herself with facility in French and English,—
                    one result of the last-named accomplishment being that she painted all the
                    English visitors to the Eternal City. “She may be styled beautiful,” he adds,
                    “and in singing may vie with our best virtuosi.” While at Venice, she was
                    induced by Lady Wentworth, the wife of the English ambassador, to accompany her
                    to London, where she appeared in 1765. One of her first works was a portrait of
                    Garrick, exhibited in the year of her arrival at “Mr Moreing’s great room in
                    Maiden Lane.” The rank of Lady Wentworth opened society to her, and she was
                    everywhere well received, the royal family especially showing her great
                    favour.</p>
                <p>Her firmest friend, however, was Reynolds. In his pocket-book her name as “Miss
                    Angelica” or “Miss Angel” appears frequently, and in 1766 he painted her, a
                    compliment which she returned by the Portrait of Sir Joshua Reynolds, aetat. 46,
                    which was exhibited by Lord Morley at the “Old Masters” in 1876. Another
                    instance of her intimacy with Reynolds is to be found in the variation of
                    Guercino’s “Et in Arcadia ego” produced by her at this date, a subject which
                    Reynolds repeated a few years later in his portrait of Mrs Bouverie and Mrs
                    Crewe. When, in 1768 or thereabouts, she was entrapped into a marriage with an
                    adventurer who passed for a Swedish count, Reynolds befriended her, and it was
                    doubtless owing to his good offices that her name is found among the signitaries
                    to the famous petition to the king for the establishment of the Royal Academy.
                    In its first catalogue of 1769 she appears with “R.A.” after her name (an honour
                    which she shared with another lady and compatriot, Mary Moser); and she
                    contributed the Interview of Hector and Andromache, and three other classical
                    compositions. From this time until 1782 she was an annual exhibitor, sending
                    sometimes as many as seven pictures, generally classic or allegorical subjects.
                    One of the most notable of her performances was the Leonardo expiring in the
                    Arms of Francis the First, which belongs to the year 1778. In 1773 she was
                    appointed by the Academy with others to decorate St Paul’s, and it was she who,
                    with Biaggio Rebecca, painted the Academy’s old lecture room at Somerset House.
                    It is probable that her popularity declined a little in consequence of her
                    unfortunate marriage; but after her first husband’s death (she had been long
                    separated from him) she married Antonio Zucchi, a Venetian artist, then resident
                    in England. This was in 1781. Shortly afterwards she retired to Rome, where she
                    lived for twenty-five years with much of her old prestige. In 1782 she lost her
                    father; and in 1795—the year in which she painted the picture of Lady Hamilton
                    now at South Kensington—her husband. She continued at intervals to contribute to
                    the Academy, her last exhibit being in 1797. After this she produced but little,
                    and in November 1807 she died, being honoured by a splendid funeral under the
                    direction of Canova. The entire Academy of St Luke, with numerous ecclesiastics
                    and virtuosi, followed her to her tomb in St Andrea delie Frate, and, as at the
                    burial of Raphael, two of her best pictures were carried in procession.</p>
                <p>Popular as they were during her lifetime, the works of Angelica Kauffman have not
                    retained their reputation. She had a certain gift of grace, and considerable
                    skill in composition. But herdrawing is weak and faulty; her figures lack
                    variety and expression; and her men are masculine women. Her colouring, however,
                    is fairly enough defined by Waagen’s term “cheerful.” Booms decorated by her
                    brush are still to be seen in various quarters. At Hampton Court is a portrait
                    of the duchess of Brunswick; in the National Gallery an allegorical composition
                    of Religion attended by the Virtues. There are other pictures by her at Paris,
                    at Dresden, in the Hermitage at St Petersburg, and in the Pinakothek at Munich.
                    The Munich example is a portrait of herself; there is a second in the Uffizi at
                    Florence, and a third in the National Portrait Gallery, South Kensington. A few
                    of her works in private collections have also been exhibited among the “Old
                    Masters” at Burlington House. But she is perhaps best known by the numerous
                    engravings from her designs by Schiavonetti, Bartolozzi, and others. Those by
                    Bartolozzi especially still find considerable favour with collectors. Her life
                    was written in 1810 by Giovanni de Rossi. It has also been used as the basis of
                    a romance by Léon de Wailly, 1838; and it prompted the charming novelette
                    contributed by Mrs Richmond Ritchie to the <hi rend="italic">Comhill
                    Magazine</hi> in 1875 under the title of “Miss Angel.” (A. D.)</p>
