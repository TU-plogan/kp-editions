                    surrounded by those of Vologda, Vyatka, Nijni-Novgorod, Vladimir, and Yaroslav,
                    lies mostly on the left bank of the upper Volga, and has an estimated area of
                    32,700 square miles. Its surface is generally undulating, with hilly tracts on
                    the right bank of the Volga, and extensive flat and marshy districts in its
                    eastern parts. The rocks belong chiefly to the Permian system, a small tract
                    being occupied by representatives of the Jurassic, and both being deeply covered
                    with Quaternary clays. The soil in the east is for the most part sand or a sandy
                    clay; a few patches are covered with fertile black earth. Immense forests,
                    yielding excellent timber for shipbuilding, and in many cases still untouched,
                    occupy no less than 70 per cent, of the surface of the government (13,230,000
                    acres in 1870). The export of timber is greatly facilitated by a series of
                    navigable tributaries of the Volga, such as the Kostroma, Unzha, Neya, and
                    Vyksa, and many others of less importance. The climate is severe; frosts of -
                    22° Fahr, are common in January, and the mean temperature of the year is but
                    3°∙1 (summer, 64° ’ 5; winter, - 13° ’ 3). The population, which numbered
                    1,176,000 in 1870, is Russian, with some Meryas,—the indigenes of this part of
                    Russia,— Tcheremisses, and Tartars. Agriculture is in a low state of
                    development; only 4,000,000 acres are under crops, with a return (1,415,000
                    quarters of corn in 1877) unequal to the wants of the population. Flax is
                    cultivated to some extent, and exported. Stock-breeding has steadily decreased
                    since 1861; in 1870 there were only 394,500 homed cattle (against 420,000 in
                    1857), and the number has since much decreased. Bee keeping is an important
                    branch of industry in some districts. The chief articles of commerce are timber,
                    fuel, pitch, tar, mushrooms (yearly value upwards of £5000), and various kinds
                    of wooden wares for building and household purposes, which are largely
                    manufactured by the peasantry in villages, and exported to the steppe provinces
                    of the lower Volga and Don. Boat-building for river traffic is also carried on.
                    Some other small industries, such as the manufacture of silver and copper wares,
                    leather wares, &amp;c., are also prosecuted in the villages; but the trade in
                    linen and towelling, formerly the staple, is now declining. There are now
                    several cotton factories, spinning mills, and engineering and chemical works.
                    The government of Kostroma is divided into twelve districts :—Kostroma,
                    Nerekhta, Kineshma, Makarieff, Yurievets, Galitch, Tchukhloma, Soligalitch,
                    Boui, Kologriv, Vetluga, and Varnavin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Kostroma,</hi> a town of Russia, capital of the government
                    of the same name, 230 miles north-east of Moscow and 55 miles from Yaroslav, It
                    is situated on the left bank of the Volga, at the mouth of the navigable
                    Kostroma river, with suburbs on the opposite side of the Volga. It is one of the
                    oldest towns of Russia, having been founded by Youri Dolgorouky in 1152. Its
                    fort was often the refuge of the great princes of Moscow during war, but the
                    town was plundered more than once by Tartars. The cathedral, built in the 13th
                    century, and situated in the <hi rend="italic">Kreml,</hi> or former citadel, is
                    a fine monument of old Russian architecture. Kostroma has been renowned since
                    the 16 th century for its linen, which was exported to Holland, and the
                    manufacture of linen and linen-yarn is still carried to some extent, flax being
                    purchased in the governments of Kostroma and of Pskoff. There are also in the
                    town and in its province several important cotton-mills, tanneries, saw-mills,
                    an iron-foundry, and a machine factory. Owing to its situation on the Volga, and
                    at the mouth of a navigable river, Kostroma carries on an active trade—importing
                    grain and exporting linen, linen-yarn, leather, and especially timber and wooden
                    wares. Population, 30,000.</p>
