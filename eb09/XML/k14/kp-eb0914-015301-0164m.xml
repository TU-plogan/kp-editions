                <p><label type="entry">KUKA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Kükawa</hi></label>, the
                    capital of the kingdom of Bornu in Central Africa, is situated in 12° 55' N.
                    lat. and 13 25 E. long.,.4⅛ miles from the western shores of Lake Tsad or
                    Chad,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The fear lest the
                    town should be submerged by the lake led the sheikh to found (1873) a new
                    residence (Kherwa) on a range of sand hills about two hours north of
                    Kuka.</p></note> in the midst of an extensive and for the most part uncultivated
                    plain. The soil of the whole district consists of a layer of sand resting on
                    clay, beneath which are found sand and lime. At a depth of 40 or 50 feet water
                    is reached, usually sweet, but sometimes brackish. 1 ’ rom a distance Kuka
                    presents a very dead and monotonous appearance, there being no minarets or lofty
                    buildings of any sort. The walls, built of earth, are about 20 feet in height.
                    There are two distinct towns, separated by more than half a mile. The western
                    town or Billa Futebe is the larger of the two, measuring from west to east about
                    a mile and a half, and rather less from north to south The plan is rectangular,
                    and there is a gate in each of the four sides. From west to east runs the main
                    thoroughfare known as the Dendal, which widens out to the west into the market
                    place. About the middle of the Dendal stands the sheikh’s secondary palace. The
                    eastern town or Bιlla Gedibe is somewhat longer and narrower than the western.
                    The Dendal continues from its western gate till closed at the east end of the
                    town by the great palace of the sheikh, gradually widening out into a large open
                    square. The larger dwelling-houses of Kuka are of mud or earth, with windowless
                    walls and flat roofs; the poorer houses are mere huts of straw or reeds, varying
                    in shape from that of a bell to that of a sugar-loaf. In almost every courtyard
                    there is at least one large shady tree, whose branches are tenanted by storks,
                    herons, or a variety of lesser birds; and the whole place is vocal with song.
                    Kuka is a wealthy town. It always contains a large number of strangers—
                    merchants, pilgrims, and adventurers—attracted even from Mecca, Medina, Morocco,
                    Egypt, Tunis, Tripoli, by the fame of the sheikh’s liberality. The town enjoys
                    the rare advantage of being absolutely free from all taxation of trade or
                    industry. In the Monday market, which is held outside the western gate, there
                    are often more than 10,000 buyers and sellers. It is at once a fair for horses,
                    cattle, camels, and other live stock, a fruit, grain, and vegetable market, a
                    meat market, and a slave market. The currency consists mainly of Maria Theresa
                    dollars and cowries. For the Mohammedans, not only of Bornu but of the
                    neighbouring countries, Kuka serves as a kind of university town. In its streets
                    are to be seen bands of mendicant students, who spend the day in collecting alms
                    from the people, and after supper gather round the fires which they kindle in
                    the public squares, and noisily and mechanically recite the verses of the Koran
                    far into the night. A less cheerful feature of the street life is the unusual
                    number of blind beggars. The population is estimated at 60,000.</p>
                <p>Kuka was founded by Sheikh Mohammed al Amin el Kanen∣i. It received its name from
                    a kuka or monkey bread tree <hi rend="italic">{Adansonia.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >digitata),</hi> which attracted the attention of the settlers as a rare thing
                    in the district. In 1840 the town was laid waste by King Mohammed Sherif of
                    Wadai; and when it was restored by Sheikh Omar he gave it the present double
                    form. It is probably from this feature of the place that the plural <hi
                    rend="italic">Kukawa</hi> has become the ordinary designation of the town in
                    Kano and throughout the Sudan; though the local inhabitants generally use the
                    singular <hi rend="italic">Kuka.</hi> Kuka has been visited by Denham and
                    Clapperton, Beurmann, Vogel, Barth, Rohlfs, and Nachtigal.</p>
