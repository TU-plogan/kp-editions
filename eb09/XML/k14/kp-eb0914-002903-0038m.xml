                    (1751-95), Swedish poet and critic, was born at Floby in West Gothland, December
                    1, 1751. He studied at the university of Âbo, and had already some reputation as
                    a poet when in 1774 he there became a “docent” in aesthetics. Three years after
                    this he removed to Stockholm, where in conjunction with Lenngren he began in
                    1778 the publication of the journal <hi rend="italic">Stockholmsposten,</hi>
                    whose chief contributor he continued to be almost throughout the remainder of

                    was appointed by the king one of its first members. He died at Stockholm after a
                    severe illness of two years, April 20, 1795. Early familiar with the models of
                    the French school of Voltaire, Kellgren did not till late in life awake to a
                    sense of the value of the works of Lessing and Goethe. His strong satiric
                    tendency led him into numerous controversies, the chief that with Thorild,
                    against whom he directed his satire <hi rend="italic">Nytforsok till orimmad
                    vers,</hi> where he sneers at the “raving of Shakespeare” and “the convulsions
                    of Goethe.” His lack of humour detracts from the interest of his polemical
                    writings. His poetical works are partly lyrical partly dramatic, but of the
                    latter only the versification belongs to him, all the rest being due to Gustavus
                    III. The songs interspersed in the four operas which they produced in common,
                    viz., <hi rend="italic">Gustaf Vasa, Gustaf Adolf</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >och</hi><hi rend="italic">Ebba Brahe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Aeneas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">i Kartago,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Drottning Kristina,</hi> are
                    wholly the work of Kellgren. From about the year 1788 a higher and graver
                    feeling pervades Kellgren’s verses, partly owing to his increased knowledge of
                    the newer German and English literature, but probably more directly due to his
                    controversy with Thorild. Of his minor poems written before that date the most
                    important are the charming spring-song <hi rend="italic">Vinterns</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">välde</hi><hi rend="italic">lyktar,</hi> and the satirical <hi
                    rend="italic">Mina l'ojen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Man eger ej snille for det
                    man dr galen.</hi> The best productions of what is called his later period are
                    the satire <hi rend="italic">Ljusets fender,</hi> the comic poem <hi
                    rend="italic">Dumboms lefverne,</hi> the warmly patriotic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kantat d.</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic">jan.</hi> 1789, the ode <hi rend="italic"
                    >Till Kristina,</hi> the fragment <hi rend="italic">Sigwart och Hilma,</hi> and
                    the beautiful song <hi rend="italic">Nya slcaρelsen,</hi> both in thought and
                    form the finest of all his works. Among the lyrics of Kellgren are the choicest
                    fruits of the Gustavian age of Swedish letters. His earlier efforts, indeed,
                    express with great completeness the superficial doubt and pert frivolousness
                    characteristic of his time; but in the works of his riper years he is no mere
                    “poet of pleasure,” as Thorild contemptuously styled him, but a worthy exponent
                    of earnest moral feeling and wide human sympathies in the most felicitous and
                    melodious verse. His <hi rend="italic">Samlade skrifter (f&gt;</hi> vols., 4th
                    ed., Örebro, 1860), revised by himself, were, in accordance with his own
                    direction, published by his friends after his death. His prose works were
                    translated into German by Lappe (Neustrelitz, 1801).</p>
