                    which occupies the fertile oasis stretching in a band of varying width along the
                    left bank of the lower Oxus between Pitniak and the Sea of Aral. The inhabited
                    district, which lies between 4Γ and 43° N. lat., and 59° and 61 30' E. long.,
                    and practically forms the limits of the khanate, is about 200 miles in length
                    and has an average breadth of 25 to 30 miles—an area therefore of some 5000 to
                    6000 square miles.</p>
                <p>This tract of territory is but a meagre relic of the great kingdom which under
                    the name of Chorasmia, Kharezm (Khwârizm), or Urgentch held the keys of the
                    mightiest river in Central Asia, and formed in consequence a precious jewel for
                    rivalry among Eastern potentates from an early period of the world’s history.
                    Great alterations, geographically and politically, have taken place since those
                    times. The Oxus has changed its outlet, and no longer forms a water-way to the
                    Caspian and thence to Europe. A great European power has arisen which has made
                    gradual but important encroachments in Asia, and between this power on the north
                    and the independent Turcoman tribes on the south the authority of the khan of
                    Khiva has been dwarfed and circumscribed within the narrow limits above
                    indicated.</p>
                <p>From the establishment of the Russians on the lower Jaxartes in 1847 dates the
                    decline in power of the khan of Khiva. Prior to that year the khan claimed
                    sovereignty from the Caspian on the west to the confines of Khokand and Bokhara
                    on the east, and from the northern margin of the Ust Urt and the Jaxartes on the
                    north to the mountain range forming the Persian frontier on the south, including
                    Merv. Within these limits his authority was recognized, although towards the
                    extremities this was merely nominal. Since that year the Russians have annexed
                    the country between the lower Jaxartes and Oxus, established the large
                    trans-Caspian military district on the east shore of the Caspian, and conquered
                    the Akhal Tekke country, thereby hemming in the Khivans on all sides. The
                    Russians have, moreover, by imposing a large indemnity (two millions of roubles)
                    for the campaign of 1873, so crippled the finances of the state that the khan,
                    though nominally independent, is in reality a vassal and in a state of complete
                    subjection to his more powerful neighbours. A Russian military force now watches
                    the khanate from Forts Petro-Alexandrovsk and Nukus on the right bank of the
                    Oxus, the former fort being within 35 miles of the capital.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> It would be impossible to trace here, even in
                    the briefest manner, the changes through which Kharezm has passed, under the
                    successive waves of migration and conquest which have swept across the country
                    in ancient and historic times. The present insignificance and the eventual
                    disappearance of the khanate from the map of Turkestan in the near future being
                    intimately connected with the extension eastward of Russia, it will be more
                    profitable to trace its history after its first connexion with that power.</p>
                <p>Russia commenced her relations with Khiva in the 17th century. The warlike
                    Cossacks of the Yaik during their raids across the Caspian learnt of the
                    existence of the rich territory of Khiva, and made an expedition to the chief
                    town, Urgentch, at a time when the khan and his troops were absent. They carried
                    off a large number of women and a rich booty, but were overtaken on their road
                    home by the Khivans and killed to a man. Two subsequent expeditions under
                    Atamans Nechai and Shemai proved equally disastrous to the Cossacks. These three
                    expeditions were simply the raids of freebooters. In 1717, however, Peter the
                    Great, having heard of the presence of auriferous sand in the bed of the Oxus,
                    and desiring also to “open mercantile relations with India through Turan” and to
                    release from slavery some Russian subjects, sent a properly equipped military
                    force to Khiva. The command of the expedition, which consisted of 3300 men and
                    six guns, with three months’ provisions, was entrusted to Prince Bekovitch
                    Tcherkassky. After establishing a fortified base of operations on the east shore
                    of the Caspian, Bekovitch collected his forces at the mouth of the Ural and
                    thence marched across the Ust Urt into Khivan territory. When within 100 miles
                    of the capital he was encountered by the forces of the khan. The battle lasted
                    three days, and ended in victory for the Russian arms. The Khivans, however,
                    induced the victors to break up their force into small detachments in order to
                    facilitate supply, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n74/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0074-0063"/> and then treacherously annihilated them in
                    detail. This disaster did not prevent the Russians from sending embassies from
                    time to time to the khan, but the representations of the envoys did not induce
                    him to desist from enslaving Russian subjects or even to free those already in
                    bondage. The Persian campaign which subsequently followed, the designs in other
                    parts of Central Asia, and the constant embroilment of Russia in European wars
                    caused Khivan affairs to recede temporarily to the background, and it was not
                    until the third decade of the 19th century that the attention of the Muscovite
                    Government was again directed to the khanate. In 1839 a force under General
                    Perovsky, consisting of three and a half battalions, three Cossack regiments,
                    and twenty-two guns, in all 4500 men, with a large train of camels, moved from
                    Orenburg across the Ust Urt to the Khivan frontiers, in order to occupy the
                    khanate, liberate the captives, and open the way for trade. This expedition
                    likewise terminated in disaster. The inaccessibility of Khiva was once more her
                    safeguard. Before the force reached half-way towards its destination it was
                    forced to return, in consequence of the severity of the weather and the loss of
                    life among the men and animals. These expeditions had convinced the Russians
                    that for the effective control of the relations of Khiva a nearer position must
                    be sought. In 1847 they founded the Raim fort at the mouth of the Jaxartes. As
                    this advance deprived the Khivans not only of territory, but of a large number
                    of tax-paying Kirghiz, while the establishment of a fort gave the Russians a
                    base for further operations, a collision became sooner or later inevitable. For
                    the next few years, however, the attention of the Russians was taken up with
                    Khokand, their operations on that side culminating in the capture of Tashkend in
                    1865. Free in this quarter, they directed their thoughts once more to Khiva. In
                    1869 Krasnovodsk on the east shore of the Caspian was founded, and in 1871-72
                    the country leading to Khiva from diferent parts of Russian Turkestan was
                    thoroughly explored and surveyed. In 1873 an expedition to Khiva was carefully
                    organized on a large scale. The forces placed at the disposal of General v.
                    Kaufmann started from three different bases of operation—Krasnovodsk, Orenburg,
                    and Tashkend. The whole force consisted of more than 10,000 men. Khiva was
                    occupied by the Russians almost without opposition. All the territory (35,700
                    square miles, and 110,000 souls) on the right bank of the Oxus was annexed to
                    Russia and formed into the Amu Daria sub-district, while a heavy war indemnity
                    was imposed upon the khanate. The difficult position financially in which the
                    khan is thereby placed has more than once impelled him to beg the Russians to
                    take the country under their administration. Russia, however, prefers the
                    present arrangement of maintaining Khiva semi-independent instead of in complete
                    subjection, for, not only does the collection of the indemnity fall upon the
                    Khivan authorities, but the country shields the Russian possessions on the Oxus
                    from the attacks of the Turcomans, which if made must first come in contact with
                    the intervening territory of Khiva.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Topography.—</hi> The Khivan oasis is indebted for its
                    fertility to the waters of the Oxus, which by means of irrigating canals and
                    ditches penetrate into what was at one time barren steppe. Where this water
                    reaches the land teams with life; where it ends all is death and a waste. The
                    area of sandy desert reclaimed by the Oxus is estimated by the late Major Wood,
                    Madras Engineers, at 1J millions of acres. The soil of the khanate is a
                    tenacious clay of a red and grey colour, more or less impregnated with sand,
                    —the detritus brought down by the river. Black earth is seldom seen; but earth
                    strongly impregnated with salt is frequently found. The oasis is generally
                    level, except some unimportant heights and sand-hills.</p>
                <p>That part of the Oxus which waters the khanate has at Pitniak a north-west
                    direction, and flows within a single bed. Below Kipchak it bends sharply to the
                    west, and, after describing part of a semicircle to Hodjeili and giving off the
                    Laudan, which with the Usboi forms the ancient course of the Oxus, resumes its
                    north-west course to Kungrad. There it takes a north direction, dividing into
                    two branches, the Taldyk and Ulkun, the latter the principal arm, and ultimately
                    disembogues by many channels into the Sea of Aral. The banks of the river are
                    generally low, and in midsummer do not stand more than 6 to 20 feet above the
                    level of the water. The river is in flood three or four times a year, the chief
                    periods being in April and May, when it overflows its banks and does much damage
                    to the canal dams. The average velocity is about 3 miles an hour, but at times
                    of inundation the current becomes much more rapid. The breadth of the river at
                    ordinary times varies from ⅛ to ⅜ mile, but increases to 3 or more miles at
                    inundations. There are no obstacles to navigation in the shape of rapids, but
                    the shifting of the sand banks acts as an impediment. The water of the Oxus is
                    wholesome, although of a yellowish-brown colour, which is due to particles in
                    suspension. These particles are gritty, and unlike the mud of the Nile do not
                    fertilize the ground. The deposit from the water when dried is used by the
                    Khivans to form their dams. In consequence of the large body of matter brought
                    down, the irrigating canals require constant clearing. These canals vary from 20
                    to 150 feet in breadth, and from 10 to 20 feet in depth, and are sometimes as
                    much as 80 miles long. They have a current of about 2 miles an hour, and are
                    mostly navigable by boats. The direction of the canals is west and north-west,
                    from which it may be concluded that the left bank of the river has a natural
                    slope towards the Caspian. By actual measurement it has been found that the fall
                    of the ancient bed is 400 feet from the point near Kipchak where it had its
                    origin to Balkhan Bay in the Caspian,—a distance of 500 miles.</p>
                <p>From the statement of Abulghazi Khan and other proofs there can be little doubt
                    that two hundred and fifty years ago the Oxus flowed into the Caspian through
                    the Usboi, which was connected with the present channel by at any rate three
                    arms—Daudan, Daryalik, and Lauzan or Laudan. The alteration in the course of the
                    river was probably due to the gradual elevation of the land where the old bed
                    passed, from which naturally resulted a diminution in the velocity of the
                    stream, and at the same time a silting of the channel. From this cause the
                    waters of the Oxus found for themselves another outlet. Whether the Russians
                    will be able to carry out their scheme of forcing the Oxus to resume its old
                    course to the Caspian it would be premature to offer an opinion, but the surveys
                    at present are not favourable. The advantages to Russia would be great, as she
                    would have a continuous waterway from the Volga to Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>The khanate has numerous lakes, especially towards the Aral, connected together
                    by affluents and canals. They are usually covered with reeds. Lake Aibugir, once
                    a large inlet of the Aral, is now dry.</p>
                <p>The means of communication in the khanate is by road and by water. The roads are
                    usually narrow, but some are as much as 70 feet wide. In spring and autumn, at
                    the time of inundations, they are in bad order. Internal trade is carried on by
                    camels and by carts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi> The government is an absolute despotism, and,
                    subject to a certain moral control exercised by the proximity of the Russians,
                    is entirely in the hands of the khan. The chief secular officials are (1) the
                    <hi rend="italic">kush-l&gt;egi</hi> or vizier, prime minister; (2) <hi
                    rend="italic">mehter,</hi> chancellor of the exchequer; (3) <hi rend="italic"

                    >ulema</hi> or priests, of whom the nakib is the chief, are subdivided as
                    follows:—(1) <hi rend="italic">kazi kelan</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kazi,</hi>
                    judicial functionaries; (2) <hi rend="italic">alem,</hi> chief of the five

                    rend="italic">dkhοηd.</hi> The acknowledged religion is the Suni form of
                    Mohammedanism. Justice is administered in the mosques and in the private
                    dwellings of the cadis and muftis, but every Khivan subject has the right to
                    prefer his complaint before the governor or even before the khan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Revenue.—</hi> The khan’s revenue is derived from (1) the
                    land-tax, paid in coin by all sedentary Khivan subjects, and in cattle (2∣∙ per
                    cent.) by nomads; (2) a customs due on all incoming and outgoing caravans, and
                    on the sale of cattle—2∣ per cent, <hi rend="italic">ad valorem·,</hi> (3) the
                    rent of crown lauds. The revenue of certain districts is set aside for the
                    support of the relatives of the reigning khan, and of the rest the greater part
                    is exhausted in paying the large indemnity imposed by the Russians after the
                    campaign of 1873.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The inhabitants are partly sedentary and
                    partly nomad. They include Uzbegs, Karakalpaks, Turcomans, Sarts, Kizilbashes,
                    and Arabs—the first three of Mongol origin, the rest of Aryan descent. The
                    Uzbegs come from a Turk stock, and constitute the dominant class. Some few live
                    in towns, but the bulk reside on their farms, where they occupy themselves in
                    agriculture, gardening, silk cultivation, and fishing. Very few engage in trade.
                    They are divided into tribes. The Karakalpaks, or “blackhats,” are supposed to
                    be a clan of Uzbegs. They inhabit the lower part of the Oxus, and are mostly
                    stocκ-breeders; they are divided into tribes, and are nearly all nomadic. The
                    Turcomans are of similar origin to the Uzbegs, and are divided into tribes, of
                    which the chief are the Yomud, Karadashli, Goklen, Ersari, Chaudor, and Imrali.
                    They are all engaged in breeding horses and stock and in agriculture. Some are
                    sedentary, while others migrate to the steppe in summer. The Sarts or Tajiks,
                    who were probably the original inhabitants of the country, live chiefly in the
                    large towns and are engaged in trade or in handicrafts, some in agriculture and
                    silk cultivation. The Kizilbashes are liberated Persian slaves, and are
                    distributed over the khanate, but more particularly inhabit the Tashauz
                    district. Of the Semitic race we find Arabs in small numbers at Shavat. They
                    form the living monuments of the Arab conquest.</p>
                <p>Owing to the absence of any census it is impossible to give more than a very
                    rough estimate of the population of the Khivan oasis. Major Wood, a competent
                    observer, estimated it in 1875 at 300,000 souls, of whom two-thirds are Uzbegs
                    and Tajiks. Liberated Persians and other slaves make up 50,000, while the
                    remainder is composed of sedentary Turcomans who occupy cultivated lands or who
                    nomadize about the western borders of the khanate.</p>
                <p>There is no marked division of the people into castes or classes. A Khivan may be
                    a merchant, an agriculturist, or craftsman as he pleases; he may possess land or
                    other real property, but for this privilege he must fulfil his obligation to the
                    state, pay taxes, and furnish labourers for digging °ξ repairing canals, upon
                    which the life of the oasis may be said to depend. Only the military class, the
                    priesthood, and the khodjas are exempt from the payment of taxes. The khodjas
                    consider themselves descendants of the prophet; they pay no taxes and render no
                    military service, nor do they furnish canal labour. They are derived from the
                    same stock as the khodjas of Turkestan, and according to tradition came to Khiva
                    six hundred years ago. Agriculture, trade, and handicrafts constitute their
                    chief employment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Towns.—</hi> Khivan towns are nothing more than agglomerations
                    of houses without plan or regularity; the streets are so crooked and narrow that
                    two carts can only pass with difficulty or not at all. The towns are usually
                    surrounded by a defensive wall, in a more or less dilapidated state; sometimes
                    there is also a wet ditch. Outside the walls stretches an extensive suburb. Each
                    town contains usually a bazaar, a caravanserai, and one or more medresses
                    (ecclesiastical colleges) and mosques. The population consists of government
                    officials, shopkeepers, mechanics, and a very few agriculturists. There are no
                    villages as we understand the term,—only farmsteads dotted at intervals along
                    the banks of the canals. The security against Turcoman raids which is given to
                    the townspeople by the wall and ditch is replaced in the case of the farming
                    class by small round guard-houses (karachi-khane) constructed along the same
                    canals where the farmsteads are placed.</p>
                <p>The chief towns are Khiva (the present capital and residence of the khan);
                    Khazarasp, spoken of by the Arab geographers as a strong place in the 10th
                    century, a reputation it still maintains; New Urgentch, the chief trading town;
                    Tashauz, another strong place; Gulden, Hazavat, Ilalli, Kipchak, Khanka,
                    Hodjeili, Kungrad, Pitniak, Kunia Urgentch (once the capital, but destroyed
                    first by Jenghiz Khan, and afterwards by Timur), and Kiat, which up to the 15th
                    century was the capital of Kharezm, but is now a place of little importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate is quite continental, but is
                    healthy, and the people are long-lived. The prevailing ailments are small-pox,
                    inflammation of the eyes, and ague. Cholera is a rare visitant. Winter begins in
                    November and lasts until February. At this season the thermometer sometimes
                    falls to 20° Fahr., and the Oxus freezes to a depth of 6 to 12 inches. At the
                    end of March the vine, pomegranate, and fig commence to bud, and in the first
                    days of April are covered with green. Wheat harvesting commences early in July;
                    about this time apricots and plums ripen. Leaves begin to grow yellow and fall
                    in the first half of November. The west wind is distinguished by its violence,
                    but it only rages in spring. At this season the north wind also blows strongly.
                    When the wind is in these quarters dews are abundant. Severe storms and
                    earthquakes are of rare occurrence; and, generally speaking, there is little
                    rain, snow, or hail.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Products.—</hi> The chief agricultural products are wheat,
                    jugara, rice, sesamum, millet, chigin (a variety of millet), barley, mash (a
                    pulse), linseed, cotton, hemp, lucerne, tobacco, poppy, and madder. The gardens
                    furnish the melon, cucumber, pumpkin, capsicum, garlic, onion, beet, radish,
                    carrot, turnip, potato, and cabbage. Of fruits the mulberry, apple, pear,
                    cherry, plum, date, peach, pomegranate, and grape are in abundance. Of trees we
                    find in small quantities the poplar, black poplar, plane, elm, willow, karaman
                    (a sort of elm), and narvan (a species of oak). Saksaul <hi rend="italic"
                    >ljloloxylon ammodendron)</hi> is found in quantities, and furnishes excellent
                    fuel. Shrubs of various kinds are indigenous, and the reed grass, in the absence
                    of meadowland, affords good fodder for cattle.</p>
                <p>Khiva furnishes no metals, but sulphur and salt are present in sufficient
                    quantities to satisfy home demands.</p>
                <p>The domestic quadrupeds are - camels, horses, asses, horned cattle, sheep, and
                    goats. Of wild animals are found the hog, giraffe, panther, jackal, fox, wolf,
                    and hare. The feathered tribe is represented by the wild goose, swan, crane,
                    pelican, duck, moorhen, bustard, pheasant, quail, snipe, partridge, magpie,
                    crow, sparrow, nightingale (in large numbers), and lark, besides domestic fowds
                    and pigeons. The fish include sturgeon, sterlet, bream, pike, carp, and
                    sandre.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trade and Industry.—</hi> The trade of Khiva, in the Middle <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n76/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0076-0065"/> Ages very considerable, has in the present day
                    declined to insignificant proportions. At the epoch when Arab trade flourished,
                    and in the time of Jenghiz Khan, Kharezm possessed important trade routes. Along
                    these routes were dug deep stone-lined wells, and they were moreover dotted at
                    intervals with caravanserais <hi rend="italic">; so</hi> that, in the words of a
                    historian of the 14th century, the traveller from Khiva to the Crimea need make
                    no provision for his journey, for all that was needful could be procured from
                    caravanserais on the way. In this latter half of the 19th century the trade is
                    unimportant, and even the ruins of the caravanserais and wells are to be
                    detected with difficulty. The merchants of New Urgentch, it is true, take their
                    wares as far as the great Russian fair of Nijni-Novgorod on the west, to Bokhara
                    on the east, and to Persia on the south, but the caravans are small and money is
                    scarce. The chief articles of trade are horned cattle, camels, horses, sheep,
                    cereals, khalats, silk and cotton cloth, clothing, gunpowder, arms, agricultural
                    implements, two-wheeled carts, saddlery, harness, boats, wood, potash, salt,
                    &amp;c. These wares are sometimes bartered, sometimes sold for money. Dried fish
                    is also an article of export for the Bokhara market. The cotton is of excellent
                    quality, and the silk of Khazarasp is renowned in Central Asia.</p>
                <p>Of manufactures there are none in the true sense of the word. The Khivans weave
                    in their hand-looms cotton and silk cloth sufficient to satisfy their home
                    necessities. In handicraft they are specially clever as armourers, smiths, and
                    founders. The fuel used is saksaul.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Currency. —</hi> The money of the country is the gold tilla,
                    the silver tenghe, and the copper pul. The tilla is worth 28 to 35 tenghe, or
                    from sixteen shillings to a pound, according to the exchange; while the tenghe,
                    value about sevenpence, is equivalent to about 35 to 50 puls. Russian, Persian,
                    and Bokharian money are also in circulation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Khiva,</hi> a fortified city, capital of the khanate of the
                    same name, situated between two canals derived from the Oxus, and in the midst
                    of green fields, orchards, and high poplars. It lies in 41° 22' 30" N. lat. and
                    60° 25' E. long., about 400 miles east of Krasnovodsk on the Caspian, 350 miles
                    north of Meshhed in Persia, and 700 miles north-north-west of Kandahar. The city
                    is girt with two mud walls. The inner wall, which surrounds the main town, is
                    built on a low eminence, and forms a tolerably regular parallelogram with four
                    towers at the angles. This wall is about 24 feet high, and has a perimeter of
                    some 2500 yards. Three gates lead into the inner town. The outer wall, 10 feet
                    high, was built in 1842 to enclose a former suburb, and has an irregular
                    perimeter of 7200 yards. Twelve gates pierce this outer wall. In the main or
                    inner town are two palaces of mean appearance, seventeen mosques, twenty-two
                    educational seminaries, a caravanserai, a covered bazaar of some one hundred and
                    twenty shops, and two hundred and sixty other shops distributed over the place.
                    The principal mosques are those erected in honour of the saints Polvan Ata and
                    Seid Bai. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. c. h. c.)</hi></p>
