                    also <hi rend="smallcaps">Surâshtra,</hi> a peninsula forming a collection of
                    native states in Guzerat, western India, lying between 20° 41' and 23° 8' N.
                    lat., and 68° 56' and 72° 20' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the Runn or
                    Gulf of Cutch, on the E. by Ahmedâbâd district and the Gulf of Cambay, and on
                    the S. and W. by the Arabian Sea; the extreme length is 220 miles, the greatest
                    breadth about 165 miles, the area about 22,000 square miles, and the estimated
                    nonulation 2.500.000.</p>

                <p>It is divided into one hundred and eighty-eight separate states, large and small,
                    of which thirteen pay no tribute, ninety-six are tributary to the British
                    Government, and seventy to the gâekwâr as the representative of the Marhattâs,
                    while of these three classes of states one hundred and thirty-two pay a tax
                    called <hi rend="italic">zortalabi</hi> to the nawâb of Junâgarh. The states are
                    arranged in seven classes: the chiefs of the first and second classes exercise
                    plenary jurisdiction, both civil and criminal; the judicial powers of the lesser
                    chiefs are graded in a diminishing scale, the residuary jurisdiction being
                    vested in four British officers, each superintending a group of states. The
                    political agent controls the whole. As a rule, no appeal lies from the decision
                    of a chief; but on presumption of maladministration his proceedings may be
                    called for and reviewed. During the past twenty years the states have
                    established civil and criminal courts and written codes. Justice is administered
                    by the political officers on the non-regulation system over 2058 square miles,
                    or about one-tenth of the whole area. Outlawry, political and predatory, has
                    been suppressed, and life and property are as safe as in British districts. A
                    village police has been established, and municipal funds are voted by the
                    states. In 1878 there were 488 schools, with 28,171 scholars; while at the
                    Râjkumar College, and three high schools many of the chiefs receive a liberal
                    education during their minority. There is railway communication with Wadhwân,
                    and an extension is in progress to Dhorâji and Bhaunagar, while a network of
                    good roads extend from Râjkot, the headquarters of the agency, over the greater
                    part of the province. Kâthiâwâr is divided for administrative purposes into four
                    <hi rend="italic">prants</hi> or districts,—Jhalâwâr, Hâllâr, Sorâth, and
                    Gohelwâr; but the old territorial <hi rend="italic">prants</hi> are ten, viz.,
                    Jhalâwâr in the north, containing about fifty states; Machhukântâ; Hâllâr, with
                    twenty-sixty states; Okhamandal, belonging to Baroda; Baradâ or Jaitwâr, also
                    known as Porbandar; Sorâth; Babriâwâr; Kâthiâwâr; Und-Sarviya; and Gohelwâr. The
                    last-named comprises the Gogo district, belonging to the Ahmedâbâd collectorate;
                    Bhaunagar, probably the foremost state in Kâthiâwâr; and many others.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, the surface of the country is undulating, with low ranges
                    running in very irregular directions; with the exception of the Tânghâ and
                    Mândhav hills, in the west of Jhalâwâr, and some unimportant hills in Hâllâr,
                    the northern portion of the country is flat; but in the south, from near Gogo,
                    the Gir range runs nearly parallel with the coast, and at a distance of about 20
                    miles from it, along the north of Babriâwâr and Sorâth, to the neighbourhood of
                    Gïrnâr. Opposite this latter mountain is the solitary 0sam hill, and then still
                    farther west is the Baradâ group, between Hâllâr and Baradâ, running about 20
                    miles north and south from Gumti to Rânâwan. The Girnâr clump of mountains is an
                    important granitic mass, the highest peak of which rises to 3500 feet. The
                    principal river is the Bhâdar, which rises in the Mândhav hills, and flowing
                    south-west falls into the sea at Navi-Bandar, in Baradâ; it is everywhere marked
                    by highly cultivated lands adjoining its course of about 115 miles. Other rivers
                    are the Aji, Machhu, and Satπinji—the last remarkable for wild and romantic
                    scenery. Four of the old races, the Jâitwas, Churâsamas, Solunkis, and Wâlâs are
                    now existing as proprietors of the soil who exercised sovereignty in the country
                    prior to the immigration of the Jhalâs, Jârejas, Purmars, Kathis, Gohels, Jâts,
                    Mohammedans, and Marhattâs, between whom the country is now chiefly portioned
                    out.</p>
                <p>The principal agricultural products consist of cotton, <hi rend="italic"
                    >bàjrd,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">jοdr,</hi> and in some parts sugar-cane,
                    turmeric, and indigo. Horse and sheep breeding is carried on to a great
                    extent—these animals, together with food grains, rawcotton,and wool, forming the
                    chief exports. The principal imports are cotton manufactures, metals, and sugar.
                    Iron is found in many parts of Barada and Hâllâr. Many iron-mines have, however,
                    had to be abandoned of late years owing to the scarcity of fuel for smelting the
                    ore. The principal towns are Jamnagar, Bhaunagar, Junâgarh, Rajkot, Porbandar,
                    and Mangrol. The last two, as also Verâwal, are thriving seaport towns.
                    Kâthiâwâr has many notable antiquities, comprising rock inscriptions of Asoka,
                    Buddhist caves, and. fine Jain temples on the sacred hill of Girnâr, and at
                    Pâlitana.</p>
