                <p><label type="entry">KEBLE, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1792-1866),
                    the poet of the <hi rend="italic">Christian Year,</hi> was born on St Mark’s Day
                    (April 25), 1792, at Fairford, Gloucestershire. He was the second child and
                    eldest son of the Rev. John Keble and Sarah Maule; three sisters and one brother
                    completed the family circle. Descended from a family which had attained some
                    legal eminence in the time of the Commonwealth, John Keble, the father of the
                    poet, was vicar of Coin St Aldwyn, but lived at Fairford, about 3 miles distant
                    from his cure. He was a clergyman of the old High Church school, whose
                    adherents, untouched by the influence of the Wesleys, had moulded their piety on
                    the doctrines of the non-jurors and the old Anglican divines. Himself a good
                    scholar, he did not send his son to any school, but educated him and his brother
                    at home so well that both obtained scholarships at Corpus Christi College,
                    Oxford. John was elected scholar of Corpus in his fifteenth, and fellow of Oriel
                    in his nineteenth year, April 1811. In Easter term 1810 he had obtained double
                    first class honours, a distinction which had been obtained only once before, and
                    that by Sir Robert Peel. After his election to the Oriel fellowship, Keble
                    gained the University prizes, both for the English essay and also for the Latin
                    essay. But he was more remarkable for the rare beauty of his character than even
                    for academic distinctions. Sir John Taylor Coleridge, his fellow scholar at
                    Corpus and his life-long friend, says of him, looking back on his youth, after
                    their friendship of five and fifty years had closed, “It was the singular
                    happiness of his nature, remarkable even in his undergraduate days, that love
                    for him was always sanctified by reverence—reverence that did not make the love
                    less tender, and love that did but add intensity to the reverence.'' Oriel
                    College was, at the time when Keble entered it, the centre of all the finest
                    ability in Oxford. Copleston, Davison, Whately, were among the fellows who
                    elected Keble; Arnold, Pusey, Newman, were soon after added to the society. In
                    1815 Keble was ordained deacon, and priest in 1816. His real bent and choice
                    were towards a pastoral cure in a country parish; but he remained in Oxford,
                    acting first as public examiner in the schools, then as tutor in Oriel, till
                    1823. In summer he sometimes took clerical work, sometimes made tours on foot
                    through various English counties, during which he was composing poems, which
                    afterwards took their place in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Year.</hi> He had
                    a rare power of attracting to himself the finest spirits, a power which lay not
                    so much in his ability or his genius as in his character, so simple, so humble,
                    so pure, so unworldly, yet wanting not that severity which can stand by
                    principle and maintain what he holds to be the truth. In 1823 he left Oxford,
                    and returned to Fairford, there to assist his father, and with his brother to
                    serve one or two small and poorly endowed curacies in the neighbourhood of Coin.
                    He had made a quiet but deep impression on all who came within his influence in
                    Oxford, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n34/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0034-0025"/> and during his five years of college
                    tutorship had won the affection of his pupils, some of whom afterwards rose to
                    eminence. But it was to pastoral work, and not to academic duty, that he
                    thenceforth devoted himself, associating with it, and scarcely placing on a
                    lower level, the affectionate discharge of his duties as a son and brother.
                    Filial piety influenced in a quite unusual degree his feelings and his action
                    all life through. It was in 1827, a few years after he settled at Fairford, that
                    he published the <hi rend="italic">Christian Year.</hi> The poems which make up
                    that book had been the silent gathering of years. Keble had purposed in his own
                    mind to keep them beside him, correcting and improving them, as long as he
                    lived, and to leave them to be published only “when he was fairly out of the
                    way.” This resolution was at length overcome by the importunities of his
                    friends, and above all by the strong desire of his father to see his son’s poems
                    in print before he died. Accordingly they were printed in two small volumes in
                    Oxford, and given to the world in June 1827, but with no name on the title page.
                    The book continued to be published anonymously, but the name of the author soon
                    transpired. Probably no book of poetry in this century has had a wider
                    circulation. Between 1827 and 1872 one hundred and fiftyeight editions had
                    issued from the press, and since the latter date it has been largely reprinted
                    both by the original publishers and by others. The author, so far from taking
                    pride in this widespread reputation, seemed all his life long to wish to
                    disconnect his name with the book, and “as if he would rather it had been the
                    work of some one else than himself.” This feeling arose from no false modesty.
                    It was because he knew that in these poems he had painted his own heart, the
                    best part of it; and he doubted whether it was right thus to exhibit himself,
                    and by the revelation of only his better self, to win the good opinion of the
                    world, on which he knew that a woe had been pronounced.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of 1831 Keble was elected to fill the chair of the poetry
                    professorship in Oxford, as successor to his friend and admirer, Dean Milman.
                    This chair he occupied for ten years, probably the most eventful ten years which
                    Oxford has seen since the Reformation. The professor is required by statute to
                    deliver at least one lecture during each of the three terms that make up the
                    academic year; and during Keble’s tenure these lectures were still required to
                    be in Latin. In the course of his professorship he delivered a series of
                    lectures, clothed in excellent idiomatic Latin, in which he expounded a theory
                    of poetry which was original and suggestive, and which grew naturally out of his
                    own character and habits of mind. He looked on poetry as a vent for overcharged
                    feeling, or a full imagination, or some imaginative regret, which had not found
                    their natural outlet in life and action. It was a relief provided for those
                    feelings which are apt to fill the mind too full, and to overburden the heart.
                    This suggested to him a distinction between what he called primary and secondary
                    poets,—the first employing poetry to relieve their own hearts, the second,
                    poetic artists, composing poetry from some other and less impulsive motive. Of
                    the former kind were Homer, Lucretius, Burns, Scott <hi rend="italic">; of</hi>
                    the latter were Euripides, Dryden, Milton. This view is set forth in an article
                    contributed to the <hi rend="italic">British Critic</hi> in 1838 on the life of
                    Scott, and was more fully developed in two volumes of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Praelectiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Academic«.</hi></p>
                <p>His regular visits to Oxford kept him in intercourse with his old friends in
                    Oriel common room, and made him familiar with the currents of feeling which
                    swayed the university. Catholic emancipation and the Reform Bill had deeply
                    stirred, not only the political spirit of Oxford, but also the church feeling
                    which had long been stagnant. Cardinal Newman writes, “On Sunday July 14, 1833,
                    Mr Keble preached the assize sermon in the University pulpit. It was published
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">National Apostasy.</hi> I have ever
                    considered and kept the day as the start of the religious movement of 1833.” The
                    occasion of this sermon was the suppression, by Earl Grey’s Reform ministry, of
                    ten Irish bishoprics. Against the spirit which would treat the church as the
                    mere creature of the state Keble had long chafed inwardly, and now he made his
                    outward protest, asserting the claim of the church to a heavenly origin and a
                    divine prerogative. About the same time, and partly stimulated by Keble’s
                    sermon, some leading spirits in Oxford and elsewhere began a concerted and
                    systematic course of action to revive High Church principles and the ancient
                    patristic theology, and by these means both to defend the church against the
                    assaults of its enemies, and also to raise to a higher tone the standard of
                    Christian life in England. This design embodied itself in what is known as the
                    Tractarian movement, a name it received from the once famous <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tracts for the Times,</hi> which were the vehicle for promulgating the new
                    doctrines. If Keble is to be reckoned, as Dr Newman would have it, as the
                    primary author of the movement, it was from Dr Pusey that it received one of its
                    best known names, and in Dr Newman that it soon found its genuine leader. To the
                    tracts, which did so much to spread High Church views, Keble made only four
                    contributions :—No. 4, containing an argument, in the manner of Bishop Butler,
                    to show that adherence to apostolical succession is the safest course; No. 13,
                    which explains the principle on which the Sunday lessons in the church service
                    are selected; No. 40, on marriage with one who is unbaptized; No. 89, on the
                    mysticism attributed to the early fathers of the church. Besides these
                    contributions from his own pen, he did much for the series by suggesting
                    subjects, by reviewing tracts written by others, and by lending to their
                    circulation the weight of his personal influence.</p>
                <p>In 1835 Keble’s father died at the age of ninety, and soon after this his son
                    married Miss Clarke, left Fairford, and settled at Hursley vicarage in
                    Hampshire, a living to which he had been presented by his friend and attached
                    pupil, Sir William Heathcote, and which continued to be Keble’s home and cure
                    for the remainder of his life.</p>
                <p>In 1841 the tracts were brought to an abrupt termination by the publication of
                    Newman’s tract No. 90. All the Protestantism of England was in arms against the
                    author of the obnoxious tract. Keble came forward at the time, desirous to share
                    the responsibility and the blame, if there was any; for he had seen the tract
                    before it was published, and approved of it. The same year in which burst this
                    ecclesiastical storm saw the close of Keble’s tenure of the professorship of
                    poetry, and thenceforward he was seen but rarely in Oxford. No other public
                    event ever effected Keble so deeply as the secession of his friend Mr Newman to
                    the Church of Rome in 1845. It was to him both a public and a private sorrow,
                    which nothing could repair. But he did not lose heart; at once he threw himself
                    into the double duty, which now devolved on himself and Dr Pusey, of counselling
                    the many who had hitherto followed the movement, and who, now in their
                    perplexity, might be tempted to follow their leader’s example, and at the same
                    time of maintaining the rights of the church against what he held to be the
                    encroachments of the state, as seen in such public acts as the Gorham judgment,
                    and the decision on <hi rend="italic">Essays and Bevieιvs.</hi> In all the
                    ecclesiastical contests of the twenty years which followed 1845, Keble took a
                    part, not loud or obtrusive, but firm and resolute, in maintaining those High
                    Anglican principles with which his life had been identified. These absorbing
                    duties, added to his parochial work, left little time for literature. But in
                    1846 he published the <hi rend="italic">Lyra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Innocentium</hi>: and in 1863 he completed a life of Bishop Wilson.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n35/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0035-0026"/>
                <p>In the late autumn of the latter year, Keble left Hursley for the sake of his
                    wife’s health, and sought the milder climate of Bournemouth. There he had an
                    attack of paralysis, from which he died on the 29th March 1866. He was buried in
                    his own churchyard at Hursley; and in little more than a month his wife was laid
                    by her husband’s side.</p>
                <p>It is as a poet that Keble was best known during his life, and it is as a poet
                    that he will be remembered. His poetical works are the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Christian Year</hi> (1827), <hi rend="italic">A Metrical Version of the
                        Psalter</hi> (1839), <hi rend="italic">Lyra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Innocentium</hi> (1846), and a volume of poems published posthumously.</p>
                <p>Keble, though himself childless, was a special lover of children; and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Lyra</hi><hi rend="italic">Innocentium</hi> expresses this
                    characteristic. It is a book “about children, their ways, and privileges.” It
                    begins with their baptism, follows them through their cradle life and infancy,
                    their childhood sports, troubles, encouragements, warnings, the lessons taught
                    them by nature, those taught them by grace, dwells on their sicknesses, and
                    their deaths. It is a book for parents, especially for mothers. The range of
                    subjects is too limited, and the turn of thought often too subtle, to allow it
                    to be widely popular. But Judge Coleridge pronounced it, if not equal to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Christian Year</hi> as a whole, yet more than equal to it in
                    parts; and Dean Stanley thinks that “it has more of the true fire of genius,
                    more of the true rush of poetic diction. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ’
                    However this may be, it is by the <hi rend="italic">Christian Year</hi> that
                    Keble won the ear of the religious world, and will retain it. It was a happy
                    thought that dictated the plau of the book, to furnish a meditative religious
                    lyric for each Sunday of the year, and for each saint’s day and festival of the
                    English Church. The subject of each poem is generally suggested by some part of
                    the lessons or the gospel or the epistle for the day. One thing which gives
                    these poems their strangely unique power is the sentiment to which they appeal,
                    and the saintly character of the poet who makes the appeal, illumining more or
                    less every poem. That to which the <hi rend="italic">Christian Year</hi> appeals
                    is the religious and devotional sentiment which, however hidden, exists more or
                    less in most men. In the words of Sir J. T. Coleridge, “to this feeling it makes
                    its unceasing appeal, with a voice so earnest, so sincere, so sad in its
                    Hopefulness, so unpretending as to the speaker, yet so authoritative and
                    confident as to the cause it pleads, that for the time it seems
                    irresistible.”</p>
                <p>The preface begins with observing how important is “a sober standard of feeling
                    in matters of practical religion,” and indicates that the object of the book is
                    to calm excitement, and to exhibit the soothing tendency which pervades the Book
                    of Common Prayer. The motto on the title page, ‘ ‘ In quietness and confidence
                    shall be your strength,’’ is the keynote to which the whole book is set. The
                    main characteristics which go to make up the charm of this small volume are
                    these :—</p>
                <p>1. The peculiar tone of religious feeling that pervades it, at once deep, pure,
                    and tender, sober and severely self-denying. The undertone of the book comes out
                    in verses like this—</p>
                <p>“The eye in smiles may wander round,</p>
                <p>Caught by earth’s shadows as they fleet, But for the soul no help is found,</p>
                <p>Save Him who made it, meet.”</p>
                <p>Closely connected with this there is a more personal feeling towards our Lord, in
                    His whole nature at once human and divine, than had ever before appeared in
                    English poetry, even in that of Charles Wesley or Cowper. This runs through all
                    the poems; it comes out especially in such verses as these</p>
                <p>“Ouι∙ Saviour’s face benign, Bent on us with transforming power, Till we, too,
                    faintly shine and again,</p>
                <p>“who loves the Lord aright No soul of man can worthless find; All will be
                    precious in his sight, Since Christ on all hath shined:</p>
                <p>But chiefly Christian souls; for they, Though worn and soiled with sinful cl·iy,
                    Are yet, to eyes that read them true, All glistening with baptismal dew."</p>
                <p>2. A second note of the <hi rend="italic">Christian Year</hi> is reverence for
                    the church, and for the pastoral office within it,—a solemn sense of its diunitγ
                    and its awful responsibility.</p>

                    tender affection for home and mends, the filial and fraternal piety, which
                    everywhere pervades it. 1 his appears notably in the poem for St Andrew’s Day,
                    in the two opening stanzas of the poem on Whit Monday, in some verses of the
                    poem for the 4th Sunday in Advent, and in many more.</p>
                <p>^.∙. ∙∖ Prevailing spirit of modesty and of delicate reserve, very unlike the
                    vanity with which poets are often credited. Combined with this is a special
                    tenderness for those persons and things which the world thinks least of—for
                    those who pine forgotten in hidden nooks, for the downtrodden and the despised.
                    These sympathies appear at every turn of the book,—especially, perhaps, in such
                    poems as that for the 4th Sunday in Lent, that for Visitation of the Sick, and
                    in two well-known stanzas in the poem for St Matthew’s Day, not to mention many
                    other like passages.</p>
                <p>5. Besides these qualities of Keble’s heart as a man, there are others which
                    belong to him especially as a poet. Prominent among these is his love of nature,
                    particularly for the more ordinary and unnoticed features of English landscape.
                    In these he seemed most to delight, as interwoven with home thoughts and
                    sentiments, and because, as he expresses it,</p>
                <p>“Homely scenes and simple views Lowly thoughts may best infuse.”</p>
                <p>Many a scene from the neighbourhood of Fairford and Oxford, many a fleeting image
                    caught there in casual walks, has been inwrought, naturally and beautifully,
                    into the web of his devout meditations.</p>
                <p>6. The intimacy with the Bible which is manifest in the pages of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Christian Year,</hi> and the unobtrusive felicity with which
                    Biblical sentiments and language are introduced, have done much to endear these
                    poems to all Bible readers; nor this only, but the fidelity with which Biblical
                    scenery is rendered. ‘ ‘ The exactness of the descriptions of Palestine, which
                    Keble had never visited, have been noted, and verified on the spot,” by Dean
                    Stanley. He points to features of the lake of Gennesareth, which were first
                    touched in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Year</hi>; and he observes that
                    throughout the book ‘ ‘ the Biblical scenery is treated graphically as real
                    scenery, and the Biblical history and poetry as real history and poetry.”</p>
                <p>As to its style, the <hi rend="italic">Christian Year</hi> is calm and grave in
                    tone, and subdued in colour, as beseems its subjects and sentiments. The
                    contemporary poets whom Keble most admired were Scott, Wordsworth, and, we may
                    add, Southey; and of their influence traces are visible in his diction. Yet he
                    has a style of language and a cadence of his own, which steal into the heart
                    with strangely soothing power. Some of the poems are faultless, after their
                    kind, flowing from the first verse to the last, lucid in thought, vivid in
                    diction, harmonious in their pensive melody. In others there are imperfections
                    in rhythm, conventionalities of language, obscurities or over-subtleties of
                    thought, which mar the reader’s enjoyment. Yet even the most defective poems
                    commonly have, at least, à single verse, expressing some profound thought or
                    tender shade of feeling, for which the sympathetic reader willingly pardons
                    artistic imperfections in the rest.</p>
                <p>The real power of the <hi rend="italic">Christian Year</hi> lies in this, that it
                    brings home to the readers, as few poetic works have ever done, a heart of rare
                    and saintly beauty. We may well believe that ages must elapse ere another such
                    character shall again concur with a poetic gift and power of expression, which,
                    if not of the highest, are still of a high order.</p>
                <p>Keble’s life was written by his life-long friend the late Mr Justice Coleridge.
