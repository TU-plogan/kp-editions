                            rend="smallcaps">Kiev</hi></label>, a south-western government of
                    European Russia, conterminous with those of Minsk, Poltava, Tchernigoff,
                    Podolia, Kherson, and Volhynia. The area is estimated at 31,664 square miles. In
                    the north we find a low-lying district characterized by marsh and woodland; in
                    the east a series of hills keeps company with the Dnieper; and in the west are
                    several outliers from the Carpathian system. The central region is a kind of
                    steppe. It is only in a very few places that the altitude exceeds 900 feet.
                    Granite with underlying syenite is the prevailing rock in the west and
                    south-west of the government; in the east there are various Eocene formations.
                    Iron-ore, fireclay, sandstone, and lignite are among the useful minerals.
                    Towards the southern and the central parts the surface is covered by a deep rich
                    “black earth.” Nearly the whole of the government belongs to the basin of the
                    Dnieper, that river forming pxrt of its eastern boundary. In the southwest are a
                    few small tributaries of the Bug. Besides the Dnieper the only navigable stream
                    is its confluent the Pripyat, but two or three of the rest are available for
                    rafts. About a fourth of the surface is occupied by woods, very unequally
                    distributed throughout the territory. Rye is the commonest of the cereals; and
                    next follow oats and wheat. In the growing of beetroot the government is the
                    first in Russia, and its factories for the production of beetroot sugar are the
                    largest in the empire. The whole industrial activity of the district has rapidly
                    developed since about the middle of the century: in 1879 there were 602
                    establishments, with 35,306 workmen, and a production worth &lt;£10,000,000. In
                    the 75 sugar factories large numbers of Tartars from Tamboff and Penza find
                    employment; and next in importance are the flour-mills, leather works, and
                    tobacco factories. The population of the government has increased from 2,017,262
                    in 1862 to 2,266,000 in 1875. Little Russians form 80 per cent, of the
                    aggregate; Jews, 13 per cent.; Poles, 4 per cent.; White Russians, 2⅜ per cent.;
                    and there are a few thousand Great Russians. There are twelve
                    districts:—Radomuisl,Kieff,Kaneff,Tcherkasui, Tchigirin, Vasilkoff, Berditcheff,
                    Lipovets, Skvira, Tarashtcha, Uman, Zvenigorodka. Besides the government town
                    the following have upwards of 5000 inhabitants :—Berditcheff, 52,560; Vasilkoff,
                    16,597; Uman, 15,393; Tcherkasui, 13,914; Tarashtcha, 11,420; Zvenigorodka,
                    11,375; Skvira, 10,061; Tchigirin, 9677; Kaneff, 7418; Lipovets, 6710;
                    Radomuisl, 5905, to which may be added the large Jewish village of ZIatopol,
                    10,000. The exarchate or diocese of Kieff and Galitsch is the oldest in Russia,
                    and comprises 1421 churches, 12 cathedrals, and 30 monasteries.</p>
                <p>In 1708 a Kieff government was founded which included the whole eastern Ukraine
                    and an extensive region in Central Russia containing thirty-six towns—Orel,
                    Kursk, &amp;c. The Kieff lieutenant ship, founded in 1782, consisted of parts of
                    the present governments of Kieff, Poltava, and Tchernigoff. In 1796 the present
                    government was practically constituted, though several slight changes in regard
                    to the district towns have since taken place.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Kieff,</hi> capital of the above province, the “mother city”
                    and Canterbury of Russia, is situated on the right or western bank of the
                    Dnieper, in 50° 26' N. lat. and 30° 37' E. long., 800 miles from St Petersburg,
                    and 566 miles from Moscow on the highway between Moscow and Odessa. By railway
                    it is connected on the one hand with Kursk and on the other hand with Odessa.
                    The site of the greater part of the town consists of a succession of hills or
                    bluffs separated from each other by ravines and hollows, the elevation of the
                    central portions being from 350 to 365 feet above the ordinary level of the
                    Dnieper. On the opposite side of the river the country spreads out low and level
                    like a sea. Having by this time received all its important tributaries, the
                    Dnieper is a large and navigable stream; but as it approaches the town it breaks
                    up into two currents and forms a low grassy island of considerable extent called
                    Tukhanoff. During the spring floods there is a rise of 16 or even 20 feet, and
                    not only the whole island but the country along the left bank and the lower
                    grounds on the right bank are laid under water. The bed of the river is sandy
                    and shifting, and it is only by costly engineering works that the main stream
                    has been kept from returning to the more eastern channel which it formerly
                    occupied. Opposite the southern part of the town, where the currents have again
                    united, the river is crossed by a wrought-iron bar-chain suspension bridge,
                    which at the time of its erection (1851) was the largest enterprise of the kind
                    in Europe. It is about half a mile in length and 52∣ feet in breadth, and the
                    four principal spans are each 440 feet. The bridge was designed by Mr Vignoles,
                    and the whole of the iron (3500 tons) employed in the construction was prepared
                    in England. The cost was about £400,000<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Views of the bridge will be found in <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Owing to the natural character of the site, Kieff is broken up into several
                    distinct portions; and from no point is it possible to get a view of the city as
                    a whole. Up to 1837 the town proper consisted of the Old Town, Petchersk, and
                    Podυl; but in that year three districts were added, and in 1879 the limits were
                    extended so as to include Kurenevka, Lukyanovka, Shulyavka, and Solomenka, and
                    the whole was divided into eight districts. The administrative area of the town,
                    as thus defined, is about 12,404 acres, or 18 square miles; but these figures
                    give a very exaggerated notion of the place, as there are extensive suburbs and
                    large intervals of unoccupied ground. Wood is still the most <pb break="no"

                <p>The Old Town or Old Kieff quarter (Starokievskaya Tchast) occupies the highest of
                    the range of hills. It is here that the houses are the most closely built, and
                    that stone structures are most abundant. In some of the principal streets—as
                    Vladimir’s, Vasiltchikoff’s—buildings of three to five stories, a comparatively
                    rare thing in Russia, have been erected. In the 11th century the area was
                    enclosed by earthen ramparts, with bastions and gateways; but of these the only
                    remnant is the so-called Golden Gate. In the centre of the Old Town stands the
                    cathedral of St Sophia, the oldest cathedral in the Russian empire. The
                    statement frequently repeated that it was a copy of St Sophia’s in
                    Constantinople has been shown by Zakrevski to be a mistake. The building
                    measures in length only 118 feet, while its breadth is 173 feet. But if the plan
                    shows no imitation of the great Byzantine church, the decorations of the
                    interior (pictures, mosaics, &amp;c.) indicate direct Byzantine influence.
                    During the occupation of the church by the Uniats in the 17th century these were
                    covered with a coating of whitewash, and a thorough-going restoration was
                    rendered a matter of necessity; but the chapel of the Three Pontiffs has been
                    left untouched to show how carefully the old style has been preserved or copied.
                    Among the mosaics is a colossal representation of the Virgin, 15 feet in height,
                    which, like the so-called “indestructible wall” in which it is inlaid, dates
                    from the time of Yaroslaff. It was this prince who founded the church in 1037 in
                    gratitude for his victory over the Petchenegs. His sarcophagus, curiously
                    sculptured with palms, fishes, &amp;c., is still preserved. The church of St
                    Andrew occupies the spot where, according to Russian tradition, the apostle
                    stood when as yet Kieff was not, and declared that the Kill would become the
                    site of a great city. The present building dates only from 1744-1767. The church
                    of the Tithes, restored in 1842, was originally founded in the close of the 10th
                    century by Vladimir in honour of two martyrs whom he had put to death; and the
                    monastery of St Michael (or of the Golden Heads—so called from the fifteen
                    gilded cupolas of the original church) claims to have been built in 1108 by
                    Svyatopolk II., and restored in 1655 by Bogdan Khmelnitski.</p>
                <p>Up to 1820 the south-eastern district of Petchersk was the industrial and
                    commercial quarter; but it has been greatly altered in carrying out
                    fortifications commenced in that year by Nicholas I. Most of the houses are
                    small and old-fashioned. The monastery—the Kievo-Petcherskaya —is the chief
                    establishment of its kind in Russia; it is visited every year by about 350,000
                    pilgrims. From the books of the conventual inns it is shown that shelter is
                    given to 150,000 persons per annum; and the numbers for whom there is no
                    accommodation is often very great,— 72,000, for example, were counted lying
                    under the open sky on the night of 15th August 1872. Of the ten or twelve
                    conventual churches the chief is that of the Assumption. There are four distinct
                    quarters in the monastery, each under a superior, subject to the archimandrite:
                    the Laura proper or New Monastery, that of the Infirmary, and those of the
                    Nearer and the Further Caves. These caves or catacombs are the most striking
                    characteristic of the place; the name Petchersk, indeed, is connected with the
                    Russian <hi rend="italic">peshtckera,</hi> a cave. The first series of these
                    caves, dedicated to St Antony, contains about eighty saints’ tombs; the second,
                    dedicated to St Theodosius, about forty-five. The bodies were formerly exposed
                    to view; but the pilgrims who now pass through the gloomy galleries, candle in
                    hand, see nothing but the draperies and the inscriptions. Among the more notable
                    names are those of Nestor the chronicler, and Ilia of Murom, the Old <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n82/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0082-0071"/> Cossack of the Russian epics. The foundation
                    of the monastery is ascribed to two saints of the 11th century— Antony of
                    Lynbeth, and Hilarion, metropolitan of Kieff. By the middle of the 12th century
                    it had become wealthy and beautiful, but, completely ruined by Batu in 1240, it
                    remained deserted for more than two centuries. Prince Simeon Oblkovitch was the
                    first to start the restoration. A conflagration laid the buildings waste in
                    1716, and their present aspect is largely due to Peter I. The monastery contains
                    a school of picture-makers of ancient origin, whose productions are widely
                    diffused throughout the empire, and a printing press from which have issued a
                    variety of liturgical and religious works, the oldest known examples bearing the
                    date 1616.</p>
                <p>The Podol quarter, as the name indicates, lies on the low ground at the foot of
                    the bluffs. It is the industrial and trading quarter of the town, and the seat
                    of the great fair of the “Contracts,” the transference of which from Dubno in
                    1797 largely stimulated the commercial prosperity of the city. The present
                    regular arrangement of its streets arose after the great fire of 1811. Lepki
                    district (from the lepki or lime trees, destroyed in 1833) is of recent origin,
                    and is mainly inhabited by the well-to-do classes. It is sometimes called the
                    palace quarter, from the royal palace erected between 1868 and 1870, on the site
                    of the older structure dating from the time of Elizabeth. Gardens and parks
                    abound; the palace garden is exceptionally fine, and in the same neighbourhood
                    are the public gardens with the place of amusement known as the Chateau de
                    Fleurs.</p>
                <p>In the New Buildings, or the Luibed quarter, are the university and the botanical
                    gardens. The Ploskaya Tchast ( Flat quarter) or Obolon contains the lunatic
                    asylum; the Lukyanovka Tchast, the penitentiary and the camp and barracks; and
                    the Bulvarnaya Tchast, the military gymnasium of St Vladimir and the railway
                    station.</p>
                <p>Kieff is the seat of the governor-general of the three provinces of Kieff,
                    Podolia, and Volhynia, and as such possesses a large number of administrative
                    institutions. In 1862 it was made the headquarters of a great military district
                    including the same provinces. As a centre of intellectual activity it ranks
                    among the principal cities of Russia. The university of St Vladimir, transferred
                    from Vilna after the Polish insurrection of 1831, possessed 94 professors in
                    1878, and was attended by 771 students; and the library contained 150,000
                    volumes. The theological academy and theological seminary are large
                    institutions; and the ordinary educational establishments include three male and
                    four female gymnasiums. A daily paper, founded in 1864, and nine other
                    periodicals are published in the town. Of the learned societies the more
                    important are the medical (1840), the naturalists’ (1869), the juridical (1876),
                    the historical of Nestor the chronicler (1872), the horticultural (1875), and
                    the dramatical (1879), the archaeological commission (1843), and the society of
                    church archaeology. There are three considerable theatres.</p>
                <p>In 1862 the population of Kieff was returned as 70,341; of this number 8604 were
                    Roman Catholics, 1411 Jews, and 976 Protestants. In 1874 the total was given as
                    127,251,—77'43 per cent, being members of the Greek Church, 10 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 85 per cent. Jews, 8 ’ 18 per cent. Catholics,
                    and 2 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 45 per cent Protestants. The clergy—
                    regular and secular—amounted to no less than 3505, Russian and its dialects were
                    spoken by four-fifths of the inhabitants. For 1881 the total population is
                    estimated at 165,000.</p>
                <p>The history of Kieff cannot be satisfactorily severed from that of Russia.
                    According to Nestor’s well-known legend it was founded in 864 by three brothers
                    Ke, Shtchek, and Khoriff. It was in the waters of the Dnieper opposite the town
                    that Vladimir, the first saint of the Russian Church, caused his people to be
                    baptized; and Kietfbecame the seat of the first Christian church, of the first
                    Christian school, and of the first library in Russia. For three hundred and
                    seventy-six years it was an independent Russian city; for eighty years it was
                    subject to the Tartars; for two hundred and forty-nine years it belonged to the
                    Lithuanian principality; and for ninetyeight years to Poland. It was finally
                    united to the Russian empire in 1667. In 1832 the headquarters of the first army
                    corps, with all the departments of the general staff, were transferred to Kieff
                    from Mogileff. The Magdeburg rights, which the city had previously c-joycd, were
                    abolished in 1835, and the ordinary form of town government introduced; and in
                    1840 it was made subject to the common civil law of the empire.</p>
                <p>A long list of works relating to Kieff will be found in Seπιenoff, Slov. Rost.
