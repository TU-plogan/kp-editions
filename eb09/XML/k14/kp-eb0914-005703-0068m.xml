                    to the basin of the Don and partly to that of the Dnieper. The area is estimated
                    at 21,035 square miles. In general terms the government may be described as a
                    table-land with an elevation of from 300 to 460 feet traversed by deep-cut river
                    valleys. The soil is for the most part of high fertility, about 47 per cent, of
                    the surface being arable land and 30 per cent, natural pasture; and though the
                    winter is rather severe the summer heat is sufficient for the ripening of grapes
                    and melons in the open air. The bulk of the population is engaged in
                    agricultural pursuits, and the breeding of sheep, cattle, and horses, though
                    various manufacturing industries have also received a rapid development, more
                    especially since the middle of the present century. The ordinary cereals, maize,
                    buckwheat, millet, hemp, flax, tobacco, poppies, and beetroot are all grown, and
                    bee keeping and silk-worm rearing are of considerable importance. In 1879 the
                    horses numbered 258,711, the cattle 475,217, the sheep 1,059,596, of which
                    376,777 were of fine-fleeced varieties. Beetroot sugar factories, cotton mills,
                    woollen factories, iron-works, and tanneries are the leading industrial
                    establishments; their whole production in 1879 was estimated at 23,939,147
                    roubles (about £3,790,000). The mass of the people are Little Russians, but
                    there are also Great Russians, Calmucks, Germans, Jews, and Gipsies. In 1867 the
                    total population was 1,681,486, and in 1879 2,036,949—4119 of these being
                    Raskolniks (dissidents), 1960 Roman Catholics, 2732 Protestants, and 3079 Jews.
                    The government is divided into eleven districts—Kharkoff, Akhtuirka,
                    Bogodukhoff, Izyum, Kupyansk, Lebedyin, Zmieff, Starobyelsk, Sumui, Valki, and
                    Voltchansk. In 1879 there were eight towns with populations above 5000—Kharkoff,
                    Izyum (15,741), Starobyelsk (12,581), Voltchansk (11,107), Slavansk (10,558),
                    Tchugueff (9418), Valki (7001), Zolotcheff (5038). Ecclesiastically the
                    government is a separate eparchy or diocese of the Greek Church. The Roman
                    Catholics are subject to the bishop of Tiraspol in Kherson.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Kharkoff,</hi> the chief town of the above government, is
                    situated in 56° 37' N. lat. and 25° 5' E. long., in the valley of the Donets,
                    462 miles from Moscow and 137 miles from Kursk. It has railway communication
                    northward by Kursk and southward to Mariupol on the Sea of Azoff and to Odessa
                    by Poltava and Balta. The four annual fairs are among the busiest in Russia,
                    more especially the Krestchenskaya or Epiphany fair, which is opened on the 6th
                    (18th) January. The turn-over is estimated at from £3,000,000 to £4,000,000.
                    Thousands of horses are bought and sold. At the Trinity (Troitsa) fair in June
                    an extensive business (£800,000) is done in wool. A great variety of
                    manufactured goods are produced in the town—linen, felt, sugar (especially from
                    beetroot), tobacco, brandy, soap, candles, cast-iron. Besides a flourishing
                    university, instituted in 1805, and attended in 1879 by 720 male and 163 female
                    students, Kharkoff possesses an observatory, a large veterinary college, a
                    botanical garden, a theological seminary, and several important institutio?.s of
                    beneficence. The university building was formerly a royal palace. The library
                    contained in 1878 98,000 volumes; and the zoological collections are especially
                    rich in the birds and fishes of southern Russia Extensive barracks are
                    maintained in the town. Public gardens occupy the site of the ancient military
                    works; and the Government has a model farm in the neighbourhood. Of the Orthodox
                    churches one has the rank of cathedral. The population of Kharkoff was 59,968 in
                    1867, and 101,175 in 1879.</p>
                <p>The foundation of Kharkoff is assigned to the year 1650, and the name is at least
                    popularly connected with that of Khariton, the Cossack originator of the
                    settlement; but there is archaeological evidence of a much earlier occupation of
                    the district, if not of the site. The Cossacks of Kharkoff remained faithful to
                    the czar during the rebellions of the latter part of the 17th century; in return
                    they received a variety of privileges, and continued to be a strong advance
                    guard of the Russian power, till the final subjugation of all the southern
                    region. Along with other military settlements Kharkoff was placed on a new
                    footing in 1765; and at the same time it became the administrative centre of the
                    Ukraine. It has been the government town from the establishment of the
                    government in 1780. For plan see Reclus, <hi rend="italic">Géographie
