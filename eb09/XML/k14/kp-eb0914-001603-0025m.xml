                    uniting genius with industry, he was ere long found foremost among the young
                    national party which resolved that the arts of Germany should see a great
                    revival.</p>
                <p>Munich is the city most closely identified with Kaulbach. The large and ambitious
                    works by which Louis I. sought to transform the capital of Bavaria into a German
                    Athens afforded to the young painter an appropriate sphere. Cornelius had for
                    some years been commissioned to execute the enormous frescoes in the Glyptothek,
                    and his custom was in the winters with the aid of Kaulbach and others to
                    complete the cartoons at Diisseldorf, and then in the summers, accompanied by
                    his best scholars, to carry out the designs in colour on the museum walls in
                    Munich. But in 1824 Cornelius became director of the Bavarian academy. Kaulbach,
                    not yet twenty, followed, took up his permanent residence in Munich, laboured
                    hard on the public works, executed independent commissions, and rose to such
                    distinction that in 1849, when Cornelius left for Berlin, he succeeded to the
                    directorship of the academy, an office which he held for a quarter of a century,
                    up to the day <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n26/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0026-0017"/> of his death. The training, experience, and
                    opportunity of Kaulbach had been extraordinary; he became a prime mover in one
                    of the most signal of art manifestations known in modern times; he matured,
                    after the example of the masters of the Middle Ages, the practice of mural or
                    monumental decoration; he once more conjoined painting with architecture, and
                    displayed a creative fertility and readiness of resource scarcely found since
                    the era of Raphael and Michelangelo.</p>
                <p>Early in the series of his multitudinous works came the famous Narrenhaus, the
                    appalling memories of a certain madhouse near Diisseldorf; the composition all
                    the more deserves mention for points of contact with Hogarth. Somewhat to the
                    same category belong the renowned illustrations to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reineke</hi><hi rend="italic">Fuchs.</hi> These, together with occasional
                    figures or passages in complex pictorial dramas, show how dominant and
                    irrepressible were the artist’s sense of satire and enjoyment of fun; character
                    in its breadth and sharpness is depicted with keenest relish, and at times the
                    sardonic smile bursts into the loudest laugh regardless of the propriety and
                    solemnity appropriate to high art. Thus occasionally the grotesque degenerates
                    into the vulgar, the grand into the ridiculous, as in the satire on “the Pigtail
                    Age” in a fresco outside the New Pinakothek. Yet the genius of Kaulbach was far
                    too transcendent to be marred by these exceptional extravagances: such
                    exaggerations came not of weakness but from excess of power; they are as the
                    sturdy traits and lawless forces of the Teutonic and northern races whence the
                    Westphalian painter bad sprung. Kaulbach tried hard to become Grecian and
                    Italian; but he never reached Phidias or Raphael; in short the blood of Dürer,
                    Holbein, and Martin Schongauer ran strong in his veins. The art products in
                    Munich during the middle of this century were of a quantity to preclude
                    first-rate quality, and Kaulbach contracted a fatal facility in covering wall
                    and canvas by the acre. He painted in the Hofgarten, the Odeon, the Palace, and
                    on the external walls of the New Pinakothek. His perspicuous and showy manner
                    also gained him abundant occupation as a book-illustrator: in tbe pages of the
                    poets his fancy revelled; he was glad to take inspiration from Wieland, Goethe,
                    even Klopstock; among his engraved designs are the Shakespeare gallery, the
                    Goethe gallery, and a folio edition of the Gospels. All these signal examples of
                    what may be called “the Munich school,” though by the many applauded to the
                    skies, were yet subjected to censorious criticism. In a volume entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Social Life in Munich</hi> it was with some show of reason urged
                    that Kaulbach had been unfortunate alike in having found Cornelius for a master
                    and King Louis for a patron, that he attempted “subjects far beyond him,
                    believing that his admiration for them was the same as inspiration”; the lack of
                    real imagination he supplied by “a compound of intellect and fancy”; he “thinks
                    his feelings,” and his creations are but “the triumph of intellect”</p>
                <p>Nevertheless no one appreciating at their worth such master compositions as the
                    Destruction of Jerusalem and the Battle of the Huns can deny to Kaulbach
                    creative imagination. As a dramatic poet he tells the story, depicts character,
                    seizes on action and situation, and thus as it were takes the spectator by
                    storm. The manner may be occasionally noisy and ranting, but the effect after
                    its kind is tremendous. Within the whole range of modern art no finer
                    composition can be named than the Battle of the Huns, no bolder conception than
                    the fierce fight in mid air between the spirits of the warriors slain in combat
                    The drawing, the foreshortening, the grouping and lines of composition, are
                    almost as a matter of course masterly. The cartoon, which, as usual in modern
                    German art, is superior to the ultimate picture, was executed in the artist’s
                    prime at the age of thirty. At this period, as here seen, the knowledge was
                    little short of absolute; subtle is the sense of beauty; playful, delicate,
                    firm, the touch; the whole treatment artistic.</p>
                <p>Ten or more years were devoted to what the Germans term a “cyclus,”—that is, a
                    series of pictures which, as successive chapters or essays, illustrate one
                    theme, as Raphael in the Vatican gave pictorial exposition to universal
                    knowledge under the distinctive titles of Theology, Philosophy, Jurisprudence,
                    and Poetry. The fundamental idea whereon Kaulbach discoursed was civilization or
                    the progress of the human race as displayed in the following historic epochs
                    :—the Tower of Babel, the Age of Homer, the Destruction of Jerusalem, the Battle
                    of the Huns, the Crusades, and the Reformation. These major tableaux, severally
                    30 feet long, and each comprising over one hundred figures above life-size, are
                    surrounded by minor compositions making more than twenty in all. The idea is to
                    congregate around the world’s historic dramas the prime agents of civilization;
                    thus here are assembled allegoric figures of Architecture and other arts, of
                    Science and other kingdoms of knowledge, together with lawgivers from the time
                    of Moses, not forgetting Frederick the Great. The chosen situation for this
                    imposing didactic and theatric display is the Treppenhaus or grand staircase in
                    the new museum, Berlin; the surface is a granulated, absorbent wall, specially
                    prepared; the technical method is that known as “water-glass,” or “liquid
                    flint,” the infusion of silica securing permanence. The same medium was adopted
                    in the later wall-pictures in the Houses of Parliament, Westminster.</p>
                <p>The painter’s last period brings no new departure; his ultimate works stand
                    conspicuous by exaggerations of early characteristics. The series of designs
                    illustrative of Goethe, which had an immense success, were melodramatic and
                    pandered to popular taste. The vast canvas, more than 30 feet long, the Sea
                    Fight at Salamis, painted for the Maximilianeum, Munich, evinces wonted
                    imagination and facility in composition; the handling also retains its largeness
                    and vigour; but in this astounding scenic uproar moderation and the simplicity
                    of nature are thrown to the winds, and the whole atmosphere is hot and feverish.
                    The painter verily had within him a fire which burnt fiercely; and, when past
                    the age of sixty he received visitors within his spacious studio, he looked the
                    perfect impersonation of his art. On the walls, upon easels, even on the floor,
                    were large cartoons, rolls of canvas, piles of drawings—fruits of a restless and
                    inexhaustible intellect. Kaulbach in the midst moved to and fro impulsively and
                    discoursed volubly on the creations he was about to call out of chaos. But his
                    career was drawing to a close; seized by the cholera, he died in 1874, at the
                    age of sixty-nine.</p>
                <p>Kaulbach can scarcely be counted among religious painters; yet the range of his
                    thought is most lofty. Whatever is noblest in humanity, whatever has raised the
                    human race, freed or enlightened the mind, given dignity and beauty to life, or
                    reared the body into godlike frame, falls within the province of his art.
                    Nothing small or mean finds a place; the accidents and crudities of common
                    nature are cast out; typical forms are selected and matured; and all is brought
                    into harmony with beauty. Kaulbach’s was indeed a beauty-loving art. He is not
                    supreme as a colourist; he belongs in fact to a school that holds colour in
                    subordination; but he laid, in common with the great masters, the sure
                    foundation of his art in form and composition. Indeed, the science of
                    composition has seldom if ever been so clearly understood or worked out with
                    equal complexity and exactitude; the constituent lines, the relation of the
                    parts to the whole, are brought into absolute agreement; in modern Germany
                    painting and music have trodden parallel paths, and Kaulbach is musical in the
                    melody and harmony of his compositions. His narrative too is lucid, and moves as
                    a stately march or royal triumph; the sequence of the figures is unbroken; the
                    arrangement of the groups accords with even literary form; the picture falls
                    into incident, episode, dialogue, action, plot, as a drama. The style is
                    eclectic; in the Age of Homer the types and the treatment are derived from Greek
                    marbles and vases; then <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n27/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0027-0018"/> in the Tower of Babel the severity of the antique
                    gives place to the suavity of the Italian renaissance; while in the Crusades the
                    composition is let loose into modern romanticism, and so the manner descends
                    into the midst of the 19th century. And yet this scholastically compounded art
                    is so nicely adjusted and smoothly blended that it casts off all incongruity and
                    becomes homogeneous as the issue of one mind. But a fickle public craved for
                    change; and so the great master in later years waned in favour, and had to
                    witness, not without inquietude, the rise of an opposing party of naturalism and
                    realism. Yet few men have had a brighter career, or enjoyed a reward better
                    earned. Kaulbach’s works are monumental, and will be handed down to future ages
                    as the highest products of the renaissance of the arts in modern Germany. (J. B.
