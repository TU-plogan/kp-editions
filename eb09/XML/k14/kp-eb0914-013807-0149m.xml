                    and 20° 30' E. long. It consists of three formerly independent parts—the
                    Altstadt (old town) to the west, Lobenicht to the east, and the island Kneiphof,
                    together with numerous suburbs, embraced in α circuit of 9⅛ miles. The Pregel,
                    spanned by many bridges, flows through the town in two branches, which unite
                    below the Green Bridge. Its greatest.breadth within the town is from 80 to 90
                    yards. It is frozen from November to March. Although an old town, Königsberg
                    does not retain many marks of antiquity. The Altstadt has long <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n150/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0150-0139"/> and narrow streets, but the Kneiphof quarter is
                    roomier. Of the seven market-places only that in the Altstadt retains something
                    of its former appearance. Among the more interesting buildings are the schloss,
                    a long rectangle begun in 1255 and added to later, with a Gothic tower 277 feet
                    high, and the chapel (built 1592) in which Frederick I. placed the Prussian
                    crown on his own head in 1701; and the cathedral, begun in 1322, restored in
                    1856, a Gothic building with a tower 164 feet high. Behind the schloss is the
                    parade-ground, with the statue of Frederick William III. by Kiss. To the east is
                    the Schlossteich, a long narrow ornamental lake covering 12 acres, with
                    beautifully laid out tree-shaded banks. The north-west side of the parade-ground
                    is occupied by the new university buildings, completed in 1873; along with the
                    new exchange on the south side of the Pregel, they are the finest architectural
                    feature of the town. The university was founded iu 1544 by Albert L, duke of
                    Prussia; it possesses a library of 200,000 volumes. Among its famous professors
                    have been Kant (born iu Königsberg in 1724), to whom a monument was erected in
                    1864, Herder, Herbart, Bessel, Voigt, K. E. von Baer, F. Neumann, and others. In
                    the summer session of 1880 it had a teaching staff of 88; in the winter session
                    1880-81 its students numbered 808. Königsberg has also four gymnasia, two
                    commercial schools of the first rank, an academy of painting with a public
                    picture gallery, and a school of music, besides other educational
                    establishments. The hospitals and benevolent institutions are numerous. The
                    protected position of its harbour has made Königsberg one of the important
                    trading cities of Germany. Ships of more than 1500 tons have to discharge cargo
                    at Pillau, at the entrance to the Haff, connected with Königsberg by rail; and
                    the grain trade with the interior is carried on by barges. The chief imports and
                    exports of Königsberg are grain, spirits, colonial wares (especially tea),
                    petroleum, coal, iron, herrings, flax, hemp, and wood. The exports by sea for
                    the third quarter of 1881 amounted to 46,508 tons, and the imports from Russia
                    alone to 42,479 tons The number of ships that entered Königsberg and Pillau in
                    1879 was 1653 (278,000 tons); the number that cleared was 1656 (299,000 tons).
                    The corresponding figures for 1880 were not so large. The manufactures of
                    Königsberg are not very important. They include iron, machinery, beer, spirits,
                    sail-cloth, cloth, oil, flour, leather, and its specialty “marchpane.” There is
                    also yarn-spinning, cloth-printing, dyeing, tanning, and tobacco manufacture.
                    The population, in 1858 only 83,000, was 140,896 in 1880.</p>
                <p>The Altstadt of Königsberg grew up around the castle built in 1255 by the
                    Teutonic Order, to restrain the neighbouring heathens. Its first site was near
                    the fishing village of Steindamm, but after its destruction by the Prussians in
                    1263 it was rebuilt in its present position. By 1327 all three parts, which were
                    only united in 1724 by Frederick William I., had acquired city rights. In 1340
                    Königsberg entered the Hanseatic League; and in 1361 it was in direct alliance
                    with England. From 1457 it was the residence of the grand master of the Teutonic
                    Order, and from 1525 till 1618 of the dukes of Prussia. The trade of Königsberg
                    was much hindered by the constant shifting and silting up of the channels
                    leading to its harbour; and the great northern wars did it immense harm. By the
                    end of the 17th century it had almost recovered; and during the 19th century the
                    opening of the railway system in East Prussia and Russia gave its commerce a new
                    departure, making it the principal outlet for the Russian staples—grain, seeds,
                    flax, and hemp. It has now regular steam communication with Memel, Stettin,
                    Kiel, Amsterdam, and Hull. The local shipping is unimportant.</p>
