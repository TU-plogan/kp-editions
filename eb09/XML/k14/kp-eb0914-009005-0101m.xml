                    medicine in 1757 by Fothergill, an eminent physician and patron of economic
                    botany. When described by him it was believed to have been brought from the
                    river Gambia <pb break="no"

                    factor to the Royal African Company, the tree yielding the drug is known in the
                    Mandingo language as “kano.” When first imported, however, it was sold in
                    England as <hi rend="italic">Gummi</hi><hi rend="italic">rubrum astringens
                    Gambiense.</hi> It was introduced into the Edinburgh pharmacopoeia in 1776 under
                    the above name, and into the London pharmacopoeia in 1787 under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Resina kino.</hi> Specimens of the plant sent home by Mungo Park
                    in 1805 were recognized as identical with <hi rend="italic">Pterοcarpus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">erinaceus,</hi> Poiret. In 1811 the African drug was no longer to
                    be met with in English commerce, its place being supplied by several other
                    kinds.</p>
                <p>The drug which is at present recognized as the legitimate kind is East Indian,
                    Malabar, or Amboyna kino, and is obtained from <hi rend="italic">Pteτocarpus
                    Marsupium,</hi> Roxb. <hi rend="italic">(Leguminosen).</hi> It is collected in
                    the Government forests of the Malabar coast, the collectors being required to
                    pay a small fee for the privilege, and to perform the tapping carefully and
                    without injuring the timber. The mode of obtaining the kino is by making a
                    perpendicular incision, with lateral ones leading into it, in the trunk, a
                    vessel being placed at the foot of the incision to receive the juice. When
                    exuding it resembles red currant jelly,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>African kino is very liquid and of an extremely pale red
                    colour when it first flows out, but soon coagulates and becomes of a deep
                    blood-red hue.</p></note> but hardens in a few hours after exposure to the air
                    and sun. When sufficiently dried it is packed into wooden boxes for exportation.
                    When these are opened it breaks up into angular brittle fragments of a
                    blackish-red colour and shining surface. In cold water it is only partially
                    dissolved, leaving a pale flocculent residue, which is soluble in boiling water,
                    but deposited again on cooling. In spirit of wine, sp. gr. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 838, it is entirely soluble, affording a solution
                    having an acid reaction, but the liquid by long keeping assumes a gelatinous
                    condition. It is also soluble in caustic alkalis and to a large extent in a
                    saturated solution of sugar, but is wholly insoluble in ether. In chemical
                    composition kino appears to be nearly allied to Pegu catechu, but differs from
                    it in not yielding catechin when exhausted by ether, but only a minute quantity
                    of scaly prismatic crystals of a substance which is soluble in cold water, and
                    thus more nearly resembles pyrocatechin. Pyrocatechin is, however, not present
                    in the fresh bark or wood of the tree. Etti (1878) states that he has obtained
                    kinoin, C <hi rend="subscript"> 14</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 32</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, from Malabar kino, while Hanbury and Fluckiger failed
                    to obtain it from that drug, but found it in Australian kino. According to
                    Bentley, kino-tannic acid, catechin (or probably pyrocatechin), and kino red are
                    the essential constituents of Malabar kino. The first of these is precipitated
                    from an aqueous solution of the drug by dilute mineral acids, and the last by
                    boiling an aqueous solution of kino-tannic acid for some time, when it separates
                    as a red precipitate. The chemical constitution of Malabar kino is therefore
                    only imperfectly known. The quantity of kino collected in Madras is
                    comparatively small, and is supposed not to exceed a ton or two annually, but it
                    is often shipped from Cochin.</p>
                <p>Bengal, Butea, or Palas kino—obtained from <hi rend="italic">Butea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">frondosa,</hi> Roxb. <hi rend="italic">(Leguminosae),</hi> a
                    native of India and Burmah, well known under the name of the Palas or Dhak tree,
                    and remarkable for its large orange papilionaceous flowers —also finds its way
                    occasionally into British commerce. A portion is also obtained from <hi
                    rend="italic">Butea</hi><hi rend="italic">superba,</hi> Roxb., and <hi
                    rend="italic">Butea parviflora,</hi> Roxb. Butea kino does not stick to the
                    teeth when chewed like ordinary kino, although like the latter it gives a red
                    tinge to the saliva. It is usually more or less mixed with small fragments of
                    bark. It is almost completely soluble in water, and to the extent of 46 per
                    cent, in boiling alcohol, but different specimens vary in solubility. It is
                    believed to contain about half its weight of kino-tannic acid, the remainder
                    consisting of a soluble mucilaginous substance, and a minute quantity of
                    pyrocatechin, which can be extracted by ether. In India Butea kino is used
                    instead of the Malabar kino, and is called by the Hindus kueni or kuenee.</p>
                <p>Botany Bay, Australian, or Eucalyptus kino is a more or less resinous astringent
                    exudation obtained from several species of <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus.</hi> It
                    is found in flattened cavities in the trunks, and is mostly collected by sawyers
                    and woodsplitters. It frequently comes into the London market, and the best
                    variety, probably the product of <hi rend="italic">E.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >corymbοsa,</hi> Sm., is used under the name of “red gum” in the preparation of
                    astringent lozenges for sore throat. According to Wiesner of Vienna, Australian
                    kino contains a little catechin (a statement doubted by Fluckiger) and
                    pyrocatechin, no pectinous matter, but a gum nearly allied to that of acacia.
                    Fluckiger also obtained from it kinoin, C <hi rend="subscript"> 14</hi> H <hi

                <p>Between 1808 and 1820 a substance was met with in French commerce under the name
                    of Jamaica kino, which is said to have been prepared by inspissating the juice
                    of the seaside grape, <hi rend="italic">Coccoloba</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >uvifera,</hi> L. <hi rend="italic">(Polygonaceae).</hi> When powdered it has a
                    somewhat bituminous odour and an astringent slightly bitter taste. It is but
                    little soluble in cold water or alcohol, but dissolves almost entirely in
                    boiling water, and to the extent of about 75 per cent, in hot alcohol. In thin
                    laminae it is only semi-transparent, the fragments usually met with in commerce
                    being quite opaque. In 1835 an article appeared in French commerce under the
                    name of “kino de la Colombie,” which is stated in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des Drogues</hi> to be in all probability an
                    extract of the bark of <hi rend="italic">Hhizophora Mangle,</hi> L. A liquid
                    kino is obtained from <hi rend="italic">Pterocarpus indicus,</hi> which does not
                    harden like that obtained from <hi rend="italic">P. Marsupium.</hi> Although
                    used in India it is not imported into Europe. Other varieties of kino are
                    mentioned in the same work, but they must be regarded rather in the light of
                    curiosities than as articles of commerce.</p>
                <p>Kino is used in medicine as an astringent, chiefly in the form of tincture; but,
                    owing to its tendency to gelatinize, that preparation is much less used than
                    formerly.</p>
