                    a maritime county in the east of Scotland, is situated between 56° 46' and 57°
                    9' N. lat., and between 2° 3' and 2° 47' W. long. It is bounded on the E. by the
                    German Ocean, on the N.W. by Aberdeenshire, and on the S.W. by Forfarshire. Its
                    length along the coast from the mouth of the North Esk to that of the Dee is 31
                    miles, and its breadth east to west from Dunnottar to Mount Battock 22 miles.
                    The total area is 248,284 acres, or about 388 square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The Grampian range of mountains intersects the
                    county from east to west, and occupies a breadth of about 8 miles in the western
                    and north-western districts, terminating in the north-eastern corner in the
                    promontory of Girdleness. To the north the county slopes into the picturesque"
                    and finely wooded valley of the Dee, and towards the south into the “How (or
                    hollow) of the Mearns,” a continuation of the valley of Strathmore, but it rises
                    again into smaller eminences towards the coast. The highest summit of the
                    Grampians in Kincardineshire is Mount Battock, 2465 feet, but a considerable
                    number range from 1500 to a little above 2000 feet. The southern part of the
                    coast from the North Esk is rocky but low, with considerable stretches of sand;
                    from Bervie to Stonehaven it rises into an almost unbroken line of perpendicular
                    cliffs ranging from 100 to 250 feet in height; from Stonehaven to the mouth of
                    the Dee it is still more bold and rocky, but at the same time more frequently
                    interrupted by creeks and bays, which form natural harbours for a number of
                    fishing villages. The greater part of the county belongs to the Upper Silurian
                    strata of the Highlands, consisting chiefly of gneiss, but towards the west
                    there is a large eruption of granite, and the southern half of the county
                    belongs to the upper strata of Old Red Sandstone. Conglomerate occurs on the
                    coast, and porphyry, sandstone, and whinstone in the southern part of the
                    county. Lime is found, but not in amount sufficient to meet agricultural wants,
                    and large quantities are imported.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Divers and Lakes.—</hi> The principal rivers are the Dee, which
                    skirts the northern boundary of the county, and receives the Feugh at Banchory,
                    where are the beautiful falls of Feugh; the North Esk, which after entering it
                    from Forfarshire, receives the tributary of the Luther, and forms a portion of
                    the south-western boundary of the shire; the Bervie, which rises in the
                    Grampians, and after flowing south-eastwards for about 10 miles, falls into the
                    sea at Bervie; and the Carron and Cowie, which flow the one eastward and the
                    other south-eastward to the sea at Stonehaven. The principal lakes are the Loch
                    of Drum, lately reduced from 300 to 100 acres, and Loirston Loch, 27 acres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate, Soil, and Agriculture.—</hi> The climate is healthy,
                    but, except on the north side of the Dee, often cold even on the low grounds,
                    owing both to exposure to east winds, especially near the sea-coast, and to the
                    proximity of bleak and chilly uplands. It has, however, been greatly improved by
                    extensive drainage of the marshes. The mean annual is 45’ Fahr., that of summer
                    being 58°, and of winter <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> As, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>37°. A great part of the mountainous district is unsuitable for either pasturage
                    or tillage, and is occupied chiefly by deer forests and grouse moors; but the
                    land in the valley of the Dee, in the “How,” and along the coast is very
                    productive, and is cultivated according to the most advanced methods. A
                    considerable portion of the “How” is, however, on account of the difficulty of
                    drainage, still occupied by moor and moss. The land in this district is richer
                    and stronger than that in the valley of the Dee, but the most fertile region is
                    that along the sea-coast, the soil consisting more generally of a deep loam
                    resting on clay, although in some places it is poor and thin, or stiff and
                    cold.</p>
                <p>According to the agricultural returns for 1881, the total area under crops was
                    120,631 acres, a percentage of 48 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6, that for
                    1870 being 47 1. The area under corn crops was 44,803; under green crops,
                    22,476; under rotation grasses, 46,645; under permanent pasture, 6552 acres. The
                    area under woods was 27,880 acres, while 12 acres were under nursery grounds,
                    and 23 under market gardens. About two-thirds of the area under corn crops is
                    occupied by oats, which in 1881 covered 31,430 acres, while 12,120 acres were
                    under barley, and 577 acres, chiefly in the neighbourhood of the sea-coast, were
                    under wheat, the area of which has been rapidly declining, 55 under rye, 581
                    under beans, and 40 under pease. Of green crops about four-fifths of the area is
                    tinder turnips and swedes, which in 1881 occupied 18,304 acres, 3696 being
                    occupied by potatoes, 450 by vetches and similar crops, 17 by carrots, and 8 by
                    cabbage. Flax occupied 1 acre, and there were 184 acres fallow. Great
                    improvements have lately been effected in regard to farm buildings and
                    drainage.</p>
                <p>The total number of horses, many of which are well-bred Clydesdales, in 1881 was
                    4798. Of these, 3893 are stated to be used solely for agricultural purposes, and
                    905 to be kept solely for breeding purposes. Cattle in 1881 numbered 25,013, or
                    an average of 21 to every 100 acres under cultivation, the average for Scotland
                    being 23'9. Much attention is paid to the rearing of stock, and cattle feeding
                    is carried on according to the most advanced methods. The most common breed is
                    the shorthorn, which are bought in for feeding from Ireland, but a few Canadian
                    cattle have also lately been bought. The more common home-bred stock is a cross
                    between shorthoraed and polled; but there are also many valuable herds of the
                    pure polled breed. Sheep in 1881 numbered 24,966, an average of 20 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 to every 100 acres under cultivation, the average
                    for Scotland being 141‘3. Blackfaced sheep are of course those chiefly kept on
                    the hill pastures, but on the lowland farms Cheviots or a cross with Leicesters
                    are not uncommon. The number of pigs in 1881 was 1967.</p>

                <p>It will thus be seen that about three-fifths of the holdings are under 50 acres
                    in extent, but that their number has within recent years been diminishing.
                    According to the <hi rend="italic">Owners of Lands and Heritages Return,</hi>
                    1872-73, the land, was divided among 1384 proprietors, possessing 244,585 acres,
                    with a gross annual value of £253,393. Of the owners, 1189 possessed less than 1
                    acre, and the average value per acre was £1, 0s. 6⅛d. Sir Thomas Gladstone owned
                    45,062 acres; Earl of Kintore, 17,370; James Young, 16,659; Viscount Arbuthnott,
                    13,560; Sir J. H. Burnett, 12,025; R. W. Duff, 8722; Mrs Badenoch Nicolson,
                    8481; W. N. Forbes, 6528. A comprehensive account of the agriculture of
                    Kincardineshire, by James Macdonald, is contained in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society</hi> for 1881.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> Woollen manufactures are carried on at
                    Stonehaven, and flax-spinning and weaving at Bervie, Laurencekirk, and a few
                    other places. There are several breweries, tanneries, and distilleries. Fishing
                    gives employment to a number of persons in the sea-coast villages. The rental of
                    the salmon fishings on the coast is £7000, and of those on the rivers £1250 per
                    annum. There is some shipping at Stonehaven.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> The Caledonian Railway traverses the county
                    from Marykirk to the mouth of the Dee, and a branch line runs along the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The county comprises eighteen parishes
                    and three parts of parishes; one royal burgh, Bervie, which received its
                    constitution from David II. in return for the hospitality of the inhabitants
                    when he landed there through stress of weather; and one burgh of barony,
                    Stonehaven, which, since 1600, has been the capital of the county, the former
                    capital, Kincardine, in the parish of Fordouu, at which there was at one time a
                    royal castle, having now declined to the position of a mere hamlet. The county

                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Anciently Kincardine belonged to
                    the district of Picta via. Cairns and stone circles are frequent in nearly every
                    part of the shire, and there are numerous traces of Roman camps. According to
                    some the county received the name Mearas from having been granted to Merfiia, a
                    Scottish king, brother of the Angus who received the neighbouring county of
                    Forfar. The only old building of special interest is Dunnottar Castle near
                    Stonehaven, the old seat of the Keiths, earl marischals of Scotland. The castle
                    stands on a high projecting rock about 150 feet above the sea, by which it is
                    nearly surrounded, and was formerly an extensive fortress of great strength. In
                    the reign of James II. it was used as a prison for Nonconformists. Among the
                    eminent persons connected with Kincardine may be mentioned John of Fordoun the
                    historian, George Wishart, Robert Barclay the Quaker, Bishop Burnet, Dr John
                    Arbuthnott, Dr James Beattie, Dr Thomas Reid, and Lord Monboddo.</p>
