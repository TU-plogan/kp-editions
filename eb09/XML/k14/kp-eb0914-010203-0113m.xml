                    district in the Madras Presidency, India, lying between 15° 35' and 17° 10' N.
                    lat., and between 79° 14' and 81° 34' E. long., and bounded on the N. by
                    Godàvari, on the E. by the Bay of Bengal, on the S. by Nellore, and on the W. by
                    the NizArn’s Dominions and Karniil. Kistna is, speaking generally, a flat
                    country, but the interior is broken by a few low hills, the highest being 1857
                    feet above sea-level. The principal rivers are the Kistna, which cuts the
                    district into two portions known as the Masulipatam and Gantür divisions, and
                    the Munyeru, Paleru, and Naguleru (tributaries of the Gundlakamma and the
                    Kistna); the last only is navigable. The Kolar Lake, which covers an area of 21
                    by 14 miles, and the Romparu swamp are natural receptacles for the drainage on
                    the north and south sides of the Kistna respectively. Iron and copper exist, and
                    at one time the mines were worked; but the smelting of copper is now a thing of
                    the past, and that of iron is also dying out. Diamond mines are still worked, to
                    a very slight extent, in five villages belonging to the nizâm; and at other
                    places there are traces of mines which were abandoned long ago. Garnets and
                    small rubies are also found. There are no forests in the district. Every variety
                    of the game birds of India, except the pheasant, woodcock, and hill partridge,
                    abounds. The most deadly of poisonous snakes, the Russell viper, is common about
                    Masulipatam. The cobra, carpet snake, and one kind of <hi rend="italic"
                    >bangaras</hi><hi rend="italic">[Arcuatus)</hi> are also met with.</p>
                <p>The census of 1871 returned the population of Kistna district at 1,452,374
                    (1,373,089 Hindus, 78,937 Mohammedans, 90 Europeans, 218 Eurasians, and 36
                    “others ”). As a whole the people are poor, except in the fertile Godavari
                    delta. The cultivated area, exclusive x&gt;f <hi rend="italic">zamindari</hi>
                    estates, in 1875-76, was returned at 1,907,213 acres, cultivable but not under
                    tillage 981,377 acres, and waste 1,215,853 acres. The principal agricultural
                    products are rice, maize, <hi rend="italic">rdgi,</hi> pulses, hemp, flax,
                    cotton, tobacco, gingelly, oil-seeds, chilies, wheat, garlic, indigo. The delta
                    is irrigated by the Kistna river, which in 1875 watered 218,029 acres. A
                    considerable trade is earned on in dressed hides at Bezwara. The inland villages
                    carry on weaving from native hand-made cotton or silk thread. The chief exports
                    are cotton and indigo. The total revenue in 1870-71 amounted to £548,469, of
                    which £359,172 was derived from the land. The number of cultivators’ holdings in
                    1871 was 137,880, owned by 169,036 proprietors or coparceners.</p>
                <p>The early history of Kistna is inseparable from that of the northern Circars and
                    Godavari district. DharanikotA and the adjacent town of AmarAvati were the seats
                    of early Hindu and Buddhist Governments; and the more modern RAjAmahendri
                    (Rajahmundry) owed its importance to later dynasties. The Chalukyas here gave
                    place to the Ganapatis, who in turn were ousted by the Reddi chiefs, who
                    flourished during the 14th century, and built the forts of Bellamkonda,
                    Kondavir, and Kondapalli. On the death of one of these, at the commencement of
                    the 15th century, Deva Rayalu, of the Vijayanagar dynasty, seized the country
                    and held it until Mohammed II. (1463-86), a Moslem king of the Bahmani line,
                    wrested this portion of his kingdom from him. The power of the Bahmani dynasty
                    failed towards the end of the 15th century. Kuli Kutab Shah became king of
                    Golconda about 1512 A.n., and his kingdom included the whole of what is now the
                    Masulipatam portion of Kistna district. On the other side of the Kistna,
                    Narasinha Deva RAyalu ruled at this time. His territory, which included Gantür,
                    was annexed to Golconda by Kutab Shah’s great-grandson, about 1600. This line of
                    kings ended with Tanisha, <pb break="no"

                    the English had, in 1622, established a small factory at Masulipatam, where they
                    traded with varying fortune till 1750, when the French took possession of it
                    From 1759, when it was recaptured by Colonel Forde, with a force sent by Lord
                    Clive from Calcutta, the power of the English in the greater part of the
                    district was complete. In 1765 the entire administration was assumed by the
                    Company; but the absolute right of sovereignty was not obtained until 1823.</p>
