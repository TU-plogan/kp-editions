                    irregular square, extending for about sixty miles in each direction, and this
                    area, which is for the most part level, is enclosed by well-marked boundaries—by
                    the Cambunian Mountains on the north, and by Othrys on the south, while on its
                    western side runs the massive chain of Pindus, which is the backbone of this
                    part of Greece, and towards the east Ossa and Pelion stand in a continuous line;
                    at the north-eastern angle Olympus rises, and is the keystone of the whole
                    mountain system. The elevation of some of the summits in these ranges is
                    considerable, for three of the peaks of Pindus are over 5000 feet, and Olympus,
                    Ossa, and Pelion reach respectively the height of 9754, 6407, and 5310 feet. The
                    country that is contained within these limits is drained by a single river, the
                    Peneius, which, together with the water of its numerous confluents, passes into
                    the sea through the Vale of Tempe. This place, which the Greeks were accustomed
                    to associate with rural delights, is a chasm, cloven in the rocks, as the fable
                    tells us, by the trident of Poseidon, between Olympus and Ossa; but though it
                    possesses every element of the sublime, yet its features are soft and beautiful,
                    from the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n316/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0316-0299"/> broad winding river, the luxuriant vegetation,
                    and the glades that at intervals open out at the foot of the cliffs. It is about
                    four miles and a half long, and towards the middle of the pass, where the rocks
                    are highest, the precipices in the direction of Olympus fall so steeply as to
                    bar the passage on that side; but those which descend from Ossa are the
                    loftiest, for they rise in many places not less than 1500 feet from the valley.
                    Owing to the length and narrowness of the ravine, it was a position easily
                    defended, but still it offered a practicable entrance to an invading force, in
                    consequence of which a number of castles were built at different times at the
                    strongest points. On the north side of Thessaly there was an important pass from
                    Petra in Pieria by the western side of Olympus, debouching on the plain
                    northward of Larissa; it was by this that Xerxes entered, and we learn from
                    Herodotus (vii. 173) that, when the Greeks discovered the existence of this
                    passage, they gave up all thoughts of defending Tempe. On the side of Epirus the
                    main line of communication passed over that part of Pindus which was called
                    Mount Lacmon, and descended the upper valley of the Peneius to Aeginium in the
                    north-west angle of Thessaly, near which place now stand the extraordinary
                    monasteries of Meteora. This was the route by which Julius Caesar arrived before
                    the battle of Pharsalia. Another pass through the Pindus chain was that of
                    Gomphi, farther south, by means of which there was communication with the
                    Ambracian Gulf. The great southern pass was that of Caela, which crosses Mount
                    Othrys nearly opposite Thermopylae. These Thessalian passes were of the utmost
                    importance to southern Greece, as commanding the approaches to that part of the
                    country.</p>
                <p>Though Thessaly is the most level district of Greece, it does not present a
                    uniform unbroken surface, but is composed of a number of sections which open out
                    into one another, divided by ranges of hills. The principal of these were called
                    Upper and Lower Thessaly, the former comprising the western and south-western
                    part, which contains the higher course of the Peneius and all those of its
                    tributaries that flow from the south—the Enipeus, the Apidanus, the Onochonus,
                    and the Pamisus; while the latter, which reaches eastward to the foot of Ossa
                    and Pelion, is inundated in parts at certain seasons of the year by the Peneius,
                    the flood-water from which forms the lake Nessonis, and, when that is full,
                    escapes again and pours itself into the Lake of Baebe. The chief city of the
                    latter of these districts was Larissa; and the two were separated from one
                    another by a long spur, which runs southwards from the Cambunian Mountains on
                    the western side of that city. Again, when Thessaly is entered from the south by
                    the pass of Caela, another plain, containing a small lake, which was formerly
                    called Xynias, intervenes, and a line of low hills has to be crossed before the
                    town of Thaumaci is reached, which from its commanding position overlooks the
                    whole of the upper plain. The view from this point has been described by Livy in
                    the following remarkable passage :—“When the traveller, in passing through the
                    rugged districts of Thessaly, where the roads are entangled in the windings of
                    the valleys, arrives at this city, on a sudden an immense level expanse,
                    resembling a vast sea, is outspread before him in such a manner that the eye
                    cannot easily reach the limit of the plains extended beneath” (xxxii. 4). To the
                    north-eastwards of this, where a portion of the great plain begins to run up
                    into the mountains, the Plain of Pharsalia is formed, which is intersected by
                    the river Enipeus; and still farther in the same direction is the scene of
                    another great battle, Cynoscephalae. Thessaly was further subdivided into four
                    districts, of which Pelasgiotis embraced the lower plain of the Peneius, and
                    Hestiaeotis and Thessaliotis respectively the northern and the southern portions
                    of the upper plain; while the fourth, Phthiotis, which lies towards the
                    southeast, was geographically distinct from the rest of the country, being
                    separated from it by a watershed. The determining feature of this is the
                    Pagasaeus Sinus (Gulf of Volo), a landlocked basin, extending from Pagasae at
                    its head to Aphetae at its narrow outlet, where the chain of Pelion, turning at
                    right angles to its axis at the end of Magnesia, throws out a projecting line of
                    broken ridges, while on the opposite side rise the heights of Othrys. In the
                    heroic age this district was of great importance. It was the birthplace of Greek
                    navigation, for this seems to be implied in the story of the Argonauts, who
                    started from this neighbourhood in quest of the golden fleece. From it the great
                    Achilles came, and, according to Thucydides (i. 3), it was the early home of the
                    Hellenic race. The site of Iolcus, the centre of so many poetic legends, is at
                    no great distance from the modern Volo. Near that town also, at a later period,
                    the city of Demetrias was founded by Demetrius Poliorcetes, who called it one of
                    the three fetters of Greece, Chalcis and Corinth being the other two.</p>
                <p>The history of Thessaly is closely connected with its geography. The fertility of
                    the land offered a temptation to invaders, and was thus the primary cause of the
                    early migrations. It was this motive which first induced the Thessalians to
                    leave their home in Epirus and descend into this district, and from this
                    movement arose the expulsion of the Boeotians from Arne, and their settlement in
                    the country subsequently called Baeotia; while another wave of the same tide
                    drove the Dorians also southward, whose migrations changed the face of the
                    Peloponnese. Again, this rich soil was the natural home of a powerful
                    aristocracy, such as the families of the Aleuadae of Larissa and the Scopadae of
                    Crannon; and the absence of elevated positions was unfavourable to the
                    foundation of numerous cities, which might have fostered the spirit of freedom
                    and democracy. The plains, also, were suited to the breeding of horses, and
                    consequently the force in which the Thessalian nation was strong was cavalry, a
                    kind of troops which has usually been associated with oligarchy. The wealth and
                    the semi-Hellenic character of the people—for in race, as in geographical
                    position, the Thessalians held an intermediate place between the non-Hellenic
                    Macedonians and the Greeks of pure blood— caused them to be wanting in
                    patriotism, so that at the time of the Persian wars we find the Aleuadae making
                    common cause with the enemies of Greece. When they were united they were a
                    formidable power, but, like other half-organized communities, they seldom
                    combined for long together, and consequently they influenced but little the
                    fortunes of the Greeks.</p>
                <p>For several centuries during the Middle Ages Roumanian immigrants formed so large
                    a part of the population of Thessaly that that district was called by the
                    Byzantine writers Great Walachia <hi rend="italic">(Μεγάλη</hi> Βλαχία): the
                    Jewish traveller, Benjamin of Tudela, who passed through the country in the
                    latter half of the 12th century, describes them as then occupying it. At the
                    present day only a few colonies of that race remain, the principal of which are
                    found on the western side of Olympus and in some of the gorges of Pindus. The
                    Turkish inhabitants are settled in the larger towns, and here and there in the
                    country districts, the most important colony being those called Koniarates, who
                    were brought from Konieh in Asia Minor shortly before the taking of
                    Constantinople, and planted under the south-west angle of Olympus. The Greeks,
                    however, form the vast majority of the population, so much so that, even while
                    the country belonged to the Ottomans, Greek was employed as the official
                    language. In accordance with the provisions of the Berlin treaty, Thessaly was
                    ceded to the Greeks by the Porte in 1881, and since that period it has formed a
                    portion of the Hellenic kingdom. (H. F. T.)</p>
