                    miles, and a population roughly estimated at about 500,000. Timor lies in deep
                    water a little to the west of the hundred fathom line, which marks in this
                    direction the proper limit of the shallow Arafura Sea, flowing between it and
                    northern Australia. It differs considerably from the other members of the
                    Sundanese group both in the lie of its main axis (south-west and north-east
                    instead of west and east), and in the great prevalence of old rocks, such as
                    schists, slates, sandstones, carboniferous limestones, and other more recent
                    sedimentary formations, and in its correspondingly slighter volcanic character.
                    It comes, however, within the great volcanic zone which sweeps in a vast curve
                    from the northern extremity of Sumatra, through Java and the other Sundanese
                    islands, round to Amboina, Tidor, Ternate, Jilolo, and the Philippines. There
                    appear to be at least two quiescent and other extinct cones, and the surface is
                    everywhere extremely rugged and mountainous, with numerous irregular ridges from
                    4000 to 8000 feet high, forming altogether a very confused orographic system.
                    Mount Kabalaki in the eastern district of Manufahi rises above 10,000 feet (H.
                    O. Forbes); the culminating point appears to be Mount Allas (11,500 feet) near
                    the south coast. Owing to the prevalent dry easterly winds from the arid plains
                    of North Australia, Timor, like Ombay, Flores, and other neighbouring islands,
                    has a much drier climate, with a correspondingly poorer vegetation, than Java,
                    and has few perennial streams and no considerable rivers. Hence, apart from
                    almost untouched and unsurveyed stores of mineral wealth, such as iron, copper,
                    and gold, which occur apparently in considerable quantities at several points,
                    the island is poor in natural resources. The uplands, however, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n417/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0417-0398"/> yield good wheat and potatoes, while the
                    woodlands, which nowhere form veritable forests, contain much excellent
                    sandalwood. This and a noted breed of hardy ponies form the chief articles of
                    export. Owing doubtless to the zone of deep water flowing between Timor and the
                    Arafura Sea, the fauna of Timor presents, beyond a marsupial cuscus, scarcely
                    any Australian types. The few mammals, such as a deer, a civet, a pig, a shrew,
                    and monkeys, as well as the birds and insects, resemble ordinary Malayan forms
                    as met with in Java and more especially in Celebes and the Moluccas. In its
                    natural history, as well as its physical constitution and oceanic surroundings,
                    Timor is thus entirely separated from Australia and should perhaps be grouped
                    with Celebes, Buru, Ceram, and Jilolo as the surviving fragments of a Miocene
                    continent intervening between Asia and Australia, but at no time connected with
                    either.</p>
                <p>The bulk of the population is certainly Papuan, but intermingled in the most
                    varied proportions with Malayan, Indonesian, and other elements; hence it
                    presents an extraordinary diversity of physical types, as is clearly shown by
                    the portraits figured in H. 0. Forbes’s <hi rend="italic">Naturalist's
                    lVaìiderings in the Eastern Archipelago.</hi> The natives, still mainly
                    independent of their nominal Dutch and Portuguese rulers, are divided into a
                    large number of more or less hostile tribes, speaking as many as forty distinct
                    Papuan and Malayan languages or dialects. Some are extremely rude and still
                    addicted to head-hunting, at least during war, and to other barbarous practices.
                    In their <hi rend="italic">uma-luli,</hi> or sacred (tabooed) enclosures, rites
                    are performed resembling those of the Pacific islanders.</p>
                <p>Politically Timor is divided between Holland and Portugal, the Dutch claiming the
                    western section of 4500 square miles and 200,000 inhabitants, the Portuguese the
                    eastern of nearly 6500 square miles and 300,000 inhabitants; the respective
                    capitals, centres of government, and outports are Kupang at the western
                    extremity and Deli on the north-east coast. But there are a large number of
                    practically independent petty states, as many as forty-seven in the Portuguese
                    territory alone, where they take the name of “renos,” or kingdoms, under
                    absolute “leoreis” or kinglets. The Dutch section forms with Sumba, Savu, Rotti,
                    and the surrounding islets a residency administered by a Dutch resident
                    stationed at Kupang, which has a population of 8000.</p>
