                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> When he became a member of the imperial family, the
                    court genealogists made him out to be one of the ancient patrician Claudii; but
                    the pedigree is at some points difficult to trace. His father, who bore the same
                    name, was an officer of Julius Caesar, who afterwards proposed to confer honours
                    on the assassins, then joined Mark Antony’s brother in his mad attack on
                    Octavian, took refuge with Mark Antony, and returned to Rome when the general
                    amnesty was proclaimed in 39 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Livia, the mother of
                    Tiberius, was also of the Claudian family, out of which her father had passed by
                    adoption into that of the Livii Drusi. Early in 38 Livia was amicably ceded to
                    Octavian (the future Augustus), and three months after her new marriage Drusus,
                    brother to Tiberius, was born. Livia had no children by Augustus, and therefore
                    devoted all her remarkable gifts to the advancement of her sons. They were
                    treated with high consideration by the emperor, yet Augustus held firmly to the
                    hope that his throne might be filled on his death by one in whose veins ran the
                    blood of the Octavii; and not till Tiberius was past forty did there appear any
                    probability that he would ever rise to be emperor. He passed through the list of
                    state offices in the usual princely fashion, beginning with the quaestorship at
                    the age of eighteen, and attaining the consulate for the first time at
                    twenty-nine. From the great capacity for civil business which he displayed as
                    emperor it may be inferred that he applied himself with determination to learn
                    the business of government.</p>
                <p>But from 22 to 6 <hi rend="smallcaps">b c.</hi> and again from 4 to 10 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> by far the greater part of Tiberius’s life was spent
                    in the camp. His first service was. as legionary tribune in one of the desperate
                    and arduous wars which led to peace in the Spanish peninsula through the
                    decimation, or rather the extermination, of the rebellious tribes. In 20 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Augustus sent Tiberius with an army to seat Tigranes
                    of Armenia on the throne as a Roman vassal. As Tiberius approached the frontier
                    of Armenia, he found its throne vacant through the assassination of the king,
                    and Tigranes stepped into his place without a blow being struck. Tiberius
                    crowned Tigranes king with his own hand. Then the Parthian monarch grew alarmed
                    and surrendered “the spoils and the standards of three Roman armies.” The senate
                    ordered a thanksgiving such as was usually celebrated in honour of a great
                    victory. The following year was passed by Tiberius as governor of Transalpine
                    Gaul. In the next year (15) he was despatched to aid his brother Drusus in
                    subjugating the Raeti and Vindelici, peoples dwelling in the mountainous region
                    whence the Rhine, Rhone, and Danube take their rise.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes,</hi> iv.
                    14.</p></note> Drusus attacked from the eastern side, while Tiberius operated
                    from the upper waters of the Rhine, and by stern measures the mountaineers were
                    reduced to a state of quietude, and could no longer cut communications between
                    northern Italy and Gaul, nor prosecute their raids in both countries. In 12 B.c.
                    Agrippa, the great general of Augustus, to whom he may be almost said to have
                    owed his throne, and who was its chief support, died at the age of fifty-one,
                    leaving Julia, the emperor’s only child, a widow. Agrippina, daughter of Agrippa
                    by an earlier marriage, was wife of Tiberius, and had borne him a son, Drusus,
                    afterwards father of Germanicus. Livia with great difficulty prevailed upon
                    Augustus to replace Agrippa by Tiberius, who was compelled to exchange Agrippina
                    for Julia, to his bitter grief. During the year of mourning for Agrippa, which
                    delayed his new marriage, Tiberius was occupied with a victorious campaign
                    against the Pannonians, followed by successful expeditions in the three
                    succeeding summers. For his victories in the Danube regions, the emperor
                    conferred on him the distinctions which flowed from a military triumph in
                    republican times (now first separated from the actual triumph), and he enjoyed
                    the “ovation” or lesser form of triumphal entry into the capital. On the death
                    of Drusus in the autumn of 9 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Tiberius, whose
                    reputation had hitherto been eclipsed by that of his brother, stepped into the
                    position of first soldier of the empire. The army, if it did not warmly admire
                    Tiberius, entertained a loyal confidence in a leader who, as Velleius tells us,
                    always made the safety of his soldiers his first care. In the campaign of the
                    year after Drusus’s death Tiberius traversed all Germany between the Rhine and
                    the Elbe, and met with slight opposition. But it would be too much to believe
                    the statement of Velleius that “he reduced Germany almost to the position of a
                    tributary province.” He was rewarded with the full triumph, the military title
                    of “imperator,” and his second consulship, though the opposition of the powerful
                    Sugambri had been only broken by an act of treachery, the guilt of which should
                    perhaps be laid at the door of Augustus. In 7 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    there was another but insignificant campaign in Germany. Next year Augustus
                    bestowed on his stepson the tribunician authority for five years. Tiberius was
                    thus in the most formal manner associated with the emperor in the conduct of the
                    government on the civil side; but Tacitus <hi rend="italic">(Ann.,</hi> iii. 56)
                    goes too far when he says that this promotion marked him out as the heir to the
                    throne.</p>
                <p>Tiberius now suddenly begged permission to retire to Rhodes and devote himself to
                    study. He seems to have declined absolutely at the time to state his reasons for
                    this course, but he obstinately adhered to it, in spite of the tears of Livia
                    and the lamentations of Augustus to the senate that his son had betrayed him. If
                    we may believe Suetonius, Tiberius determined to commit suicide by abstention
                    from food, and Augustus only gave way when this design was all but accomplished.
                    The departure from Italy was as secret as it could be made. Years afterwards,
                    when Tiberius broke silence about his motives, he declared that he had retired
                    in order to allow the young princes, Gaius and Lucius, sons of Julia, a free
                    course. There was perhaps a portion of the truth wrapped up in this declaration.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0353-0336"/> to avoid the young Marcellus, Tiberius had
                    clearly no taste to become the servant of the two children whom Augustus had
                    adopted in their infancy and evidently destined to be joint emperors after his
                    death. But it may well be believed that Tiberius, unlike Agrippa, had no burning
                    ambition to see himself in the place destined for his stepsons; and it may have
                    been in his eyes one of the attractions of exile that it released him from the
                    obligation to aid in carrying out the far-reaching designs which Livia cherished
                    for his sake. But the contemporaries of Tiberius were no doubt right in
                    believing that the scandal of Julia’s life did more than all else to render his
                    position at Rome intolerable. His conduct to her from first to last gives a
                    strong impression of his dignity and self-respect. When at last the emperor’s
                    eyes were opened, and he inflicted severe punishment upon his daughter, her
                    husband, now divorced by the emperor’s act, made earnest intercession for her,
                    and did what he could to alleviate her suffering. At Rhodes Tiberius lived
                    simply, passing his time mainly in the company of Greek professors, with whom he
                    associated on pretty equal terms. He acquired a very considerable proficiency in
                    the studies of the day, among which must be reckoned astrology. But all his
                    attempts at composition, whether in prose or verse, were laboured and obscure.
                    After five years’ absence from Rome, he begged for leave to return; but the boon
                    was angrily refused, and Livia λvith difficulty got her son made nominally a
                    legate of Augustus, so as in some. degree to veil his disgrace. The next two
                    years were spent in solitude and gloom. Then, on the intercession of Gaius,
                    Augustus allowed Tiberius to come back to Rome, but on the express understanding
                    that he was to hold aloof from all public functions,—an understanding which he
                    thoroughly carried out.</p>
                <p>He had scarcely returned before death removed (2 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi>
                    Lucius, the younger of the two princes, and a year and a half later Gaius also
                    died. The emperor was thus left with only one remaining male descendant, Agrippa
                    Postumus, youngest son of Julia, and still a boy. Four months after Gaius’s
                    death Augustus adopted Agrippa and at the same time Tiberius. The emperor now
                    indicated clearly his expectation that Tiberius would be his principal
                    successor. The two essential ingredients in the imperial authority—the <hi
                    rend="italic">proconsulare</hi><hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">tribunicia potestas</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> were conferred on
                    Tiberius, and not on Agrippa, who was too young to receive them. Tiberius’s
                    career as a general now began anew. In two or three safe rather than brilliant
                    campaigns he strengthened immensely the Roman hold on Germany, and established
                    the winter camps of the legions in the interior, away from the Rhine.</p>
                <p>In 5 A.D. it became necessary to attack Maroboduus, who by combining peoples
                    formerly hostile to each other had constructed a formidable power, with its
                    centre in Bohemia, menacing the Roman acquisitions in Germany, Noricum, and
                    Pannonia. The operations were conducted both from the Rhine and from the Danube,
                    Tiberius being in command of the southern army. Just as the decisive engagement
                    was about to take place, Tiberius learned that Pannonia and Dalmatia were aflame
                    with insurrection in his rear. He was therefore forced to conclude peace on
                    terms honourable to Maroboduus. The terror inspired in Italy by the Pannonian
                    and Dalmatian rebellion under the able chief Bato had had no parallel since the
                    invasion of the Cimbri and Teutones. The four serious campaigns which the war
                    cost displayed Tiberius at his best as a general. As he was about to celebrate
                    his well-won triumphs, the terrible catastrophe to Varus and his legions turned
                    the rejoicing into lasting sorrow, and produced a profound change in the Roman
                    policy towards Germany.</p>
                <p>Although Tiberius with his nephew and adopted son Germanicus made in 9 and 10 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> two more marches into the interior of Germany, the
                    Romans never again attempted to bound their domain by the Elbe, but clung to the
                    neighbourhood of the Rhine. Tiberius was thus robbed in great part of the fruit
                    of his campaigns; but nothing can deprive him of the credit of being a chief
                    founder of the imperial system in the lands of Europe. From the beginning of 11,
                    when he celebrated a magnificent triumph, to the time of the emperor’s death in
                    14 Tiberius remained almost entirely in Italy, and held rather the position of
                    joint emperor than that of expectant heir. Agrippa Postumus had proved his
                    incapacity beyond hope, and had been banished to a desolate island. In all
                    probability Tiberius was not present when Augustus died, although Livia spread
                    reports (eagerly amplified by Velleius) of an affectionate interview and a
                    lingering farewell.</p>
                <p>Tiberius ascended the throne at the age of fifty-six. What struck his
                    contemporaries most was his absolute impenetrability. As was said of a very
                    different man, the poet Gray, “he never spoke out.” All his feelings, desires,
                    passions, and ambitions were locked behind an impassable barrier, and had to be
                    interpreted by the very uncertain light of his external acts. It is recorded of
                    him that only once did he as commander take counsel with his officers concerning
                    military operations, and that was when the destruction of Varus’s legions had
                    made it imperatively necessary not lightly to risk the loss of a single soldier.
                    He was an unparalleled master of passive and silent dissimulation, and the
                    inevitable penalty of his inscrutability was widespread dislike and suspicion.
                    But behind his defences there lay an intellect of high power, cold, clear, and
                    penetrating all disguises. Few have ever possessed such mental vision, and he
                    was probably never deceived either about the weaknesses of others or about his
                    own. For the littleness and servility of public life in regions below the court
                    he entertained a strong contempt. It is a question whether he ever liked or was
                    liked by a single being; but he did his duty by those with whom he was connected
                    after a thorough though stern and unlovable fashion. As a general he commanded
                    the full confidence of his soldiers, though he was a severe disciplinarian; yet
                    the men of his own legions greeted his accession to the throne with a mutiny.
                    Tiberius proved himself capable in every department of the state more by virtue
                    of industry and application than by genius. His mind moved so slowly and he was
                    accustomed to deliberate so long that men sometimes made the mistake of deeming
                    him a weakling and a waverer. He was in reality one of the most tenacious of
                    men. When he had once formed an aim he could wait patiently for years till the
                    favourable moment enabled him to achieve it, and if compelled to yield ground he
                    never failed to recover it in the end. The key to much of his character lies in
                    the observation that he had in early life set before himself a certain ideal of
                    what a Roman in high position ought to be, and to this ideal he rigidly and
                    religiously adhered. He may in one sense be said to have acted a part throughout
                    life, but that part had entered into and interpenetrated his whole nature. His
                    ideal of character was pretty much that of the two Catos. He practised
                    sternness, silence, simplicity of life, and frugality as he deemed that they had
                    been practised by the Fabricii, the Curii, and the Fabii. That Tiberius’s
                    character was stained by vice before he became emperor no one who fairly weighs
                    the records can believe. The persuasion entertained by many at the end of his
                    life that he had been always a monster of wickedness, but had succeeded in
                    concealing the fact till he became emperor, has slightly, but only slightly,
                    discoloured the narratives we possess of his earlier years. The change which
                    came over him in the last years of his life seems to have been due to a kind of
                    constitutional clouding of the spirits, which made him what the elder Pliny
                    calls him, “the gloomiest of mankind,” and disposed him to brood over mysteries
                    and superstitions. As this gloom deepened his will grew weaker, his power tended
                    to fall into the hands of unworthy instruments, terrors closed in around his
                    mind, and his naturally clear vision was perturbed.</p>
                <p>The change of masters had been anticipated by the Roman world with apprehension,
                    but it was smoothly accomp!ished. Tiberius was already invested with the
                    necessary powers, and it may even be that the senate was not permitted the
                    satisfaction of giving a formal sanction to his accession. Agrippa Postumus was
                    put to death; but Livia may be reasonably regarded as the instigator of this
                    crime. Livia indeed expected to share the imperial authority with her son. At
                    first Tiberius allowed some recognition to the claim: but he soon shook himself
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n356/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0356-0337"/> free, and later became estranged from his mother
                    and held no communication with her for years before her death. The history of
                    Tiberius’s relations with other members of his family is hardly less miserable.
                    Perhaps with any other commander than Germanicus the dangerous mutiny of the
                    troops on the Rhine which broke out soon after Tiberius’s accession would have
                    ended in a march of the discontented legions upon the capital. The perilous
                    episode of Arminius caused the recall of Germanicus and his despatch to the East
                    on an honourable but comparatively inactive mission. The pride and passion of
                    Agrippina, the granddaughter of Augustus and wife of Germanicus, tended to open
                    a breach between her husband and the emperor. In his Eastern command Germanicus
                    found himself perpetually watched and even violently opposed by Piso, the
                    governor of Syria, who was suspected to have received secret orders from
                    Tiberius. When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi>
                    the populace of Rome combined with Agrippina in demanding vengeance upon Piso;
                    and the emperor was forced to disown him. The death of Germanicus was followed
                    four years later by that of Drusus. These two princes had been firm friends, and
                    Livilla, the wife of Drusus, was sister to Germanicus. Years afterwards it was
                    found that Drusus had fallen a victim to the treachery of his wife Livilla, who
                    had joined her ambition to that of the emperor’s minister of state Sejanus. When
                    Drusus died, Tiberius nominated two of Agrippina’s sons as his heirs. But
                    Sejanus had grown strong by nursing the emperor’s suspicions and dislike for the
                    household of Germanicus, and the mother and the princes were imprisoned on a
                    charge of crime. In his memoirs of his own life Tiberius declared that he killed
                    Sejanus because he had discovered that he entertained a mad rage against the
                    sons of Germanicus. But the destruction of Sejanus did not save Agrippina and
                    her two children. The third son, Gaius Caesar (Caligula), lived to become
                    emperor when Tiberius died in 37.</p>
                <p>Throughout his reign Tiberius strove earnestly to do his duty to the empire at
                    large; his guiding principle was to maintain with an almost superstitious
                    reverence the constitutional forms which had been constructed by Augustus. Only
                    two changes of moment were introduced. The imperial guard, hitherto only seen in
                    the city in small detachments, was by the advice of Sejanus encamped permanently
                    in full force close to the walls. By this measure the turbulence of the populace
                    was kept in check. The officer in command of the guard became at once the most
                    important of the emperor’s lieutenants. The other change was the practically
                    complete abolition of the old comitia. But the senate was treated with an almost
                    hypocritical deference, and a pedantically precise compliance with the old
                    republican forms was observed towards the senatorial magistrates. The care
                    expended by Tiberius on the provinces was unremitting. His favourite maxim was
                    that a good shepherd should shear the flock and not flay it. When he died he
                    left the subject peoples of the empire in a condition of prosperity such as they
                    had never known before and never knew again. Soldiers, governors, and officials
                    of all kinds were kept in wholesome dread of vengeance if they oppressed those
                    beneath them or encouraged irregularity of any kind. Strict economy permitted
                    light taxation and enabled the emperor to show generosity in periods of
                    exceptional distress. Public security both in Italy and abroad was maintained by
                    a strong hand, and commerce was stimulated by the improvement of communications.
                    Jurisdiction both within and without the capital was on the whole exercised with
                    steadiness and equity, and the laws of the empire were at many points improved.
                    The social and moral reforms of Augustus were upheld and carried further. Such
                    risings against the emperor’s authority as occurred within the Roman domain were
                    put down with no great difficulty. The foreign or rather the frontier policy was
                    a policy of peace, and it was pursued with considerable success. With few
                    exceptions the duties of the Roman forces on the borders were confined to
                    watching the peoples on the other side while they destroyed each other. On the
                    Rhine, at least, masterly inactivity achieved tranquillity which lasted for a
                    long period.</p>
                <p>The disrepute which attaches to the reign of Tiberius has come mainly from three
                    or four sources,—from the lamentable story of the imperial household, from the
                    tales of hideous debauchery practised in deep retirement at Capreae during the
                    last eleven years of the emperor’s life, from the tyranny which Sejanus was
                    permitted to wield in his master’s name, and from the political prosecutions and
                    executions which Tiberius encouraged, more by silent compliance than by open
                    incitement. The stories of immorality are recorded chiefly by Suetonius, who has
                    evidently used a poisoned source, possibly the memoirs of the younger Agrippina,
                    the mother of Nero. Tiberius loved to shroud himself in mystery, and such
                    stories are probably the result of unfriendly attempts to uplift the darkness.
                    If history ventures to doubt the blackness of Theodora, that of Tiberius grows
                    continually lighter under the investigations of criticism. Suetonius makes the
                    emperor’s condition to have been one of mania, issuing frequently in the
                    abandonment of all moral restraint. But in that case the authority of Tiberius,
                    which was as firmly upheld during the years spent at Capreae as it had been
                    earlier, must have fallen to pieces and come to an end. With respect to Sejanus
                    it is impossible to acquit Tiberius of blame. If he was deceived in his
                    favourite he must have been willing to be deceived. He conferred on Sejanus a
                    position as great as had been held by Agrippa during the reign of Augustus, and
                    the minister was actually, and all but formally, joint emperor. Of the
                    administrative ability of Sejanus there can be no question; but the charm and
                    secret of his power lay in the use he made of those apprehensions of personal
                    danger which seem never to have been absent from his master’s mind. The growth
                    of “delation,” the darkest shadow that lies on the reign, was in part a
                    consequence of the supremacy and the arts of Sejanus. Historians of Rome in
                    ancient times remembered Tiberius chiefly as the sovereign under whose rule
                    prosecutions for treason on slight pretexts first became rife, and the hateful
                    race of informers was first allowed to fatten on the gains of judicial murder.
                    Augustus had allowed considerable licence of speech and writing against himself,
                    and had made no attempt to set up a doctrine of constructive treason. But the
                    history of the state trials of Tiberius’s reign shows conclusively that the
                    straining of the law proceeded in the first instance from the eager flattery of
                    the senate, was in the earlier days checked and controlled to a great extent by
                    the emperor, and was by him acquiesced in after a time with a sort of
                    contemptuous indifference, till he developed, under the influence of his fears,
                    a readiness to shed blood.</p>
                <p>The principal authorities for the reign of Tiberius are Tacitus and Suetonius.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Annals of</hi> Tacitus were not published till nearly
                    eighty years after the death of Tiberius. He rarely quotes an authority by name.
                    In all probability he drew most largely from other historians who had preceded
                    him; to some extent he availed himself of oral tradition; and of archives and
                    original records he made some, but comparatively little, use. In his history of
                    Tiberius two influences were at work, in almost equal strength: on the one hand
                    he strives continually after fairness; on the other the bias of a man steeped in
                    senatorial traditions forbids him to attain it. Tacitus is certainly not among
                    the historians in whom our confidence grows by repeated reading. Suetonius was a
                    biographer rather than an historian, and the ancient biographer .was even less
                    given to exhaustive inquiry than the ancient historian; moreover Suetonius was
                    not gifted with great critical faculty, though he told the truth so far as he
                    could see it. His <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Twelve Caesars</hi> was written
                    nearly at the time when Tacitus was composing the <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi>
                    but was published a little later. Velleius Paterculus is by far the oldest
                    authority for any part of Tiberius’s life. He had been an officer under
                    Tiberius, and he eulogizes his old general enthusiastically,—feeling it
                    necessary, however, to do less than justice to the achievements of Germanicus.
                    To Velleius all defenders of Tiberius have eagerly appealed. In truth it is his
                    silence alone which affords any external aid in repelling the charges of Tacitus
                    and Suetonius, and the fact that Velleius published his work in the lifetime of
                    his master deprives that silence of its value. The eulogy of Sejanus which is
                    linked with that of Tiberius must needs shake faith in the scrupulousness of the
                    author. It is still doubtful whether Dio Cassius (whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi> ended with the year 229) in his narrative of the reign of Tiberius
                    is to any great extent independent of Tacitus. In recent times a considerable
                    mass of inscriptions has added to our knowledge of the administration of this
                    emperor. The chief account of Tiberius in English is that contained in Dean
                    Merivale’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Romans under the Empire.</hi> Mr
                    Beesly has written an interesting defence of him in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catiline,</hi><hi rend="italic">Clodius,</hi><hi rend="italic">and
                    Tiberius.</hi> The best recent history of this period is Hermann Schiller’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Geschichte der römischen Kaiserzeit</hi> (Gotha, 1883). Numerous
                    monographs relating to the reign have appeared in recent times on the Continent.
                    The principles of the imperial administration of the provinces by Tiberius have
                    been treated by Mommsen in the fifth volume of his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Rome,</hi> translated into English under the title of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Roman Provinces from Augustus to Diocletian.</hi> (J. 8. B.)</p>
