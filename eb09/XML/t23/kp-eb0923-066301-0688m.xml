                <p><label type="entry">TURNER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph Mallord
                    William</hi></label> (1775-1851), one of the greatest painters of the English
                    school, was born in London on 23d April 1775. His father, William Turner, a
                    native of Devonshire, kept a barber’s shop at 26 Maiden Lane, in the parish of
                    St Paul’s, Covent Garden; he was “a cheerful, talkative little man, with small
                    blue eyes, a parrot nose, projecting chin, and a fresh complexion indicative of
                    health.” Of the painter’s mother, Mary Marshall or Turner, little is known; she
                    is said to have been a person of ungovernable temper and towards the end of her
                    life became insane. Apparently the home in which Turner spent his childhood was
                    not a happy one, and this may account for much that was unsociable and eccentric
                    in his character. The earliest known drawing by Turner, a view of Margate
                    Church, dates from his ninth year. It was also about this time that he was sent
                    to his first school at New Brentford. Of education, as the term is generally
                    understood, he received but little. His father taught him to read, and this and
                    a few months at New Brentford and afterwards at Margate were all the schooling
                    he ever had; he never mastered his native tongue, nor was he able in after life
                    to learn any foreign language. Notwithstanding this lack of scholarship, one of
                    his strongest characteristics was a taste for associating his works with
                    personages and places of legendary and historical interest, and certain stories
                    of antiquity seem to have taken root in his mind very strongly. By the time
                    Turner had completed his thirteenth year his school days were over and his
                    choice of an artist’s career settled. In 1788-89 he was receiving lessons from
                    Palice, “a floral drawing master,” from T. Malton, a perspective draughtsman,
                    and from Hardwick, an architect. He also attended Paul Sandby’s drawing school
                    in St Martin’s Lane. Part of his time was employed in making drawings at home,
                    which he exhibited for sale in his father’s shop window, two or three shillings
                    being the usual price. He coloured prints for engravers, washed in backgrounds
                    for architects, went out sketching with Girtin, and made drawings in the
                    evenings for Dr Munro “for half a crown and his supper.” When pitied in after
                    life for the miscellaneous character of his early work, his reply was “Well! and
                    what could be better practice?” In 1789 Turner became a student of the Royal
                    Academy. He also worked for a short time in the house of Sir Joshua Reynolds,
                    with the idea, apparently, of becoming a portrait painter; but, the death of
                    Reynolds occurring shortly afterwards, this intention was abandoned. In 1790
                    Turner’s name appears for the first time in the catalogue of the Royal Academy,
                    the title of his solitary contribution being “View of the Archbishop’s Palace,
                    Lambeth.” About 1792 he received a commission from Walker, the engraver, to make
                    drawings for his <hi rend="italic">Copper-Plate Magazine,</hi> and this
                    topographical work took him to many interesting places. The natural vigour of
                    his constitution enabled him to cover much of the ground on foot. He could walk
                    from 20 to 25 miles a day with ease, his baggage at the end of a stick, making
                    notes and memoranda as he went. He rose early, worked hard all day, wasted no
                    time over his simple meals, and his homely way of living made him easily
                    contented with such rude accommodation as he chanced to find on the road. A year
                    or two after he accepted a similar commission to make drawings for the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pocket Magazine,</hi> and before his twentieth year he had
                    travelled over many parts of England and Wales. None of these magazine drawings
                    are remarkable for originality of treatment or for artistic feeling.</p>
                <p>Up to this time Turner had worked in the back room above his father’s shop. His
                    love of secretiveness and solitude had already begun to show itself. An
                    architect who often employed him to put in backgrounds to his drawings says, “he
                    would never suffer me to see him draw, but concealed all that he did in his
                    bed-room.”</p>
                <p>On another occasion, a visitor entering unannounced, Turner instantly covered up
                    his drawings, and, in reply to the intimation, “I’ve come to see the drawings
                    for—,”</p>
                <p>the answer was, “You shan’t see ’em, and mind that next time you come through the
                    shop, and not up the back way.” Probably the increase in the number of his
                    engagements induced Turner about this time to set up a studio for himself in
                    Hand Court, not far from his father’s shop, and there he continued to work till
                    he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy (1799).</p>
                <p>Until 1792 Turner’s practice had been almost exclusively confined to water
                    colours, and his early works show how much he was indebted to some of his
                    contemporaries. There are few of any note whose style he did not copy or adopt.
                    His first exhibited oil picture appeared in the Academy in 1793. In 1794-95
                    Canterbury Cathedral, Malvern Abbey, Tintern Abbey, Lincoln and Peterborough
                    Cathedrals, Shrewsbury, and King’s College Chapel, Cambridge, were among the
                    subjects exhibited, and during the next four years he contributed no less than
                    thirty-nine works to the Academy. In the catalogue of 1798 he first began to add
                    poetic quotations to the titles of his pictures; one of the very first of
                    these—a passage from Milton’s <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost—</hi> is in some
                    respects curiously prophetic of one of the future characteristics of his
                    art.</p>
                <p>“Ye mists and exhalations that now rise From hill or steaming lake, dusky or grey
                    Till the sun paints your fleecy skirts with gold, In honour of the world’s great
                    author lise.”</p>
                <p>This and several other quotations in the following years show that Turner’s mind
                    was now occupied with something more than the merely topographical element of
                    landscape, Milton’s <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> and Thomson’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Seasons</hi> being laid under frequent contribution for
                    descriptions of sunrise, sunset, twilight, or thunderstorm. Turner’s first visit
                    to Yorkshire took place in 1797. It seems to have braced his powers and possibly
                    helped to change the student into the painter. Until then his work had shown
                    very little of the artist in the higher sense of the term: he was little more
                    than a painstaking and tolerably accurate topographer, but even under these
                    conditions he had begun to attract the notice of his brother artists and of the
                    critics. England was, at the time, at a low point both in literature and art.
                    Among the artists De Loutherbourg and Morland were almost the only men of note
                    left. Hogarth, Wilson, Gainsborough, and Reynolds had passed away. Beechey,
                    Bourgeois, Garvey, Farington—names well-nigh forgotten now—were the Academicians
                    who painted landscape. The only formidable rivals Turner had to contend with
                    were De Loutherbourg and Girtin, and after the death of the latter in 1802 he
                    was left undisputed master of the field.</p>
                <p>It is not therefore surprising that the exhibition of his works in 1798 was
                    followed by his election to the associateship of the Royal Academy. That he
                    should have attained to this position before completing his twentyfourth year
                    says much for the wisdom and discernment of that body, which further showed its
                    recognition of his talent by electing him an Academician four years later.
                    Turner owed much to the Academy. Mr Ruskin says, “It taught him nothing.”
                    Possibly it had little to teach that he had not already been able to learn for
                    himself; at all events it was quick to see his genius and to confer its honours,
                    and Turner, naturally generous and grateful, never forgot this. He enjoyed the
                    dignity of Academician for nearly half a century, and during nearly the whole of
                    that period he took an active share in the direction of the Academy’s affairs.
                    His speeches are described as “confused, tedious, obscure, and extremely
                    difficult to follow”; but at council meetings he was ever anxious to allay anger
                    and bitter controversy. His opinions on art were always <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n689/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0689-0664"/> listened to with respect; but on matters of
                    business it was often difficult to know what he meant. His friend Chantrey used
                    to say, “He has great thoughts, if only he could express them.” When appointed
                    professor of perspective to the Royal Academy in 1808, this painful lack of
                    expression stood greatly in the way of his usefulness: he was often at a loss
                    for words to express his ideas, and when he had recourse to his notes he found
                    difficulty in reading them. Mr Ruskin says, “The zealous care with which Turner
                    endeavoured to do his duty is proved by a series of large drawings, exquisitely
                    tinted, and often completely coloured, all by his own hand, of the most
                    difficult perspective subjects, illustrating not only directions of line, but
                    effects of light, with a care and completion which would put the work of any
                    ordinary teacher to utter shame.” In teaching he would neither waste time nor
                    spare it. “If a student would take a hint, Turner was delighted and would go on
                    with him giving hint after hint; if he could not follow, he left him.
                    Explanations are wasted time; a man who can see understands a touch; a man who
                    cannot misunderstands an oration.” With his election to the associateship of the
                    Academy in 1799, Turner’s early struggles may be considered to have ended. He
                    had emancipated himself from hack work, had given up making topographical
                    drawings of castles and abbeys for the engravers—drawings in which mere local
                    fidelity was the principal object—and had taken to <hi rend="italic"
                    >composing</hi> as he drew. Local facts had become of secondary importance
                    compared with effects of light and colour. He had reached manhood, and with it
                    he abandoned topographical fidelity and began to paint his dreams, the visionary
                    faculty— the true foundation of his art—asserting itself, nature being used to
                    supply suggestions and materials.</p>
                <p>His pictures of 1797-99 had shown that he was a painter of no ordinary power, one
                    having much of the poet in him, and able to give expression to the mystery,
                    beauty, and inexhaustible fulness of nature. His work at this period is
                    described by Mr Ruskin as “stern in manner, reserved, quiet, grave in colour,
                    forceful in hand.”</p>
                <p>Turner’s visit to Yorkshire in 1797 was followed a year or two later by a second,
                    and it was on this occasion that he made the acquaintance, which afterwards
                    τipened into a long and staunch friendship, of Fawkes of Farnley Hall. From 1803
                    till 1820 Turner was a frequent visitor at Farnley. The large number of his
                    drawings still preserved there—English, Swiss, German, and Italian, the studies
                    of rooms, outhouses, porches, gateways, of birds shot while he was there, and of
                    old places in the neighbourhood—prove the frequency of his visits and his
                    affection for the place and for its hospitable master. A caricature, made by
                    Fawkes, and “thought by old friends to be very like,” shows Turner as “a little
                    Jewish-nosed man, in an ill-cut brown tail-coat, striped waistcoat, and enormous
                    frilled shirt, with feet and hands notably small, sketching on a small piece of
                    paper, held down almost level with his waist.” It is evident from all the
                    accounts given that Turner’s personal appearance was not of a kind to command
                    much attention or respect. This may have pained his sensitive nature, and led
                    him to seek refuge in the solitude of his painting room. Had he been inclined he
                    had abundant opportunity for social and friendly intercourse with his
                    fellow-men, but he gradually came to live more and more in a state of mental
                    isolation, keeping himself to himself, entirely absorbed in his art. “This man
                    must be loved for his works, for his person is not striking nor his conversation
                    brilliant,” is the testimony of Dayes, the water-colour painter (and Girtin’s
                    master), in 1804. Turner could never make up his mind to visit Farnley again
                    after his old friend’s death, and his voice would falter when he spoke of the
                    shores of the Wharfe.</p>
                <p>Turner visited Scotland in 1800, and in 1801 or 1802 he made his first tour on
                    the Continent. In the following year, of the seven pictures he exhibited six
                    were of foreign subjects, among them Bonneville, the Festival upon the Opening
                    of the Vintage of Mâcon, and the well-known Calais Pier in the National Gallery.
                    The last-named picture, although heavily painted and somewhat opaque in colour,
                    is magnificently composed and full of energy. A better idea of its masterly
                    composition can be formed from Mr Seymour Haden’s vigorous etching than from the
                    picture itself, which is now greatly darkened by time.</p>
                <p>In 1802, the year in which Turner became a Royal Academician, he took his old
                    father, who still carried on the barber business in Maiden Lane, to live with
                    him. The powder tax, imposed in 1795, drove out wigs and spoiled the old man’s
                    trade. “It is precisely,” says Mr Hamerton, “when the painter wins the full
                    honours of the Academy—honours which give a recognized and envied position in
                    London society—that he takes his father home; a meaner nature would have tried
                    to keep the old man at a safe distance.” Turner’s relations with his father were
                    of the most dutiful and filial kind to the last.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Turner’s father died in 1830, and the loss of
                    “poor old Dad,” as he used to call him, left a terrible void. He had lived in
                    his son’s house for nearly thirty years, looking after the frugal affairs of his
                    household, and making himself useful in various ways. It is said that he used to
                    prepare and strain his son’s canvases and varnish them when finished, which may
                    explain a saying of Turner’s that “his father used to begin and finish bis
                    pictures for him.” He also attended to the gallery in Queen Anne Street, showed
                    in visiters, and took care of the dinner, if he did not himself cook it. Turner
                    was never the same man after his father’s death, living a life of almost
                    complete isolation.</p></note></p>
                <p>In 1804 Turner made a second tour on the Continent, and in the following year
                    painted the Shipwreck and Fishing Boats in a Squall (in the Ellesmere
                    collection), seemingly in direct rivalry of Vandervelde, in 1806 the Goddess of
                    Discord in the Garden of the Hesperides (in rivalry of Poussin), and in 1807 the
                    Sun rising through Vapour (in rivalry of Claude).<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This spirit of rivalry showed itself early in
                    his career. He began by pitting himself against his contemporaries, and
                    afterwards, when his powers were more fully developed, against some of the old
                    masters, notably Vandervelde and Claude. During these years, while he kept up a
                    constant rivalry with artists living and dead, he was continuing his unresting
                    and untiring study of nature, and, while seemingly a mere follower of the
                    ancients, was accumulating that immense store of knowledge which in after years,
                    when his true genius asserted itself, he was to use to such purpose.</p></note>
                    The last two are notable works, especially the Sun. In after years it was one of
                    the works he left to the nation, on the special condition of its being hung
                    beside the Claudes in the National Gallery. In this same year (1807) Turner
                    commenced his most serious rivalry. Possibly it arose out of a desire to break
                    down Claude worship, the then prevailing fashion, and to show the public that
                    there was a living artist not unworthy of taking rank beside him. That the <hi
                    rend="italic">Liber Studiorum</hi> was suggested by the <hi rend="italic">Liber
                    Veritatis</hi> of Claude, and was intended as a direct challenge to that master,
                    is beyond doubt. . There is, however, a certain degree of unfairness to Claude
                    in the way in which the challenge was given. Claude made drawings in brown of
                    his pictures as they left the easel, not for publication, but merely to serve as
                    private memoranda. Turner’s <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi> drawings had no such
                    purpose, but were intended as a direct appeal to the public to judge between the
                    two artists. The first of the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi> drawings were made in
                    the autumn of 1806, the others at intervals till about 1815. They are of the
                    same size as the plates and carefully finished in sepia. About fifty of them are
                    now to be seen in the Turner rooms of the National Gallery. The issue of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Liber</hi> began in 1807 and continued at irregular intervals till
                    1819, when it stopped at the fourteenth number. Turner had resolved to manage
                    the publishing business himself, but in this he <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n690/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0690-0665"/> was not very successful. He soon quarrelled with
                    his engraver, F. C. Lewis, on the ground that he had raised his charges from
                    five guineas a plate to eight. He then employed Charles Turner, who agreed to do
                    fifty plates at the latter sum, but, after finishing twenty, he too wished to
                    raise his price, and, as a matter of course, this led to another quarrel.
                    Reynolds, Dunkarton, Lupton, Say, Dawe, and other engravers were afterwards
                    employed— Turner himself etching and mezzotinting some of the plates. Each part
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi> contained five plates, the subjects, divided
                    into “historical,” “pastoral,” “marine,” &amp;c., embracing the whole range of
                    landscape art. Seventy-one plates in all were published (including one as a gift
                    of the artist to his subscribers); ten other plates—more or less
                    completed—intended for the fifteenth and sixteenth numbers were never published,
                    the work being stopped for want of encouragement. Absence of method and business
                    habits may account for this. Turner is said to have got up the numbers in his
                    own house with the help of a female servant. The plates, which cost the
                    subscribers only five shillings apiece, were so little esteemed that in the
                    early quarter of the 19th century they were sometimes used for lighting fires.
                    So much has fashion, or public taste, changed since then that a fine proof of a
                    single plate has sold for £210. The merit of the plates is unequal; some—for
                    example, Solway Moss, Inverary Pier, Hind Head Hill, Ben Arthur, Rizpah,
                    Junction of the Severn and Wye, and Peat Bog—are of great beauty, while a few
                    are comparatively tame and uninteresting. Among the unpublished plates
                    Stonehenge at Daybreak and Sheep Washing, Windsor Castle take a high place. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi> shows strong traces of the influence of Cozens and
                    Girtin, and, as a matter of course, of Claude. In most of the designs the
                    predominant feeling is serious; in not a few, gloomy, or even tragic. A good
                    deal has been written about Turner’s intention, and the “lessons” of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Liber Studiorum.</hi> Probably his only intention in the beginning
                    was to show what he could do, to display his art, to rival Claude, perhaps to
                    educate public taste, and at the same time make money. If lessons were intended
                    they might have been better conveyed by words. “Silent always with a bitter
                    silence, disdaining to tell his meaning,”—such is Mr Ruskin’s explanation; but
                    surely Turner had little reason for either silence or contempt because the
                    public failed to see in landscape art the means of teaching it great moral
                    lessons. The seventy plates of the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi> contain an
                    almost complete epitome of Turner’s art. Already in this work are seen strong
                    indications of one of his most remarkable characteristics—a knowledge of the
                    principles of structure in natural objects: mountains and rocks are drawn, not
                    with topographical accuracy, but with what appears like an intuitive feeling for
                    geological formation; and trees have also the same expression of life and growth
                    in the drawing of stems and branches. This instinctive feeling in Turner for the
                    principles of organic structure is treated of at considerable length in the
                    fourth volume of <hi rend="italic">Modem Painters,</hi> and Turner is there
                    contrasted with Claude, Poussin, and some of the Dutch masters, greatly to their
                    disadvantage.</p>
                <p>After 1797 Turner was little concerned with mere topographical facts: his
                    pictures might be like the places represented or not; much depended on the
                    mental impression produced by the scene. He preferred to deal with the spirit,
                    rather than with the local details of places. A curious example of the <hi
                    rend="italic">reasonableness</hi> accompanying his exercise of the imaginative
                    faculty is to be found in his creations of creatures he had never seen, as, for
                    example, the dragon<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“The
                    strange unity of vertebrated action and of a true bony contour, infinitely
                    varied in every vertebra, with this glacial outline, together with the adoption
                    of the head of the Ganges crocodile, the fish-eater, to show his sea descent
                    (and this in the year 1806, when hardly a single fossil saurian skeleton existed
                    within Turner’s reach), renders the whole conception one of the most curious
                    exertions of the imaginative intellect with which I am acquainted in the arts”
                    (Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Mod. Painters,</hi> vol. v. p. 313).</p></note> in
                    the Garden of the Hesperides and the python in the Apollo, exhibited in 1811.
                    Both these monsters are imagined with such vividness and reality, and the sense
                    of power and movement is so completely expressed, that the spectator never once
                    thinks of them as otherwise than representations of actual facts in natural
                    history. It needs but a little comparison to discover how far Turner surpassed
                    all his contemporaries, as well as all who preceded him, in these respects. The
                    imaginative faculty he possessed was of the highest order, and it was further
                    aided by a memory of the most retentive and unerring kind. A good illustration
                    of this may be seen at Farnley Hall in a drawing of a Man-of-War taking in
                    Stores. Some one, who had never seen a first-rate, expressed a wish to know what
                    it looked like. Turner took a blank sheet of paper one morning after breakfast,
                    outlined the ship, and finished the drawing in three hours, Fawkes sitting
                    beside him from the first stroke to the last. The size of this drawing is about
                    16 in. by 11 in. Mr Ruskin thus describes it:</p>
                <p>“The hull of a first-rate occupies nearly one half of the picture to the right,
                    her bows toward the spectator, seen in sharp perspective from stem to stern,
                    with all her port-holes, guns, anchors, and lower rigging elaborately detailed,
                    two other ships of the line in the middle distance drawn with equal precision, a
                    noble breezy sea, full of delicate drawing in its waves, a store ship beneath
                    the hull of the larger vessel and several other boats, and a complicated cloudy
                    sky, all drawn from memory, down to the smallest rope, in a drawing-room of a
                    mansion in the middle of Yorkshire.”</p>
                <p>About the year 1811 Turner paid his first visit to Devonshire, the county to
                    which his family belonged, and a curious glimpse of his simple manner of life is
                    given by Redding, who accompanied him on some of his excursions. On one occasion
                    they spent a night together in a small road-side inn, Turner having a great
                    desire to see the country around at sunrise.</p>
                <p>“Turner was content with bread and cheese and beer, tolerably good, for dinner
                    and supper in one. In the little sanded room we conversed by the light of an
                    attenuated candle and some aid from the moon until nearly midnight, when Turner
                    laid his head upon the table and was soon fast asleep. Three or four hours rest
                    was thus obtained, and we went out as soon as the sun was up to explore the
                    surrounding neighbourhood. It was in that early morning Turner made a sketch of
                    the picture Crossing the Brook.” In another excursion to Borough Island, “the
                    morning was squally and the sea rolled boisterously into the Sound. Off Stakes
                    Point it became stormy; our Dutch boat rode bravely over the furrows. Two of the
                    party were ill. Turner was all the while quiet, watching the troubled scene.
                    Bolt Head, to seaward, against which the waves broke with fury, seemed to absorb
                    his entire notice, and he scarcely spoke a syllable. While the fish were getting
                    ready Turner mounted nearly to the highest point of the island rock, and <hi
                    rend="italic">seemed writing rather than drawing.</hi> The wind was almost too
                    violent for either purpose.”</p>
                <p>This and similar incidents show how careless of comfort Turner was, and how
                    devoted to his art. The tumult and discomfort by which he was surrounded could
                    not distract his powers of observation; and some thirty years later there is
                    still evidence of the same kind. In the catalogue of the exhibition of 1842 one
                    of his pictures bears the following title, “Snow-Storm: steam-boat off a
                    harbour’s mouth making signals in shallow water, and going by the lead. The
                    author was in that storm the night the ‘Ariel ’ left Harwich.”</p>
                <p>From 1813 till 1826, in addition to his Harley Street residence, Turner had a
                    country house at Twickenham. He kept a boat on the river, also a pony and gig,
                    in which he used to drive about the neighbouring country on sketching
                    expeditions. The pony, for which Turner had a great love, appears in his
                    well-known Frosty Morning in the National Gallery. He appears to have had a
                    great affection<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n691/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0691-0666"/> for animals, and one instance of his tenderness
                    of heart is given by one who often joined him in the amusement of fishing, of
                    which Turner was very fond. “I was often with him when fishing at Petworth, and
                    also on the banks of the Thames. His success as an angler was great, although
                    with the worst tackle in the world. Every fish he caught he showed to me, and
                    appealed to me to decide whether the size justified him to keep it for the table
                    or to return it to the river; his hesitation was often almost touching, and he
                    always gave the prisoner at the bar the benefit of the doubt.”</p>
                <p>In 1813 Turner commenced the series of drawings, forty in number, for Cooke’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Southern Coast.</hi> This work was not completed till 1826. The
                    price he at first received for these drawings was £7, 10s. each, afterwards
                    raised to £13, 2s. 6d.</p>
                <p>Crossing the Brook appeared in the Academy of 1815. It may be regarded as a
                    typical example of Turner’s art at this period, and marks the transition from
                    his earlier style to that of his maturity. It represents a piece of Devonshire
                    scenery, a view on the river Tamar. On the left is a group of tall pine-trees,
                    beautifully designed and drawn with great skill and knowledge of structure, in
                    the foreground a couple of children, with a dog carrying a bundle in its mouth
                    across the brook, and beyond, a vast expanse of richly-wooded country, with
                    glimpses of a winding river, an old bridge, a mill, and other buildings, and, in
                    the far distance, the sea. Both in design and execution this work is founded
                    upon Claude. Some critics consider it one of Turner’s greatest works; but this
                    is open to question.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Crossing the Brook was a great favourite with Turner. It was painted for a
                    patron, who, dissatisfied with it, left it on the painter’s hands. The price
                    asked (£500) seems to have been part of the objection. Turner subsequently
                    refused an offer of £1600 for it.</p></note> It can hardly be called a work in
                    full colour: it is limited to greys and quiet greens for the earth and pale
                    blues for the sky. It is a sober but very admirable picture, full of diffused
                    daylight, and in the painting of its distance better than any master who had
                    preceded him. The fascination of the remote, afterwards so distinctive an
                    element in Turner’s pictures, shows itself here. Perhaps nothing tests the
                    powers or tries the skill of the landscape-painter more severely than the
                    representation of distant effects. They come and go so rapidly, are often in a
                    high key of light and colour, and so full of mystery and delicacy, that anything
                    approaching to real imitation is impossible. Only the most retentive memory and
                    the most sensitive and tender feeling will avail. These qualities Turner
                    possessed to a remarkable degree, and as his powers matured there was an
                    ever-increasing tendency in his art to desert the foreground, where things were
                    definite and clear, in order to dream in the infinite suggestiveness and space
                    of distances. Dido Building Carthage also belongs to this period. It hangs
                    beside the Claudes in the National Gallery. It pertains to the old erroneous
                    school of historical painting. Towering masses of Claudesque architecture piled
                    up on either side, porticoes, vestibules, and stone pines, with the sun in a
                    yellow sky, represent the Carthage of Turner’s imagination. With all its faults
                    it is still the finest work of the class he ever painted. Carthage and its fate
                    had a strange fascination for him. It is said that he regarded it as a moral
                    example to England in its agricultural decline, its increase of luxury, and its
                    blindness to the insatiable ambition of a powerful rival. . He returned again to
                    this theme in 1817, when he exhibited his Decline of the Carthaginian Empire:
                    Hostages Leaving Carthage for Rome,—a picture which Mr Ruskin describes as
                    “little more than an accumulation of academy student’s outlines coloured
                    brown.”</p>
                <p>In 1818 Turner was in Scotland making drawings for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Provincial Antiquities</hi> for which Sir Walter Scott supplied the
                    letterpress, and in 1819 he visited Italy for the first time. One of the results
                    of this visit was a great change in his style, and from this time his works
                    became remarkable for their colour. Hitherto he had painted in browns, greys,
                    and blues, using red and yellow sparingly. He had gradually been advancing from
                    the sober grey colouring of Vandervelde and Ruysdael to the mellow and richer
                    tones of Claude. His works now begin to show a heightened scale of colour,
                    gradually increasing in richness and splendour and reaching its culminating
                    point in such works as the Ulysses, Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, the Golden
                    Bough, and the Fighting Téméraire. All these works belong to the middle period
                    of Turner’s art (1829- 39), when his powers were entirely developed and entirely
                    unabated. Much of his most beautiful work at this period is to be found in his
                    water-colour drawings: those executed for Whitaker’s <hi rend="italic">History
                    of Richmondshire</hi> (1819-21), for Cooke’s <hi rend="italic">Southern
                    Coast</hi> (1814-26), for <hi rend="italic">The Rivers of England</hi> (1824),
                    for <hi rend="italic">England and Wales</hi> (1829-38), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Provincial Antiquities</hi> (1826), Rogers’s <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>
                    (1830), Scott’s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (1834), and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Rivers of France</hi> (1833-35) are in many instances of the greatest beauty. Of
                    the Richmondshire drawings Mr Ruskin says, “The foliage is rich and marvellous
                    in composition, the rock and hill drawing insuperable, the skies exquisite in
                    complex form.”</p>
                <p>But perhaps one of the greatest services Turner rendered to the art of England
                    was the education of a whole school of engravers. His best qualities as a
                    teacher came from the union of strength and delicacy in his work; subtle and
                    delicate tonality was almost a new element for the engraver to deal with, but
                    with Turner’s teaching and careful supervision his engravers by degrees mastered
                    it more or less successfully, and something like a new development of the art of
                    engraving was the result. No better proof can be found of the immense advance
                    made than by comparing the work of the landscape engravers of the pre-Turnerian
                    period with the work of Miller, Goodall, Willmore, Cooke, Wallis, Lupton, C.
                    Turner, Brandard, Cousen, and others who worked under his guidance. The art of
                    steel engraving reached its highest development in England at this time.
                    Rogers’s <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> (1830) and his <hi rend="italic"

                    engravings executed after Turner’s drawings. They are vignettes,<note

                    have been because there was nothing harsh or rigid in his genius, that forms and
                    colours melted into each other tenderly in his dream-world, and that his sense
                    of gradation was the most delicate ever possessed by man” (Hamerton).</p></note>
                    a form of art which Turner understood better than any artist ever did
                    before,—perhaps, we might add, since. The Alps at Daybreak, Columbus Discovering
                    Land, and <hi rend="italic">Datur Hora Quieti</hi> may be given as examples of
                    the finest.</p>
                <p>In 1828 Turner paid a second visit to Italy, this time of considerable duration,
                    on the way visiting Nîmes, Avignon, Marseilles, Genoa, Spezzia, and Siena, and
                    in the following year he exhibited the Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus, now in the
                    National Gallery. It marks the beginning of the central and best period of
                    Turner’s power. This work is so well known that description is hardly needed.
                    The galley of Ulysses occupies the centre of the picture; the oars are being
                    thrust out and the sailors flocking up the masts to unfurl sail, while Ulysses
                    waves the blazing olive tree in defiance of the giant, whose huge form is seen
                    high on the cliffs above; and the shadowy horses of Phoebus are traced in the
                    slanting rays of the rising sun. The impression this picture leaves is one of
                    great power and splendour. The painting throughout is magnificent, especially in
                    the sky. Leslie speaks of it as “a poem of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n692/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0692-0667"/> matchless splendour and beauty.” From this period
                    onward till about 1840 Turner’s life was one of unceasing activity. Nothing is
                    more astonishing than his prodigious fertility; he rose early, worked from
                    morning till night, entirely absorbed in his art, and gradually became more and
                    more solitary and isolated. Between 1829 and 1839 he sent fifty-five pictures to
                    the Royal Academy, painted many others on private commission, made over four
                    hundred drawings for engravers, besides thousands of studies and sketches from
                    nature. His industry accounts for the immense quantity of work he left behind
                    him. There is not the slightest evidence to show that it arose from a desire to
                    make money, which he never cared for in comparison with his art. He has been
                    accused, perhaps not without some cause, of avarice and meanness in his business
                    dealings, and many stories are told to his discredit. But in private he often
                    did generous things, although owing to his reserved disposition his virtues were
                    known only to a few. His faults on the other hand—thanks to the malice, or
                    jealousy, of one or two individuals—were freely talked about and, as a matter of
                    course, greatly exaggerated. “Keep it, and send your children to school and to
                    church,” were the words with which he declined repayment of a considerable loan
                    to a poor drawing-master’s widow. On another occasion, when interrupted in his
                    work, he roughly chid and dismissed the applicant, a poor woman; but she had
                    hardly left his door before he followed her and slipped a <hi rend="italic"
                    >£5</hi> note into her hand. His tenants in Harley Street were in arrears for
                    years, but he would never allow his lawyer to distrain; and if further proof of
                    his generosity were needed his great scheme for bettering the condition of the
                    unfortunate in his own profession should suffice. On one occasion he is known to
                    have taken down a picture of his own from the walls of the Academy to make room
                    for that of an unknown artist.</p>
                <p>The first of Turner’s Venetian pictures (Bridge of Sighs, Ducal Palace and Custom
                    House, Venice, Canaletti Painting) appeared in the Academy in 1833. Compared
                    with the sober, prosaic work of Canaletti, Turner’s pictures of Venice appear
                    like poetic dreams. Splendour of colour and carelessness of form generally
                    characterize them. Venice appeared to him “a city of rose and white, rising out
                    of an emerald sea against a sky of sapphire blue.” Many of these Venetian
                    pictures belong to his later manner, and some of them, the Sun of Venice Going
                    to Sea (1843), Approach to Venice (1844), and Venice, Evening, Going to the Ball
                    (1845), to his latest. As Turner grew older his love of brilliant colour and
                    light became more and more a characteristic. In trying to obtain these qualities
                    he gradually fell into an unsound method of work, treating oil as if it had been
                    water-colour, using both indiscriminately on the same canvas, utterly regardless
                    of the result. Many of his finest pictures are already in a ruined state, mere
                    wrecks of what they once were.</p>
                <p>The Fighting Téméraire Tugged to her Last Berth to be Broken up (see vol. xxi. p.
                    441, fig. 43) was exhibited in the Academy of 1839. By many it is considered one
                    of his finest works. Turner had all his life been half a sailor at heart: he
                    loved the sea, and shipping, and sailors and their ways; many of his best
                    pictures are sea pieces; and the old ships of Collingwood and Nelson were dear
                    to him. Hence the pathetic feeling he throws around the fighting Téméraire. The
                    old three-decker, looking ghostly and wan in the evening light, is slowly towed
                    along by a black, fiery little steam tug,—a contrast suggesting the passing away
                    of the old order of things and the advent of the new; and behind the sun sets
                    red in a thick bank of smoke or mist. The Slave Ship, another important sea
                    picture, was exhibited in the following year, and in 1842 Peace: Burial at Sea,
                    commemorative of Wilkie.</p>
                <p>Turner had now reached his sixty-seventh year, but no very marked traces of
                    declining power are to be seen in his work. Many of the water-colour drawings
                    belonging to this period are of great beauty, and, although a year or two later
                    his other powers began to fail, his faculty for colour remained unimpaired
                    almost to the end. He paid his last visit to the Continent in 1843, wandering
                    about from one place to another, and avoiding his own countrymen, an old and
                    solitary man. At his house in Queen Anne Street they were often ignorant of his
                    whereabouts for months, as he seldom took the trouble to write to any one. Two
                    years later (1845) his health gave way and with it both mind and sight began to
                    fail. The works of his declining period exercised the wit of the critics. Turner
                    felt these attacks keenly. He was naturally kind-hearted and acutely sensitive
                    to censure. “A man may be weak in his age,” he once remarked, “but you should
                    not tell him so.”</p>
                <p>After 1845 all the pictures shown by Turner belong to the period of decay,—mere
                    ghosts and shadows of what once had been. In 1850 he exhibited for the last
                    time. He had given up attending the meetings of the Academicians; none of his
                    friends had seen him for months; and even his old housekeeper had no idea of his
                    whereabouts. Turner’s mind had evidently given way for some time, and with that
                    love of secrecy which in later years had grown into a passion he had gone away
                    to hide himself in a corner of London. He had settled as a lodger in a small
                    house in Chelsea, overlooking the river, kept by his old Margate landlady, Mrs
                    Booth. To the children in the neighbourhood he was known as “Admiral Booth.” His
                    short, sailor-like figure may account for the idea that he was an impoverished
                    old naval officer. He had been ill for some weeks, and when his Queen Anne
                    Street housekeeper at last discovered his hiding-place she found him sinking,
                    and on the following day, the 19th December 1851, he died. He was buried in St
                    Paul’s cathedral, in deference to a wish he had himself expressed.</p>
                <p>He left the large fortune he had amassed (about £140,000) to found a charity for
                    the “maintenance and support of male decayed artists, being born in England, and
                    of English parents only, and of lawful issue.” His pictures he bequeathed to the
                    nation, on condition that they were to be exhibited in rooms of their own, and
                    that these rooms were to be called “Turner’s Gallery.” The will and its codicils
                    were so confused that after years of litigation, during which a large part of
                    the money was wasted in legal expenses, it was found impossible to decide what
                    Turner really wanted. A compromise was effected in which the wishes of
                    everybody, save those of the testator, were consulted, his next-of-kin, whom he
                    did not mean to get a single farthing, inheriting the bulk of his property. The
                    nation got all the pictures and drawings, and the Royal Academy £20,000.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary here to do more than allude to the charges which have been
                    brought against Turner’s moral character. Like most men of note he had his
                    enemies and detractors, and it is to be. regretted that so many of the stories
                    they set in circulation should have been repeated by one of his biographers, who
                    candidly admits having ‘ spared none of his faults,” and excuses himself for so
                    doing by “what he hopes” is his “undeviating love of truth.” The immense
                    quantity of work accomplished by Turner during his lifetime, work full of the
                    utmost delicacy and refinement, proves the singularly fine condition of his
                    nervous system, and is perhaps the best answer that can be given to the charge
                    of being excessively addicted to sensual gratification. In his declining years
                    he possibly had recourse to stimulants to help his failing powers, but it by no
                    means follows that he went habitually to excess in their use. He never lost an
                    opportunity of doing a kindness, and under a rough and cold exterior there was
                    more good and worth hidden than the world imagined. “During the ten years I knew
                    him,” says Mr Ruskin, “years in which he was suffering most from the
                    evilspeaking of the world, I never heard him say one depreciating word of any
                    living man or man’s work; I never saw him look an unkind or blameful look; I
                    never knew him let pass, without sorrowful remonstrance, or endeavour at
                    mitigation, a blameful word spoken by another. Of no man but Turner, whom I have
                    ever known, could I say this.” Twice during his earlier days there are
                    circumstances leading to the belief that he had thoughts of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n693/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0693-0668"/> marriage, but on both occasions it ended in
                    disappointment, and his home after his father died was cheerless and solitary,
                    without solace or comfort of any kind.</p>
                <p>If Turner had died early his reputation as an artist would have been very
                    different from what it ultimately became. He would not have been recognized as a
                    colourist. It was only after the year 1820 that colour began to assert itself
                    strongly in his work. He painted for many a year in greys and greens and browns,
                    went steadily through “the subdued golden chord,” and painted yellow mists and
                    suns rising through vapour; but as time went on that was no longer enough, and
                    he tried to paint the sun in his strength and the full glories of sunshine. The
                    means at the painter’s disposal are, however, limited, and Turner, in his
                    efforts after brilliancy, began to indulge in reckless experiments in colour. He
                    could not endure even the slightest restraints which technical limitations
                    impose, but went on trying to paint the unpaintable. As a watercolour painter
                    Turner stands pre-eminent; he is unquestionably the greatest master in that
                    branch of art that ever lived. If his work is compared with that of Barrett, or
                    Varley, or Cozens, or Sandby, or any of the earlier masters, so great is
                    Turner’s superiority that the art in his hands seems to be lifted altogether
                    into a higher region.</p>
                <p>In 1843 a champion, in the person of Mr Ruskin, arose to defend Turner against
                    the unjust and ignorant attacks of the press, and what at first was intended as
                    a “short pamphlet, reprobating the manner and style of these critics,” grew into
                    the five volumes known as <hi rend="italic">Modern Painters.</hi> The writer
                    employs all his eloquence and his great critical faculty to prove how
                    immeasurably superior Turner was to all who had ever gone before, hardly
                    restricting his supremacy to landscape art, and placing him among the “seven
                    supreme colourists of the world.” Two lives of Turner have been written, one by
                    Mr Thornbury, the other by Mr Hamerton. The work of the latter deserves the
                    highest commendation; it gives a clear and consistent history of the great
                    artist, and is characterized by refined thought and critical insight. An
                    excellent little book by Mr W. C. Monkhouse should also be noticed. (G. RE.)</p>
