                    ιsland-group generally known as the Society Islands <hi rend="italic">(Isles de
                    la Société,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tα'iti)</hi> lies between 16° and 18° S.
                    lat. and 148° and 155° W. long., and stretches for nearly 200 miles in a
                    north-west and south-east direction; the total area does not exceed 650 square
                    miles, of which 600 fall to Tahiti alone. To the east and north-east a channel
                    of only 140 miles in breadth, but over 2000 fathoms in depth, separates this
                    group from the great chain of the Low Islands, beyond which the ocean extends
                    unbroken to America. To the west as far as Fiji—the main islands of which group
                    lie between the same degrees of latitude as those of Tahiti— there are 1500
                    miles of open water. About 300 miles southwest lies Cook’s Archipelago, and at
                    the same distance south are the Austral Islands. To the north, excepting a few
                    coral banks, there is open sea to Hawaii, a distance of 2600 miles.</p>
                <p>Tahiti occupies a central position in the Pacific. Sydney lies about 3400 miles
                    to the west and San Francisco about as far to the north-north-east. Honolulu,
                    Noumea, and Auckland are each somewhere about 2400 miles away; Panama is at a
                    distance of 4600 miles.</p>
                <p>The archipelago consists of eleven islands, which are divided into two
                    clusters—the Leeward and the Windward Islands—by a clear channel of 60 miles in
                    breadth. The Leeward Islands, to which alone the name of Society Islands was
                    given by Cook, are Tubai or Motu-iti, a small uninhabited lagoon island, the
                    most northern of the w hole archipelago; Maupiti or Mau-rua—“Double Mountain,”
                    the most western; Bora-bora (Bola-Bυla of the older navigators), or Faarui;
                    Tahaa; Raiatea or Ulietea (Boen-shea’s Princessa), the largest island of this
                    cluster, and Huahine, which approach each other very closely, and are encircled
                    by one reef. To the Windward Islands, the Georgian Islands of the early
                    missionaries, belong Maiaiti or Tapamanu (Wallis’s jSir Charles Saunders Island
                    and Boenshea’s Pelada); Morea or Eimeo (Wallis’s Duke of York Island and
                    Boenshea’s San Domingo); Tahiti—Cook’s Otaheiti (probably Quiros’s Sagittaria;
                    Wallis’s King George’s Island, Bougainville’s Nouvelle Cythère, and Boenshea’s
                    Isla d’Amat), the most southern and by far the largest of all the islands;
                    Tetuara or Tetiaroa—“The Distant Sea” (?Quiros’s Fugitiva; Bougainville’s
                    Umaitia and Boenshea’s Tres Hermanos); and Matia or Maitea (? Quiros’s La
                    Dezana, Wallis’s Osnaburg Island, Bougainville’s Boudoir and Pic de la Boudeuse,
                    and Boenshea’s San Cristoval), which is by a degree the most eastern of the
                    archipelago. Bellinghausen, Scilly, and Lord Howe (Mopia) are three
                    insignificant clusters of coral islets to the north west and west, and, like
                    Tubai and Tetuara, are atolls. The length of the Tetuara reef ring is about six
                    miles; it bears ten palm-covered islets, of which several are in habited, and
                    has one narrow boat-passage leading into the lagoon. With the exception just
                    named, the islands, which agree very closely in geological structure, are
                    mountainous, and present perhaps the most wonderful example of volcanic rocks to
                    be found on the globe. They are formed of trachyte, dolerite, and basalt. There
                    are raised coral beds high up the mountains, and lava occurs in a variety of
                    forms, even in solid flows; but all active volcanic agency has so long ceased
                    that the craters have been almost entirely obliterated by denudation. Hot
                    springs are unknown, and earthquakes are slight and rare. Nevertheless, under
                    some of these flows remains of plants and insects of species now living in the
                    islands have been found,—a proof that the formation as well as the denudation of
                    the country is, geologically speaking, recent. In profile the islands are
                    rugged. A high mountain, usually with very steep peaks, forms the centre, if not
                    the whole island; on all sides steep ridges descend to the sea, or, as is
                    offener the case, to a considerable belt of flat land. These mountains,
                    excepting some stony crags and cliffs, are clothed with dense forest, the soil
                    being exceptionally fertile. All voyagers agree that for varied beauty of form
                    and colour the Society Islands are unsurpassed in the Pacific. Innumerable
                    rills, fed by the fleeting clouds which circle round the high lands, gather in
                    lovely streams, and, after heavy rains, torrents precipitate themselves in grand
                    cascades from the mountain cliffs—a feature so striking as to have attracted the
                    attention of all voyagers, from Wallis downwards. Round most of the islands
                    there is a luxuriant coral growth; but, as the reefs lie at no great distance,
                    and follow the line of the coast, the interisland channels are safer than those
                    of the neighbouring Tuamotus, which exhibit the atoll formation in perhaps its
                    fullest development, and in consequence have been justly called the “Low” or
                    “Dangerous Archipelago.” Maitea, which rises from the sea as an exceedingly
                    abrupt cone, and Tapamanu appear to be the only islands which have not their
                    fringing and more or less completely encircling barrier-reefs.<note

                    indented, and, protected by these reefs, which often support a chain of green
                    islets, afford many good harbours and safe anchorages. In this respect the
                    Society Islands have the advantage of most of the Polynesian groups.</p>
                <p>The island of Tahiti, in shape not unlike the figure 8, has a total length of 35
                    miles, a coast-line of 120, and a superficial area of 600 square miles. It is
                    divided into two distinct portions by a short isthmus (Isthmus de Taravao) less
                    than a mile in width, and nowhere more than 50 feet above sea-level. The
                    southern, the peninsula of Tairabu, or Tahiti-iti (Little Tahiti), alone as
                    large as Raiatea (after Tahiti the most important island of the group), measures
                    12 miles in length by 6 miles in breadth; while the northern, the circular main
                    island of Porionuu, or Tahiti-uni (Great Tahiti), has a length of 23 miles and a
                    width of 20. The whole island is mountainous. A little to the north-west of the
                    centre of Great Tahiti the Society Islands attain their greatest altitude. There
                    the doublepeaked Orohena rises to 7340 feet, and Aorai, its rival, is only a few
                    hundred feet lower. Little Tahiti cannot boast of such mountains, but its
                    tower-like peaks are very striking. The flat land of the Tahitian coast,
                    extending to a width of several miles—with its chain of villages, its <pb

                    intersected by stream-fed valleys which open on the sea-shore—forms a most
                    pleasing foreground to the grand amphitheatre-like mountain ranges. A good road
                    surrounds the entire island, which is divided into eighteen districts, each
                    under a chief and a municipal council of which he is president. A railroad is in
                    contemplation. By the last census the population of the entire island was 9194,
                    one-eighth being French and foreigners. The majority of the natives profess the
                    Protestant religion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    best chart of Tahiti is that published by the French Government in 1876, and
                    corrected down to 1881. Morea is given on the same sheèt.</p></note></p>
                <p>The extreme north of the island is formed by Point Venus, to the east of which
                    lies the Bay of Matavai, and some miles still farther east Papeete, the European
                    town and the seat of government. The beautiful harbour, of fair size and depth,
                    is entered by two passages in the reef, Papeete to the north, 7 fathoms in
                    depth, and Taunoa to the east, the wider and more convenient, though shallower.
                    The town, in 1881, had a population of 3224, half of whom were French or French
                    half-castes, but at least a dozen different nations were represented by the 800
                    whites. The little city is decidedly French in character. “Papeete is the
                    emporium of trade for the products of the South Sea Islands east of 160° E.
                    long. Small schooners of from 20 to 50 tons burden bring the produce of the
                    various groups to Tahiti, whence they are shipped direct for Europe, either by
                    Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, according to the season of the year. These
                    schooners, of w hich about twenty fly the Tahitian flag, take back portions of
                    the cargoes of vessels arriving from Europe for sale or barter amongst the
                    islands. The chief exports are cocoa-nuts, mother-of-pearl, cotton, and some
                    sugar, mainly to England and Germany, very little to France; and oranges,
                    trepang (for China), and edible fungus to California.”<note anchored="true"

                    London, 1884.</p></note> Many whalers formerly visited Papeete harbour, but for
                    some years there has been a steady diminution in their number. In 1845
                    forty-eight called there, in 1860 five, and none in 1874. Commerce has also in
                    other respects decreased. Three sugar-mills with distilleries attached, two
                    cotton manufactories, and a manufactory of cocoa-nut fibre were at work in 1886.
                    Oranges and vanilla are profitably grown. The timber of the country is hardly
                    used, great quantities of Californian pine being imported. Oxen and hogs are
                    reared. The artificial culture of the pearl oyster is beginning to be discussed,
                    but the pearls of the Society Islands are not to be compared in number or
                    quality to those of the Tuamotus. A good deal of trading in fruit, fibre, shell,
                    &amp;c., is carried on with the natives, but still mainly by barter. The
                    competition of the Chinese immigrants, of whom in 1886 there were already 400 on
                    Tahiti and Eimeo, is beginning to be keenly felt. The importation of “labour,”
                    chiefly for the plantations, from other Polynesian islands was placed under
                    Government control in 1862. Tha Tahitians themselves prefer handicrafts to
                    agricultural work, and many are employed as artisans by European masters, who
                    find them as handy and industrious as their oλvιι countrymen, but for domestic
                    service they show no aptitude. Papeete is in direct sailing communication with
                    San Francisco, and with Sydney by a Government steamer which calls every five
                    months; also with France by Bordeaux steamers which touch on their way to
                    Noumea.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For fuller
                    statistics, see <hi rend="italic">Notices Coloniales,</hi> Paris, 1886, vol.

                    Damp is excessive; there is little variation in the weather, which, though hot,
                    is nevertheless not depressing, and the climate for the tropics must be
                    considered remarkably healthy. The rainfall is largest between December and
                    April, but there is so much at other times of the year also that these months
                    hardly deserve the name of the rainy season. During this period north-west winds
                    are frequent, continuing at times for weeks, and there are thunderstorms and
                    hurricanes, though they are not nearly so destructive as in some of the
                    neighbouring islands. During the eight drier and cooler months south-east winds
                    (corresponding with the trades) prevail, but there are southerly winds which
                    bring rain, and even λvesterly breezes are not unfrequent. The mean temperature
                    for the year is 77° F.; maximum 84°, minimum 69°. The average rainfall from
                    December to March (4 months) is 29 inches; from April to November (8 months), 19
                    inches. The above observations apply to the coast only.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fauna.—</hi> Neither the zoology nor the botany of the
                    archipelago has been thoroughly investigated. Mammalians, as in other Polynesian
                    islands, are restricted to a few species of bats (mostly of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Pteropus),</hi> rats, and mice, none of them peculiar. Of domestic
                    animals, the pig and the dog—the former a small breed which quickly disappeared
                    before the stronger European strains— were plentiful even in Wallis’s days. The
                    ornithology is very poor as compared with that of the Western Pacific; and, in
                    marked contrast to the isolated Hawaiian archipelago, the Society Islands
                    possess no peculiar genera and but few peculiar species. They claim, however, a
                    thrush, several small parrots of great beauty, doves, pigeons, rails, and a
                    sandpiper. Of this sandpiper, <hi rend="italic">Tringa leucoptera,</hi> which,
                    with many of the birds here mentioned, was discovered as far back as Cook’s stay
                    in the islands, only one specimen (now in the Leyden museum) is known to exist;
                    and of the rest, their range being often limited to one portion of a small
                    island, several species are (through the increase in the number of cats,
                    &amp;c.) threatened with extermination. A jungle-fowl (var. of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gallus bankiva)</hi> is found in the mountains, but as domesticated fowls were
                    abundant, even when Tahiti was first discovered by Europeans, these wild birds
                    are doubtless the offspring of tame birds, probably imported with the pigs and
                    dogs by Malay vessels. There are no peculiar reptiles, and batrachians are
                    entirely wanting. The lagoons swarm with fish of many species. Insects are poor
                    in species, though some of them are indigenous. Crustaceans and molluscs, on the
                    other hand, are well represented; worms, echinoderms, and corals comparatively
                    poorly. A noteworthy feature of Tahitian conchology is the number of peculiar
                    species belonging to the genus <hi rend="italic">Partula,</hi> almost every
                    valley being the habitat of a distinct form.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    This, though luxuriant, is not very rich. Like the zoology, it is much poorer
                    than that of the more western groups of the Pacific. <hi rend="italic"

                    links which this typically Polynesian region has retained to join it to
                    Australia. Four genera are peculiar, of which three are claimed by the <hi

                    characteristic of Hawaii. It is rich in trees, shrubs, and hardwood plants, poor
                    in the smaller undergrowth. Orchids, including some beautiful species, and ferns
                    are abundant; but, here as in Polynesia generally, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rnbiaceae</hi> is the order best represented. Remarkable are the banana
                    thickets, which, chiefly on Tahiti, grow at an altitude of from 3000 to 5000
                    feet. Along the shore—in some places almost to the extinction of all native
                    growth—many exotics have established themselves; and a great variety of
                    fruit-bearing and other useful trees have been successfully introduced into most
                    of the islands.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>De

                    Tahitians are a typical Polynesian race, closely connected physically with the
                    Marquesans and Rarotongans, but widely divided from them in many of their
                    customs. The dialects, also, of the three groups are different, the Tahitian
                    being perhaps the softest in all Oceania. The women rank with the most beautiful
                    of the Pacific, though the accounts given of them by early voyagers are much
                    exaggerated; and for general symmetry of form the people are unsurpassed by any
                    race in the world. Even now in its decadence, after generations of drunkenness
                    and European disease and vice, grafted on inborn indolence and licentiousness,
                    many tall and robust people (6 feet and even upwards in height) are to be found.
                    The women, as a rule, are small in proportion to the men. Men and women of good
                    birth can generally be distinguished by their height and fairness, and often,
                    even in early age, by their enormous corpulence. The skin varies from a very
                    light olive to a full dark brown. The wavy or curly hair and the expressive eyes
                    are black, or nearly so; the mouth is large, but well-shaped and set with
                    beautiful teeth; the nose broad (formerly flattened in infancy by artificial
                    means); and the chin well developed. So long as the native costume was retained,
                    the <hi rend="italic">tiputa,</hi> an oblong piece of bark cloth with a hole in
                    its centre for the head, and the <hi rend="italic">paru,</hi> a plain piece of
                    cloth round the loins, were worn alike by men and women of the higher classes.
                    Men of all ranks wore, with or without these, the <hi rend="italic">maro,</hi>
                    or J bandage. The women concealed their breasts except in the company of their
                    superiors, when etiquette demanded that inferiors of both sexes should uncover
                    the upper part of the body. The chiefs wore short feather cloaks, not unlike
                    those of the Hawaiians, and beautiful semicircular breastplates, dexterously
                    interwoven with the black plumage of the frigate bird, with crimson feathers,
                    and with sharks’ teeth; also most elaborate special dresses as a sign of
                    mourning. The priests had strange cylindrical hats, made of wicker-work and over
                    a yard in height. Circumcision, and in both sexes tattooing, were generally
                    practised, and much significance was attached to some of the marks. The houses
                    <hi rend="italic">(pare)</hi> were long, low, and open at the sides. Household
                    utensils were few—plain round wooden dishes, sometimes on legs, cocoa-nut
                    shells, baskets, &amp;c. Low stools and head-rests were used. Pottery being
                    unknown, all food was baked in the “native oven” or roasted over the fire. Their
                    chief musical instruments were the nose-flute <hi rend="italic">(vivo)—</hi>
                    often used as the accompaniment of song—and the drum <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pahu).</hi> Of the latter, those kept in the <hi rend="italic">marai</hi> were
                    huge elaborately carved hollow cylinders of wood, the upper end of which was
                    covered with sharks’ skin. Conchshells (⅛u) were also used. Tahitian stone
                    adzes, which are greatly inferior in finish to those of the Hervey Islands, are,
                    like the adzes of eastern Polynesia in general, distinguished from those of
                    western Polynesia by their triangular section and adaptation to a socket.</p>

                <p>Slings were perhaps the favourite weapons of the Tahitians; they had also plain

                    islanders consisted of the bread-fruit, the taro-root, the yam, the sweet
                    potato, and in some districts the wild plantain (<hi rend="italic">fei</hi>);
                    but they also ate much fish (the turtle was considered sacred food), as well as
                    pigs and dogs, though of the latter, as pets, the women were so fond as to
                    suckle the puppies sometimes even to the exclusion of their own children. <hi

                <p>Tahitians were good fishermen and bold seamen. They steered by the stars, of
                    which they distinguished many constellations. The land was carefully tended and
                    the fields well irrigated. Three great classes were recognized:—(1) the <hi
                    rend="italic">huiari,</hi> of divine origin, which included only the suzerain
                    (<hi rend="italic">arirai</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> who bore a semi-sacred
                    as well as a political character, and the reigning chiefs of districts; (2)the
                    <hi rend="italic">bue-raatira,</hi> proprietors and cultivators of inherited
                    land, who also built canoes, made arms, &amp;c.; to these two classes also
                    belonged the priests <hi rend="italic">(tahora),</hi> who were medicine-men as
                    well; (3)the <hi rend="italic">manahune,</hi> fishers, artisans, &amp;c., and
                    slaves <hi rend="italic">(titi).</hi> As wars and infanticide depopulated the
                    island this class gradually acquired land and with it certain privileges. Rank
                    is hereditary and determined by primogeniture, not necessarily in the male line.
                    The firstborn of an arirai received at birth the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >otu</hi>; the father, who was the first to pay homage to his own child, then
                    abdicated, and henceforth took up the position of regent. It is easy to see
                    that, while this custom tended to keep honours within a family, it may have
                    encouraged the practice of infanticide, which was common in all grades of
                    society when Tahiti was first visited by Europeans. The age at which the otu’s
                    authority became real varied according to his own abilities and the will of his
                    subjects. Though arbitrary, the power of the arirai was limited by the power of
                    his vassals, the district chiefs (<hi rend="italic">raatiras</hi>) <hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> who ruled absolutely over their respective districts, and
                    who might be of as good blood as the arirai himself. The arirai had a
                    councillor, but was alone responsible for any act. The bi-insular form of Tahiti
                    promoted the independence of the chiefs, and war was rarely declared or an army
                    or fleet despatched without the raatiras being first summoned to council.
                    Without their favour nothing could be accomplished, for their power over their
                    own people was absolute. The form of government was thus strictly feudal in
                    character, but it gradually centralized into a monarchy, which, in the person of
                    Pomare II., the English missionaries greatly helped to regulate and strengthen.
                    The arirai sent his commands by a messenger (<hi rend="italic">veo</hi>) whose
                    credentials were a tuft of cocoa-nut film. This tuft was returned intact as a
                    sign of assent or torn in token of refusal. After the chief the wife ranked
                    first, and then his brother. The arirai was carried on the shoulders of his
                    subjects, and chiefs were not allowed to feed themselves. Women always ate
                    apart. Their places of worship (<hi rend="italic">marai</hi>) <hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> national, local, or private—were square tree-surrounded enclosures. They
                    each had a single entrance, and contained several small courts, within which
                    were houses for the images and attendant priests. A pyramidal stone structure,
                    on which were the actual altars, stood at the further end of the square. The
                    marais were also used as places of sepulture of chiefs, whose embalmed bodies,
                    after being exposed for a time, were buried in a crouching position. Their
                    skulls, however, were kept in the houses of their nearest relations. In the
                    great marai at Atahura the stone structure was 270 feet long, 94 feet wide, and
                    50 feet high, and its summit was reached by a flight of steps, built of hewn
                    coral and basalt. Sacrificial offerings, including human sacrifices, formed a
                    prominent part of Tahitian worship. An eye of the victim was offered to the
                    arirai, and placed within his mouth by the officiating priest. Every household
                    possessed its own guardian spirits <hi rend="italic">(tii),</hi> but there were
                    several superior divinities, of which, at the beginning of this century, Oro was
                    the most venerated. The images, which are less remarkable than those of Hawaii,
                    were rough representations of the human form carved in wood. Some were covered
                    from head to foot with small human figures cut in relief; others were mere
                    sticks clothed with feathers. The <hi rend="italic">areoi,</hi> a licentious
                    association of strolling players, men and women, which numbered among its ranks
                    the highest chiefs, and practised infanticide, was a special feature of Tahitian
                    society.</p>
                <p>The Tahitians are light-hearted, frivolous, courteous, and gener ous; but with
                    these traits are blended deceit, irritability, and cruelty, which formerly
                    reached an unexampled degree of savage brutality. Their notions of morality were
                    never, according to our ideas, very precise; and their customs, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">tayo,</hi> or exchange of name with the rights which it carried
                    over the wife of the giver of the name and all her female relations, seemed to
                    the earlier European observer strangely revolting. It would appear, however,
                    that with the introduction of the vices of civilization such limitations as
                    their primitive morality recognized have disappeared and all self-respect has
                    been lost. Especially characteristic were the elaborate costume-dances <hi
                    rend="italic">(heivas)</hi> performed by women. Besides dancing, the singing of
                    songs <hi rend="italic">(pehe),</hi> and the recitation of historical and
                    mythical ballads (<hi rend="italic">ubus</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> the
                    natives had also a variety of sports and games. During the periodical seasons of
                    rejoicing wrestling (<hi rend="italic">maond</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi>
                    boxing (<hi rend="italic">moto</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> and spear-throwing
                    <hi rend="italic">(vcro patia)</hi> matches, with foot and canoe-races, were
                    held; also sham fights and naval reviews. They had several games in which a ball
                    was used,—one, <hi rend="italic">apai,</hi> not unlike our bandy, while another,
                    <hi rend="italic">tuiraa</hi> (played chiefly by women), was a kind of football;
                    but surf-swimming (<hi rend="italic">faahee</hi>) was perhaps the most favourite
                    sport with both sexes. Kites were known. Cock-fighting (<hi rend="italic"
                    >faatitoraamoa</hi>) was much practised.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Discovery und Exploration.—</hi> There is little doubt that the
                    main island and some other members of the group were visited by the Spaniard
                    Pedro Fernandez de Quiros in February 1607. They were rediscovered in June 1767
                    by Wallis in the “Dolphin,” who took nominal possession of Tahiti for George
                    III. and named it after him. In the following year Bougainville visited Tahiti,
                    claimed it as French, and called it La Nouvelle Cythère. With Tetuara (called by
                    him Umaitia) and Eimeo it makes up the Archipel de Bourbon of his most
                    inaccurate chart. Almost all we know of the early state of the islands is,
                    however, due to Captain Cook’s visits in 1769, 1773, 1774, and 1777. The name of
                    Society Islands was given to the Leeward group on his first voyage in honour of
                    the Royal Society. In 1774 Tahiti was also visited by two Spanish vessels, which
                    left two priests, who remained for ten months on the island. The Spaniards named
                    it Isla d’Amat. The islands were again visited in 1788 by the “Lady Penrhyn.”
                    Bligh in the “Bounty” spent five months on the island in the same year, and it
                    was revisited by that ship after the famous mutiny. At this time the leading
                    chief was Pomare, whose family had been pre-eminent in the island for more than
                    a century. Aided by sixteen of the “Bounty” mutineers, and armed with guns
                    procured from Bligh and a Swedish vessel, Pomare greatly strengthened his power
                    and brought to a successful close a long struggle with Eimeo. In 1791 the
                    “Pandora” carried off fourteen of the “Bounty” mutineers, and from this time
                    forward visits were frequent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Missions.—</hi> The attempt of the Spaniards in 1774 was
                    followed by the settlement of twenty-five persons brought in 1797 by the
                    missionary ship “Duff.” Though befriended by Pomare I. (who lived till 1805),
                    they had many difficulties, especially from the constant wars, and at length
                    they fled with Pomare II. to Eimeo and ultimately to New South Wales, returning
                    in 1812 when Pomare renounced heathenism. In 1815 he regained his power in
                    Tahiti. For a time the missionaries made good progress,—a printing press was
                    established (1817), and coffee, cotton, and sugar were planted (1819); but soon
                    there came a serious relapse into heathen practices and immorality. Pomare II.
                    died of drink in 1824. His successor Pomare III. died in 1827, and was succeeded
                    by his half-sister Aimata, the unfortunate “Queen Pomare.” In 1828 a new
                    fanatical sect, the "Mamaia,” arose, which gave much trouble to the missions and
                    whose influence is still felt. The leader proclaimed that he was Jesus Christ,
                    and promised to his followers a sensual paradise.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">French Annexation.—</hi> In 1836 the French Catholic
                    missionaries in Mangareva attempted to open a mission in Tahiti. Queen Pomare,
                    advised by the English missionary and consul Pritchard, refused her consent, and
                    removed by force two priests who had landed surreptitiously and to whom many of
                    the opposition party in the state had rallied. In 1838 a French frigate
                    appeared, under the command of Μ. Du Petit-Thouars, and extorted from Pomare the
                    right of settlement for Frenchmen of every profession. Other acts of
                    interference followed, and at length, in 1842, Admiral du Petit-Thouars procured
                    the signature of a document placing the islands under French protection, the
                    authority of the queen and chiefs being expressly reserved. In 1843
                    Petit-Thouars reappeared, and, alleging that the treaty of 1842 had not been
                    duly carried out, deposed the queen and took possession of the islands. His
                    highhanded action was not countenanced by the French Government, but, while it
                    professed not to sanction the annexation, it did not retrace the steps taken.
                    Two years were spent in reducing the party in the islands opposed to French
                    rule; an attempt to conquer the western islands failed; and at length, by
                    agreement with England, France promised to return to the plan of a protectorate
                    and leave the western islands to their rightful owners. The London missionaries
                    were replaced by French Protestants, but neither they nor the priests have been
                    very successful, possibly because French is a compulsory subject in the
                    Government schools. In 1880 <pb break="no"
