                    W. long.) on the little river Papagallo (Atoyac, formerly Zahuatl), which flows
                    between two hills at an altitude of considerably over 7000 feet, some 30 miles
                    north of La Puebla and 170 by rail from Vera Cruz. Tlaxcala was founded probably
                    about the close of the 13th century, when the Tlaxcaltecs, a branch of the
                    Nahuatl race closely akin to the Aztecs, withdrew from the western side of the
                    central lacustrine district and established a powerful democratic state in a
                    somewhat secluded, hill-encircled, but highly productive tract, 90 miles in
                    length by 70 in breadth, with a total area of over 1550 square miles. The
                    Tlaxcaltecs, hereditary foes of the Aztecs, became, after a short resistance
                    (September 1519), the firm allies of the Spaniards, their co-operation
                    contributing largely, if not mainly, to the overthrow of <pb break="no"

                    enslavement of Tlaxcala itself, the general decay of the country, and the
                    dispersion of most of the inhabitants by Cortes. A1though now reduced to a
                    population of a little over 5000, or, including the commune, to 36,000, and with
                    no monuments beyond a fine church, an old episcopal palace, and a town-hall, the
                    city at the time of the conquest was a very large place, containing nearly as
                    many inhabitants as the whole of the modern state (130,000). When occupied by
                    the Spaniards, its size and splendour excited the admiration of Cortes, w ho
                    describes it in somewhat exaggerated language as “much larger and much stronger
                    than Granada, with as fine buildings and much more people than Granada had at
                    the time it was captured, also much better supplied with the things of the
                    earth” <hi rend="italic">(Cartas,</hi> 67). It was disposed in four distinct
                    quarters separated by high stone walls, each with a palace for the ruling chief,
                    besides temples, and stone buildings for the nobles. But most of the other
                    houses were low mud or adobe structures. In the daily market, which was said to
                    be frequented by 30,000 people, were exposed for sale the products of the
                    surrounding country,—maize, maguey (extracted from the aloe), and chilli pepper;
                    to these are now added wheat, barley, pease, lentils, and a great variety of
                    fruits.</p>
                <p>A prominent feature of the landscape is the Sierra de Malintzi, or Malin ehe,
                    that is, “Lord of Marina,” a name given to Cortes after his alliance with the
                    “heroine of the conquest.” The Sierra (originally Matlacuezatl), which rises
                    grandly (more than 16,000 feet) above the plateau, takes a prominent place in
                    Tlaxcaltecan mythology, owing to the peculiar shape of its summit, representing
                    in rough outline the body of a native woman lying at full length in its grave
                    and partly wrapped in its cerements. There are some woollen manufactures,
                    centred chiefly in the capital, and also a few silver, copper, lead, and coal
                    mines in the San Ambrosio and San Mateo ranges; but the state is essentially
                    agricultural, yielding large annual crops of maize and wheat, the total produce
                    being valued at over £1,000,000.</p>
