                <p><label type="entry">TYPOGRAPHY</label> (writing by types) is the art of printing
                    (cast-metal) movable types on paper, vellum, &amp;c. It is quite distinct, not
                    only from writing, but from xylography or wood-engraving, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e</hi>., the art of cutting figures, letters, or words on blocks of wood and
                    taking impressions from such blocks, by means of ink or any other fluid coloured
                    substance, on paper or vellum.</p>
                <p>Possibly the earliest attempt to describe the art of typography is that in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Donatus</hi> issued by Peter Schoeffer, perhaps before 1456,
                    the colophon of which says that it was finished “Arte nova imprimendi seu
                    caracterizandi [from <hi rend="italic">character</hi> = letter] . . . absque
                    calami exaratione.” Fust and Schoeffer in the Mainz psalter of 1457 said that it
                    was formed by an “adinventio artificiosa imprimendi ac caracterizandi absque
                    calami ulla exaratione.” The colophon of the <hi rend="italic">Catholicon</hi>
                    of 1460 is more precise, and says that the book was printed “non calami, stili,
                    aut pennae suffragio, sed mira patronarum formarumque concordia, proportione, ac
                    modulo.” In 1462 Albrecht Pfister had “gedrucket” the <hi rend="italic">Four
                    Histories.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Liber Sextus Decretalium,</hi>
                    published in 1465, Fust and Schoeffer say that it was completed “non atramento
                    [“atramento communi,” in the Justinianus of 1468 and 1472], plumali canna neque
                    aerea, sed artificiosa quadam adinventione imprimendi seu caracterizandi,” a
                    phrase which they slightly varied in Cicero’s <hi rend="italic">Officia,</hi>
                    issued in the same year: “non atramento, plumali canna neque aerea, sed arte
                    quadam perpulcra.” The edition of St. Jerome’s <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>
                    of 1470 is said to have been completed by an “ars impressoria,” the <hi
                    rend="italic">Decretum Gratiani</hi> of 1472 by an “ars quaedam ingeniosa
                    imprimendi,” the <hi rend="italic">Dyalogus</hi> of 1478 by an “ars magistra.”
                    We find further—“ars sancta” or “divina,” “nova ars scribendi,” “novum
                    exscribendi genus prope divinum,” “sculptoria archetyporum ars,” “ars mirifica
                    formandi,” “ars excusoria,” “nova imprimendi ratio,” “ars pressurae,”
                    “chalcotypa ars,” “chalcographia” (1472 and later), “chalcographia excusoria
                    impressoriaque,” “libraria impressio,” “empryntynge” (Caxton, 1482), “prenterei”
                    (Schoeffer, 1492), “truckery” (1505), “impression des livres” (1498), and
                    “prenten.”</p>
                <p>The early printers called themselves, or were called by others, “libronim
                    prothocaragmatici” <hi rend="italic">(Gramm. Rhythm.,</hi> 1468), “impres-sores
                    libronim,” “exsculptor libronim” (Jenson, 1471), “chal-cographus” (1473; Hain,
                    13036), “magister artis impressoria?,” “boeckprinter”; and during the 16th
                    century we find them still frequently called “chalcotypus” and
                    “chalcographus.”</p>
                <p>The types were at first designated more by negative than positive expressions. In
                    1468 they were called “caragma,” later on “car-acter" or “character,”
                    “archetipae notae” (1473; Hain, 13036), “sculptoria archetyporum ars,”
                    “chalcotypa ars,” “formae,” “ar-tificiosissimae imprimendorum librorum formae.”
                    We soon hear also of the process and material by which they were produced. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Grammatica</hi> of 1468, published by Schoeffer, says that it
                    was “cast” (sum fusus libellus). In 1471 “aeneae formulae” are spoken of; and
                    Bernardus Cenninus and his son say that they had printed the Virgil “expressis
                    ante calibe caracteribus et deinde fusis literis” (with letters first cut into
                    steel and then cast). In 1473 Friedrich Creusner at Nuremberg says that he had
                    “cut” (sculpsit) the work of Diogenes (Hain, 6192). Johan Zeiner of Ulm says in
                    1474 that he had perfected a book, not with the pen, but with letters of metal
                    (stagneis caracteribus). In 1474 Joh. Ph. de Lignamine speaks of “metallicae
                    formae.” In 1476 Husner of Strasburg represents the Nider as being printed with
                    “letters cut of metal (litteris sculptis artificiali certe conatu ex aere).”
                    Nicolas Jenson printed in 1480 with letters “cut and cast” (sculptis ac
                    conflatis).</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">typographus</hi> does not seem to occur before 1488,
                    when it was used in the preface of P. Stephanus Dulcinius Scalae to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Astronomicon</hi> of Manilius, printed in that year at Milan by
                    Antonius Zarotus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Maittaire, <hi rend="italic">Annales Typogr.,</hi> i. 508, note
                    1.</p></note> in 1498 Erasmus uses it in a letter (dated 13th Feb.) to
                    Christianus, a Lübeck merchant;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Opp.,</hi> iii. col. 24.</p></note> and in
                    1517 Johan Schoeffer applies the word to himself in the colophon of the Aeneas
                    Sylvius published by him. But of the use of the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >typographia</hi> no earlier instance is known than 1520, in which year Gerardus
                    Noviomagus (=Geldenhaurius) in his <hi rend="italic">Lucubratiuncula de
                    Batavorum Insula</hi> (pref. to Nicol. Buscoducensis, dated 1520) says: “inventa
                    Germanorum . . . bombarda videlicet, typographia, pyxis char-taque nautica;” and
                    Johan Schott, a printer of Strasburg, in the <hi rend="italic">Geogr.
                    Ptolem.</hi> published by him, describes his grandfather, Johan Mentelin, as
                    “primus typographiae inventor.” Gerardus, it may be added, borrowed the whole
                    passage from Pet. Montanus (li. 1 <hi rend="italic">Adam,</hi> published <hi
                    rend="italic">a.</hi> 1504), who has chalcographia instead of typo graphia.
                    Meerman indeed<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Orig. Typogr.,</hi> i. p. 32, note <hi rend="italic"
                    >cx.</hi></p></note> speaks of a use of the word typographia (or at least of
                    typographus) earlier than 1520, and refers to the preface of Bernardinus
                    Veronensis in the edition of Tibullus, Catullus, and Propertius published at
                    Venice in 1493 by Symon Bevilaqua, “at least,” Meerman adds, “as it (the
                    preface) is read in the <hi rend="italic">Annal. Typogr.</hi> of Maittaire, i.
                    560, 2d ed.” But on page 560 Maittaire quotes the first two lines of
                    Bernardinus’s preface (till <hi rend="italic">dicit)</hi> and then adds: “Gratis
                    characteribus destitutus, typographus necesse habuit hiatus in commentario hic
                    illic relinquere,” which is evidently Maittaire’s own remark, not that of
                    Bernardinus. The present writer at least has been unable to find such a passage
                    in the Tibullus.</p>
                <p>Although the art of writing and that of block-printing both differ widely from
                    printing with movable metal types, yet this last process seems to have been such
                    a gradual transition from block-printing, and block-printing in its turn to have
                    been such a natural outcome of the many trials that were probably made to
                    produce books in some more expeditious manner than could be done with
                    handwriting, that a cursory glance at these two processes will not seem out of
                    place, all the less as a discussion on the origin and progress of typography
                    could hardly be understood without knowing the state of the literary development
                    at the time that printing appeared.</p>
                <p>The art of printing, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of impressing (by means of
                    certain forms and colours) figures, pictures, letters, words, lines, whole
                    pages, &amp;c., on other objects, as also the art of engraving, which is
                    inseparably connected with printing, existed long before the 15th century. Not
                    to go back to remoter essays, there is reason to suppose that mediaeval kings
                    and princes (among others William the Conqueror) had their monograms cut on
                    blocks of wood or metal in order to impress them on their charters. Such
                    impressions from stamps are found instead of seals on charters of the 15th
                    century. Manuscripts of the 12th century show initials which, on account of
                    their uniformity, are believed to have been impressed by means of stamps or
                    dies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Passavant, <hi

                    the idea of multiplying representations from one engraved plate or block or
                    other form was unknown to the ancients, whereas it is predominant in what we
                    call the art of blockprinting, and especially in that of typography, in which
                    the same types can be used again and again.</p>
                <p>Block-printing and printing with movable types seem to have been practised in
                    China and Japan long before they were known in Europe. It is said that in the
                    year 175 the text of the Chinese classics was cut upon tablets, which were
                    erected outside the university, and that impressions were taken of them, some of
                    which are said to be still in existence. Printing from wooden blocks can be
                    traced as far back as the 6th century, when the founder of the Suy dynasty is
                    said to have had the remains of the classical books engraved on wood, though it
                    was not until the 10th century that printed books became common. In Japan the
                    earliest example of block-printing dates from the period 764-770, when the
                    empress Shiyau-toku, in pursuance of a vow, had a million small wooden toy
                    pagodas made for distribution among the Buddhist temples and monasteries, each
                    of which was to contain a dhâranî out of the Buddhist Scriptures entitled
                    “Vimala nirbhasa Sûtra,” printed on a slip of paper about 18 inches in length
                    and 2 in width, which was rolled up and deposited in the body of the pagoda
                    under the spire. In a journal of the period, under the year 987, the expression
                    “printed” book” <hi rend="italic">(suri-hoñ)</hi> is found applied to a copy of
                    the Buddhist canon brought back from China by a Buddhist priest. This, of
                    course, must have been a Chinese edition; but the use of the term implies that
                    printed books were already known in Japan. It is said that the Chinese printed
                    with movable types (of clay) from the middle of the 11th century. The
                    authorities of the British Museum exhibit as the earliest instance of Corean
                    books printed with movable types a work printed in 1337. To the Coreans is
                    attributed the invention of copper types in the beginning of the 15th century;
                    and an inspection of books bearing dates of that <pb break="no"

                    even if they did not invent them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Ern. Satow, “On the Early Hist. of Printing in Japan,”

                <p>From such evidence as we have it would seem that Europe is not indebted to the
                    Chinese or Japanese for the art of block-printing, nor for that of printing with
                    movable types.</p>
                <p>In Europe, as late as the second half of the 14th century, every book (including
                    school and prayer books), and every public and private document, proclamation,
                    bull, letter, &amp;c., was written by hand; all figures and pictures, even
                    playing-cards and images of saints, were drawn with the pen or painted with a
                    brush. In the 13th century there already existed a kind of book trade. The
                    organization of universities as well as that of large ecclesiastical
                    establishments was at that time incomplete, especially in Italy, France, and
                    Germany, without a staff of scribes and transcribers <hi rend="italic"
                    >{scriptores),</hi> illuminators, lenders, sellers, and custodians of books <hi
                    rend="italic">{stationary librorum, librarii),</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >per-gamenarii, i.e.,</hi> persons who prepared and sold the vellum or parchment
                    required for books and documents. The books supplied were for the most part
                    legal, theological, and educational, and are calculated to have amounted to
                    above one hundred different works. As no book or document was approved unless it
                    had some ornamented and illuminated initials or capital letters, there was no
                    want of illuminators. The workmen scribes and transcribers were, perhaps without
                    exception, caligraphers, and the illuminators for the most part artists.
                    Beautifully written and richly illuminated manuscripts on vellum became objects
                    of luxury which were eagerly bought and treasured up by princes and people of
                    distinction. Burgundy of the 15th century, with its rich literature, its wealthy
                    towns, its love for art, and its school of painting, was in this respect the
                    centre of Europe, and the libraries of its dukes at Brussels, Bruges, Antwerp,
                    Ghent, &amp;c., contained more than three thousand beautifully illuminated
                    MSS.</p>
                <p>In speaking of the writing of the manuscripts of the 15th and two preceding
                    centuries, it is essential to distinguish, in each country, between at least
                    four different classes of writing, and two of these must be again subdivided
                    each into two classes. All these different kinds of writing were, in the first
                    instance, taken as models for cutting such portions of text as were intended to
                    illustrate and explain the figures in block-books, and afterwards as models for
                    the types used in the printing of books and documents.</p>
                <p>(1) The <hi rend="italic">book hand,</hi> that is, the ordinary writing of legal,
                    theological, and devotional books, was used by the official transcribers of the
                    universities and churches. These men had received a more or less learned
                    education, and consequently wrote or transcribed books with a certain pretence
                    of understanding them and of being able to write with greater rapidity than the
                    ordinary caligrapher. Hence their writing may be called (<hi rend="italic"

                    library and arsenal library each possesses a MS. composed in 1324, whereas the
                    British Museum has nine MSS. (six being illuminated) of the 14th and 15th

                <p>When all this writing, transcribing, illuminating, Ac., had reached their period
                    of greatest development, the art of printing from wooden blocks (block-printing,
                    xylography) on silk, cloth, &amp;c., vellum, and paper made its appearance in
                    Europe. It seems to have been practised, so far as we have evidence, on cloth,
                    &amp;c., and vellum as early as the 12th century,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Weigel, <hi rend="italic">Anfänge,</hi> i.

                    while it was largely employed in the early part of the 15th in the production of
                    (1) separate leaves (called <hi rend="italic">briefs,</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">breve,</hi> scriptum), containing either a picture (<hi

                    consisting of half picture and half text, or wholly of text, or altogether of
                    picture.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We have also
                    evidence that sometimes the picture or figures were printed from blocks, space
                    being reserved for the text, to be added afterwards by hand (see Bernard, <hi
                    rend="italic">Origine,</hi> i. 102).</p></note> It is, however, certain that
                    about 1400 xylography was known all over Germany, Flanders, and Holland.</p>
                <p>In these blocks, as in wood-engraving now, the lines to be printed were in
                    relief. The block, after the picture or the text had been engraved upon it, was
                    first thoroughly wetted with a thin, watery, pale brown material, much
                    resembling distemper; then a sheet of damp paper was laid upon it, and the back
                    of the paper was carefully rubbed with some kind of dabber or burnisher, usually
                    called a <hi rend="italic">frotton,</hi> till an impression from the ridges of
                    the carved block had been transferred to the paper. In this fashion a sheet
                    could only be printed on one side (anopisthographic); and in some copies of
                    block-books we find the sides on which there is no printing pasted together so
                    as to give the work the appearance of an ordinary book. There are only a few
                    block-books which do not possess this characteristic, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Legend of St Servatius</hi> in the royal library of Brussels, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Das Zeitglöcklein</hi> in the Bamberg library (<hi rend="italic">cf</hi>.
                    Falkenstein, p. 49), <hi rend="italic">Das geistlich und weltlich Rom</hi> at
                    Althorp and Gotha <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Falkenstein, p. 46); but these
                    belong to the end of the 15th century, and therefore to a later period than the
                    ordinary block-books. Consequently, if a man wanted to set up as a printer of
                    briefs or books, he needed no apparatus but a set of wood-blocks and a
                    rubber.</p>
                <p>Formerly it was the general opinion that playing-cards had been the first
                    products of xylography; but the earliest that have been preserved to us are done
                    by hand, while the printed ones date from the 15th century, therefore from a
                    period in which woodcuts were already used for other purposes. It is believed
                    that some of the wood engravings and block-books were printed in monasteries. In
                    a necrology of the Franciscan monastery at Nordlingen, which comes down to the
                    beginning of the 15th century, this entry occurs: “VII. Id. Augusti, obiit
                    Frater h. Luger, laycus, optimus incisor lignorum”; and on some of the
                    engravings we find the arms of certain monasteries, which may, however, merely
                    mean that they were printed for, not in, those monasteries. The registers of
                    Ulin mention several wood-engravers <hi rend="italic">(formschneider),—</hi> in
                    1398 a certain Ulrich; in 1441 Heinrich Peter von Erolzheim, Joerg, and another
                    Heinrich; in 1442 Ulrich and Lienhart; in 1447 Claus (Nicolas), Stoffel
                    (Christopher), and Johann; in 1455 Wilhelm; in 1461 Meister Ulrich, &amp;c. In a
                    register of taxes of Nordlingen we find from 1428 to 1452 a certain Wilhelm
                    Kegeler mentioned as <hi rend="italic">brief-trücker</hi>; in 1453 his widow is
                    called <hi rend="italic">alt brieftriivkerin</hi>; and in 1461 his brother
                    Wilhelm is registered for the same craft. At Mainz there was a printer, Henne
                    Cruse, in 1440. At Nuremberg we find in 1449 Hans, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >formschneider,</hi> while his son Junghans exercised the same industry from
                    1472 to 1490. Hans von Pfedersheim printed at Frankfort in 1459, and Peter
                    Schott at Strasburg in 1464. A certain George Glockendon exercised the same
                    trade at Nuremberg till 1474, when he died, being succeeded by a son and
                    afterwards by a grandson. In Flanders a Jan de Printere was established at
                    Antwerp in 1417; and printers and wood engravers <hi rend="italic">(houte
                    bild-snyters)</hi> worked there in 1442 <hi rend="italic">(Privileges of the
                    Corporation of St Luke</hi> at Antwerp). At Bruges <hi rend="italic"
                    >printers</hi> and <hi rend="italic">beeldemakers</hi> (makers, engravers of
                    images) were enumerated in 1454 among the members of the fraternity of St John
                    the Evangelist. The printers of playing cards seem to have constituted a
                    separate class. These entries show that about the middle of the 15th century
                    there were men who exercised the art of wood-engraving and printing as a trade
                    or craft. It seems also certain that wealthy persons and religious institutions
                    were wont to possess sets of blocks, and, when occasion arose, they printed a
                    set of sheets for presentation to a friend, or in the case of monasteries for
                    sale to the passing pilgrim. A printer of briefs or block-books had no need to
                    serve an apprenticeship; any neat-handed man could print for himself. We learn
                    from the inventory of the possessions of Jean de Hinsberg, bishop of Liége
                    (1419-1455), and his sister, a nun in the convent of Bethany, near Mechlin, that
                    they possessed “unum instrumentum ad imprimendas scripturas et ymagines,” and
                    “novem printe lignee ad imprimendas ymagines cum quatuordecim aliis lapideis
                    printis.” These entries would seem to indicate that people purchased engraved
                    blocks of wood or of stone from the woodcutter rather than books from a
                    printer.</p>
                <p>The earliest dated woodcut that we know of is the St Christopher of 1423,
                    preserved in the library of Lord Spencer at Althorp. The Mary engraving, which
                    is preserved at Brussels and apparently bears the date mccccxviii., is now
                    declared to be of 1468, the date having been falsified. The next date after that
                    of the St Christopher is 1437, found on a woodcut preserved in the imperial
                    library at Vienna. It was discovered in 1779 in the monastery of St Blaise in
                    the Black Forest, and represents the martyrdom of St Sebastian, with fourteen
                    lines of text. The date, however, is said by others to refer to a concession of
                    indulgences. A woodcut, preserved in the library at Vienna, which represents St
                    Nicolas de Tolentino, has the date 1440, but written in by hand; as the saint
                    was canonized in that year, it may refer to that event. Another in the Weigel
                    collection representing the bearing of the cross, St Dorothea and St Alexis, has
                    the date 1443, also written in by hand, though the woodcut is considered to
                    belong to that period. These are the only known wood-engravings with dates
                    anterior to the second half of the 15th century. But there exist a good many
                    woodcuts which, from the style of the engraving, are presumed to be of an
                    earlier date, and to have been printed partly in the fourteenth and partly in
                    the first half of the 15th century. J. D. Passavant<note anchored="true"

                <p>Of block-books of probable German origin the following are known :—</p>
                <p>(1) The <hi rend="italic">Apocalypsis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Historia S.
                    Johannis Evangelistae ejusque Visiones Apocalypticae</hi> (Germ. <hi

                    work six or seven editions are said to exist, each containing forty-eight (the
                    2d and 3d edition fifty) illustrations, on as many anopisthographic leaves,
                    which seem to have been divided into three quires of eight sheets each. The
                    first edition alone is without signatures.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Ars Moriendi.</hi> Of this work some authors think that
                    there are early German editions, among others that spoken of below as the 2d
                    Dutch edition. Certainly German is the edition of Hans Sporer of Nuremberg,
                    1473, in the public library at Zwickau, of another by Ludwig zu Ulm, in the
                    Paris national library, and of that described in <hi rend="italic">Collectio
                    Weigel.</hi> (ii. 16), where also other, but opisthographic, editions are
                    described.</p>

                <p>When we, for the moment, leave out of sight the question as to when, where, and
                    by whom the art of printing with movable metal types was invented, and take our
                    stand on well-authenticated dates in such printed documents as have been
                    preserved to us, we find that the first printed date, 1454, occurs in two
                    different editions of the same letters of indulgence issued in that year by Pope
                    Nicholas V. in behalf of the kingdom of Cyprus.</p>
                <p>These two editions are distinguished respectively as the 31-line and the 30-line
                    indulgence. The former, of which three different issues with the printed date
                    mccccliiii., and a fourth with the printed date mcccclv., are known to exist,
                    claims priority<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>No
                    inferences can be drawn from this priority, as it merely rests on the date of a
                    sold copy that has come to light.</p></note> from a chronological point of view
                    over the latter, of which one issue with the printed date mccccliiii., and two
                    issues with the printed date mcccclquinto, are known to exist, because one of
                    the sold copies that has been preserved was issued at Erfurt on 15th November
                    1454, whereas of the 30-line indulgence the earliest sold copy that has as yet
                    come down to us was issued at Cologne on 27 th February 1455, though it
                    distinctly has the printed date mccccliiii., but altered with the pen to
                    mccccliiiij. In the 31-line indulgence occur (1) a large church type usually
                    regarded as identical with that of the 36-line Bible, and used for the rubrics
                    of the absolutions, for the word with which the document commences, and for the
                    Christian name of the pope’s legate; (2) a smaller text or brief type, which was
                    afterwards very closely imitated, if not actually used, at Eltville, in printing
                    the 1472 edition of the <hi rend="italic">Vocαbulαrius ex quo</hi> and an
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Summa de Articulis Fidei</hi> of Thomas
                    Aquinas; (3) a large initial V and two large initials M, which differ from each
                    other. In the 30-line indulgence occur (1) a large church type, which is used as
                    in the 31-line indulgence, and is usually regarded as identical with that of the
                    42-line Bible; (2) a smaller text or brief type, of which as yet no further
                    trace has been found; (3) a large initial U, and two large initials M, which
                    differ from each other, the first being identical with the initial M of the
                    second absolution of a 33-line indulgence printed by Peter Schoeffer in 1489 for
                    “Raymundus Peyraudi, archidiaconus Alnisiensis in ecclesia Xanton,” who issued
                    it at the order of Pope Innocent VIII., “pro tuicione orthodoxe fidei contra
                    Turchos.” These two different editions are usually regarded as having been
                    printed at Mainz; and, so long as there is no evidence to the contrary, we may
                    assume that such was really the fact. But we must at the same time conclude that
                    about November 1454 there were at least two rival printers at work there,—(1)
                    the printer of the 31-line indulgence, whose name has not yet transpired, but
                    who may have been Johan Gutenberg, perhaps subsidized by Johan Fust; (2) the
                    printer of the 30-line indulgence, who was no doubt Peter (Schoeffer) de
                    Gernss-heym, on account of the connexion of this indulgence with that of 1489,
                    which was unquestionably printed by him. Latterly four written copies of the
                    same indulgence have been found, which respectively bear the dates,—Frankfort,
                    10th April 1454 (in the possession of Herr Lais, Wiesbaden); Frankfort, 11th
                    April 1454 (Frankfort archives); 11th July 1454 (place unknown; Darmstadt
                    archives); Lübeck, 6th October 1454. As their dates precede by a few weeks only
                    the earliest known printed date (15th November 1454), they mark, perhaps, the
                    exact time when printing made its appearance at Mainz in an already advanced
                    state of perfection.</p>
                <p>In following up the basis afforded by the above indulgences we may give a short
                    chronological view of the early printing at Mainz, so far as it is at present

                <p>The Paris library possesses a paper on vellum, and corresponds in copy, and also
                    a separate copy of every respect to the 42-line Bible, the last leaf, which
                    bears the MS. having double columns, 42 lines, date 1461. Other copies exist in
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The above four types and the books printed with them (besides a few others
                    printed by Albrecht Pfister at Bamberg) are the only ones that stand in close
                    connexion with the question regarding the introduction, or the possible
                    invention, of printing at Mainz. It has been pointed out above that one of the
                    initial M’s of the 30-line indulgence of 1454 occurs again in an indulgence of
                    1489, printed by Schoeffer; hence types 3 and 4 and the books printed with them
                    must be ascribed to this printer, in spite of the fact that the capital P found
                    in the indulgence does not seem to occur again in the 42- line Bible. No further
                    trace of the brief type 4 has yet been found, and perhaps Schoeffer melted it
                    down for his other types. As Schoeffer. in the colonhon of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Donatus</hi> (v.) which bears his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n710/mode/1up"

                    capitalibus,” and as these capitals gradually disappear after 1459 and the type
                    of the 42-line Bible is no longer found after 1456, we must presume that the
                    seven incunabula mentioned above were printed by Peter Schoeffer alone before he
                    entered (in 1457) into partnership with Johan Fust.<note anchored="true"

                    >Gutenberg</hi>, p. 160 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>There is no such certainty as regards types 1 and 2 and the books printed with
                    them. If the 31-line indulgence may be assumed to have been printed at Mainz,
                    its printer was in all probability Johan Gutenberg, though it would seem from a
                    lawsuit of 1455 (see p. 690 below) between him and Fust that in that year
                    Gutenberg had not yet printed anything, and in 1454 (1455) Fust evidently called
                    him to account for not having produced anything. Certain circumstances point to
                    Albrecht Pfister as the printer of the eight incunabula in the left-hand column.
                    First, he undoubtedly printed with type 1 in that city as early as 1461, for on
                    14th February of that year he issued in that type an edition of Boner’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Edelstein</hi> (88 leaves, fol., with wood engravings), and
                    printed with the same type at least eight other works,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Hessels, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gutenberg</hi>, p. 161 <hi rend="italic">sq</hi>.</p></note> one of which was
                    issued in 1462, the seven others without a date. Secondly, most of the copies of
                    the 36-line Bible were at one time or another preserved in the libraries of
                    Bavaria, and a great number of fragments have been discovered in monasteries in
                    that country, even in a register of the abbey of St Michael at Bamberg of the
                    year 1460. Thirdly, a transfer of type from Gutenberg to Pfister is contrary to
                    all analogy in the infancy of printing, when every printer started with a type
                    of his own making. But, as there is no direct evidence as to who really
                    possessed types 1 and 2 before 1460, we have not felt justified in assigning the
                    31-line indulgence and the other seven incunabula (including the 36-line Bible)
                    to Pfister.</p>
                <p>It is alleged that, in consequence of the lawsuit between Gutenberg and Fust, the
                    former was deprived of all tools, &amp;c., which he had made, or is supposed to
                    have made, with the money which the latter had advanced to him, and that
                    afterwards a certain Dr Homery or Humery, a syndic of Mainz, lent him fresh
                    money to enable him to establish another printing office. This allegation is
                    made on the strength of a letter of obligation (of 26th February 1468), given by
                    Dr Homery to Adolph, the archbishop of Mainz, by which he acknowledges to have
                    received from the said archbishop “several forms, letters, instruments,
                    implements, and other things belonging to the work of printing, which Johan
                    Gutenberg had left after his death, and which had belonged and still did belong
                    to him (Dr Homery).” It is presumed that with these types, which we may call the
                    Mainz type No. 5, Gutenberg printed (i.) Joannes de Balbis, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catholicon,</hi> 1460, 373 leaves, folio, 2 columns of 66 lines each, copies of

                    the British Museum and the Paris library; and (v.) indulgence of 1461 of 15
                    lines.</p>
                <p>On 18th January 1465 Adolph II., archbishop of Mainz, appointed “Johan Gudenberg,
                    on account of his grateful and willing service, his servant and courtier (<hi
                    rend="italic">dhiener und hoffgesind)</hi> for life, promising to supply him
                    with clothing and each year 20 ‘ malter ’ of corn and 2 ‘fuder’ of wine.” It has
                    always been inferred from this that Gutenberg had quitted Mainz and gone to
                    Eltville (Elfeld) to reside at the archbishop’s court, and that, his dignity as
                    courtier preventing him from printing himself, he passed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catholicon</hi> types on to Henry Bechtermuncze at Eltville. But recent
                    researches have shown that Gutenberg remained at Mainz till his death in 1468.
                    We certainly find in 1467 the <hi rend="italic">Catholicon</hi> type with some
                    additions (already found in the indulgence of 1461) at Eltville near Mainz, in
                    the hands of Henry and Nicholas Bechtermuncze and Wigandus Spyes de Orthenberg,
                    who finished on 4th November of that year (vi.) <hi rend="italic">Vοcabularius
                    ex quo</hi> (a Latin-German vocabulary) in 4to, 166 leaves, 35 lines, the only
                    known copy of which is in the Paris library, and (vii.) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vocabularius ex quo,</hi> second edition, with colophon dated 5th June 1469,
                    4to, 165 leaves, 35 lines, copies of which exist in Lord Spencer’s library, at
                    Blenheim, and in the Paris library. Now it is asked how the Bechtermunczes could
                    have been using the <hi rend="italic">Catholicon</hi> type in 1467, if we assume
                    that it was this type to which Homery refers in his letter of obligation as
                    being in his possession. Some, therefore, conclude that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catholicon</hi> and the four other works in the same type were printed at Mainz
                    by Henry Bechtermuncze, who may afterwards have transferred his printing office
                    to Eltville. In that case it is difficult to see what type Homery could refer
                    to, unless it were type 2, a close imitation of which, if not the actual tvne,
                    was used by Nicholas</p>
                <p>Bechtermuncze at Eltville in printing (12th March 1472) a third edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Vocabularius ex quo,</hi> 166 leaves, 35 lines, copies of

                    (Munich library).</p>
                <p>It is necessary to point out that for nearly seventy years eight books—(1) <hi

                    ascribed to Gutenberg on the strength (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of the date

                    in the Darmstadt library, and (5) of a so-called rubrication alleged to be in a
                    copy of the <hi rend="italic">Tractatus de Celebratione Missarum,</hi> in which
                    “Johannes dictus a bono monte” and Johannes Numeister are represented as
                    offering this work on 19th June 1463 to the Carthusians at Mainz. But the date
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Prognostication</hi> has been falsified from 1482 into
                    1460, and the rubrication in the <hi rend="italic">Tractatus</hi> is a
                    forgery.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Hessels,

                <p>When we set aside the above works, there is no further difficulty as regards the
                    history of Mainz printing. Fust and Schoeffer worked together from 1457 to 1466,
                    starting in August 1457 with an edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Psalterium,</hi> printed in large missal types, which, as far as we know, is
                    the first printed book which bears a date, besides the place where it was
                    printed and the name of the printers. It was reprinted with the same types in
                    1459 (the second printed book with date, place, and name of printer), in 1490,
                    and in 1502 (the last work of Schoeffer, who had manufactured its types). In
                    1459 Fust and Schoeffer also published Gul. Durantus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rationale Divinorum Officiorum,</hi> with the small type (usually called
                    Durandus type) with which they continued to print long afterwards. In 1460 they
                    published the <hi rend="italic">Constitutiones</hi> of Pope Clement V., the text
                    printed in a type (Clement type) about a third larger than the Durandus. This
                    type was, however, in existence in 1459, as the colophon of the Durandus is

                    in a copy at Freiburg in the Breisgau; 2. Adolph Rusch de Inguilen, who is

                <p>Till the moment (say 1477) that printing spread to almost all the chief towns of
                    Germany, Italy, Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, Spain, England, not a
                    single printer carried away with him a set of types or a set of punches or
                    moulds from the master who had taught him, but, in setting up his printing
                    office, each man cast a set of types for his own use, always imitating as
                    closely as possible the handwriting of some particular manuscript which he or
                    his patron desired to publish. When we compare Schoeffer's 30-line indulgence of
                    1454 with a manuscript copy of the same indulgence dated 10th April 1454, now in
                    the hands of a private collector at Wiesbaden, we see that the types used in
                    printing that document were specially cast for the purpose after the model of
                    the handwriting employed for the written copies. We know also that the types of
                    the 36-line and 42-line Bibles and those of the psalter of 1457 are the closest
                    possible imitations of the ornamental church handwriting customary at the time
                    of their production. Also, when we compare the 31-line indulgence of 1454 with
                    the German blockbook called the <hi rend="italic">Enndtchrist,</hi> and both in
                    their turn with the German MSS. of that period (especially the manuscript
                    portions in the printed copies of the indulgences), we see that the cutter of
                    the text type of the indulgence, as well as the engraver of the blockbook,
                    formed his characters according to some German handwriting (book hand) of the
                    period. This imitation extended, not only to the shape of the letters, but
                    likewise to all those combinations of letters (double <hi rend="italic">p,</hi>
                    double <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> double <hi rend="italic">s, st, ti, tu, re, cu,
                    cl, si, de, co, ci, te, ce, or, ve, po, fa, he, be,</hi> &amp;c.) and
                    contractions (for <hi rend="italic">pro, -urn, -em, -en, the-, uer, -bus, -bis,
                    sed, am, tur, qui, quae, quod, secundum,</hi> &amp;c. ) which were then, and had
                    been for many centuries, in use by scribes. In most, if not all cases, the MSS.
                    which the printers imitated were indigenous to the place where they settled.
                    Thus the first printers of Subiaco, though they were Germans and had most
                    probably learned the art of casting types and printing at Mainz, clearly cut
                    their types after the model of some Italian MS. which was free from any Gothic
                    influence, but written in a pure Caroline minuscle hand, differing but slightly
                    from the Caroline minuscles which the same printers adopted two years afterwards
                    at Rome. The first Paris printers started in 1470 with a type cast in the most
                    exact manner, on the model of the Caroline minuscle handwriting then in vogue at
                    Paris. John de Westphalia, who introduced printing into Belgium, used from the
                    beginning a type which he calls Venetian. Where therefore there is a great
                    similarity, but no absolute identity, between the types of two printers <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Schoeffer and Ulr. Zell), it should be attributed to
                    the similarity of the handwritings which the printers followed rather than to
                    any attempt on their part to imitate each other’s types. To this universal
                    system (clearly discernible in the first twenty-five years of printing) of each
                    printer setting up business with a new type cast by himself, there are,
                    according to the conjectures of a good many bibliographers, only two exceptions.
                    One is Albrecht Pfister (see above); the other is the Bechtermunczes of Eltville
                    (see above).</p>
                <p>Another most important feature in the earliest books is that the printers
                    imitated, not only the handwriting, with all its contractions, combined letters,
                    &amp;c., but all the other peculiarities of the MSS. they copied. There is in
                    the first place the unevenness of the lines, which very often serves as a guide
                    to the approximate date of a book, especially when we deal with the works of the
                    same printer, since each commenced with uneven lines, and gradually made them
                    less uneven, and finally even. This unevenness was unavoidable in manuscripts as
                    well as in block-books; but in the earliest printed books it is regarded as
                    evidence of the inability of the printers to space out their lines. If this
                    theory be correct, this inability was perhaps owing to the types being
                    perforated and connected with each other by a thread, or to some other cause
                    which has not yet been clearly ascertained. But it is not impossible that the
                    unevenness was simply part and parcel of the system of imitating MSS., and that
                    only gradually (about 1473 or 1474, but in some cases later) printers began to
                    see that even lines looked better than uneven. This seems clear when we observe
                    that the imitation of MSS. was carried so far that sometimes things which
                    deviated from the work of the scribe, but had accidentally been printed in, were
                    afterwards erased and altered in conformity with the MS. The Paris library, for
                    instance, possesses two copies of the <hi rend="italic">Liber Epistolarum</hi>
                    of Gasparinus Pergamensis (printed at Paris in 1470) in both of which the
                    initial G of the first line and the initial M of the fourth line were printed
                    in, and, whilst they have been allowed to remain in one of the copies, in the
                    other they were regarded as a fault and replaced by a rubricated L and Μ.</p>
                <p>In the second place the initials of books or the chapters of books in MSS., and
                    again in block-books and the earliest products of ]&gt;rinting, were always, or
                    at least in most cases (they are printed in the indulgences of 1454), omitted by
                    the scribe and the printer, and afterwards filled in by the rubricator. As the
                    latter artists were sometimes illiterate and very often filled up the gap by a
                    wrong initial, we find in a good many MSS. as well as early printed books small
                    letters written either in the margin or in the blank left for the initial, to
                    guide the rubricator. In most cases where these letters (which are now called
                    initial directors) were written in the margin, they were placed as much as
                    possible on the edges of the pages in order that they might be cut away by the
                    binder as unsightly; but in a vast number of incunabula they have remained till
                    the present day.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    university library of Basel possesses a collection of the earliest Paris books
                    still bound in their original binding, in which these initial directors are
                    written not only on the outer edges but on the inner sides of the pages, and so
                    close to the back that they can only be seen by stretching the books wide
                    open.</p></note> After a few years these initial directors were in a good many
                    books printed in (in lower-case type) with the text. In all cases, whether
                    written or printed, they were meant to be covered by the illuminated initial;
                    but, as a matter of fact, the latter very seldom covers the initial director so
                    completely as to make it invisible, and in a good many cases the intended
                    illumination was never carried into effect.</p>
                <p>With respect to the hyphens, which were used in the 1454 indulgences and the
                    36-line and 42-line Bibles, always outside the printed margin, some of the
                    earliest printers did not employ them at the moment that they started their
                    presses, and in the case of some printers the non-use or use of hyphens, and
                    their position outside or inside the printed margin, serve as a guide to the
                    dating, of their products. After about 1472 they become more uniform in their
                    shape and more generally used.</p>
                <p>The use of signatures is confined in MSS. mostly to mark the quires, and in
                    block-books to mark each sheet or page; they do not occur in printed books
                    before 1472 (at least in no earlier book with a date), when they appear in Joh.

                <p>Pagination or rather foliation was first used by Am. Ther Hoernen, at Cologne in
                    1471, in Adrianus’s <hi rend="italic">Liber de Remediis Fortuitorum Casuum,</hi>
                    having each leaf (not page) numbered by figures placed in the end of the line on
                    the middle of each right-hand page.</p>
                <p>The practice among early printers of imitating and reproducing MSS. was not
                    abandoned till many years after the first printed book (1454) made its
                    appearance; and, looking at the books printed, say from 1454 to 1477, from our
                    present standpoint of daily improvement and alteration, the printing of that
                    period may be said to have been almost wholly stagnant, without any improvement
                    or modification. If some printers (for instance, Sweynheym and Pannarts at
                    Subiaco and Rome, and Nicolas Jenson at Venice) produced handsomer books than
                    others, this is to be attributed to the beauty of the MSS. imitated and the
                    paper used rather than to any superior skill. Generally speaking, therefore, we
                    shall not be very far wrong in saying that the workmanship of Ketelaer and De
                    Leempt’s first book, published at Utrecht c. 1473, and that of Caxton’s first
                    book issued at Westminster in 1477, exhibit the very same stage of the art of
                    printing as the 1454 indulgences. If therefore any evidence were found that
                    Ketelaer and De Leempt and Caxton had really printed their first books in 1454,
                    there would be nothing in the workmanship of these books to prevent us from
                    placing them in that year. And conversely, if the indulgences of 1454 had been
                    issued without a date or without any names to indicate their approximate date,
                    their workmanship would invariably induce bibliographers to ascribe them to <hi
                    rend="italic">circa</hi> 1470, if not somewhat later. Even after 1477 the
                    alterations in the mode of printing books proceeded very slowly and almost
                    imperceptibly. It came to be no longer a universal system for printers to begin
                    business by casting a type for themselves, but some received their types from
                    one of their colleagues. And, though there were still many varieties of types,
                    one sort began to make its appearance in two or three different places. The
                    combinations of letters were the first to disappear; but the contractions remain
                    in a good many books even of the 17th century.</p>
                <p>Some theories have been based on, and others have been considered to be upset by,
                    the supposition that the early printers always required as much type as printers
                    of the present day, or at any rate so much as would enable them to set up, not
                    only a whole quire of 4 or 5 sheets ( = 8 or 10 leaves = 16 or 20 pages), but
                    even two quires ( = 40 pages). Consequently calculations have been made that,
                    for instance, the printer of the 42-line Bible required a fount of at least
                    120,000 characters.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Bernard, <hi rend="italic">origine de l'Impr.,</hi> i. 164, who was a printer
                    himself and speaks very strongly on this point.</p></note> But, though the <hi
                    rend="italic">Speculum Humanae Salvationis</hi> seems to have been printed by
                    whole sheets (2 pages), there are numberless proofs that many early books were
                    printed page by page, even when in small 4to. For instance, in some books it has
                    been observed that portions of the types with which the text of the first,
                    second, or third pages of a quire had been printed were used to “lock up” the
                    types employed for the later pages of the same quire, as is evident from the
                    blank impressions of such portions being found on these later pages. Again, in
                    some books two, three, or four blank leaves are found at the end, showing a
                    miscalculation of the printer. Moreover, the numerous itinerant printers of the
                    15th century, who established a press for a short time wherever they went, prove
                    that the furniture of the earliest printing offices must have been of no great
                    extent.</p>

                <p>Now that we have traced the art of printing from the moment (1454) that it made
                    its appearance in a perfect state at Mainz, and have followed its spread to all
                    the chief places of Europe till 1500, we must take notice of the controversy
                    which has been carried on for nearly four hundred years as to when, where, and
                    by whom the art was invented. For this purpose we will gather up into a
                    chronological sequence (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) a few of the most important
                    expressions used by the earliest printers in their colophons, (6) whatever
                    documentary evidence there may be on the subject, and (c) some accounts of the
                    earliest authors on the subject. (The letters A, B, &amp;c., are for the sake of
                    convenient reference.)</p>
                <p>The earliest testimony (A) to which we may refer is the notarial instrument,
                    dated 6th November 1455, of the lawsuit between Fust and Gutenberg, whereby the
                    former sought to recover 2026 guilders from the latter in repayment of 1600
                    guilders (800 advanced in 1450 or 1449 and another 800 in 1452), with the
                    interest thereon. Fust speaks here<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Gutenberg speaks of “tools” in preparation, “workmen’s wages, house-rent,

                    both” (49), and “their common use” (60). (B) In the earliest<note

                    a date (the Mainz psalter, issued 14th August 1457 by Fust and Peter Schoeffer)
                    it is said that it was perfected at Mainz by an “adinventio artificiosa
                    imprimendi ac caracterizandi absque calami ulla exaratione” (repeated and varied
                    later; see p. 681 above). &amp;c.; (C) In 1460 the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catholicon</hi> was published at Mainz, without the name of the printer; but
                    the colophon, after stating that the book was printed at Mainz, which town God’s
                    mercy had deigned to prefer above other nations of the earth, adds (D) that the
                    book was printed and completed “non calami, stili, aut pennae suffragio, sed
                    mira patronarum formarumque concordia, proporcione, et modulo.” This work is
                    considered to have been printed by Gutenberg, and the mention of God’s mercy is
                    regarded as an allusion to the invention of printing. The phrase is, however,
                    also found in the <hi rend="italic">Liber Sextus Decretalium,</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Summa</hi> of Thomas Aquinas, and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clementinas,</hi> published respectively on 17th December 1465, 6th March, and
                    8th October 1467, by Fust and Schoeffer. (E) On 17th January 1465 Adolph II.,
                    archbishop of Mainz, by a public decree, appointed Gutenberg as his servant in
                    reward for “his services,” but he does not speak of him as the inventor of
                    printing, nor even as a printer. (F) In the <hi rend="italic">Grammatica
                    Rhythmica,</hi> published in 1466 by Fust and Schoeffer, the third line of the
                    colophon runs: “Hinc Nazareni sonet oda per ora Johannis,” which was formerly
                    regarded as an allusion to Johann Fust or Johann Gutenberg, but which more
                    probably refers to Johann Brannen or Fons, the author of the grammar. (G) On
                    26th February 1468 Dr Homery wrote to the archbishop of Mainz the letter quoted
                    above, from which it may be inferred that Gutenberg had been a printer, though
                    not a word is said as to his being the inventor of printing. (H) In 1468
                    Schoeffer reprinted Fons’s <hi rend="italic">Grammatica,</hi> and in the
                    colophon it is said: “At Moguntina sum fusus in urbe libellus meque (the book)
                    domus genuit unde caragma venit.” (I) Schoeffer published on 24th May 1468 the
                    first edition of <hi rend="italic">Justiniani Imper. Institutionum Juris Libri
                    VI., cum Glossa.</hi> To this were added by way of colophon some verses
                    commencing: “Scema tabernaculi, &amp;c.,” in which it is said that (the ornament
                    of the church) Jesus “hos dedit eximios sculpendi in arte magistros . . . Quos
                    genuit ambos urbs Moguntina Johannes, librorum insignes prothocaragmaticos,”
                    which is regarded as an allusion to Johann Gutenberg and Johann Fust as first
                    printers. (K) In the same year (1468) Johannes Andreas, bishop of Aleria, says,
                    in the dedication of his edition of St Jerome’s <hi rend="italic">Epistles,</hi>
                    published in that year (13th December) at Rome, to Pope Paul II., that “Germany
                    is to be honoured for ever as having been the inventress of the greatest
                    utilities. Cardinal Cusa wished that the sacred art of printing, which then
                    (under Cardinal Cusa, who died 11th August 1464) seemed to have arisen in
                    Germany, were brought to Rome.” (L) In 1470 Guil. Fichet, in an octastichon
                    inserted in the Paris edition of 1470 of the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> of
                    Gasparinus of Bergamo, exhorts Paris to take up the almost divine art of writing
                    (printing) which Germany is acquainted with. In the same year Erhard Windsberg
                    writes to the same effect in an epigram inserted in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistolae Phalaridis</hi> published at Paris about 1470. (M)</p>
                <p>In 1471 Ludov. Carbo speaks, in the dedication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Letters</hi> of Pliny to Borso, duke of Modena, of the Germans having invented
                    printing. Nicolaus Gupalatinus speaks (Venice, 1471) of a German being the
                    inventor of printing, and Nicolaus Perottus of the art which had lately come
                    from Germany. (N) On 21st May 1471 Nicolas Jenson published an edition of
                    Quintilian, edited and revised by Ognibene de Lonigo (Omnibonus Leonicenus), who
                    in the preface speaks of its printer as “librariae artis mirabilis inventor, non
                    ut scribantur calamo libri, sed veluti gemma imprimantur, ac prope sigillo,
                    primus omnium ingeniose demonstravit.” (O) About 1472 the first three printers
                    of Paris published Gasparinus Perga-mensis’s <hi rend="italic">Orthographiae
                    Liber,</hi> to which is prefixed (in the copy of the university of Basel) a
                    letter, dated 1st January, from Guillaume Fichet, prior of the Sorbonne, to
                    Robert Gaguin, in which he says that “it is rumoured in Germany that not far
                    from the city of Mainz a certain Johann Gutenberg (Johannes, cui cognomen
                    Bone-montano) first of all invented the art of printing (impressoriam artem), by
                    means of which books are made with letters of metal, not with a reed (as the
                    ancients did), nor with the pen (as is done at present).” (P) On 14th July 1474
                    Joh. Philippus de Lignamine published at Rome <hi rend="italic">Chronica
                    Summorum Pontificum Imperatorumque,</hi> in which we find, between two entries,
                    relating one to 14th July 1459 and the other to 1st October 1459, an undated
                    paragraph in which it is said that Jacobus with the surname of Gutenberg of
                    Strasburg and a certain other one named Fustus, “imprimendarum litterarum in
                    membranis cum metallicis formis periti, trecentas cartas quisque eoram per diem
                    facere innotescunt apud Moguntiam Germanie civitatem.” The same is said of
                    Mentelin, and (under 1464) of Conrad Sweynheym, Arnold Pannarts, and Udalricus
                    Gallus. (Q) On 23d May 1476 Peter Schoeffer issued the third edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutiones</hi> of Justinian, with the same imprint as in the
                    edition <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n713/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0713-0688"/> of 1468 (see testimony I), but with the addition
                    that Mainz is the “impressoriae artis inventrix elimatrixque prima.” (R) In 1478
                    an edition of the <hi rend="italic">Fasciculus Temporum</hi> was issued at
                    Cologne, in which it is stated under the year 1457 that the printers of books
                    were multiplied on earth, deriving the origin of their art from Mainz. The
                    earlier editions merely stated that the printers of books were multiplied on
                    earth. (S) In 1483 Matthias Palmerius of Pisa published at Venice the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chron. Euseb.,</hi> in which under the year 1457 it is stated that
                    students owe a great debt to Germany, where Johannes Guttenberg zum Jungen,
                    knight of Mainz, invented the art of printing in 1440. (T) In the same year Jac.
                    Phil. Foresta of</p>
                <p>Bergamo published <hi rend="italic">Supplementum Chronicorum,</hi> in which he
                    says under the year 1458 that the art of printing books was first discovered in
                    Germany, according to some by Guthimberg of Strasburg, according to others by
                    Faust (see P), according to others by Nicolas Jenson (see N). (V) On 6th March
                    1492 Peter Schoeffer published the <hi rend="italic">Niedersächsische
                    Chronik</hi> of Conrad Botho, saying in the colophon that it was “geprent . . .
                    in . . . Mentz, die eyn anefangk is der prentery.” (X) At the end of 1494 two
                    Heidelberg professors, Adam Wernher and Joh. Herbst, composed some Latin verses
                    in honour of Johannes Gensfleisch (a family name by which Gutenberg was known,
                    and which was turned into the Latin Ansicarus), whom they called “primus
                    librorum impressor” and “impressoriae artis inventor primus.”<note

                    (d. 1396), in which he, on leaf 22a, praises Joannes Ansicarus in verse on
                    account of his invention at Mainz. (Z) These verses are preceded by an epitaph
                    on Johann Gensfleisch, “artis impressoriae inventor” and “repertor,” written in
                    Latin by Adam Gelthus, a relative of Gutenberg. (AA) In the same year Polydore
                    Vergil <hi rend="italic">(De Inventoribus Rerum,</hi> Venice, 1499, lib. ii.
                    cap. 7) says that a certain Peter [Schoeffer ?], a German, invented in 1442 the
                    art of printing at Mainz in Germany, as he had heard from the latter’s
                    countryman; this statement was repeated in a Venice edition of 1503. In later
                    editions “Peter” was altered to “Job. Gutenberg.” (BB) In the same year
                    Koelhoff, printer at Cologne, published <hi rend="italic">Cronica van der
                    billiger Stat van Coellen,</hi> in which on fol. 312b it is said: (1) The art of
                    printing was found first of all in Germany at Mainz about the year 1440; (2)
                    from that time till 1450 the art and what belonged to it were investigated; (3)
                    and in 1450, when it was a golden year (jubilee), they began to print, and the
                    first book that they printed was the Bible in Latin, in a large letter,
                    resembling that with which at present missals are printed. (4) Although the art
                    was found at Mainz in the manner in which it is generally employed now, yet the
                    first prefiguration was found in Holland from out the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Donatuses</hi> which were printed there before that time, and from and out of
                    them was taken the beginning of the aforesaid art, and it was found much more
                    masterly and exact (<hi rend="italic">subtilis</hi>) than that other manner was,
                    and has become more and more artistic. (5) Omnibonus wrote in a preface to
                    Quintilian, and in some other books too, that a Walloon from France, named
                    Nicol. Jenson (see N), discovered this art; but that is untrue, for there are
                    those still alive who testify that books were printed at Venice before Nicol.
                    Jenson came there, and began to cut and make letters. (6) But the first inventor
                    of printing was a citizen of Mainz, named Junker Johan Gudenburch. (7) From
                    Mainz the art was introduced first of all into Cologne, then into Strasburg, and
                    afterwards into Venice. (8) The origin and progress of the art were told to the
                    writer verbally by Ulrich Zell of Hanau, still printer at Cologne <hi
                    rend="italic">(anno</hi> 1499), through whom the said art came to Cologne. (CC)
                    In 1501 Jacob Wimpheling (see Y), who stated in his <hi rend="italic">Oratio
                    Querulosa contra Invasores Sacerdotum, Flaminum,</hi> &amp;c., published at
                    Delft <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1495, that chalcography had been invented at
                    Mainz, published a work <hi rend="italic">(Germania,</hi> Strasburg, Job.
                    Priiss, 1501) in which he says (on p. 43) that the invention was made at
                    Strasburg by Johann Gutenberg of Strasburg, and that it was perfected at Mainz.
                    (DD) In 1503 Johann Schoeffer (the son of Peter Schoeffer and the grandson of
                    Johann Fust) published an edition of Hermes Trismegistus, in which he represents
                    himself as one of the most distinguished citizens of Mainz, descended from the
                    most fortunate race who invented the art of printing. (EE) In 1504 Ivo Wittig,
                    who was a relative of Gutenberg, and a canon and the keeper of the seal of the
                    St Victor cathedral near Mainz (of which Gutenberg had been a lay member),
                    erected in the house “Zum Gutenberg” a memorial stone and an epitaph to Joh.
                    Gutenberg of Mainz, “qui primus omnium litteras aere imprimendas invenit.” (FF)
                    In 1505, in the German translation of Livy published by Johann Schoeffer (see
                    KK), the dedication to the emperor Maximilian, which was probably written by Ivo
                    Wittig (see EE), speaks of Johann Güttenbergk as inventor of printing (1450) and
                    Johann Faust and Peter Schoeffer as improvers of the art. This work was
                    reprinted six times (1514, 1523, 1533, 1551, 1553) with the same dedication; but
                    in 1509 the <hi rend="italic">Breviarium Moguntinum</hi> says that it was
                    printed at the expense and trouble of Johann</p>
                <p>Schoeffer, whose grandfather <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> Johann Fust) was the
                    first inventor and author of the art of printing (see DD). (GG) In 1505 Jacob
                    Wimpheling, in <hi rend="italic">his Epithoma Gemnanorum</hi> (Strasburg, 1505),
                    asserts (on leaf xxxviii b. and xxxixa.) that in 1440 Johann Gutenberg of
                    Strasburg invented there the art of printing. And in 1507, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Catal. Episcoporum Argent.</hi> (Strasburg, 1507), he says that
                    the art was invented, though in an imperfect manner, by a certain Strasburger,
                    who afterwards went to Mainz and joined others working and trying the same art,
                    where it was, Under the guidance of Johann Gensfleisch, perfected in the house
                    “boni montis” (Gutenberg). This he repeated in 1515. (HH) About 1506 Johannes
                    Trithemius wrote his <hi rend="italic">Chronicon</hi> of Spanheim, published at
                    Frankfort in 1601, in which he says (p. 366) that the art of printing books was
                    discovered afresh at Mainz by Johan Gutenberg, who, after having spent all his
                    property in accomplishing the new invention, perfected it by the advice and
                    assistance of Johann Fust. The first propagator of the new art was, after the
                    inventor, Peter Schoeffer. (II) In 1515 Johann Schoeffer published Job.
                    Trithemius’s <hi rend="italic">Compendium sive Breviarium Historiae
                    Francorum,</hi> and said in the colophon that the book was published at Mainz,
                    the first inventress of the art of printing, by Johann Schoeffer, grandson of
                    the late Johann Fust, the first author of the said art, who finally from his own
                    genius commenced to excogitate and to investigate the art in 1450, and in 1452
                    perfected it and commenced printing, assisted by many necessary inventions of
                    Peter Schoeffer von Gernsheim, his servant and adopted son. Johann Fust and
                    Peter Schoeffer kept this art secret, binding all their servants and domestics
                    by oath never to reveal it; but in 1462 it was spread by the same domestics into
                    divers countries. (KK) On 9th December 1518 the emperor Maximilian accorded to
                    Johann Schoeffer the privilege of printing Livy (1518-1519), and says in it that
                    “he has learned and been advised on the faith of worthy testimonies that the
                    ingenious invention of chalcography was effected by the printer’s grandfather.”
                    (LL) In 1519 Joh. Thurmayer Aventinus (1474-1534) wrote that “in 1450 Joannes
                    Faustus, a German, a citizen of Mainz, invented a new kind of writing, called
                    chalcography, and completed it in two years; it was kept secret by him and Peter
                    Schoeffer, his son-in-law, but divulged in Germany ten years afterwards by
                    Faust’s servant, Johannes Guttenberger, a Strasburger.” (MM) In a pedigree of
                    Lourens Janszoon Coster of Haarlem and his descendants, drawn up not later than
                    1520, it is asserted that in 1446 “he brought the first print into the world.”
                    This document, of which the date 1446 seems to have been altered into 1440, is
                    preserved in the Haarlem town library. (NN) In 1520 Johan Schott, a printer at
                    Strasburg and grandson of Johan Mentelin, the first printer of that town,
                    published an edition of Ptolemy, at the end of which he printed the arms of his
                    grandfather with the following legend: “Insigne Schottorum Familiae ab Friderico
                    Rom. Imp. III. Joan. Mentelio primo Typographiae Inventori ac suis concessum:
                    Anno Christi 1466.” Apart from the assertion that Mentelin was the inventor of
                    printing, we may remark that the emperor Frederick III. raised Mentelin to the
                    rank of a nobleman in 1466 and granted him new arms. (OO) About 1533 the
                    Neapolitan Mariangelo Accorso, who had resided at the court of Charles V., wrote
                    on an edition of <hi rend="italic">Donatus</hi> (in the possession of Aldus
                    Manutius, jun.) that “Joh. Faust of Mainz first discovered the art of printing
                    with metal types, which afterwards he made of lead; his son Peter Schoeffer
                    added afterwards much to polish the said art. This <hi rend="italic"
                    >Donatus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Confessionalia</hi> were printed first of
                    all in 1450. Faust derived the suggestion from a <hi rend="italic">Donatus</hi>
                    printed before in Holland from an engraved block.” This paragraph is found on p.
                    411 of the <hi rend="italic">Biblioth. Apost. Vaticana</hi> of Angelo Roccha
                    (Rome, 1591). Some consider its latter part to have been derived from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cologne Chronicle (ΒΒ),</hi> and it seems probable that it was a
                    mixture of some of the above testimonies. (PP) In 1536 Johan Schott (see NN)
                    published <hi rend="italic">Historien Handt-Buchlein</hi> (Strasburg, 1536), in
                    which (on leaf b <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> and b <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>) he says that “Hans Mentlin of Strasburg invented the art, which, through
                    infidelity, was brought to Mainz.” On the strength of this and other statements
                    (CC, GG, NN) the bicentenary of the Strasburg invention was celebrated there in
                    1640. (QQ) In 1541 Joh. Arnold (Bergel or) Bergellanus, who had settled as
                    press-reader at Mainz two years previously, published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encomium Chalcographies</hi> (Mainz, Fr. Behem, 1541, 4to), in which the
                    lawsuit between Fust and Gutenberg (A) is alluded to for the first time. Bergel
                    had read Tritheim’s books (HH), in which the invention is ascribed to Johann
                    Gutenberg with two coadjutors, Johann Faust and Peter Schoeffer, which he
                    (Bergel) had heard confirmed in conversations with Mainz citizens; he had also
                    seen some old tools prepared for the work by the originators which were still in
                    existence. Gutenberg invented it in 1450. (RR) About 1561 Jan Van Zuren (boni at
                    Haarlem in 1517) and Dirk Volkerts Coornhert (born at Amsterdam in 1522)
                    established a printing office at Haarlem. Of the former it is alleged that he
                    had compiled a work on the invention of printing, which is presumed to have been
                    lost during the siege of Haarlem in 1573. It was not publicly spoken of till
                    1628, when Peter Scriverius published his <hi rend="italic">Laurecranz voor
                    Laurens Coster.</hi> Scriverius had only found the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n714/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0714-0689"/> title, preface, and introduction, in which Van
                    Zuren contended that the first foundations of the art were laid at Haarlem, and
                    that it afterwards accompanied a foreigner to Mainz. In this introduction he
                    does not mention the name of the inventor, nor a date, but points in indefinite
                    terms to the house of the inventor as still existing. (SS) In the same year
                    (1561) Van Zuren and Coornhert published an edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Officia Ciceronis,</hi> in which the latter, in a dedication to the magistracy
                    of Haarlem, refers to the rumour that the art of printing books was invented
                    first of all at Haarlem, and was brought to Mainz by an unfaithful servant and
                    much improved there. He adds that very old and dignified persons had often told
                    him, not only the family of the inventor, but also his name and surname, and had
                    explained the first crude way of printing, and pointed out to him the house of
                    the first printer. (TT) In 1566 Luigi Guicciardini, a Florentine nobleman who
                    had visited the Netherlands and had resided many years at Antwerp, finished a
                    description of the Netherlands (published in 1567), in which, alluding to
                    Haarlem, he speaks of the invention there according to the assertions of the
                    inhabitants, the evidence of some authors, and other remembrances; the inventor
                    died before the perfection of his art; his servant went to Mainz, where he
                    perfected the art, and hence the report that it was invented there. (VV) About
                    1568 (it is calculated) Hadrianus Junius wrote his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Batavia,</hi> published at Leyden in 1588, with two prefaces, dated, the one
                    from Leyden, 6th January 1575, the other from Delft <hi rend="italic">ad annum
                    salutis</hi> 1575. On p. 253 he says that the opinion that the forms of the
                    letters whereby books are printed were first discovered at Mainz is very
                    inveterate, but old and eminent inhabitants of Haarlem had assured him that they
                    had heard from their ancestors that there lived at Haarlem, more than 128 years
                    before, in a decent house then existing, near the marketplace, opposite the
                    royal palace, Lourens (son of) Jan, surnamed Coster, who, while walking in the
                    wood near Haarlem, began to shape beechen bark first into figures of letters, by
                    which, reversely impressed one by one on paper, he composed one or two lines to
                    serve as an example for the children of his son-in-law. When this succeeded, he
                    began to contemplate greater things, and first of all invented, assisted by his
                    son-in-law Thomas (son of) Peter, a more gluey and substantial kind of ink (as
                    the ordinary ink was found to blot), with which he printed whole tablets with
                    pictures, with the letters added. Junius had seen books of this kind printed by
                    Coster (the beginnings of his labours) on the rectos of the leaves only, not on
                    both sides; the book was written (in Dutch) by an anonymous author, and entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Speculum Nostrae Salutis,</hi> in which care was taken that
                    the blank versos could be pasted together, so that the blank pages should not
                    present any unsightliness. Afterwards (Coster) changed the beechen characters
                    into leaden, and the latter again into tin ones. Very ancient wine-pots cast of
                    the remains of these types were still to be seen in the house of Lourens, which
                    was afterwards inhabited by his great-grandson Gerard (son of) Thomas, who had
                    died an old man a few years before. When the new merchandise attracted
                    purchasers everywhere, workmen were added to (Lourens’s) household, among whom
                    was a certain John (whether, as was suspected, Faust, or another of the same
                    name, Junius did not inquire), who was bound to the work of printing by oath.
                    But, when he thought he knew the art of joining the letters and of casting the
                    types, &amp;c., he stole away, when everybody had gone to church, the whole
                    apparatus of the types and the tools prepared by his master, and hastened to
                    Amsterdam, thence to Cologne, until he arrived at Mainz, where he could remain
                    in safety, and, having opened a work-office, issued within the space of one
                    year, about 1442, the <hi rend="italic">Doctrinale</hi> of Alexander Gallus and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tracts</hi> of Petrus Hispanus, printed with the same
                    types which Lourens had used at Haarlem. Junius recollects that Nicolaus Gale,
                    his tutor, a man of firm memory and venerable old age, had told him that as a
                    boy he had often heard a certain bookbinder Cornells (a man of more than eighty
                    years of age, who had been an under-workman in the same office) narrating the
                    story of the invention (as he had heard it from his master), the polishing and
                    increase of the crude art, &amp;c., and cursing those nights which he had
                    passed, during some months, with the culprit in one bed. The burgomaster
                    Quirinus Talesius admitted to Junius that he had formerly heard nearly the same
                    from the mouth of the same bookbinder. (XX) In 1628 Scriverius in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Laurecranz</hi> (see RR) placed the date of the Haarlem invention
                    as far back as 1428, and mentioned as its inventor Lourens Janszoon, sheriff of
                    Haarlem. He asserts that the art of printing appeared, “not in the manner as it
                    is used now, with letters cast of lead and tin, but a book was cut leaf for leaf
                    on wooden blocks,” and the Haarlem inventor was robbed in 1440 by Johan
                    Gutenberg. Scriverius based the date 1428 upon a Hebrew <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle</hi> compiled by Joseph ben Meir (born 1496, d. c. 1575), and
                    published in 1554 at Sabionetta by Cornelius Adelkind, where, under the year of
                    the Jewish era 5188 ( = 1428), the author mentions a book (without giving the
                    title) printed at Venice and seen by him. Scriverius, being convinced that this
                    could only refer to a book printed at Haarlem, applied the entry to a
                    xylographic <hi rend="italic">Biblia Pauperum,</hi> of which he gave a
                    description, together with several other block-books and early printed
                    books.</p>
                <p>(YY) In 1639 Boxhorn pushed the date of the Haarlem invention back to 1420,
                    referring, as his authority, to the same <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> of
                    Rabbi Joseph. Since that time the date of the Haarlem invention has been
                    variously placed between 1420 and 1430.</p>

                    Antonio Cambruzzi, who asserted that Pamfilo Castaldi invented printing at
                    Feltre, in Italy, in 1456, and that Fausto Comes-burgo, who lived in his house
                    in order to learn the Italian language, learned the art from him and brought it
                    to Mainz; this story, however, has found so much credence that in 1868 a statue
                    was erected at Feltre in honour of Castaldi. Nor need we speak of Kuttenberg in
                    Bohemia, where John Gutenberg is asserted to have been born and to have found
                    the art of printing. We may also pass over Johann Fust, later on called Faust
                    (testimonies P, T, DD, FF, II, KK, LL, OO), as we know from the Mainz lawsuit of
                    1455 (A) that he had simply assisted Gutenberg with loans of money. We may also
                    pass over Johann Mentelin of Strasburg (testimonies NN, PP), only remarking here
                    that he had already printed a Bible in 1460, and that he is mentioned in
                    Strasburg registers as a chrysographer or gold-writer from 1447 to 1450; but of
                    his whereabouts between 1450 and 1460 there is no record. That he had gone, or
                    had been called, after 1450 by Gutenberg to Mainz has been asserted but not
                    proved, and there is no reason why he should not be one of the two Johannes
                    alluded to as the <hi rend="italic">prothocaragmatici</hi> of Mainz in the
                    Justinian of 1468 (testimony I.). That Nicolas Jenson came to be regarded in
                    certain circles and for a time as the inventor of printing is owing to testimony
                    N being misunderstood. There remain, therefore, to be considered the testimonies
                    which bear on the rival claims of Haarlem and Mainz. The controversy between
                    Germany and Holland was publicly started as early as 1499 by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cologne Chronicle</hi> (testimony BB), that between the two towns
                    mentioned not publicly before 1561 (testimony RR); while no rival inventor to
                    Gutenberg was mentioned publicly and in print earlier than 1588 (testimony
                    VV).</p>
                <p>Let us first consider the claims of Germany and Mainz as centred in the person of
                    Henne ( = Hans or Johann) Gensfleisch, called Gutenberg or Gudenberg, the latter
                    name derived from his mother, whose maiden name was Elsa Wyrich, who lived in
                    the “Hof zum Gutenberg” at Mainz. He is supposed to have been born at that town
                    about 1400. He is first mentioned in a Mainz document, dated 16th January 1430.
                    In a document of 28th March 1430 he is spoken of as being “not in Mainz.”
                    Documents from 14th March 1434 to 18th September 1444 prove him to have been at
                    Strasburg during that time, and documents dated respectively 17th October 1448,
                    6th November 1455, 21st June 1457, 10th April 1461, show that he was in or near
                    Mainz on those days. By a decree of 17th January 1465 the archbishop of that
                    town rewarded him for “his services,” and in the bond of Dr Homery, dated 26th
                    February 1468, he is spoken of as dead. There are, moreover, six forged
                    documents (including some relics of an ancient press bearing the date 1441)
                    respectively dated 24th March 1424, 1437, 3d July 1453, 20th July 1459, 19th
                    June 1463, and an entry in an anniversarium which has been applied to Gutenberg,
                    but does not concern him (see Hessels, <hi rend="italic">Gutenberg).</hi></p>
                <p>In former years, when printing was believed to have been invented in 1440, the
                    records of the Strasburg lawsuit of 1439, between Gutenberg and some Strasburg
                    artisans about certain industrial undertakings (as the art of polishing stones,
                    the manufacture of looking-glasses), were considered to prove the invention of
                    printing at Strasburg, not, however, by Mentelin, as had been thought by some
                    (testimonies NN, PP), but by Gutenberg. The records came to light about 1740,
                    just when Schoepflin, the principal discoverer, had been commissioned to search
                    for documents of this kind. Doubts may be suggested as to their genuineness, but
                    they have all perished, partly during the revolution of 1793 and partly during
                    the siege of Strasburg in 1870. However, nobody would now assert that printing
                    was invented in 1439 or at Strasburg; and those who still believe that Gutenberg
                    was the inventor of printing refer to them only as showing that he was a
                    mechanic as early as 1439, and that he understood the art of pressing.<note

                <p>The first document that connects Gutenberg with the art of printing is the
                    notarial instrument of 6th November 1455 (testimony A). But it says nothing of
                    an invention or a new mode of printing. And yet the occasion was such as to make
                    it almost imperative on Gutenberg to mention it, for he had spent 1600 guilders
                    of Fust’s money, apparently without printing anything,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In line 42 Gutenberg distinctly declares that
                    “he hoped that he was under no obligation to Fust to devote the first 800
                    guilders to the work of the books and, as Fust, by advancing the second 800
                    guilders in 1452, had become Gutenberg’s partner, it seems clear that the former
                    claimed in 1454, when the trial is calculated to have commenced, his money and
                    interest because Gutenberg had as yet not printed anything.</p></note> and was
                    on the point of being robbed by the latter and having taken away from him all
                    that he had made and done to give effect to his idea or invention. In the next
                    testimony (B), <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the earliest Mainz books with
                    printed dates (1457 to 1467), there is evidence that the new art of printing is
                    not only not kept secret but fully appreciated at Mainz, and its importance
                    fully realized and advertised; but, though they speak of a “nova ars imprimendi”
                    and an “adinventio imprimendi,” there is not a syllable as to a Mainz invention
                    or inventor. In testimonies C and D (the <hi rend="italic">Catholicon</hi> of
                    1460) there is again not one word about an invention or an inventor, or about
                    Mainz. Yet Gutenberg is supposed to have printed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catholicon;</hi> and it is incredible that he, who had been wronged and robbed
                    by his two rivals (Fust and Schoeffer), should agree with them in explaining and
                    proclaiming the new art, but never with one word assert his claim to the honour
                    and profit of the invention, if he had made any, and should even omit his name,
                    whereas he saw his two rivals never neglect to print their names in full on
                    every book which they published. Those who believe that Gutenberg was the
                    inventor of printing suggest that he kept silent, as otherwise his creditors
                    would have seized his copies and his printing office. But this explanation
                    cannot be accepted; for the verbose colophon at the end of a gigantic folio book
                    like the <hi rend="italic">Catholicon,</hi> published at a time when there were
                    perhaps not more than three printing offices in the world, was calculated to
                    draw attention to its printer and his residence, not to conceal him. Testimony F
                    (1466) is no longer regarded as having any reference to Gutenberg or the
                    invention of printing. H (1468) was formerly thought to mean: “I, the book, am
                    cast <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> its types are cast) in the Mainz city, and
                    the house whence the type came (=where the type was invented) produced me.” But
                    of late years it has been shown that the author of the book, Johann Fons, was
                    Peter Schoeffer’s press-corrector. And, as he no doubt resided in Schoeffer’s
                    house, the two lines evidently mean: “I am a little book cast in Mainz, and I
                    was born ( = written) in the same house whence the type comes<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Venit is the present not the
                    perfect tense.</p></note> ( = where I am printed).” Testimony I (also of 1468)
                    speaks of two Johannes (Gutenberg and Fust) as the “prothocaragmatici librorum
                    quos genuit urbs Moguntina.” But this certainly means, not that the first
                    printers of books were born at Mainz, but that the two Johannes were the chief
                    printers of books (born) produced at Mainz.</p>
                <p>When we now place together the clear documentary testimonies (A to I) of the
                    first fourteen years of printing (1454 to 1468) at Mainz, we see that they all
                    come from Mainz itself. Everybody connected with the art speaks of it in the
                    most public and unreserved manner; its importance is as fully realized and
                    advertised during that period as it is in the present day; the German nation is
                    even congratulated on possessing it; there is never any secrecy about it; once
                    (about 1456) it is even called a new art. But, in the midst of all this
                    publicity, the art which Mainz and Germany possess is never said to have been
                    invented at Mainz. The supposed Mainz inventor (Gutenberg) even speaks himself
                    on two occasions (in the lawsuit of 1455 and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catholicon</hi> of 1460), but never says that he had made an invention. The
                    archbishop, too, speaks publicly of Gutenberg in 1465 (testimony E), and rewards
                    him for services, but does not speak of him as the inventor of printing, nor
                    even as a printer. Nor does Dr Homery, in his letter to the archbishop
                    (testimony G), in which he refers to Gutenberg’s printing apparatus, call him
                    the inventor of printing.</p>
                <p>In 1468 we enter on a new phase in the history of the invention. Even if we
                    reject testimony I as being merely local, testimony K (1468) speaks of the art
                    of printing as having arisen in Germany. This testimony, however, does not come
                    from Germany, nor from Mainz, but from Italy, and is supposed to owe its
                    inspiration to the two German printers who had established a printing office at
                    Subiaco in 1465, and in 1467 at Rome, and who most likely learned their craft at
                    Mainz. But, as the two printers are mentioned in the testimony, and as it does
                    not speak of Gutenberg, nor of Mainz, it is far more likely that it was merely
                    derived from the colophons of Fust and Schoeffer, or from something that
                    Cardinal Cusa had heard during his embassies in Germany. To the Mainz colophons
                    we must also ascribe (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the two testimonies of 1470 (L)
                    and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the three of 1471 (M), all five of which come
                    from France and Italy. At last, in 1472, we find in testimony O the invention of
                    printing ascribed to Gutenberg of Mainz, but it is mentioned as a rumour, and
                    comes from France. Guil. Fichet of Paris, who gives it, is supposed to have
                    heard the rumour from the three German printers who commenced printing at Paris
                    in 1470. But, as two of them had resided, immediately before they came to Paris,
                    in the university of Basel, and are supposed to have learned their art there,
                    the rumour is ascribed to “Bertolff von Hanauwe,” who appears in the lawsuit of
                    1455 as Gutenberg’s servant, and who was printing at Basel in 1468. Perhaps it
                    came rather from information which Fichet obtained from the St Victor cathedral,
                    near Mainz, as he speaks of the art having been invented not far from that town.
                    Testimony P (1474) again comes from Italy, from Rome, and was perhaps derived
                    from one of the German printers settled there at that time. It merely speaks of
                    Gutenberg, Fust, and Mentelin as printers, but says not a word which even
                    touches upon the invention of the art. In testimony Q (1476) we have definite
                    mention of Mainz as the inventress of the art; it is given as an addition to the
                    Mainz colophon of 1468 (see I). In 1478 Mainz is again mentioned in a Cologne
                    testimony (R), which gives evidence of research, as it is an amplification of an
                    earlier one in which Mainz was not mentioned. Germany, Gutenberg, and Mainz are
                    again mentioned in the Venetian testimony S (1483), which gives for the first
                    time 1440 as the date of the invention. In the same year we have two earlier
                    testimonies (P and N) worked into one (T), to the effect that printing was
                    invented either by Gutenberg or by Fust or by Jenson. Testimony V (1492), which
                    states that printing commenced at Mainz, is practically equivalent to Q. In 1494
                    and 1499 we have three German testimonies (X, Y, Z) as to Gutenberg being the
                    inventor of printing; these, however, come, not from Mainz, but from Heidelberg.
                    Z is given by a relative of Gutenberg, Adam Gelthus; and, as the latter resided
                    at Heidelberg, it is clear that he was the real source of the other two
                    Heidelberg testimonies (X and Y). Two years later, when Wimpheling, the author
                    of testimony Y, had left Heidelberg, he ascribed (CC) the invention of printing
                    to Strasburg, though stating that Gutenberg was the inventor. Testimony AA is
                    recorded above to show the great confusion that reigned in people’s minds about
                    the invention. We must add to these testimonies those of 1504 (EE) and 1505
                    (FF), which are owing to Ivo Wittig, a relative of Gutenberg, and a canon and
                    the keeper of the seals of the Str Victor cathedral, near Mainz, of which
                    Gutenberg had been a lay member according to its <hi rend="italic">liber
                    fraternitatis.</hi> Thus in the period from 1468 to 1505 we have (1) several
                    vague statements made in Italy and France as to the art of printing being known
                    or practised or invented in Germany, statements which arose from the books and
                    colophons published at Mainz; (2) one item of rumour in 1472 that Gutenberg
                    invented it near that town; (3) two Mainz statements, of 1476 and 1492, and one
                    Cologne statement, of 1478, that it was invented at Mainz; (4) three German
                    statements, of 1492, 1494, and 1499, that Gutenberg had invented it; and (5) two
                    Mainz statements, of 1504 and 1505, to the same effect. It is to be particularly
                    noticed that the statements (2, 4, 5) which speak distinctly of Gutenberg being
                    the inventor can be clearly traced to Gutenberg himself and two of his
                    relatives.</p>
                <p>Seeing then how slender the basis is for the tradition that printing was invented
                    by Gutenberg at Mainz, and that even this slender basis was not laid till
                    fourteen years after the art had been fully established and proclaimed in that
                    city, we cannot be surprised to find the tradition promptly contradicted. This
                    contradiction was made in 1499 (testimony BB) in a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle</hi> published at Cologne. To facilitate the understanding of this
                    testimony it is divided above into eight sections. The first (taken from
                    Hartmann Schedel's <hi rend="italic">Chronicle,</hi> 1493), second, sixth,
                    seventh, and eighth are no doubt due to the compiler of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle,</hi> and must not be connected with the third, fourth, and fifth,
                    which, according to the compiler, are due to Ulrich Zell, a printer at Cologne,
                    who had probably settled there about 1463, and had most likely learned his art
                    at Mainz, as he called himself “clericus Moguntinus.” As Zell’s testimony leaves
                    to Gutenberg nothing but the honour of having perfected the art, various
                    attempts have been made to explain away this account. As long as no
                    typographically printed <hi rend="italic">Donatus</hi> had been found that could
                    be fitted into Zell’s account, it was argued that he meant <hi rend="italic"
                    >Donatuses</hi> printed from wooden blocks; and this argument is brought forward
                    even at the present time. But a practical printer like Zell must have been able
                    to express himself to that effect if he had really meant to say so; and, as
                    block-printing was not less practised in Germany than in Holland, we could
                    hardly assume that things printed in Holland would have inspired the German
                    inventor rather than the same things printed in Germany. That testimony OO
                    speaks of a <hi rend="italic">Donatus</hi> printed from wooden blocks may be
                    ascribed to the notion arising at that time (c. 1533) that block-printing had
                    given rise to typography. It has also been asserted that Holland in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> means Flanders; but the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle</hi> is usually very correct in geographical matters. It has also
                    been suggested that Zell most likely learned his art in Fust and Schoeffer’s
                    office and invented the passage to injure the reputation of Gutenberg, who had
                    been their enemy. Finally it has been said that Zell did not suggest or write
                    the passage at all; but it is hard to see how this can be maintained in face of
                    the compiler’s own statement to that effect. Therefore, all these suggestions<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n716/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0716-0691"/> failing to weaken Zell’s testimony, we must see
                    how far it can be brought into harmony with other circumstances and the
                    testimonies MM, RR, SS, TT, VV, XX, YY, which claim the honour of the invention
                    for Haarlem in Holland. Testimonies RR and SS do not mention the name of the
                    inventor. But the former is a mere introduction destined for a complete book
                    that was lost during the siege of Haarlem in 1573 before it was printed; we are,
                    therefore, not entitled to say that Van Zuren did not know the name. SS may have
                    omitted the name, because the publication of Van Zuren’s work was in
                    contemplation at the time that it was written. That Guicciardini (testimony TT)
                    in 1566 did not mention the name of the reputed Haarlem inventor cannot be
                    considered as an indication that it was not known or had not yet been “invented”
                    when he wrote, as his accounts of the cities of the northern Netherlands are all
                    very meagre and were for the most part derived from correspondence. In Junius’s
                    account (VV), however, we find every particular that could be desired. He begins
                    by referring to the difficulty of vindicating the honour of the invention for
                    Haarlem on account of the deep-rooted and general opinion that it took place at
                    Mainz. He then mentions that Lourens (son of Jan) surnamed Coster resided at
                    Haarlem “more than 128 years ago” and gives us to understand that in the year
                    indicated by that phrase he invented the art of printing. As Junius’s book was
                    not published till after his death, in 1588, and the two prefaces in it are
                    dated 1575 (he died 16th June 1575), the number 128 is supposed to go back from
                    the date when he actually wrote his account, which he is calculated to have done
                    about 1568. Thus we get the year 1440 as the supposed date of the Haarlem
                    invention, though, if we based our calculation upon the date of the preface, the
                    year 1446 or 1447 would have to be assumed. But, as Junius adds that Coster’s
                    types were stolen by one of his servants, who fled with them to Mainz, and
                    establishing there a printing office printed within a year’s time, in 1442, two
                    books, he must, if this latter date is correct, have meant 1440. By testimonies
                    XX and YY we see that in the 17th century the date of the Haarlem invention was
                    first put back as far as 1428, then to 1423; and since then it has usually been
                    regarded as 1423, especially after it was discovered that the Haarlem wood where
                    Coster is said to have cut his wooden letters was destroyed during a siege in
                    1426.</p>
                <p>The researches as regards the reputed Haarlem inventor have hitherto not been
                    made in a manner adequate for scientific purposes. It would appear that by the
                    pushing back of the date of the invention, in spite of Junius, to 1420-1428, two
                    inhabitants of Haarlem have been mixed up by the Dutch authors on the subject.
                    (1) Lourens Janszoon, who never bore the surname Coster, and whose existence
                    seems to be authenticated by documents from 1404 to 1439, was sheriff, and a
                    wine merchant and innkeeper, and is supposed to have died in 1439. About 1870,
                    however, researches brought to light that there had been (2) a Lourens Janszoon
                    Coster at Haarlem, duly authenticated by genuine official documents as a
                    chandler and innkeeper, from 1436 to 1483, who went away from Haarlem in the
                    latter year. The name of this man and some genealogical particulars known of him
                    fit into the story of Junius, though there are certain particulars in Junius’s
                    account which cannot yet be properly explained.</p>
                <p>Junius bases his account of the Haarlem invention on three books, a Dutch edition
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Speculum Humanae Salvationis,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Doctrinale,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Tracts</hi> of Petrus
                    Hispanus (Pope John XXI.). The first work, he said, was printed by Coster
                    himself as a first specimen of his art, and it would seem from his words that he
                    considered the work to be printed with wooden types. The two Dutch editions of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Speculum,</hi> however, were printed, like the two Latin
                    editions of the same work, with movable metal type, though in one of the Latin
                    editions there are twenty leaves the text of which is printed apparently from
                    wooden blocks. The <hi rend="italic">Doctrinale</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tracts</hi> of Hispanus were printed, Junius says, at Mainz by Coster’s workman
                    with the types which he had stolen from Coster. Of the Hispanus <hi
                    rend="italic">Tracts</hi> no edition has yet come to light that would answer to
                    Junius’s description. But of the <hi rend="italic">Doctrinale</hi> we have four
                    editions, all printed in the same type (i. ) as the four editions of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Speculum.</hi> With these same types are printed no less than six
                    editions of the short Latin grammar of Aelius Donatus; and editions of this
                    school-book printed in Holland were, according to Zell in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cologne Chronicle,</hi> the models for the printing at Mainz, which commenced
                    about 1450. As there are no other editions of Donatus printed in Holland that
                    could be placed before the year 1450, the claims of Haarlem and Holland are
                    based on them; and we will, therefore, briefly describe the types and books
                    which must be connected with the <hi rend="italic">Specula, Doctrinalia,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Donatuses</hi> just mentioned. In one of the editions of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi> in Dutch occur two leaves printed in a
                    different type (ii. ) from the rest of the work. This type is in its turn so
                    very much like another type with which a work of Laur. Valla <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Facetiae Morales)</hi> is printed that we link it (iii. ) on to the two just
                    mentioned. Then again type iii. is, in some of its capitals, identical with a
                    type (iv. ) used for a work of Ludovicus de Roma, <hi rend="italic">Singularia
                    Juris,</hi> at the end of which, on the last leaf, commences another work,
                    printed in a different type (v. ). Type vi. is identical with type v., except in
                    its capital P, which is larger. We have also works printed in two different
                    types (vii., viii.) which both show such a great family likeness to each other
                    and to types i. to vi. that it would not be advisable to separate them without
                    evidence that they do not belong to the same office. With these eight types,
                    which we cannot at present separate, fortyseven different books were printed, so
                    far as we know at present. In type i.:—four editions (two in Latin,<note

                <p>Type v. must have been in existence before 13th September 1474, as there is
                    evidence that a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Saliceto,</hi> printed in that
                    type, was bought for the monastery of St James at Lille by its abbot Conrad du
                    Moulin, who filled that office from the end of 1471 to 13th September 1474. As a
                    work in this type (the <hi rend="italic">Tracts and Epitaphs</hi> of Pius II.)
                    is printed at the end of the <hi rend="italic">Singularia Juris</hi> in type
                    iv., we may assume that this type existed a considerable time before type v. As
                    the books printed in types iv. and v. show greater progress in style and
                    workmanship than the books printed in types i. to iii., we must assign the
                    latter to an earlier period than the former. There is indeed positive evidence
                    that type i. must have existed a considerable time before the end of 1473, as
                    fragments of a <hi rend="italic">Donatus</hi> printed in that type were used by
                    a bookbinder at Haarlem to strengthen the binding of an account-book of the
                    cathedral church in that town for the year 1474. From these facts alone we may
                    safely assume that none of the forty-seven books can be dated after 1474, or, if
                    any, only a few in types v. and vii. On the other hand, four of the works in
                    type v. cannot be dated before 1458, as they bear the name of Pius II., who was
                    not elected pope till that year. When we consider that there are twenty
                    different editions of the <hi rend="italic">Donatus</hi> printed in these types,
                    and place an interval of about eighteen months between the successive editions,
                    we get a period of some thirty years from about 1445 to 1474 for the issue of
                    the twenty editions. That we reach the year 1445 by such a calculation is purely
                    accidental; but there is evidence that in 1446 and 1451 printed<note

                    were bought at Bruges and Valenciennes by Jean Le Robert, the abbot of Cambray,
                    according to two entries in his diary, preserved in the archives at Lille. And,
                    as we know positively that there was no printing done at Mainz before 1454, nor
                    anywhere else so early, we can only apply these entries to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Doctrinalia</hi> printed in Holland in the same types as the four editions of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi> (on which Junius based the tradition of the
                    Haarlem invention), and six editions of the Donatus, which we may fit into
                    Zell’s account. That the editions of the <hi rend="italic">Speculum,</hi> of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Donatus,</hi> and of the <hi rend="italic">Doctrinale</hi> in
                    type i. may be dated as early as 1445-1454 is clear when we compare them with
                    the earliest products of Mainz printing, for which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Donatuses,</hi> according to the <hi rend="italic">Cologne Chronicle,</hi>
                    served as models. For instance, no difference in workmanship can be detected
                    between the <hi rend="italic">Donatuses</hi> printed in Holland and the three
                    editions of <hi rend="italic">Donatus</hi> in the 36-line Bible type and the
                    four editions of the same in the 42-line Bible type, all seven presumably
                    printed at Mainz and before 1456. Nor is the workmanship of the <hi

                    Morales</hi> (in type iii. ) different from or later than that of the Mainz <hi

                <p>It has been pointed out above that the first products of the art of printing were
                    not meant to be anything but faithful imitations of manuscript books, and that
                    no material deviations from the general plan become observable till about
                    1473-1477. Nowhere is the plan of the MS. period more strictly adhered to than
                    in the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n717/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0717-0692"/> forty-seven books of which we are speaking. They
                    are all without signatures, without initial directors, without hyphens, without
                    catchwords, that is to say, without any of those characteristics which we see
                    gradually, one after the other, come into almost general use from 1473 (if not
                    earlier) to 1480. The four editions of the <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi> are
                    all entirely printed anopisthographically, the woodcuts at the top of the pages
                    as well as the explanatory text (in type i.) underneath, which would hardly be
                    the case if the books had been printed after 1471, when the printing of
                    woodcuts, together with text in movable types, had already been known for eleven
                    years. Their types have nothing in common with any of those used in the
                    Netherlands after 1473, but remind us in every respect of the earlier period of
                    the Dutch block-books and MSS. They are all, so far as we know, without any
                    colophon (except such a word as <hi rend="italic">explicit),</hi> which would,
                    for a collection of forty-seven books, be incompatible with a period after 1471,
                    but not with the earlier period of the block-books and MSS. Moreover, out of the
                    forty-seven books no less than thirty-five are printed on vellum, which is
                    incompatible with a period after 1471, when printing on paper had become
                    universal, but not with the earlier period of the MSS.</p>
                <p>There is, therefore, no reason whatever to discredit Zell’s statement in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cologne Chronicle</hi> of 1499, that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Donatuses</hi> printed in Holland were the models, the “beginning” of the art
                    of printing, at Mainz, nor that of Hadrianus Junius in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Batavia,</hi> that printing was invented at Haarlem by Lourens Janszoon Coster.
                    The two statements were made independently of each other. That of Zell must be
                    regarded as a direct contradiction of the vague rumours and statements about an
                    invention of printing at Mainz in Germany by Gutenberg, which gradually crept
                    into print in and after 1468 in Italy and France, and which found their way into
                    Germany about 1476, after Mainz and Germany had given the greatest publicity to
                    the existence of the art in their midst for more than twenty-two years, but had
                    been silent about an invention and an inventor. And, though Zell accords to
                    Mainz the honour of having improved the art and having made it more artistic, he
                    denies it the honour of having invented or begun it, and this latter honour was
                    never claimed by that town before 1476. Junius’s account is the embodiment of a
                    local tradition at Haarlem, the first written traces of which we have in a
                    pedigree (testimony MM) of the family of the reputed Haarlem inventor, which
                    must have existed at least as early as 1520. His account has been indirectly
                    confirmed by the finding of several fragments at Haarlem, all belonging to the
                    groups of books mentioned above, but still more by the discovery of several
                    fragments of the <hi rend="italic">Donatuses</hi> printed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Speculum</hi> type, all used as binder’s waste by Cornelis, the
                    bookbinder, the very man whom Junius alleges to have been the servant of Coster.
                    As the case stands at present, therefore, we have no choice but to say that the
                    invention of printing with movable metal types took place at Haarlem about the
                    year 1445 by Lourens Janszoon Coster.</p>

                <p>We must now take notice of two theories or traditions which have been current for
                    a long time as to some intervening stage between the art of block-printing and
                    the art of printing with movable cast types.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>We do not allude to Tritheim’s assertion that the <hi

                    story, which he declares he had heard from Peter Schoeffer, if it were true,
                    would belong to the history of blockprinting. Nor need we speak of Bergellanus's
                    verses (1541), in which he distinctly alludes to carved blocks.</p></note> One
                    theory or tradition would have it that the inventor of printing, after the idea
                    of single, individual, movable types had arisen in his mind, practised his new
                    invention for some considerable time with wooden types, and that he came only
                    gradually to the idea of movable types cast of metal.</p>
                <p>Junius gives us to understand that in his opinion the Dutch <hi rend="italic"
                    >Speculum</hi> was printed with such wooden types. Of Johann Gutenberg it was
                    asserted that he printed his first Bible with wooden types. The Mainz psalter,
                    printed in 1457 by Joh. Fust and Peter Schoeffer, was alleged to have been
                    printed with wooden types, in which case the 4th edition, published in 1502, and
                    even the 5th edition of 1516, would be printed with wooden types, the same being
                    used for them as for the editions of 1457 and 1459. Theod. Bibliander was the
                    first to speak (in 1548) of such types and to describe them: first they cut
                    their letters, he says, on wood-blocks the size of an entire page; but, because
                    the labour and cost of that way was so great, they devised movable wooden types,
                    perforated and joined one to the other by a thread.<note anchored="true"

                    Bibliander does not say that he had ever seen such types himself, but Dan.
                    Speckle or Specklin (died 1589), who ascribed the invention to Mentelin, asserts
                    that he saw some of these wooden types at Strasburg.<note anchored="true"

                    1710 Paulus Pater asserted that he had seen wooden types made of the trunk of a
                    box-tree, and perforated in the centre to enable them to be joined together by a
                    thread, originating from the office of Fust at Mainz.<note anchored="true"

                    a worm-eaten condition at Mainz; and Fischer stated in 1802 that these relics
                    were used as a sort of token of honour to be bestowed on worthy apprentices on
                    the occasion of their finishing their term.</p>
                <p>Besides those who believed in these wooden types from the fact that the letters
                    (especially in the <hi rend="italic">Speculum)</hi> vary among themselves in a
                    manner which would not be the case had they been cast from a matrix in a mould,
                    there were authors and practical printers who attempted to cut themselves or to
                    have cut for them some such wooden types as were alleged to have been used by
                    the early printers. Some of them came to the conclusion that such a process
                    would be quite practicable; others found by experiment that it would, in the
                    case of small types, be wholly impossible. Up to the present time no book or
                    document has come to light which can be asserted to have been printed with such
                    single, movable, wooden types. But nearly all the experiments to which we have
                    alluded were made with the idea that the inventor of printing, or the earliest
                    printers, started, or had to start, with as large a supply of type as a modern
                    printer. This idea is erroneous, as it is hardly any longer denied that, for a
                    good many years after the first appearance of the art, printers printed their
                    books (large or small) not by quires (quaternions or quinternions) but page by
                    page.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See, for instance,
                    W. Blades, <hi rend="italic">Life of Caxton,</hi> i. 39.</p></note> Therefore,
                    all considerations of the experimenters as to the impracticability of such
                    wooden types, on account of the trouble and length of time required for the
                    cutting of thousands of types, fall to the ground in face of the fact that the
                    earliest printers required only a very small quantity of type, in spite of the
                    peculiar forms (combined letters, letters with contractions, &amp;c.) which were
                    then in vogue.</p>
                <p>The other theory would have it that between blockprinting and printing with
                    movable cast types there was an intermediate stage of printing with
                    “sculpto-fusi” types, that is, types of which the shanks had been cast in a
                    quadrilateral mould, and the “faces,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the
                    characters or letters, engraved by hand afterwards. This theory was suggested by
                    some who could not believe in wooden types and yet wished to account for the
                    marked irregularities in the types of the earliest printed books.</p>
                <p>Gerardus Meerman, the chief champion of this theory, based it, not only on the
                    words of Celtes <hi rend="italic">(Amores,</hi> iii. 3), who in 1502 described
                    Mainz as the city “quae prima sculpsit solidos aere characteres,” but on the
                    frequent recurrence of the word <hi rend="italic">sculptus</hi> in the colophons
                    of the early printers (for Jenson and Husner of Strasburg, see p. 681 above).
                    Sensenschmid in 1475 said that the <hi rend="italic">Codex Justinianus</hi> was
                    “cut” <hi rend="italic">(insculptus),</hi> and that he had “cut" <hi
                    rend="italic">(sculpsit)</hi> the work of Lombardus, <hi rend="italic">In
                    Psalterium.</hi> Meerman also explained the account of the invention of printing
                    by Trithemius<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Annales Hirsaugienses,</hi> ii. 421: “Post haec inventis

                    stanneos characteres fundebant, ad omnem pressuram sufficientes, quos prius
                    manibus sculpebant.”</p></note> as meaning that, after the rejection of the
                    first wooden types, the inventors discovered a method of casting the bodies only
                    of all the letters of the Latin alphabet from what they called matrices, on
                    which they cut the face of each letter; and from the same kind of matrices a
                    method was in time discovered of casting the complete letters of sufficient
                    hardness for the pressure they had to bear, which letters they were before—that
                    is, when the bodies only were cast—obliged to cut.<note anchored="true"

                    Τypographicae,</hi> The Hague, 1765, Append., p. 47.</p></note> In this way
                    Meerman explained that the <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi> was printed in
                    sculpto-fusi types, although in the one page of which he gives a facsimile there
                    are nearly 1700 separate types, of which 250 alone are e’s. Schoepflin claimed
                    the same invention for Strasburg, and believed that all the earliest books
                    printed there were produced by this means. Both Meerman and Schoepflin agreed
                    that engraved metal types <hi rend="italic">(literae in aere sculptae)</hi> were
                    in use for many years after the invention of the punch and matrix, mentioning
                    among others so printed the Mainz psalter, the <hi rend="italic">Catholicon</hi>
                    of 1460, the Eggestein <hi rend="italic">Bible</hi> of 1468, and even the <hi
                    rend="italic">Praeceptorium</hi> of Nider, printed at Strasburg in 1476. But the
                    great difficulty connected with the process of first casting the shanks and
                    afterwards engraving the faces of the types has become apparent to those who
                    have made experiments; and it seems more probable that the terms <hi
                    rend="italic">sculpere, exsculpere, insculpere</hi> are only a figurative
                    allusion to the first process towards producing the types, namely, the cutting
                    of the punch, which is artistically more important to the fabrication of types
                    than the mechanical casting,—all the more as Schoeffer in 1468 makes his <hi
                    rend="italic">Grammatica Vetus Rhythmica</hi> say, “I am cast at <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n718/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0718-0693"/> Mainz,” an expression which could hardly be
                    anything but a figurative allusion to the casting of the types.</p>
                <p>Granting that all the earlier works of typography preserved to us are impressions
                    of cast-metal types, there are still differences of opinion, especially among
                    practical printers, as to the probable methods employed to cast them. It is
                    considered unlikely that the inventor of printing passed all at once to the
                    perfect typography of the punch, the matrix, and the mould. Bernard<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Origine de
                    l'Imprimerie,</hi> i. 40.</p></note> considered that the types of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Speculum</hi> were cast in sand, as that art was certainly known
                    to the silversmiths and trinket-makers of the 15th century; and he accounts for
                    the varieties observable in the shapes of various letters on the ground that
                    several models would probably be made of each letter, and that the types, when
                    cast by this imperfect mode, would require some touching up or finishing by
                    hand. He exhibits a specimen of a word cast for him by this process which not
                    only proves the possibility of casting types in this manner but also shows the
                    same kind of irregularities as those observable in the types of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Speculum.</hi></p>
                <p>But here again it is argued that in types cast by this or any other primitive
                    method there would be an absence of uniformity in what founders term “height to
                    paper.” Some types would stand higher than others, and the low ones, unless
                    raised, would miss the ink and not appear in the impression. The comparative
                    rarity of faults of this kind in the <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi> leads one
                    to suppose that, if a process of sand-casting had been adopted, the difficulty
                    of uneven heights had been surmounted either by locking up the forme face
                    downwards, or by perforating the types either at the time of casting or
                    afterwards, and holding them in their places by means of a thread or wire. To
                    this cause Ottley attributed the numerous misprints in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Speculum,</hi> to correct which would have involved the unthreading of every
                    line in which an error occurred. And, as a still more striking proof that the
                    lines were put into the forme one by one, in a piece, he shows a curious
                    printer’s blunder at the end of one page, where the whole of the last
                    reference-line is put in upside down, thus :—</p>

                <p>*pjldE3 il 0103U3®</p>
                <p>A “turn” of this magnitude could hardly have occurred if the letters had been set
                    in the forme type by type.</p>
                <p>Another suggested mode is that of casting in clay moulds, by a method very
                    similar to that used in the sand process, and resulting in similar peculiarities
                    and variations in the types.</p>
                <p>Ottley, who was the chief exponent of this theory, suggested that the types were
                    made by pouring melted lead or other soft metal into moulds of earth or plaster,
                    after the ordinary manner used from time immemorial in casting statues of bronze
                    and other articles of metal. But the mould thus formed could hardly avail for a
                    second casting, as it would be scarcely possible to extract the type after
                    casting without breaking the clay, and, even if that could be done, the
                    shrinking of the metal in cooling would be apt to warp the mould beyond the
                    possibility of further use. Ottley therefore suggests that the constant renewal
                    of the moulds could be effected by using old types cast out of them, after being
                    touched up by the graver, as models,—a process which he thinks will account for
                    the varieties observable in the different letters, but which would really cause
                    such a gradual deterioration and attenuation in the type, as the work of casting
                    progressed, that in the end it would leave the face of the letter unrecognizable
                    as that with which it began. It would therefore be more reasonable to suppose
                    that one set of models would be used for the preparation of all the moulds
                    necessary for the casting of a sufficient number of types to compose a page, and
                    for the periodical renewal of the moulds all through the work, and that the
                    variations in the types would be due, not to the gradual paring of the faces of
                    the models, but to the different skill and exactness with which the successive
                    moulds would be taken. It is evident that the sand and clay methods of casting
                    types above described must be slow. The time occupied after the first engraving
                    of the models in forming, drying, and clearing the moulds, in casting,
                    extracting, touching up, and possibly perforating the types required for one
                    page, would exceed the time required by a practised xylographer for the cutting
                    of a page of text upon a block. But he that has gone through the trouble of
                    casting separate movable types has a clear gain over the woodblock printer in
                    having a fount of movable types, which, even if the metal in which they were
                    cast were only soft lead or pewter, might be used again and again in the
                    production of any other page of text, while the wood-block can only produce the
                    one page which it contains. Moreover, only one hand could labour on the
                    xylographic block; but many hands could be employed in the moulding and casting
                    of types, however rude they might be. Bernard states that the artist who
                    produced for him the few sand-cast types shown in his work assured him that a
                    workman could easily produce a thousand such letters a day. He also states that,
                    though each letter required squaring after casting, there was no need to touch
                    up the faces.</p>
                <p>There remains yet another suggestion as to the method in which the types of the
                    rude school may have been produced. This may be described as a system of what
                    the founders of sixty years ago called polytype, which is a cast or facsimile
                    copy of an engraved block, matter in type, &amp;c.</p>

                    translation of Trithemius’s narrative, explains that this process really means
                    an early adoption of stereotype. He thinks that the first printers may have
                    discovered a way of moulding a page of some work—an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abecedarium—</hi> in cooling metal, so as to get a matrixplate impression of
                    the whole page. Upon this matrix they would pour a liquid metal, and by the aid
                    of a roller or cylinder press the fused matter evenly, so as to make it
                    penetrate into all the hollows and corners of the letters. This tablet of tin or
                    lead, being easily lifted and detached from the matrix, would then appear as a
                    surface of metal in which the letters of the alphabet stood out reversed and in
                    relief. These letters could easily be detached and rendered mobile by a knife or
                    other sharp instrument, and the operation could be repeated a hundred times a
                    day. The metal faces so produced would be fixed on wooden shanks, type high, and
                    the fount would then be complete. Lambinet's hypothesis was endorsed by
                    Firmin-Didot, the renowned type-founder and printer of Lambinet’s day. But it is
                    impossible to suppose that the Mainz psalter of 1457, which these writers point
                    to as a specimen of this mode of execution, is the impression, not of type at
                    all, but of a collection of “casts” mounted on wood.</p>
                <p>Whatever value there may be in the above theories with regard to the movable
                    types of the first printer, certain it is that the shape and manufacture of the
                    types used as early as <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1470 do not seem to have
                    differed materially from those of the present types.</p>
                <p>This is evident (1) from the shape of the old types which were discovered in 1878
                    in the bed of the river Saône, near Lyons, opposite the site of one of the
                    15th-century printing houses of that city, and which there is reason to believe
                    belonged once to one of those presses, and were used by the early printers of
                    Lyons; (2) from a page in Joh. Nider’s <hi rend="italic">Lepra Moralis,</hi>
                    printed by Conrad Homburch at Cologne in 1476, which shows the accidental
                    impression of a type, pulled up from its place in the course of printing by the
                    ink-ball, and laid at length upon the face of the forme, thus leaving its exact
                    profile indented upon the page; (3) from an entirely similar page (fol. 4 <hi

                    Gloriosae Virginis,</hi> Cologne, c. 1468. From the small circle appearing in
                    the two last-mentioned types, it is presumed that the letters were pierced
                    laterally by a circular hole, which did not penetrate the whole thickness of the
                    letter, and served, like the nick of modern types, to enable the compositor to
                    tell by touch which way to set the letter in his stick. The fact that in these
                    two cases the letter was pulled up from the forme seems to show that the line
                    could not have been threaded.</p>

                    Ripoli press, about 1480, by which it appears that steel, brass, copper, tin,
                    lead, and iron wire were all used in the manufacture of types at that
                    period.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On the above

                <p>The history and nomenclature of the earliest types are practically a continuation
                    of the history and nomenclature of the characters figured in the earliest
                    block-books, woodengravings, and MSS. For instance, Gothic type was first seen
                    about the year 1445; but it should not be forgotten that the Gothic writing, of
                    which that type was an imitation, was already known and used about the second
                    half of the 12th century. Again, the pure Roman type, which appeared about 1464,
                    is nothing but an imitation of what in palaeography is called the Caroline
                    minuscule, a handwriting which was already fully developed towards the end of
                    the 8th century. Consequently, details as to the history and development of the
                    various types properly belong to the study of <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>The broad outlines of the history of the earliest types are as follows :—</p>
                <p>Gothic type, of the angular or pointed kind, was first used by the Haarlem
                    printer of the <hi rend="italic">Speculum, Bonatus,</hi> &amp;c. (see specimen
                    No. 1, taken from the British Museum copy of the <hi rend="italic">Speculum
                    Humanae Salvationis,</hi> mixed Latin edition), presumably <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi>. 1445. An entirely similar but larger type (No. 2, taken from the
                    British Museum copy of Ludovicus [Pontanus] de Roma, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Singularia)</hi> was used, presumably by the same printer, <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi>. 1465-1470. Gothic type appeared in Germany as a church type in 1454, in
                    the 31-line indulgence, presumably printed by Johan Gutenberg at Mainz (No. 3,
                    from the Gottingen copy), and in the 30-line indulgence (No. 4, taken from the
                    British Museum copy), printed by Peter Schoeffer at Mainz. Type No. 3 was also
                    used about the same time for the 36-line Bible and type No. 4 for the 42-line
                    Bible. Two much larger Gothic types appeared in the psalter of 1457, published
                    by Fust and Schoeffer (see Bernard, <hi rend="italic">Origine,</hi> pl. vii.).
                    In Italy Gothic type appears in 1468 (No. 5, taken from the British Museum copy
                    of Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Be Oratore</hi> published at Rome by Ulr. Hahn,
                    15th December</p>
                <p>1468, in small Roman type, with imprint in Gothic), but in a more rounded form;
                    it is practically the ordinary Italian writing influenced by the Gothic. In
                    France Gothic began to be used in 1473; in England it appears first in Caxton’s
                    type about the year 1480.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Blades, <hi rend="italic">Life of Caxton,</hi> pl. xvii.</p></note> It
                    was employed extensively in a great many of the earliest presses all over
                    Europe, and continued to be used largely at all times, especially for Bibles,
                    law books, royal proclamations, &amp;c., and even to this day it is the national
                    character of Germany. It is now usually called <hi rend="italic">lettre de
                    forme, black letter</hi> or <hi rend="italic">English</hi> in English-speaking
                    countries, <hi rend="italic">lettre Flamand</hi> in Holland, and <hi
                    rend="italic">fractur</hi> in Germany.</p>
                <p>Bastard Italian or bastard Roman was introduced in 1454 at Mainz in the 31-line
                    (No. 6) and 30-line (No. 7) indulgence. It is also called <hi rend="italic"
                    >lettre de somme,</hi> some think from the <hi rend="italic">Summa</hi> of
                    Thomas Aquinas, printed in the type of the Bible of 1462 by Fust and Schoeffer.
                    Varieties of this kind of type were, like the Gothic, much used by the earliest
                    printers, as, for instance, the printer of the 1460 <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catholicon, i.e.,</hi> by Mentelin of Strasburg, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>
                    1460, and by Ulrich Zell at Cologne, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 1466, &amp;c. In
                    England it appeared in the first three books printed (1478, 1479) at Oxford (No.
                    8, taken from the British Museum copy of Jerome’s <hi rend="italic">Expositio in

                <p>Roman type, the Caroline minuscule of palaeography, was first used in Germany
                    about 1464, at Strasburg, by the printer whose fount of type is known by a
                    peculiarly shaped R, and who on that account is usually called “the R printer”

                    Italy it appears in 1465 at Subiaco (see Bernard, pl. xii., No. 19), at Rome in
                    1467 <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> pl. xii., No. 20), but in all its purity

                    In England it was not used before 1518, when Richard Pynson printed Pace’s <hi

                    presumed to have printed, likewise at Bruges, a set of five books, of which the

                    entirely superseded by the English black letter. To this class of type belong

                <p>Though the <hi rend="italic">Cologne Chronicle</hi> of 1499 denies to Mainz the
                    honour of the invention of the art of printing, it was right in asserting that,
                    after it had been brought there from Holland, it became much more masterly and
                    exact, and more and more artistic. During the first half century of printing a
                    good many printers distinguished themselves by the beauty, excellence, and
                    literary value of their productions. We may mention as such :—Johan Fust and
                    Peter Schoeffer at Mainz; Johan Mentelin and Heinrich Eggestein at Strasburg;
                    Ulrich Zell at Cologne; Sweyn-heym and Pannarts at Subiaco and at Rome; Nicolas
                    Jenson at Venice; Anton Koberger at Nuremberg; Ketelaer and De Leempt at
                    Utrecht; Johan Veldener at Louvain, Utrecht, and Kuilenburg; Gerard Leeu at
                    Gouda; Johan of Westphalia at Louvain; and William <hi rend="smallcaps">Caxton
                    (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> at Westminster.</p>
                <p>Very soon the demand for books increased, and with it came a reduction in their
                    prices. This caused a decline in the execution of printing, which begins to be
                    appreciable about 1480 in some localities, and may be said to have become
                    general towards the end of the 15th century. At all times, however, we find some
                    printers raise their art to a great height by the beauty of their types and the
                    literary excellence of their productions. Among the later printers we may
                    mention the Aldi of Venice (1490 to 1597; see <pb break="no"

                    the handwriting of Petrarch, and was introduced by Aldus Manutius of Venice for
                    the purpose of printing his projected small editions of the classics. The
                    cutting of it was entrusted to Francesco da Bologna, an artist who is presumed
                    to be identical with the painter Francesco Francia or Raibolini. The fount is a
                    “lower case” only, the capitals being Roman in form. It contains a large number
                    of tied letters, to imitate handwriting, but is quite free from contractions and
                    ligatures. It was first used in the <hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi> of 1500. Aldus
                    produced six different sizes between 1501 and 1558. It was counterfeited almost
                    immediately in Italy, at Lyons, and elsewhere. Originally it was called Venetian
                    or Aldine, but subsequently Italic type, except in Germany and Holland, where it
                    is called “cursive.” The Italians also adopted the Latin name “characteres
                    cursivi seu cancellarii.” In England it was first used by Wynkyn de Worde in
                    Wakefield’s <hi rend="italic">Oratio</hi> in 1524. The character was at first
                    intended and used for the entire text of classical works. When it became more
                    general, it was employed to distinguish portions of a book not properly
                    belonging to the work, such as introductions, prefaces, indexes, notes, the text
                    itself being in Roman. Later it was used in the text for quotations, and finally
                    served the double part of emphasizing certain words in some works, and in
                    others, chiefly translations of the Bible, of marking words not rightly forming
                    a part of the text.</p>
                <p>Greek type (<hi rend="italic">minuscules)</hi> first occurs in Cicero, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Officiis</hi> printed at Mainz in 1465 by Fust and Schoeffer.
                    The fount used is rude and imperfect, many of the letter’s being ordinary Latin.
                    In the same year Sweynheym and Pannarts used a good Greek letter for some of the
                    quotations in their edition of <hi rend="italic">Laetantius</hi> (see, for
                    instance, leaves 11a, 19a, 36a, 139, 140); but the supply was evidently short at
                    first, as some of the larger quotations in the first part of the book were left
                    blank to be filled in by hand. The first book wholly printed in Greek minuscules
                    was the <hi rend="italic">Grammar</hi> of Lascaris, by Paravisinus, at Milan in
                    1476, in types stated to have been cut and cast by Demetrius of Crete. The fount
                    contains breathings, accents, and some ligatures. The headings to the chapters
                    are wholly in capitals. The <hi rend="italic">Anthologia Graeca</hi> of Lascaris
                    was printed at Florence in 1494 wholly in Greek capitals <hi rend="italic"
                    >(litterae majusculae),</hi> and it is stated in the preface that they were
                    designed after the genuine models of antiquity to be found in the inscriptions
                    on medals, marbles, &amp;c. But as late as 1493 Greek type was not common, for
                    in that year the Venice printer Symon Bevilaqua issued <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tibullus, Catullus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Propertius</hi> with blanks left
                    in the commentary for the Greek quotations. In England Greek letters appeared
                    for the first time in 1519 in W. de Worde’s edition of Whitenton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Grammatica,</hi> where a few words are introduced cut in wood.
                    Cast types were used at Cambridge in Galen’s <hi rend="italic">De
                    Temperamentis,</hi> translated by Linacre, and printed by Siberch in 1521, who
                    styles himself the first Greek printer in England; but the quotations in the
                    Galen are very sparse, and Siberch is not known to have printed any entire book
                    in Greek. The first printer who possessed Greek types in any quantity was
                    Reginald Wolfe, who held a royal patent as printer in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew,
                    and printed in 1543 two <hi rend="italic">Homilies</hi> of Chrysostom, edited by
                    Sir John Cheke, the first Greek lecturer at Cambridge. In Edinburgh, in 1563,
                    and as late as 1579, the space for Greek words was left blank in printing, to be
                    filled in by hand. In 1632 Cambridge applied to Oxford for the loan of a Greek
                    fount to print a Greek Testament, and the same university made an offer in 1700
                    for the purchase of a fount of the king’s Greek at Paris, but withdrew on the
                    French Academy insisting as a condition that every work printed should bear the
                    imprint “characteribus Graecis e typographeo regio Parisiensi.” It should not be
                    forgotten that the large number of ligatures in the Greek of that day made the
                    production of a fount a serious business. The Oxford Augustin Greek comprised no
                    fewer than 354 matrices, the great primer 456, and even one fount showed 776
                    different sorts. The Dutch founders effected a gradual reduction of the Greek
                    typographical ligatures. Early in the 19th century a new fashion of Greek, for
                    which Porson was sponsor and furnished the drawings, was introduced, and has
                    remained the prevailing form to this day.</p>
                <p>The first Hebrew types are generally supposed to have appeared in 1475 in Petras
                    Niger’s <hi rend="italic">Tractatus contra Perfidos Judaeos</hi> (leaf 10),
                    printed by Conrad Fyner at Esslingen. De Rossi states that a Hebrew work in four
                    folio volumes entitled <hi rend="italic">Arba Turim</hi> of Rabbi Jacob ben
                    Asher, was printed in 1475 at Pieve di Sacco in Austrian Italy, while in the
                    same year, a few months earlier, Salomon Jarchi’s <hi rend="italic">Comment. on
                    the Pentateuch</hi> appeared at Reggio in Italy, printed in the Rabbinical
                    character. Numerous other Hebrew works followed before 1488, in which year the
                    first entire Hebrew Bible was printed, with points, at Soncino, by a family of
                    German Jews. The first English book in which any quantity of Hebrew type was
                    used was Dr Rhys’s <hi rend="italic">Cambro-Brytannicae Cymraecaeve Linguae
                    Institutiones,</hi> printed by Thomas Orwin in 1592, though already in 1524
                    Greek characters, but cut in wood, were used by W. de Worde in Wakefield’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Oratio.</hi> But the Hebrew fount made use of in Walton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Polyglott</hi> in 1657 was probably the first important fount cut
                    and cast in England, though there were as yet no matrices there for Rabbinical
                    Hebrew. In the beginning of the 18th century Amsterdam was the centre of the
                    best Hebrew printing in Europe.</p>
                <p>The first book printed in Arabic types is said to be a <hi rend="italic">Diurnale
                    Graecorum Arabum,</hi> printed at Fano in Italy in 1514.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Panzer, vii. 2.</p></note> Two years
                    later P. P. Porras’s <hi rend="italic">Polyglott Psalter,</hi> comprising the
                    Arabic version, was printed at Genoa; and two years later a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Koran</hi> in Arabic is said to have been printed at Venice. In 1505 an <hi
                    rend="italic">Arabic Vocabulary</hi> at Granada had the words printed in Gothic
                    letters with the Arabic points placed over them; and in other presses where
                    there were no Arabic types the language was expressed in Hebrew letters or cut
                    in wood. De Guignes and others mention a fount of Arabic used by Gromors in
                    Paris in 1539-40 to print Postel’s <hi rend="italic">Grammar.</hi> In England
                    some Arabic words were introduced in Wakefield’s <hi rend="italic">Oratio</hi>
                    of 1524, but apparently cut in wood. In Minsheu’s <hi rend="italic">Ductor in
                    Linguas,</hi> 1617, the Arabic words are printed in Italic character’s. Laud’s
                    gift of Oriental MSS. to Oxford in 1635, and the appointment of an Arabic
                    lecturer, were the first real incentives to the cultivation of the language by
                    English scholars. Previous to this it is stated that the Raphelengius Arabic
                    press at Leyden had been purchased by the English Orientalist, William Bedwell;
                    but, if it was brought to England, it does not appear to have been immediately
                    made use of. The Arabic words in Thomas Greave’s <hi rend="italic">Oratio de
                    Linguae Arabicae Utilitate,</hi> printed at Oxford in 1639, were written in by
                    hand.</p>
                <p>Syriac type, probably cut in wood, first appeared in Postel’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Linguarum XII. Alphabeta,</hi> printed in Paris in 1538; but the characters are
                    so rude in form and execution as to be scarcely legible. In 1555, however,
                    Postel assisted in cutting the punches for the Syriac Peshito New Testament,
                    printed at Vienna in 4to, the first portion of the Scriptures, and apparently
                    the first book, printed in that language. In 1569-72 Plantin at Antwerp included
                    the Syriac New Testament in his <hi rend="italic">Polyglott,</hi> and reissued
                    it in a separate form in 1574. In England Syriac was usually expressed in the
                    earlier works in Hebrew characters. But in 1652, when the prospectus and
                    preliminary specimen of Walton’s <hi rend="italic">Polyglott</hi> were issued,
                    we find Syriac type in use.</p>
                <p>Of the Armenian character the press of the Vatican possessed a good fount in
                    1591, when Angelo Roccha showed a specimen in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                    Apostolica Vaticana.</hi> A psalter is said to have been printed at Rome in
                    1565, and Rowe Mores mentions doubtfully a liturgy printed at Cracow in 1549.
                    Armenian printing was practised in Paris in 1633; but the Armenian bishops, on
                    applying to France for assistance in printing an Armenian Bible in 1662, were
                    refused, and went to Rome, where, as early as 1636, the press of the Propaganda
                    had published a specimen of its Armenian matrices. The patriarch, after fifteen
                    months’ residence in Rome, removed to Amsterdam, where he established an
                    Armenian press, and printed the Bible in 1666, which was followed in 1668 by a
                    separate edition of the New Testament. In 1669 the press was set up at
                    Marseilles, where it continued for a time, and was ultimately removed to
                    Constantinople. In England the first Armenian type was that presented by Dr Fell
                    to Oxford in 1667. The alphabet given in the prolegomena of Walton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Polyglott</hi> was cut in wood.</p>
                <p>Of Ethiopic the earliest type appeared in Potken’s <hi rend="italic">Psalter and
                    Song of Solomon,</hi> printed at Rome in 1513. The work was reprinted at Cologne
                    in 1518 in Potken’s <hi rend="italic">Polyglott Psalter.</hi> In 1548 the New
                    Testament was printed at Rome by some Abyssinian priests. The press of the
                    Propaganda issued a specimen of its fount in 1631, and again in Kircher’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Prodromus Coptics</hi> in 1636. Erpenius at Leyden had an Ethiopic
                    fount, which in 1626 was acquired by the Elzevirs. Usher attempted to procure
                    the fount for England; but, his attempt failing, punches were cut and matrices
                    prepared by the London founders for the London <hi rend="italic">Polyglott,</hi>
                    which showed the Psalms, Canticles, and New Testament in the Ethiopic

                <p>Of Coptic the press of the Propaganda possessed a fount, and a specimen was

                    Coptus</hi> appeared from the same press. In England David Wilkins’s edition of
                    the New Testament was printed in 1716 from Coptic types cast with matrices which
                    Dr Fell had presented to Oxford in 1667. The alphabets shown in the introduction
                    and prolegomena to the London <hi rend="italic">Polyglott</hi> of 1655 and 1657
                    were cut in wood.</p>

                    rend="italic">Polyglott,</hi> completed in 1645, contained the entire Pentateuch
                    in type the punches and matrices of which had been specially prepared under Le
                    Jay’s direction. The fount used for the London <hi rend="italic">Polyglott</hi>
                    in 1657 is admitted to have been an English production, and was probably cut
                    under the supervision of Usher.</p>
                <p>With Slavonic type a psalter was printed at Cracow as early as 1491, and
                    reprinted in Montenegro in 1495. The only Slavonic fount in England was that
                    given by Dr Fell to Oxford, and this, Mores states, was replaced in 1695 by a
                    fount of the more modern Russian character, purchased probably at Amsterdam. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Oratio Dominica</hi> of 1700 gives a specimen of this fount,
                    but renders the Hieronymian version in copper-plate. Modern Slavonic, better
                    known as Russian, is said to have appeared first in portions of the Old
                    Testament printed at Prague in 1517-19. Ten years later there was Russian type
                    in Venice. A Russian press was established at Stockholm in 1625, and in 1696
                    there were matrices in Amsterdam, from which came the types used in Ludolph’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Grammatica Russica,</hi> printed at Oxford in that year, and
                    whence also, it is said, the types were procured which furnished the first St
                    Petersburg press, established in 1711 by Peter the Great Mores notes that in
                    1778 there was no Russian type in England, but that Cottrell was at that time
                    engaged in preparing a fount. It does not appear that this project was carried
                    out, and the earliest Russian in England was cut by Dr Fry from alphabets in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Vocabularia,</hi> collected and published for the empress of
                    Russia in 1786-89. This fount appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pantograρhia</hi> in 1799.</p>
                <p>A fount of the Etruscan character cut by William Caslon about 1733 for Swinton of
                    Oxford was apparently the first produced. Fournier in 1766 showed an alphabet
                    engraved in metal or wood. In 1771 the Propaganda published a specimen of their
                    fount, and Bodoni of Parma in 1806 exhibited a third in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oratio Dominica.</hi></p>
                <p>Runic types were first used at Stockholm in a Runic and Swedish <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alphabetarium</hi> printed in 1611. The fount, which was cast at the expense of
                    the king, was afterwards acquired by the university. About the same time Runic
                    type was used at Upsala and at Copenhagen. Voskens of Amsterdam had matrices
                    about the end of that century, and it was from Holland that Francis Junius is
                    supposed to have procured the matrices which in 1677 he presented to Oxford.
                    This fount appears in the <hi rend="italic">Oratio Dominica</hi> of 1700, and in
                    Hickes’s <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus,</hi> 1703-5, and it remained the only one
                    in England.</p>
                <p>Matrices of Gothic type were presented to Oxford by Francis Junius in 1677, and a
                    fount of them was used for the <hi rend="italic">Oratio Dominica</hi> of 1700
                    and in Hickes’s <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus.</hi> A different fount was used for
                    Chamberlayne’s <hi rend="italic">Oratio Dominica,</hi> printed at Amsterdam in
                    1715. Caslon cut a fount which appeared in his first specimen in 1734. This and
                    the Oxford fount were the only two in England in 1820.</p>
                <p>Founts of Icelandic, Swedish, and Danish were included in Junius’s gift to Oxford
                    in 1677, and were, perhaps, specially prepared in Holland. The first-named is
                    shown in the <hi rend="italic">Oratio Dominica</hi> of 1700 and in Hickes’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Thesaurus.</hi> Printing had been practised in Iceland since 1531,
                    when a <hi rend="italic">Breviary</hi> was printed at Hoolum, in types rudely
                    cut, it is alleged, in wood. In 1574, however, metal types were provided, and
                    several works produced. After a period of decline, printing was revived in 1773,
                    and in 1810 Sir George M'Kenzie reported that the Hoolum press possessed eight
                    founts of type, of which two were Roman, and the remainder of the common
                    Icelandic character, which, like the Danish and Swedish, bears a close
                    resemblance to the German.</p>
                <p>For the Anglo-Saxon language the first type was cut by John Day in 1567, under
                    the direction of Archbishop Parker, and appeared in Aelfric’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paschal Homily</hi> in that year and in the <hi rend="italic">Aelfredi Res
                    Gestae</hi> of Asser Menevensis in 1574. Anglo-Saxon type was used by Browne in
                    1617, in Minsheu’s <hi rend="italic">Ductor in Linguas</hi>; and Haviland, who
                    printed the second edition of that work in 1626, had in 1623 made use of the
                    character in Lisle’s edition of Aelfric’s <hi rend="italic">Homily.</hi></p>
                <p>The first fount of Irish character was that presented by Queen Elizabeth to
                    O’Kearney in 1571, and used to print the Catechism which appeared in that year
                    in Dublin, from the press of Franckton. But the fount is only partially Irish,
                    many of the letters being ordinary Roman or Italic. It was used in several works
                    during the early years of the 17th century, and as late as 1652 in Godfrey
                    Daniel’s <hi rend="italic">Christian Doctrine,</hi> printed in Dublin. The Irish
                    seminaries abroad were better supplied with Irish type. A new type was cut by
                    Moxon, and appeared in 1681 in Boyle’s New Testament, printed by Robert
                    Everingham.</p>
                <p>The earliest specimen of music type occurs in Higden’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polychronicon,</hi> printed by De Worde at Westminster in 1495. The square
                    notes appear to have been formed of ordinary quadrats, and the staff-lines of
                    metal rules imperfectly joined. In Caxton’s edition of the same work in 1482 the
                    space had been left to be filled up by hand. The plain chant in the Mainz
                    psalter of 1490, printed in two colours, was probably cut in wood. Hans
                    Froschauer of Augsburg printed music from wooden blocks in 1473, and the notes
                    in Burtius’s <hi rend="italic">Opusculum Musices,</hi> printed at Bologna in
                    1487, appear to have been produced in the same manner; while at Lyons the missal
                    printed by Matthias Hus in 1485 had the staff only printed, the notes being
                    intended to be filled in by hand. About 1500 a musical press was established at
                    Venice by Ottavio Petrucci, at which were produced a series of mass-books with
                    lozenge-shaped notes, each being cast complete with a staff-line. In 1513 he
                    removed to Fossombrone, and obtained a patent from Leo X. for his invention of
                    types for the sole printing of figurative song (<hi rend="italic">cantus
                    figuratus).</hi> Before 1550 several European presses followed Petrucci’s
                    example, and music type was used, among other places, at Augsburg in 1506 and
                    1511, Parma in 1526, Lyons in 1532, and Nuremberg in 1549. In 1525 Pierre Hautin
                    cut punches of lozenge-shaped music at Paris. Round notes were used at Avignon
                    in 1532. In England, after its first use, music-printing did not become general
                    till 1550, when Grafton printed Marbecke’s Book of Common Prayer, “noted” in
                    movable type, the four staff-lines being printed in red and the notes in black.
                    There are only four different sorts of notes used,—three square and one lozenge.
                    About 1660 the detached notes hitherto employed began to give place to the “new
                    tyed note,” by which the heads of sets of quavers could be joined. But at the
                    close of the 17th century music-printing from type became less common, on
                    account of the introduction of stamping and engraving plates for the
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>Printing for the blind (compare vol. iii. p. 826) was first introduced in 1784 by
                    Valentin Haiiy, the founder of the asylum for blind children in Paris. He made
                    use of a large script character, from which impressions were taken on a prepared
                    paper, the impressions being so deeply sunk as to leave their marks in strong
                    relief and legible to the touch. Haüy’s pupils not only read in this way, but
                    executed their own typography, and in 1786 printed an account of their
                    institution and labours as a specimen of their press. The first school for the
                    blind in England was opened in Liverpool in 1791, but printing in raised
                    characters was not successfully accomplished till 1827, when Gall of the
                    Edinburgh asylum printed the Gospel of St John from angular types. Alston, the
                    treasurer of the Glasgow asylum, introduced the ordinary Roman capitals in
                    relief, and this system was subsequently improved upon by the addition of the
                    lower-case letters by Dr Fry, the type-founder, whose specimen gained the prize
                    of the Edinburgh Society of Arts in 1837. Several rival systems have competed in
                    England for adoption, of which the most important are those of Lucas, Frere,
                    Moon, Braille, Carton, and Alston; the last-named, as perfected by Dr Fry, seems
                    likely to become the recognized method of printing for the blind in all European
                    countries.</p>
                <p>As regards initials in the earliest printed books, see above, p. 686. The trouble
                    and cost involved in the use of the initial director early suggested the use of
                    wood-cut initials, and Erhard Ratdolt of Venice, about 1475, is generally
                    supposed to have been the first printer to introduce the <hi rend="italic"
                    >literae florentes,</hi> called also <hi rend="italic">lettres tourneures,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">typi tomatissimi,</hi> which eventually superseded the
                    hand-painted initials. Caxton introduced one or two kinds in 1484. Among the
                    earliest to be used are the so-called Lombardic initials or capitals. The more
                    elaborate initials, such as those used in the Mainz indulgences and psalter, by
                    Aldus at Venice, by Johann Schoeffer at Mainz in 1518, by Tory and the Estiennes
                    at Paris, by Froben at Basel, and by the other great printers of their day, were
                    known as <hi rend="italic">lettres grises.</hi> Besides these, the ordinary
                    “two-line letters” or large plain capitals came into use; and these were
                    generally cast, whilst the ornamental letters were for the most part engraved on
                    wood or metal.</p>
                <p>Type ornaments and flowers began, like the initials, with the illuminators, and
                    were afterwards cut on wood or metal. The first printed ornament or vignette is
                    supposed to be the scutum or arms of Fust and Schoeffer in their edition of the
                    Bible of 1462. There is no vignette in the Subiaco <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lactantius</hi> of 1465 (as stated by Mr Reed, <hi rend="italic">Letter
                    Foundries,</hi> p. 82). In Holtrop’s <hi rend="italic">Monum. Typogr. des
                    Pays-Bas</hi> may be seen borders used by some of the earliest printers of
                    Holland (1475-1490) which would not look bad even in the present time. Caxton in
                    1490 used ornamental pieces to form the border for his <hi rend="italic">Fifteen
                    O’s.</hi> At the same time the Paris printers engraved still more elaborate
                    border pieces. At Venice entire frames were engraved in one piece, while Aldus
                    as early as 1495 used tasteful head-pieces cut in artistic harmony with his <hi
                    rend="italic">lettres grises.</hi> Early in the 16th century we observe detached
                    ornaments and flourishes which have evidently been cast from a matrix.</p>

                <p>Printing has been defined to be the act, art, or practice of impressing letters,
                    characters, or figures on paper, cloth, or other material, the definition being
                    based on the etymology (Old Fr. <hi rend="italic">empreindre,</hi> from Lat. <hi
                    rend="italic">imprimere).</hi> Technically the same definition might be applied
                    to such arts as those of calico and oilcloth printing, and even of moulding,
                    embossing, coining, and stamping; but in point of fact these are never
                    understood when the word “printing” is employed. There is also printing without
                    pressure, such as photographic printing. The use of a pigment or ink must be
                    regarded as an indispensable element. The application of the term is therefore
                    confined to the use of pressure and a pigment for literary and pictorial
                    purposes. As thus defined, printing includes three entirely different
                    processes—not inaptly called the polygraphic arts—viz., chalcography or
                    copperplate printing (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Engraving,</hi> vol. viii. p.
                    439 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Lithography</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.</hi>) or chemical stoneprinting, and typography or
                    letterpress printing. The last-named is that to which the present article is
                    confined.</p>
                <p>The difference between the three methods lies essentially in the nature or
                    conformation of the surface that is inked, and which afterwards gives a
                    reproduction or image in reverse on the material to be impressed. In copperplate
                    printing the whole of a flat surface is inked, and a portion of the ink sinks
                    into an incision or trench, in which it still remains after the surface is
                    cleansed. When pressure is brought to bear, this ink is transferred to the
                    paper, giving an impression of a line. In lithographic printing the flat surface
                    is protected except at certain places, where it is slightly coated with the ink,
                    which practically leaves the stone quite level, but also marks a line when
                    pressure is brought to bear. In typography the printing surface is in relief. It
                    alone receives ink, the remainder being protected by its lower level. Any kind
                    of printing done from a relief surface belongs to letterpress printing, such as
                    a woodcut, a casting in metal, india-rubber, celluloid, xylonite, &amp;c. (or
                    “stereotype”), or a deposition by electricity (or “electrotype”). The
                    typographic method requires a surface that is more difficult to form than either
                    of the other two. In lithography the surface may be obtained by merely writing
                    or drawing on the stone; in copperplate printing the line may be immediately
                    incised into or scratched on the plate; but for letterpress printing the surface
                    between the lines in relief has to be cut away. Hence the tediousness of
                    wood-engraving, in which all the surface of the block has to be removed except
                    those parts that are to be printed from and which form the black lines in the
                    impression; and the conformation of a type surface is similar.</p>
                <p>Typography, however, has many compensating advantages. Impressions are taken with
                    much greater facility. The inking appliance glides over the relief lines to be
                    printed from, whereas it would cling to the entire surface of the stone or the
                    metal; hence much greater pressure would be required in these cases. The
                    unprintable part of the stone in lithography has to be damped, so as to repel
                    the ink; the same portion has to be inked and then cleaned off in copperplate
                    printing; but in letterpress printing the ink only that has to be transferred to
                    the paper needs to be applied to the type. When the design has been drawn on the
                    stone or scratched into the copper, the result does not admit of any further
                    application beyond that at first contemplated. But in letterpress printing the
                    surface may be of a composite character. It may be formed of single pieces
                    representing the several letters, and these, when once formed, may be employed
                    in endless combinations. Only by such means are cheap newspapers and books
                    possible. Before the invention of typography (as in the East to the present
                    day), the different pages of a book were printed from wooden blocks, cut after
                    the manner of a wood-engraving. Blocks of this kind are of no use for printing
                    after their first purpose has been fulfilled. They must necessarily be made very
                    slowly and with much labour. In forming a page of a book, on the other hand, by
                    the typographic method there need (excluding necessary wear and tear) only be
                    the cost of “composing” the types and of “distributing” them into their proper
                    receptacles, from which they may be re-taken many times to form other
                    compositions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Types: their Material Characteristics.</hi></p>
                <p>Exclusive of such printing surfaces as wood-blocks and casts, the letters, marks,
                    and signs with which letterpress printing is executed are called <hi
                    rend="italic">types,</hi> a proportioned quantity of each of the letters of the
                    alphabet in any one body or face forming a <hi rend="italic">fount.</hi> A
                    bookwork fount contains single letters, diphthongs, ligatures (such as ff, fl),
                    accented letters, figures, fractions, points, reference marks, dashes or metal
                    rales (as―), leaders (as......), braces (<hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> — <hi
                    rend="superscript"> l</hi> —.), and signs (as &amp;, £). It also includes
                    quadrats,—pieces of metal of various widths, which do not print, but are used to
                    compensate for the shortness of occasional lines, as at the close of a
                    paragraph— and spaces, which separate words and letters. There are thus about
                    226 separate characters in every ordinary English book-work fount. The table
                    used by type-founders to regulate the number of each of the several sorts in a
                    fount is called a <hi rend="italic">bill of type.</hi> The sorts are supplied by
                    English type-founders in certain definite proportions, depending upon the number
                    of lower-case m’s. A bill of 3000 m’s usually contains the following :—</p>

                    language;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is a
                    tradition in one of the oldest English foundries that this scale originated in a
                    laborious calculation of the comparative number of different letters used in
                    setting up a lengthy debate in the House of Commons, it being supposed then that
                    the purest English was spoken there. The scale is, however, frequently found
                    defective in practice. It is a curious fact, for instance, that the matter of
                    Charles Dickens’s works will empty the vowel boxes long before those of the
                    consonants, and that Lord Macaulay’s statelier style will run with like
                    persistency on consonants.</p></note> other languages of course require
                    different proportions. In Latin and French, for instance, q and u would be
                    deficient, h in excess, and w needless. The number of the respective letters may
                    be, and sometimes is, apportioned by weight; for example, in one of the
                    “schemes” of founts <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n723/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0723-0698"/> used by type-founders a fount of 125 ft Roman
                    with, as its complement, 10 lb Italic, includes 8 oz. of E, M, C; 9 oz. of T; 8
                    ft of e; 5 ft each of a, h, n, o, t; and so on, down to 3 oz. of z. To estimate
                    the quantity of type required for a page, the number of square inches it
                    contains is measured and divided by 4, the quotient being the approximate weight
                    of the matter in pounds. In small founts, however, 50 per cent. is added, and in
                    large ones 30 to 40 per cent., to allow for the letters generally left in the
                    cases, not being required in the job, and for sorts, &amp;c. These figures,
                    although useful, are only approximative, the proportion of the several
                    ingredients of type-metal used by different founders for the various sizes of
                    type greatly varying the calculation.</p>
                <p>Each of the parts of a type has a technical name. In the annexed diagram (fig. 1)
                    of the capital letter M the darkest space <hi rend="italic">a, a, a, a,</hi> is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">face</hi>; and only that part of the type touches
                    the paper in printing. The face is divided into the <hi rend="italic">stem,</hi>
                    marked 1, which comprises the whole outline of the type M; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >serifs,</hi> or the horizontal lines marked 2, which complete the outline' of
                    the letter; the <hi rend="italic">beard,</hi> consisting of the bevel or sloping
                    part marked <hi rend="italic">b, b,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">shoulder</hi>
                    or flat portion below <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> The shank is the entire body of
                    the letter, <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the front part (that shown) being known as
                    the <hi rend="italic">belly</hi> and the corresponding part behind as the <hi
                    rend="italic">back.</hi> The spaces at <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> are the <hi rend="italic">counters,</hi> which regulate the
                    distances apart of the stems in a line of type. The hollow groove extending
                    across the shank at <hi rend="italic">e, e</hi> is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nick,</hi> which enables the workman to recognize the direction of the type and
                    to distinguish different founts of the same body. The absence of this simple
                    expedient would retard the operation of composing types by fully one-half. The
                    earliest type-founders did not know the use of the nick. In some letters, such
                    as j and f, a part of the face overhangs the shank; this is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">kern.</hi> The groove <hi rend="italic">g</hi> divides the bottom
                    of the type into two parts called the <hi rend="italic">feet.</hi> An impression
                    from that part of a type on which it stands would be as Types must be perfectly
                    rectangular, the minutest deviation rendering them useless. Any roughness at the
                    sides is called <hi rend="italic">burr,</hi> and any injury to their faces a <hi
                    rend="italic">batter.</hi> Smoothness, sharpness of angle, and perfection of
                    finish are also prime requirements. A line of types, when viewed along the back,
                    presents the appearance of a solid bar of metal.</p>
                <p>Types which have the face cast in the middle of the shank, as a, c, e, m,
                    &amp;c., and thus leave an open space above them corresponding to that below,
                    caused by the beard, are known as <hi rend="italic">short letters.</hi> Those
                    whose stem extends to the top of the shank, as b, d, f, &amp;c., are called <hi
                    rend="italic">ascending letters.</hi> Those that have a stem extending over the
                    shoulder, as g, p, &amp;c., are called <hi rend="italic">descending
                    letters.</hi> Those that are both ascending and descending, and extend over the
                    whole of the shank, as Q and j, are <hi rend="italic">long letters.</hi> Small
                    letters and figures cast upon the upper part of the shank, as l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> α</hi>, are called <hi rend="italic">superiors;</hi> those
                    very low down on the shank are <hi rend="italic">inferiors,</hi> as H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. Types that are very heavy and massive in appearance
                    are called <hi rend="italic">fat-faced;</hi> those that are fine and delicate,
                    <hi rend="italic">lean-faced.</hi> A type whose face is not in proportion to the
                    depth of the shank <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> a small pica cast on a pica
                    body) is a <hi rend="italic">bastard type.</hi></p>
                <p>Types are of various sizes, ranging from those used in printing pocket Bibles to
                    those for large placards. The variation is confined to the superficial
                    dimensions of their ends, or <hi rend="italic">bodies,</hi> as they are called.
                    Each body has a distinctive name. The following are specimens of the principal
                    bodies of ordinary types, and show the relation of the various bodies one to
                    another—</p>
                <p>It is a confusing and inconvenient anomaly that the types made by different
                    English founders vary in size, although they bear the same name. The above
                    figures refer to the types of Messrs Miller and Richard, the royal type-founders
                    for Scotland; but other eminent makers supply, for instance, long primer which
                    is 89½, 90, or 92 lines to the foot. This has been remedied in America by an
                    agreement on the part of the founders to adopt one standard pica, to divide that
                    pica into a certain number of equal parts, and to cast all their types as
                    multiples of one of these parts. They divide the pica into twelve points, and
                    the point is the unit upon which the system is based. There is also another
                    practical advantage in this multiple system: each type bears a simple proportion
                    to the others, and therefore can be used in exact combination. Thus pearl is 5,
                    nonpareil 6, minion 7, brevier 8, bourgeois 9, long primer 10, small pica 11,
                    and pica 12 points. In Germany, France, and other countries of the Continent a
                    uniform system of points has been adopted, based on a scale of 133 “Ciceros”
                    (corpus 12) to 60 centimetres. The types which most nearly correspond to those
                    already mentioned are :—</p>

                <p>The number of lines given to the foot in the above specimens of bodies is the
                    theoretic and practically the only approximative standard. The height of types
                    varies slightly with different founders, the mean being <hi rend="superscript">
                    29</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 32</hi> in. The old Scotch height is about <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi> in. higher. Types
                    lower than the ordinary dimension are said to be <hi rend="italic">low to
                    paper,</hi> and if surrounded by higher types will not give a perfect
                    impression. Spaces and quadrats were formerly only three-fourths of an inch in
                    height; but, since electrotyping has become so common, they are almost
                    invariably cut high, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> up to the shoulder of the
                    type. Six lines of pica and twelve lines of nonpareil each cover an inch in
                    depth. It is, however, not possible to know the size of a type in a printed page
                    by placing a rule measure upon it, as many books are not set solid: the lines
                    are not close together, but leaded out with pieces of lead, to make them cover a
                    larger space. A communication of great importance contributed to a newspaper may
                    be set up in the same type as the leading article; but if not leaded it will
                    appear to the non-technical reader to be in a smaller character.</p>
                <p>The width of pages or columns, in the technical language of the printing office,
                    is expressed according to the number of “ems,”—</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n724/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0724-0699"/>
                <p>that is, of a pica m,—the square of the depth of pica. As the latter is one-sixth
                    of an inch, the em is the same width,' and a page of twenty-four ems wide is
                    equal to one 4 inches wide. The columns of this <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopaedia</hi> are 19 ems wide.</p>
                <p>According to the purpose for which they are used, types are divided into two
                    classes—book type, including Roman and Italic, and job type, including a
                    multitude of fanciful forms of letters, chiefly founded on the shape of the
                    Roman and Italic letters, and intended to be more prominent, delicate, elegant,
                    &amp;c. It is impossible to enumerate all the varieties of the latter class, as
                    additions are being constantly made and once popular styles always going out of
                    fashion. The leading varieties are the antiques, which are Roman letters with
                    strokes of nearly uniform thickness, as M; sanserifs or grotesques, which have
                    no serifs, as M; blacks, as; and scripts, which represent the modern cursive or
                    Italian handwriting, as Black letter is now only a jobbing type in
                    English-speaking countries, although, as stated in the historical section of
                    this article, it was the first character used in printing. It is still used in
                    Germany, with certain modifications, as the principal textletter for books and
                    newspapers. A comparison of the numerous reproductions that have been issued of
                    Caxton’s works with any modern line of black letter will show how greatly the
                    form and style have been altered within a period of four centuries. The present
                    style of Roman type dates only from about the first quarter of the 18th century.
                    Previously the approved shape was as follows :—</p>
                <p>The use of this type was revived by Whittingham of the Chiswick Press about 1843,
                    and it has since become a favourite form, under the name of old style. Some of
                    the punches cut by the first notable English type-founder, William Caslon
                    (1692-1766), have been preserved and types are being constantly cast from them.
                    Nearly all founders now produce modernized old style. For the recent revival of
                    old style printing, see p. 710 below.</p>
                <p>Large letters, such as are employed for large bills and posters, are made of
                    wood, chiefly rock maple, sycamore, pine, and lime. These are cut up, planed to
                    the required size, and then engraved, generally by special machinery, this being
                    a business quite distinct from that of letter-founding. The larger letters are
                    designated as two line, three line, four line, &amp;c.,—meaning twice, thrice,
                    or four times the depth of face of pica or great primer, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Type metal is an alloy, of which lead is the principal ingredient; but, owing to
                    its softness, antimony and tin are added (see vol. ii. p. 129 and vol. xiv. p.
                    378). A patent type metal (Besley’s) was invented in 1855 in which the mixture
                    consisted of lead, regulus of antimony, tin, nickel, copper, and bismuth. Nearly
                    all type is now made with some of these metals superadded. Ductility, hardness,
                    and toughness are the prime requisites of a type metal.</p>
                <p>The earliest printers made their own types, and the books printed from them can
                    now be distinguished with almost as much certainty as handwriting can be
                    identified. The modern printer has recourse to the type-founder. The first step
                    in the making of type is cutting the letter on the end of a piece of fine steel,
                    forming the punch (see fig. 2), which is afterwards hardened. This is an
                    operation requiring great care and nicety (there being comparatively few adepts
                    at it), in order that the various sorts in a fount may be exactly uniform in
                    width, height, and general proportions to each other. A separate punch is
                    required for each character in every fount of type, and the making of them is
                    the most expensive branch of type-founding. During the process of its
                    manufacture the punch is frequently tested or measured by delicate gauges to
                    insure its accuracy. When finished it is held over a light, the flame of which
                    blackens the letter, and thus enables an impression, called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >smoke proof,</hi> to be stamped on paper. When the letter is perfect, it is
                    driven into a piece of polished copper, called the <hi rend="italic">drive</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">strike</hi> (fig. 3). This passes to the justifier, who
                    makes the width and depth of the faces uniform throughout the fount. They must
                    then be made to line exactly with each other. When completed, the strike becomes
                    the matrix (fig. 4), wherein the face of the type is made. This method of making
                    a matrix has until now been in almost universal use in Great Britain. It is,
                    however, a very slow and costly process. In America the great majority of
                    matrices are made otherwise. If the design of the fount to be produced is
                    original, it is often cut by hand or by an engraving-machine on the piece of
                    metal which is to form the matrix. If, on the other hand, an existing fount has
                    to be copied, the matrix is made by electro-deposition. A perfectly good type is
                    selected, and inserted in a mould specially made, called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >fusible mould</hi> (fig. 5). Sufficient metal of a more fusible nature than the
                    type is cast round it, and forms a shape similar to that of the ordinary matrix.
                    This fusible cast is then placed in a box protected by glass and guttapercha, in
                    order that the copper deposit may be kept square and to the proper dimensions.
                    This arrangement also limits the deposition to the face. The box is immersed in
                    the copper electrotyping solution, in which it may be left until the deposit of
                    metal has increased to a thickness at which it may be backed up with copper, or
                    it is left until it reaches the full thickness, which is about <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 5</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 16</hi> of an inch. It is
                    then fitted in line, set, position, and height. The minutest imperfection or
                    blemish is reproduced by the deposition, and the type cast from such a matrix is
                    a perfect counterpart of the original. A school of type-engravers has recently
                    sprung up in the United States, cutting exclusively on metal and producing
                    ornamentation and finish which the punch-cutters cannot rival. It is expected
                    that in the course of time the electrotype matrix will nearly supersede that
                    made in the old-fashioned way with the punch. In the ordinary method the mould
                    in which the body of the type is formed is made of hardened steel in two parts;
                    one part is fastened to the machine and is stationary, while the other is
                    movable so that it may be adjusted for the proper width of the letters, as one
                    is wider than another. The combined matrix and mould are then adjusted to the
                    type-casting machine, which manufactures types at the rate of from 25 to about
                    120 per minute, according to the body. The metal is kept fluid by a little
                    furnace underneath and is injected into the mould by a pump, the spout of which
                    is in front of the metal pot. The mould is movable, and at every revolution of
                    the wheel it comes up to the spout, receives a charge of metal, and flies back
                    with a fully formed type in its bosom; when the upper half of the mould is
                    lifted, a type is ejected. The spring in front holds the copper matrix in close
                    proximity to the mould. The letter a, for instance, stamped in the matrix is
                    directly opposite the aperture in the mould which meets the spout of the pump.
                    When a due proportion of a’s are cast, another matrix with b stamped on it takes
                    its place, and so on throughout the whole fount. The types, however, are not
                    finished when they leave the machine. There will be found attached to each a
                    wedge-shaped <hi rend="italic">jet</hi> (fig. 6), somewhat similar to that on a
                    bullet cast in a hand-mould. These are picked off by boys at the rate of from
                    2000 to 6000 per hour. A burr which still adheres to the shoulder of the type is
                    taken off by the rubbers, who rub the sides on circular stones or on files. The
                    types afterwards go to the setters, who arrange them in long lines ready for the
                    dresser, and he slips them into a long stick, turns them on their face, and,
                    after duly fastening them, cuts with a plane a groove in the bottom, which forms
                    the feet. (These processes are now frequently performed by a machine, which
                    produces types that do not require rubbing or dressing.) The types are then
                    dressed and the picker takes them in hand, in order to pick out each defective
                    letter with the aid of a magnifying glass. They are finally made up into parcels
                    of a convenient size, called <hi rend="italic">typefounders’ pages,</hi>
                    weighing about 8 lb each.</p>
                <p>Subjoined is a description of a machine for performing automatically the various
                    operations of casting and finishing type which was invented about twenty years
                    ago by Messrs J. R. Johnson and J. S. Atkinson. In this apparatus the metal is
                    fused, injected into the mould, the cast letter turned out, rubbed or planed,
                    first on one side and then on the other, the feet cut out and smoothed, the
                    dressed sides planed alternately, and the finished letter set up on a stick
                    ready for use by the printer. The casting machine and the dressing machine are
                    in reality distinct, though mounted on a common frame. The whole is driven by a
                    steam-engine or other prime mover. The casting machine consists of a furnace
                    covered by a shallow pot holding the fused metal. In this is a pump, and the
                    mould is placed opposite its nozzle. The mould being adjusted and the matrix in
                    its place, the molten metal is injected and then solidifies, forming a perfect
                    type, but with jet attached. This letter is then thrust out, and the mould
                    closes again for another jet of molten metal. All this is effected by one
                    revolution of the axle of the machine. The letters pass through a channel one by
                    one into the dressing machine. On arriving there they have each of their sides
                    planed in succession by being held against cutters. When one side is made true
                    with respect to the set of the letter on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n725/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0725-0700"/> its face, it is passed over a second cutter,
                    which planes the second side absolutely parallel to the first. After this the
                    type is carried in a line at right angles to its former course past a series of
                    similar cutters, which plane out the foot, further smooth its surface, and plane
                    each of the two dressed sides in succession; this completes the dressing or
                    finishing of the types, which, continuing on their course, pass upon a composing
                    stick and are ready for the printer. The line of types presents the appearance
                    of a solid bar of metal, so true, flat, and square are the surfaces of the
                    several separate letters. This machine has been considerably improved by Mr P.
                    Μ. Shanks. The new machine is of simpler construction and its parts are more
                    compact. It does not produce better type, nor work quicker,—the speed in all
                    type machines being regulated by the time required to cool the volume of metal,
                    which, when on the machine, is assisted by having water percolating through the
                    heated parts of the mould. The working of the new machine is more readily
                    grasped by the manipulator, and there is considerable reduction in its cost.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic strikethrough"> Type-Setting or Composing.</hi></p>
                <p>We may now describe the manipulation of the types in the printing office, and for
                    the sake of conciseness reference must be made only to the operations connected
                    with ordinary book-work. These differ in details from the methods in use in the
                    other two departments of the printing business,—news-work and job-work.</p>
                <p>The types, received from the foundry in the packages called pages, are placed in
                    shallow trays called <hi rend="italic">cases.</hi> These contain compartments or
                    <hi rend="italic">boxes,</hi> each of which is appropriated to some particular
                    <hi rend="italic">sort</hi> or character. The cases when in use stand on <hi
                    rend="italic">frames</hi> or sloping desks. The case at the top is the <hi
                    rend="italic">upper case,</hi> and <hi rend="underline">tha</hi> t below the <hi
                    rend="italic">lower case.</hi> The former contains ninetyeight equal-sized
                    boxes, appropriated principally to the capital and small capital letters; the
                    latter has fifty-three boxes of various sizes, appropriated to the lower-case
                    sorts. The difference in the size of the boxes corresponds to the difference of
                    quantity of letters in a fount, as already stated,—the lower-case e for instance
                    having the largest box. The localization of the letters, &amp;c., is a subject
                    on which opinions differ, the object being to bring the letters most frequently
                    required nearest to the hand of the compositor as he stands at work. As a man
                    picks out from the boxes seldom less than 1500 letters per hour and distributes
                    or replaces on the average about 5000 per hour, it is necessary that the most
                    economical allocation of the boxes should be adopted. The system of allocating
                    the various types is called the <hi rend="italic">lay</hi> of the case; fig. 7
                    illustrates the plan used in the principal English book offices; but there are
                    many deviations.</p>
                <p>The types when taken from the cases are arranged in lines or “composed” in an
                    instrument called a <hi rend="italic">composing stick,</hi> made of iron, brass,
                    or gun metal. The slide in the middle is movable so as to accommodate varying
                    lengths of lines. In the composing room the frames are arranged in rows,
                    supporting the cases. The compositor fixes the “copy,” or document which he is
                    to repeat in type, in a convenient place before his eye, and on some part of the
                    case that is seldom used. In his left hand he holds the composing stick, and
                    with the thumb and first finger of the right hand lifts the letters from the
                    boxes, and arranges them in the composing stick, every letter, point, or sign
                    being picked out separately. In this operation he is much assisted by the use of
                    a <hi rend="italic">setting-rule,</hi> a thin brass or steel plate which, being
                    removed as successive lines are completed, keeps the type in place. When so many
                    words and parts of words as will nearly fill the line have been composed, it is
                    made the exact length required by inserting or diminishing the space between the
                    several words. This is called <hi rend="italic">justifying</hi> the line and is
                    effected by means of the spaces already mentioned. If the work is not “solid
                    ”—that is, if the lines are not close together— the strips of metal called <hi
                    rend="italic">leads</hi> are used. They vary in thickness, but always form
                    aliquot parts of pica body. A good compositor must possess intelligence and a
                    reasonable amount of general knowledge: he must be able to read his copy with
                    readiness, and to understand its meaning, in order to punctuate it properly. He
                    should be able to spell correctly, as some copy is almost undecipherable in
                    regard to separate letters, while other copy is incorrectly spelt. When the
                    composing stick is filled, the type is lifted on to a <hi rend="italic"
                    >galley,</hi> a shallow tray of wood or metal, two or three sides of which are
                    flanged, for the purpose of supporting the type, when the galley is slightly
                    inclined. Stickful after stickful of type is placed on the galley until it is
                    full. The matter is then fastened up, a proof taken at the proof press, and the
                    work of the <hi rend="italic">reader</hi> or corrector of the press—described
                    below—begins. The proof, marked with the necessary corrections, is given back to
                    the compositor, in order that he may make the required alterations in the
                    type.</p>
                <p>The type, being duly corrected, is made up into pages of the required length
                    (unless the author has desired to see proof in <hi rend="italic">slip).</hi> It
                    is then <hi rend="italic">imposed,</hi> that is, the pages are arranged in such
                    a manner that, when printed and the sheet folded, they will fall in due
                    numerical sequence. The impression from any arrangement of pages will be the
                    reverse of that in which they are laid down. If an ordinary four-page newspaper
                    supplement be opened and spread out with the first page uppermost, it will be
                    found that on this side the order of pages is 4, 1; when turned the pages are 2,
                    3. The type pages must be ranged in the reverse way, as 1, 4; 3, 2. Thus the
                    fourth page is placed alongside the first, because both must be printed together
                    on the outside; the third page is to the left, and the second to the right,
                    because in books the odd page—the <hi rend="italic">verso—</hi> is always to the
                    right. For a quarto a sheet of paper is folded twice, that is once across its
                    breadth and then once in a perpendicular direction down the middle. It contains
                    four leaves, and if these are printed on both sides eight pages. The two sides
                    of a sheet are called the outer and inner formes respectively. A sheet of octavo
                    is folded three times, making 8 leaves or 16 pages. The size of a book depends,
                    not only upon the number of times the sheet has been folded, and described
                    accordingly as 4to, 8vo, 12mo, &amp;c., but upon the size of the sheets. The
                    dimensions of the papers commonly used in book-printing are :—imperial, 22 × 30
                    inches; super royal, 20½ × 27½; royal, 20 × 25; medium, 19 × 24; demy, 17½ ×
                    22½; double crown, 20 × 30; double foolscap, 17 × 27; post, 15¾ ×19½. Hence to
                    say that a book is a quarto merely gives no precise indication of its
                    dimensions, as a quarto of one size of paper may be smaller than an octavo of
                    another; it is also necessary to know the size of the sheets of which it is
                    composed.</p>
                <p>When a printed book is opened, it will be found that at the foot of certain pages
                    there is usually a letter and at the foot of another a letter and a figure, as
                    B, B 2; further on another letter and another letter and figure. On going
                    through the book it will be seen that the letters are in regular alphabetical
                    order, and occur at regular intervals of eight, twelve, sixteen, &amp;c., pages.
                    These designate the several sheets of which the book is composed and are called
                    <hi rend="italic">signatures,</hi> so that a sheet may be designated B, and the
                    pages of which it consists are thereby sufficiently indicated. (Occasionally, as
                    in the present work, numbers are used instead of letters.) These signatures
                    assist the binder in folding, as they occupy a certain specified place in each
                    sheet; hence to ascertain if the sheet has been folded properly it is only
                    necessary to examine the position of the signature. The binder also is thus
                    assisted in <hi rend="italic">gathering</hi> or collating together the sheets of
                    a volume in proper order. Signature A is omitted, because it would be on the
                    title or first page, and would be both unnecessary and unsightly. By old custom
                    J, V, and W are discarded, I and J, U and V being originally used
                    indiscriminately by printers, while W was written UU or VV. When the alphabet is
                    exhausted, a new one is commenced, distinguished by a figure precedent, as 2 B,
                    2 C, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The pages of types are arranged in proper order on a flat table, covered with
                    stone or metal, called the <hi rend="italic">imposing stone,</hi> and are then
                    ready to be made into a <hi rend="italic">forme,</hi> that is, in such a state
                    that they can be securely fastened up and moved about. The forme is enclosed in
                    an iron frame or <hi rend="italic">chase,</hi> subdivided by a cross bar. The
                    portions of the type are separated by <hi rend="italic">furniture,</hi> which
                    may be of metal or wood or both. It is of the same height as the chase, but
                    lower than the type, and therefore does not print, but forms the margin of the
                    printed pages. At the sides of the two sections of the formes are pieces of
                    furniture of a tapering shape, called <hi rend="italic">sidesticks,</hi> and at
                    the top and bottom corresponding pieces, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >footsticks.</hi> Small wedges, called <hi rend="italic">quoins,</hi> are
                    inserted and driven forward by a mallet and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >shooting-stick,</hi> so that they gradually exert increasing pressure upon the
                    type. Other mechanical means for locking up are also occasionally adopted. When
                    sufficiently locked up, the whole is quite as firm and portable, however many
                    thousands of pieces of metal it may consist of, as if it were a single plate. In
                    this rapid sketch we purposely omit mention of several operations which, though
                    important and indispensable, are only of interest to the workman.</p>
                <p>For many years endeavours have been made to construct machines for type-setting
                    which should obviate hand labour. Picking out the types separately from their
                    boxes and arranging: them singly in the composing stick is an irksome and
                    monotonous operation, and one which it might be thought comparatively easy to
                    perform by automatic machinery. But of the many different composing machines
                    that have been invented less than half a dozen have stood the test of practical
                    experience. These have been confined to special classes of work, and it is open
                    to doubt whether the nimble fingers of a good compositor, aided by the brains
                    which no machinery can supply, do not favourably compare on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n726/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0726-0701"/> ground of economy with any possible mechanical
                    arrangement. On the other hand, employers and makers of machines allege that
                    owing to the opposition of the men machine type-setting has not had fair play.
                    However that may be, it is undeniable that a composing machine is still rare in
                    printing offices, and where employed it is only as an auxiliary to the ordinary
                    labour of the men. It deserves to be mentioned that nearly the whole of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Times,</hi> with the single exception of the advertisements, has
                    for years past been set up by machinery, and that more than 10,000 pages of the
                    present edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi> have also
                    been so set up. We have not space to describe with any minuteness the
                    construction of composing machines. In the Fraser machine (fig. 8), one of the
                    simplest of its class, which has been made use of to the extent already
                    mentioned in the present work, the types are contained in a series of grooved
                    trays A, in the upper part of the machine, the trays having previously been
                    filled by complementary apparatus called the <hi rend="italic">distributor.</hi>
                    In these trays the types are kept in position, and pressed towards the front
                    part of each tray, by slips of metal attached by cords to the boxwheels B; each
                    of these contains a spring of sufficient strength to press the line of types
                    steadily forward against the separators C, which are formed with an inverted
                    shoulder, under which the front type in each line passes. The keys are connected
                    by levers to the separators, and the depression of any key causes the
                    corresponding separator to descend, carrying with it the front type of the line
                    into the grooved face-plate, down which it slides into the composing stick G.
                    Immediately the finger is lifted from the key the spiral spring D raises the
                    separator to its original position, and the next type in the line takes the
                    place of the one just released, and so in succession as fast as the keys can be
                    pressed. Under the keys runs a rod connected by a crank motion with the pusher
                    G, which, with every depression of a key, pushes forward the line of type in the
                    composing stick, thus making room for the next letter. The matter is thus set in
                    one continuous line, ready to be divided into lines of the required length
                    either by the operator at the machine or by another hand working in conjunction.
                    The speed of the machine varies from 6000 to 12,000 types per hour, but is
                    regulated solely by the skill of the operator, as the machine will work as fast
                    as the keys can be pressed. The composing machines now employed at the <hi
                    rend="italic">Times</hi> office are an improved form of an apparatus invented by
                    Charles Kastenbein, and introduced there in 1872. The operator sits in front of
                    four rows of keys one above the other, something like the manuals of an organ,
                    but only about 3 feet wide. Each of the keys corresponds to a type or character.
                    The types are kept in tin tubes placed vertically at the top of the machine. The
                    depression of a key works a series of levers, and an iron finger pushes the
                    undermost type from its tube, when it falls into a groove formed in a conducting
                    plate, narrowing at the bottom to its apex. Immediately below is a receptacle,
                    and by the action of a treadle the type is pushed along a channel. Other letters
                    follow, the matter being thus set up in a long line, on a groove of the width of
                    an em quad, and running from left to right. The type when it first comes into
                    the groove is in an upright position, but in passing along it becomes twisted,
                    so that the letters stand at an angle of about 45° when they reach the point at
                    which they are justified. This groove communicates at its dexter extremity with
                    the justifying galley,—a simple apparatus, something of the nature of a
                    composing stick and galley combined. Then the type is divided into portions or
                    lines of the required length and justified in the galley, which is adjustable to
                    the width of the required length. As the long line approaches him, the justifier
                    with a small bodkin accelerates a portion large enough in his judgment to fill
                    the width of his column. When this is done he presses his foot on the treadle
                    under him, and thereby causes the line to be pushed into the galley. The line is
                    justified by spaces and quads, and enough type is then taken for another line.
                    The speed depends on the operator, and varies from 6000 to 13,000 types per
                    hour, the average being about 8000, with two operators,—a justifier and a
                    compositor being also necessary. These machines are worked in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Times</hi> office at the rate of a column of solid minion an hour.
                    The machine occupies a floor space of only about 4 feet wide by 2 deep.</p>
                <p>Another machine at present in use is that of Mr Robert Hattersley of Manchester.
                    It probably furnished the general scheme of others in use. One of the most
                    ingenious machines of the kind is that of Mr Alexander Mackie of Warrington, its
                    general principle being the adoption to setting up types of the Jacquard card of
                    the power loom, which weaves automatically the most intricate patterns of cloth.
                    The apparatus consists of three parts,—two used for preparing the “card” or
                    ribbon, which directs the third in the operation of type composing. The
                    perforator is like a small cottage pianoforte. When the keys are struck they
                    produce a perforation, and the ribbon is made to move aside a little, so that a
                    new surface may be presented for puncturing. The composer is a circular iron
                    table, 4 feet in diameter, having round its periphery a number of boxes divided
                    into sections, each of which holds one kind of type. On a slightly lower plane
                    is a wheel carrying little brass tables, hinged at one end. When the machine is
                    in motion, the types are pushed out on to the table, which passes with its
                    freight round its course until it comes to the point of delivery, when the types
                    are swept off. The rising of the table, and the drawing out of the types, are
                    guided by the perforated paper. Hence the machine sets types without a human
                    compositor. When once the ribbon is perforated, it may be used over again for
                    subsequent editions of the same work, which may be in a different size of type.
                    These machines are only in use in the office of the inventor.</p>
                <p>As has been already described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Reporting</hi> (vol. xx.
                    p. 406), the parliamentary reports of some newspapers are set up entirely
                    without copy,—by the ear, not by the eye. It has been found that by the aid of
                    the machine the matter can be set up half as fast again as it could be written
                    out: the average speed of the composing machine is 230 lines per hour when the
                    copy is dictated to the operator, whereas the most skilful workman setting at
                    ease in the usual way can do but 50 lines per hour.</p>
                <p>For many years it was a favourite idea with inventors, especially those who were
                    not practical printers, that great economy might be gained in composition by the
                    use of word-characters or “logotypes,” instead of single letters. The constant
                    repetition of many words seemed to suggest that they might be cast in one piece.
                    Combinations suitable for affixes and suffixes, as ad-, ac-, in-, -ing, -ment,
                    &amp;c., it was also suggested, should be used instead of the single component
                    letters. The suggestion has, however, not been carried out, at least to any
                    considerable extent. The chief practical objection to it is that it involves the
                    use of cases with an inconveniently large number of boxes. The more the variety
                    of characters is multiplied the more “travel” of the compositor’s hand over the
                    cases is necessary for picking them up, and by so much is the speed of his work
                    retarded. Logotypes, too, are more liable to accident; when one letter is
                    damaged the combination is rendered useless.</p>
                <p>The correction of the type is a subject that should be understood by all who have
                    to do with printing, as many mistakes are made on the part of authors which a
                    little technical knowledge would prevent. In the course of setting any <hi
                    rend="italic">copy</hi> or MS. which may be given him the compositor unavoidably
                    picks up some wrong letters, or mistakes the words in the copy before him, or
                    fails to follow the style prescribed for the work. These are called <hi
                    rend="italic">printer's errors.</hi> When the compositor has finished his task,
                    a first proof of the matter is taken. This proof is read through and compared
                    with the copy by the proof reader or <hi rend="italic">corrector of the
                    press</hi> and an assistant, the <hi rend="italic">copy-holder</hi> or reading
                    boy. The proof is then sent back to the compositor and the latter is required to
                    correct all the inaccuracies indicated therein—in fact, to attend to all the
                    directions given by the reader—and this has to be done at his own cost if he is
                    working on piece—that is, paid by results according to work done —or by the
                    employer if he is working “on establishment wages” or paid by time. Another
                    proof called a <hi rend="italic">revise</hi> is now taken; this is carefully
                    compared with the previous proof. If the corrections have not all been made, the
                    revise is marked accordingly, and sent back to the compositor, who is required
                    to remedy the imperfections. When the proof is deemed accurate, or “clean,” it
                    is sent, generally along with the copy, to the author,—being now termed an
                    author’s proof. Finally, in the printing office the matter is carefully re-read
                    and compared with the last author’s proof by the press reader, who signs it and
                    on his responsibility the type is printed off.</p>
                <p>The operation of distributing the types is the converse of that of composing: it
                    is de-composing the forme and returning the several letters to their proper
                    boxes in the case. It is done, as already mentioned, with remarkable rapidity.
                    The forme is first washed over with an alkaline or other detergent to remove the
                    ink from its surface, and then laid down on the imposing surface, unlocked, and
                    damped; this assists the cohesion of the type, after the chase, furniture, side
                    sticks, &amp;c., are removed. The compositor then takes in his left hand,
                    supported by a setting rule, a portion of type in lines, and with the right hand
                    takes a word or so between the finger and thumb, letting each letter drop
                    separately into its proper box. There is hardly any operation which so strikes a
                    spectator as distributing, for a competent distributor literally showers the
                    types into their receptacles. The types are held upside down, that is, with the
                    nicks uppermost; hence the letters of each word are read from left to right like
                    ordinary matter when printed, but the words are of course dealt with in the
                    inverse order.</p>
                <p>Distributing machines of many different kinds have been invented.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n727/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0727-0702"/>
                <p>They may be divided into two classes,—those worked entirely by keys or notes,
                    like the pianoforte, and those in which the distributing is to a certain extent
                    done automatically. For the former class only the type in ordinary use in
                    printing offices is required. For the latter the type requires to be specially
                    prepared, each character having a distinctive nick or nicks upon it, which
                    correspond with the particular channel of the machine it is intended to occupy,
                    and by which it is guided to its special compartment. Kastenbein has produced a
                    distributor which may be described as a composing machine reversed. The matter
                    to be decomposed is placed at the top in its appropriate tray or fixed galley,
                    the sides of which are adjustable to fit any measure, the back being so
                    constructed that it may be advanced to keep the matter always up to the front.
                    As the matter is pressed towards the front, the first letter of it is brought in
                    contact with a steel pusher, behind it being an aperture communicating with the
                    channel of the guide plate. The matter is read by the operator; and he touches
                    the key corresponding to the letter that comes first. Thus the types are
                    conveyed one by one to the guide plate or conductor. It has grooves furnished
                    with little gates or switches, like the points of a railway, and these direct
                    the types into their proper channels. The tubes into which the types are
                    deposited are placed at the foot of each groove. Thus every time a key is
                    depressed the switches move, the pusher sends the type to be distributed out of
                    the line, it falls through the aperture, and, passing down the channels in the
                    guide plate, reaches the proper tube. The speed is to a certain extent dependent
                    upon the skill of the operator, but averages between 3500 and 4000 per hour. A
                    good compositor can by hand alone distribute as many letters as this. But for
                    the purposes of the composing machine, hand distributed types would have to be
                    set up again, as the composing machine is supplied not from ordinary cases but
                    from tubes of type. In the Fraser distributing machine (fig. 9) the page of
                    matter to be distributed is placed on the upper part of the machine at H, whence
                    by suitable apparatus it is moved line by line towards the separator I in front.
                    The matter is there read by the operator, and as each letter comes in contact
                    with the separator the corresponding key is pressed and the type is conveyed to
                    the guide plate, where a series of switches guide it to its proper compartment
                    in the tray of the composing machine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic strikethrough"> Stereotyping, Electrotyping, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>The method of reproducing and multiplying letter-press printing surfaces by
                    taking casts of them, or stereotypes, has greatly conduced to the progress of
                    typography,—much more so, indeed, than might be realized by those who are
                    unacquainted with the practical details of the art. Stereotyping (στερ∈ός, fixed
                    or solid; τύπoς, type or forme) is the method of taking casts from a fixed or
                    movable forme; thus, printing from stereotypes is distinguished from typography,
                    in which impressions are taken from movable types. It does not supersede
                    type-founding, but supplements it, for a page of reading matter requires first
                    of all to be set up letter by letter, and then the casts or plates are taken,
                    each of which may be printed from with nearly as much perfection as from the
                    original forme. Hence a printing surface may be reproduced to an almost infinite
                    extent, and the means of production of impressions on the press or machine are
                    increased in proportion to the number of casts taken. It ensures an accurate
                    copy of an original text, whereas in reproduction by resetting the movable types
                    there is a liability to deviation. When only a cast is worked from, any accident
                    may be repaired by taking another cast, and the cost is slight compared with
                    that of composing over again. A smaller quantity of type may be used in an
                    office where this process is used; a portion of a work may be set up, a cast
                    taken, and the types returned to the cases. The plates are more easily stored
                    than movable formes, and are not liable to the danger, as in the latter, of
                    types falling out. Above all, the mould may be bent to any curve required, and a
                    circular cast obtained, which may be fastened round the cylinder of a machine
                    (see <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> in regard to rotary printing).</p>
                <p>The process of stereotyping, divested of merely technical details, is as follows.
                    From a forme of matter, which may be wholly or in part composed of movable
                    types, a matrix or mould is taken. The original is in rilievo; the mould
                    consequently is in intaglio. From this the stereo plate is cast, and it of
                    course is again in rilievo. This in turn may likewise become an original, and
                    casts may be taken from a plate, or other casts from the same mould. The first
                    books were printed from solid wooden blocks, each of which formed a page. Then
                    came the era of typography, in which these pages were composed, mosaic-like, of
                    movable types. Now has succeeded the period of stereotyping, in which pages
                    formed of single blocks —but of metal, not of wood—are used. The two essential
                    parts are, therefore, the making of the matrix and of the cast, which is
                    composed of an alloy something like that for type metal. The mould may be of
                    plaster of Paris or papier-mâché; the latter being the simplest material, and
                    that almost universally used, need alone be here referred to. The following
                    account of the process, when carried out on the smallest possible scale, is
                    sufficient perhaps to show the general principles of the art. The papier-mâché
                    for the mould, called <hi rend="italic">flong,</hi> is made by uniting several
                    sheets of paper with a paste made of wheaten flour, starch, and alum, to which
                    whiting is added. These ingredients are often varied; the general object in
                    using them is to obtain a paste which will stand a high temperature without
                    burning. A sheet of brown paper is laid down on a smooth surface and pasted
                    over; blotting paper is laid on that and pressed down, then pasted over, and a
                    sheet of tissue paper added, which is also pasted, and another sheet of tissue
                    paper placed on the top. This is well smoothed and pressed to give the
                    incorporated material greater firmness and cohesion. Next, to prepare the forme
                    for being moulded, it is surrounded with metal “clumps” of the height of the
                    type, placed close to the matter, and then oiled to prevent the flong sticking
                    to it. The latter is then thoroughly damped, to render it quite plastic. The
                    forme being on a level surface, the flong is laid upon it, and on that a piece
                    of linen. The surface is next well beaten all over with a long-handled brush,
                    till the flong sinks into all the declivities of the forme and receives a deep
                    impression of it. This is a process requiring experience and practice. The linen
                    being removed, a piece of very stout paper is laid on the top, and also beaten
                    down, so as to strengthen the flong, and the moulding is finished. The next
                    point is to dry the mould.</p>
                <p>In the most rudimentary method a combined drying and casting press is used. It
                    consists of a flat iron surface, with a lid attached to one end by hinges. Over
                    the surface is a cross-head fitted with a screw; pressure may be exerted on
                    anything placed between, the arrangement being like that of a screw
                    letter-copying press. The cross-head can be moved to one side when it is
                    necessary for the lid to be lifted up. Underneath the press is a series of gas
                    jets, by means of which the bed plate is heated. The press stands on supports,
                    but is attached to them only by an axle, and it can be readily changed from the
                    horizontal to the vertical position. The lid of the box is raised and the forme
                    with the flong upon it placed on the centre of the iron surface. After being
                    covered with a blanket, the lid is screwed down upon the whole, and, the gas
                    being lighted, the forme and mould are heated for a few minutes, after which the
                    lid is raised, the steam evaporates, and the flong, which has now become the
                    matrix, is thoroughly dry. In large stereotyping foundries, after the flong has
                    been well beaten upon the forme, until the impression of the types is plainly
                    seen on the back, it is baked and dried (the forme still underneath) on a long
                    thick iron slab, called a <hi rend="italic">hot chamber,</hi> because it is
                    heated from within by steam. The matrix is then removed from the forme, and any
                    superfluous margin cut away or trimmed; after this the matrix is dusted with
                    powdered French chalk and is ready for being cast from.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These matrices can be preserved for several
                    years, and the stereotyping process postponed until actually
                    required.</p></note> A method has lately come into use for obviating the
                    necessity of keeping the matrix on the type while it is being hardened by drying
                    by heat, whereby the type is injured. The matrix is dried separately, being
                    removed when moist from the forme, as soon as the impression is obtained. It is
                    then placed on a bed of sand heated by gas. The forme is never heated, and there
                    is a great saving of time, because the drying can be done in two minutes. The
                    matrix is laid on the bed of the casting box face upwards, with gauges around it
                    to determine the height or thickness of the cast. The lid is put down and
                    screwed tightly, and the position of the press altered from the horizontal to
                    the upright. The metal is then poured in and the press restored to its former
                    position. The matrix is carefully raised and the plate exposed. It has only to
                    be “trimmed,” the superfluous metal cut away, and the back planed, to be ready
                    for mounting on a block of wood to make it type high.</p>
                <p>In stereotyping for the Walter and similar presses the process is as follows. The
                    forme is laid on the table of the moulding machine and the flong placed on it
                    and thoroughly beaten in by hand or passed through a moulding machine, which
                    performs the same operation. The forme is next placed on a heating surface, and
                    when nearly dried the matrix is removed from it and again dried. It is then
                    placed in the casting box, which is curved to the circumference of the cylinder
                    of the press. The box, being on a swivel, is set upright. The metal is now
                    poured in from a ladle and the plate cast. It is allowed to stand a minute and
                    then taken out, still hot, and placed upon a “finishing saddle” of the same
                    circular form as the back of the plate, and secured by clamps and screws. An
                    angular-shaped knife or chisel, fixed in a carriage, is moved by a handle in a
                    semicircular direction across the surface of the plate, in order to remove
                    superfluous portions of metal and to form a bevel whereby the plate can be
                    subsequently <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n728/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0728-0703"/> clamped on the machine. If necessary the plate
                    may be smoothed at the back by a specially-contrived planing machine. The plate
                    is now ready for being placed on the printing machine. Each single operation can
                    be performed with the utmost possible despatch. If the organization is
                    sufficiently perfect, the time for making a plate, from the moment when the
                    forme comes down from the machine-room to that wherein the perfect plate is set
                    on the machine, need only be about eight minutes.</p>
                <p>In newspaper establishments where stereotyping is thus adopted the pages are not
                    all made up simultaneously: some are kept open till the last for the latest
                    telegrams. The moment a page is completed and locked up in its chase it is sent
                    down to the foundry, and as many casts taken as there are printing machines to
                    be set going. One page follows another with rapidity, the first being placed in
                    position on the machine, while the later ones are in the foundry. When all the
                    plates are finished and fixed in their places, six, eight, or ten machines may
                    be simultaneously printing at the rate of nearly 12,000 per hour each. The
                    enormous increase in the circulation of the great daily newspapers would have
                    been impossible but for the extraordinary facilities for rapid production
                    provided by stereotyping. This process is also of special utility to the
                    newspaper printer in the case of telegrams arriving late. In machines which
                    printed from the type, late telegrams could only be inserted by a “stop-press”;
                    that is, the printing was interrupted while the alteration was being made. But,
                    when the papier-mâché casts of the pages have been taken, the type itself is;ed
                    and sent back to the composing room, so that, if later news arrives while the
                    machines are running, the foreman printer alters the page, a fresh cast of it is
                    taken, and a machine started without interrupting the production for a moment.
                    The London evening papers have usually five editions, and for every edition
                    fresh casts are made of one or more of the pages.</p>
                <p>Quite recently the substance called celluloid has been introduced instead of the
                    metal referred to previously. A mould is made of yellow oxide of lead and
                    glycerin formed into a semi-fluid paste, which is applied to the surface of the
                    type. The matrix is placed on a powerful press and a heated sheet of celluloid
                    about <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 16</hi> of an inch
                    thick is laid on it. When pressure is applied, a perfect facsimile is obtained,
                    and it is ready to be printed from when mounted in the usual way. Whereas a good
                    electrotype from a wood block averages six hours in its production, a cast in
                    celluloid can be got in less than an hour. These blocks are very tough and many
                    thousands more of impressions can be printed from them than from stereotypes
                    without their showing signs of wear. For small stamps india-rubber is used as a
                    stereotyping material, and afterwards vulcanized. These stamps, being flexible,
                    print on rough surfaces which would not take an impression from ordinary
                    stereotypes. With a flexible surface, too, much less pressure is required.</p>
                <p>Machines have been invented to do away with the use of types altogether. The
                    principle is to punch the characters successively on some substance which will
                    act like the flong and become a mould from which stereo plates may be cast. In
                    an apparatus recently introduced the flong is a prepared piece of millboard,
                    which is placed in front of the steel punches. The latter are driven into the
                    flong with lightning speed and great accuracy. By turning a handle all the Roman
                    punches are changed to Italic; by another a set of sanserif or other founts
                    comes into play. For setting time-tables and logarithms the apparatus is said to
                    save ninety per cent. over the ordinary system of hand-setting. The obstacle to
                    the more general use of it is the difficulty of correcting errors. In another
                    machine the punches are driven into a block of teak wood. They are cast to
                    thicknesses which are the multiple of a “point”; hence by a simple calculation
                    they may be spaced out to the exact number of points chosen for the length of
                    the line, and every line leaves the machine justified. The block when complete
                    is removed and a stereotype taken, which can be printed as in the ordinary
                    method of typography.</p>
                <p>For the reproduction of wood engravings electrotyping has nearly superseded
                    stereotyping, as it produces much better copies. For obtaining plates of type
                    matter it is also better than stereotyping, as many thousands of impressions may
                    be taken without reducing the sharpness of an electro, while ordinary stereotype
                    would be almost worn out by printing a much smaller number. This arises from the
                    superior hardness and toughness of copper, of which the surface of the electro
                    is formed. Electrotyping, however, is costlier and slower.</p>
                <p>The forme to be electrotyped is placed upon a level plate, and surrounded with
                    type-high clumps or metal furniture, and then floated with plaster of Paris,
                    which prevents the mould of wax (to be afterwards made) from penetrating too far
                    into the interstices of the spaces. The forme is next brushed with finely
                    powdered blacklead or plumbago. The moulding composition is made of melted wax,
                    with the addition of a little blacklead. This is poured into a shallow metal
                    moulding tray, to which two pieces of stout wire are soldered, in order that it
                    may be afterwards suspended in the depositing trough. After the composition is
                    cooled and set its surface is brushed with blacklead, and it is then ready for
                    moulding. The moulding press may be something like a letter-copying press, or,
                    in a large establishment, may consist of a powerful hydraulic or other press
                    capable of exercising a pressure of many tons. The forme is placed exactly under
                    the centre of the platen, with the moulding tray containing the wax, slightly
                    warm, upon it. An impression is then taken, and the mould afterwards separated
                    from the forme. The mould has next to go through the process of <hi
                    rend="italic">building,</hi> that is, heated wax is dropped upon such portions
                    as should be more deeply sunk in the finished electrotype plate, namely, the
                    places where “whites” are to appear in the print. The mould, having been
                    finished, has to be blackleaded, plumbago being a conductor of electricity,
                    while wax is a non-conductor. The material is well brushed in, filling all the
                    interstices of the forme; and the entire surface of the mould must be properly
                    covered, to ensure a perfect deposit of the copper. To facilitate this
                    operation, a blackleading machine is used in large establishments. The forme is
                    placed upon a carriage formed of transverse bars and is moved backwards and
                    forwards by a handle and rounce to bring it under the blacklead brush. After the
                    mould is blackleaded, the back of the moulding pan is coated with wax, to
                    prevent the copper from being deposited upon it. The mould is now quickly
                    immersed in one of the compartments of the battery. The process of depositing a
                    copper solution upon the blackleaded surface of the mould is continued until a
                    solid plate is formed, which, though it is scarcely thicker than a finger nail,
                    being about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 32</hi> inch,
                    forms, when properly backed, the best and most enduring surface for letterpress
                    printing that has been discovered.</p>
                <p>The moulding tray containing the mould is hung on the brass rod of the depositing
                    trough facing a plate of copper, and the connexion of the battery made: that is,
                    the mould is attached to one pole of the battery and the plate of copper to the
                    other. The copper, so to speak, is decomposed on the one hand and recomposed on
                    the other: in other words, the current of electricity being complete, and the
                    mould submerged in the sulphate of copper solution, the deposition of copper on
                    the mould at once commences. Here it remains until the deposit is sufficient,
                    the time usually occupied being from 8 to 12 hours, according to the state of
                    the solution and the strength of the batteries. The dynamo-electro machine,
                    which is now employed in large houses, very materially reduces this period;
                    otherwise Smee’s batteries are generally used. When the deposit, or, as it is
                    called, the <hi rend="italic">shell,</hi> formed on the wax mould is of proper
                    thickness, it is disengaged from the wax,—the mould being placed with its back
                    on an inclined board, and boiling water poured over the shell, which melts the
                    surface of the wax, except a thin coating, the removal of which is effected by
                    placing the mould and shell on a steam heating table. Thus the wax mould is
                    destroyed, and it is not possible to obtain more than one shell from a mould,
                    whereas the stereotype process enables almost any number of casts to be taken
                    from the same matrix. The shell, being too thin and fragile to be printed from,
                    is next backed, or filled up with metal of a somewhat softer kind than stereo
                    metal. The shell, after being further cleaned, is lowered on to the top of a
                    vessel of molten type metal; and, when the solder previously used to unite the
                    copper and the metal has fused, the latter is poured over it in a molten state
                    until it is covered. The plate is washed, dried, and polished, the back roughly
                    planed to a surface parallel to the front, the edges squared, and all
                    imperfections made good. The thickness of a plate is usually a pica or ⅙th inch.
                    It is mounted as an ordinary stereotype plate. Within the last few years the
                    process has been greatly facilitated by the employment of specially contrived
                    apparatus, and illustrations can be produced in three hours from the time the
                    mould is made. Curved electros are produced, as well as curved stereos, for use
                    in rotary printing. Facing with nickel by the electroplating process is now
                    largely adopted for hardening stereotypes and electrotypes and rendering them
                    more durable. This process also prevents the deterioration of such plates by the
                    action of the acids or other chemical reagents often present in printing inks,
                    such as cyanide of potassium in red ink and nitric acid in some blue inks.</p>
                <p>Polytyping is a method invented in France about the end of the 18th century, but
                    now seldom practised in the United Kingdom. The apparatus somewhat resembles a
                    pile-driver. It has two upright guides about six feet high, and a pulley at the
                    top, which elevates by means of a rope a heavy plate, on which the matrix is
                    placed in an inverted position. At the foot of the machine there is a
                    substantial iron bed, upon which the operator places some molten metal. He then
                    pulls the rope until the matrix, with its weight attached, is elevated to the
                    top of the machine, when it is suddenly allowed to fall. The result is similar
                    to that made on a medal by means of a die,—a perfect reproduction of the matrix
                    in relief, which is mounted on a metal stand to type height. The results are
                    excellent, as the plastic metal is forced into the finest lines of the matrix.
                    Duplicates of a block can be thus produced more rapidly than by the ordinary
                    stereotype process; and another advantage is that the intaglio parts are much
                    deeper,—a point of some importance in printing. The matrix may be made from the
                    block by the electrotyping process.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Substitutes for Wood-Engraving.</hi></p>
                <p>Formerly the only available method of obtaining illustrations which could be
                    printed on the letter-press in conjunction with type was that of wood -
                    engraving. At the present time a number of comparatively new processes are in
                    operation, in which the engraving is done almost automatically by the adoption
                    of chemical processes and the well-known principles of photography. Engravings
                    of this kind are called in the trade <hi rend="italic">process blocks,</hi> or
                    sometimes <hi rend="italic">zinco-types,</hi> owing to the metal of which they
                    are formed. There is space here for only the barest possible account of the
                    processes.</p>
                <p>In the first method, which is sometimes called <hi rend="italic"
                    >typo-etching,</hi> the drawing is made with ordinary lithographic ink on stone,
                    or on paper and transferred to stone. It is then re-transferred to a plate of
                    polished zinc by the ordinary lithographic process. Zinc is employed on account
                    of its cheapness and its ready solubility in the acids used for etching. It has
                    properties similar to those of the lithographic stone in taking up the ink and
                    the water. The transfer is made to adhere to the plate by being passed through a
                    lithographic press; the paper is then stripped off; and the whole of the ink is
                    left on the plate, which is inked up as a litho stone with a view to render the
                    lines as solid and strong as possible to resist the acid. The covering of the
                    lines is strengthened by dusting powdered asphalt or some other suitable
                    material over the plate, which is warmed just sufficiently to incorporate the
                    asphalt with the ink. The plate is next placed in a bath of acid (its back and
                    other parts, where the acid is not required to act, being protected by varnish),
                    in order that the unprotected parts, or those which are to form the whites of
                    the finished picture, may be dissolved away. In order to prevent the acid eating
                    not only straight down into the plate but on the sides of the furrows it forms,
                    and thus undermining them, an ingenious device has been adopted. As soon as the
                    etching has proceeded to a very slight depth, the plate is removed from the
                    bath, washed, and heated. The ink and other protective medium are thus melted
                    and run down the sides of the little furrows formed by the acids and thereby
                    protect them from further action. Inking and dusting with resinous material are
                    repeated, and etching resumed, until the depressions of the block have been
                    brought to the proper depth. The etching is carried on in troughs to which a
                    rocking motion is given, so that the acid flows to and fro in waves over the
                    surface, and little bubbles of gas, &amp;c., are carried away. Where large
                    spaces of white occur, the metal is cleared away by a drill; after the block has
                    been mounted type high, it is ready for the printer.</p>
                <p>This process is only available for the production of “line blocks,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e</hi>., those in which the original drawing is done in lines or
                    dots, as for an ordinary woodcut. The highest achievement of process blocks has
                    been the production of <hi rend="italic">tone blocks,</hi> which may be made
                    direct from oil-paintings, water-colours, photographs, drawings in chalk, wash,
                    pencil, &amp;c., or indeed from anything from which a photographic negative can
                    be taken. The exact nature of the processes is a trade secret, but the rationale
                    is given in Mr Truman Wood’s <hi rend="italic">Modern Methods of Illustrating
                    Books (London,</hi> 1887), to which we are indebted for the following details.
                    The problem is to translate, as it were, the light and shade of the negative
                    into solid outlines of black and white. The shades must be lines of various
                    breadths or of various distances apart, or spots or grain of various degrees of
                    fineness or closeness. In a surfaceblock any part that touches the paper prints,
                    and any part that does not touch the paper does not leave any mark at all. The
                    photographic image is continuous: there are no outlines in it, the picture being
                    formed of graduated tints or shades, ranging from the white of the paper up to
                    the darkest colour that the process employed can give. To make a block for
                    letter-press printing the graduated tints of the photograph have to be broken up
                    into stipple or grain, and it must be a stipple closest in the shadows,
                    gradually becoming more open through the range of the intermediate tones, and
                    vanishing altogether in the highest lights. To describe the ingenious methods
                    adopted to secure this end would involve an account of several photographic
                    operations which would be out of place here. In one process, perfected by
                    Meisenbach of Munich in 1882, grained negatives are produced by placing a
                    transparent screen, on which a suitable grain is imprinted, in contact with the
                    negative or the positive to be copied, and then photographing the two together.
                    The negative is transferred to a plate of suitable material, which is graved or
                    etched in the usual manner, to form a typographic block. Another device is to
                    print from the original negative upon a piece of silk, the threads of which
                    break up the picture into a regular grain. The positive on the silk is then
                    photographed and a printing block made. These blocks require from their very low
                    relief delicate and careful printing, but are made to give excellent
                    results.</p>
                <p>A process of typographic etching has been invented by Messrs Dawson, in which the
                    design is drawn with an etching needle on a brass plate covered with a wax
                    etching ground, in the same manner as for an ordinary etching. The metal is
                    therefore bared at the lines, which are separated by ridges and spaces of wax.
                    These spaces are strengthened by the addition of melted wax, which runs up to
                    the edges of the lines, but does not run over on to them as might be expected,
                    filling them up. The supply is continued until the spaces between the lines,
                    representing the whites of the finished print, have been raised to a height
                    sufficient to give the necessary relief, when an electrotype is taken. This
                    electrotype forms the printing surface.</p>
                <p>Shanks’s process is a device for producing pictures simply by the use of
                    mechanism, and is an application of the eidograph. The plate to be drawn upon is
                    moved under the drawing implement, which is a rapidly revolving cutter, and the
                    plate on its carrier is mounted on the end of a series of levers in the same way
                    as the slide rest of a lathe, so as to have motion in two directions, one at
                    right angles to the other, and consequently by a combination of the two to have
                    motion in any direction in the same plane. If a plate of a suitable substance,
                    such as hardened plaster of Paris, be mounted on the carrier, and the bracing
                    point at the other end of the lever be moved over the lines of a drawing, the
                    cutter will plough a little furrow, which will follow these lines. When the
                    plate is finished, a stereotype is taken from it and forms the printing surface.
                    The lines of the casts are remarkably strong owing to the conformation of the
                    furrow of the mould, and they can be printed on fast rotary machines. The
                    weather charts given in some newspapers are produced by this process. A block
                    with the recurring outlines being made, plates are moulded from it, so that the
                    details alone have to be separately cut upon future plates. Mr Shanks’s method
                    is remarkably simple and expeditious, and the results are economical and
                    trustworthy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Press - Work and Presses.</hi></p>
                <p>The characteristic of printing, as already pointed out, is that the pigment—the
                    ink—with which the printing surface of the type is coated is transferred to the
                    paper or other material by pressure. The manner in which this pressure is
                    exerted gives rise to two classes of machinery,—those in which the platen and
                    the cylinder respectively are employed. After the paper is placed on the type,
                    in the one case a flat plate of iron moves parallel to the forme and comes in
                    contact with it, causing the impression on the paper, while in the other case a
                    cylinder revolves over the surface, which travels in gearing with the
                    cylinder.</p>
                <p>Space does not permit of any sketch, however slight, of the origin and progress
                    of type-printing machinery. We can only refer to what may be regarded as
                    representative appliances in present use. In America all kinds of apparatus for
                    printing are called “presses”; in England, however, an appliance of a more
                    automatic character than the hand-press is usually called “a machine.” As the
                    hand-press is now almost obsolete, this distinction will probably be abandoned,
                    and the shorter and more expressive word “press” be applied to all. Venturing to
                    adopt this suggestion, we may say that of platen presses there are the
                    hand-press, the treadle platen press, and the steam or other power-driven
                    press.</p>
                <p>Fig. 10 is a view of the Albion press. It is wholly of iron and steel. Although
                    this press is nearly superseded, it is desirable to point out its component
                    parts, as they indicate the general principles on which all typographic
                    machinery is based. The flat plane on which the type is laid is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">bed</hi> of the press; the other flat plane which moves vertically
                    and presses the paper on the type is the <hi rend="italic">platen.</hi> These
                    are the two essential parts of the press. The platen is perfectly smooth and
                    level on its under surface, in order to give the whole of the type forme an
                    equable pressure. It is mounted in a strong iron frame, with a crosspiece or
                    head. The platen is propelled by a piston, which moves up and down. The power is
                    gained by bringing an inclined bar of steel perpendicular to the direct line of
                    pressure, and in doing so the piston is forced down. This steel bar is the <hi
                    rend="italic">chill,</hi> shaped like an elbow. At one end is a bar or handle
                    which, on being pulled towards the operator, straightens the chill or brings it
                    into the vertical position. At the sides are guide-plates fixed into the frame,
                    to preserve the parallelism of the platen, for the slightest vibration or
                    lateral movement would prevent a clear sharp impression being taken. There are
                    appropriate appliances, such as a helical spring, fixed on the head of the
                    press, whereby the platen raises itself when the pressure is not required. In
                    order to bring the forme readily under the platen, and to withdraw it so that it
                    may be inked and the sheet to be printed placed in position, the table is
                    mounted on a carriage, that runs on two rails by turning a handle connected with
                    two endless bands. The paper is fixed to certain marks on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tympan,</hi> a kind of metal frame hinged on to the carriage, when it is in a
                    sloping position. This ensures the paper being printed in the exact place
                    required. The tympan, over which calico or parchment is stretched, is double,
                    and contains within it a pad of paper or a piece of blanket, to moderate the
                    force of the impression of the platen. To it is hinged another metal frame, the
                    <hi rend="italic">frisket,</hi> which is covered with paper, cut to correspond
                    with the shape of the type forme on the press. The ink is applied with a
                    cylinder or <hi rend="italic">roller,</hi> which revolves in an iron frame, and
                    is <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n730/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0730-0705"/> covered about an inch thick with a composition of
                    glue and treacle or of glycerin or other substance. The ink is spread out with a
                    palette knife or similar appliance on a table adjoining the press, and by
                    repeatedly revolving the roller over it, it becomes coated with an extremely
                    thin film of ink. The roller is then moved over the surface of the forme on the
                    press, until sufficient ink has been transferred to it. This is called <hi
                    rend="italic">rolling,</hi> and is a very important part of press-work, for if
                    inefficiently performed there will be too much ink on the impression, or even
                    blotches, which are called <hi rend="italic">monks,</hi> or the print will be
                    too pale or grey in places, such imperfections being called <hi rend="italic"
                    >friars.</hi> The sheet of paper to be printed is next laid on the tympan, to
                    pins serving as guides. The frisket is folded down on the tympan, which is in
                    turn folded down on the forme with the right hand, while with the left the
                    handle is turned and the press carriage brought under the platen. The bar is
                    pulled by the right hand, the handle turned the reverse way with the left hand,
                    the carriage brought out again, the tympan raised, the frisket opened, and the
                    printed sheet removed, the tympan being ready to receive another white sheet.
                    The frisket serves, among other things, to keep the edges and parts of the sheet
                    not required to be printed from being discoloured by contact with the ink or the
                    sides of the forme, and to aid in steadying the sheet when the tympan is
                    depressed and in the removal of the sheet when it is raised. Such is a bare
                    outline of the method of printing at a hand-press,—one necessarily imperfect
                    from a technical point of view, but sufficient to indicate the essentials of the
                    operation.</p>
                <p>Another press which has been much used is the Columbian,—a name given to it by
                    its inventor, Clymer, an American. The power is gained by an ingenious
                    combination of levers. Two of these are connected by a rod with the bar handle,
                    which is in itself a lever. The platen is attached to the head by a strong iron
                    bolt, the descent being made steady and regular by vertical guides. It is
                    counterbalanced by a powerful lever or beam, having an adjustable weight shaped
                    like an eagle, which raises it automatically. In the bar handle is a screw stop
                    by means of which the length of the lever rod can be adjusted and its pressure,
                    or the <hi rend="italic">pull,</hi> perfectly regulated.</p>
                <p>Nine distinct processes have thus to be gone through in order to print one side
                    of a sheet of paper at a hand-press :—(1) inking the roller, (2) inking the
                    forme, (3) laying the sheet on the tympan, (4) folding down the tympan, (5)
                    running in the forme under the platen, (6) taking the impression by depressing
                    the platen, and then immediately afterwards allowing it to raise itself by means
                    of the counterpoise or spring, (7) running out the forme, (8) lifting the tympan
                    and frisket, and (9) removing the sheet. The object of successive improvers of
                    the printing press has been to render the apparatus more automatic, or to
                    substitute for it a “machine” that will reduce these nine operations to the
                    minimum. In modern machines this has been effected to the extent of rendering
                    necessary only three of them—(1) laying on or “feeding” the sheets, (2) applying
                    the motive power, (3) taking off or delivering the sheets; and rotary machines
                    both feed and deliver themselves automatically. Nearly all cylinder machines
                    have a delivery apparatus, and quite recently an appliance for the automatic
                    feeding to them of single sheets of paper has been invented.</p>
                <p>With respect to the platen press we notice first that which is capable of being
                    driven by a rotating shaft or wheel. It should be observed that the adoption of
                    the rotatory principle was essential to the acceleration of speed. This was
                    recognized by the projector of the machine<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The best account of its invention is contained in a series
                    of articles by Mr william Blades in the <hi rend="italic">Printers'

                    Nicholson, and by Frederick Koenig, who first brought the invention into use and
                    constructed a practical press. The essential arrangements of every machine are
                    four, their respective objects being (1) to feed in the paper, (2) to ink the
                    forme, (3) to print the sheet, and (4) to deliver or take it off.</p>
                <p>The treadle platen press is the simplest of machine presses capable of being
                    worked by a wheel. When other motive power is not available it is driven by a
                    treadle, like that of a lathe. The type forme is usually secured by clamps on an
                    almost vertical bed (fig. 11), and the platen rocks backwards and forwards,
                    being thus brought in contact with the type on the bed. Just before the
                    impression is taken, the two surfaces are momentarily parallel. The inking is
                    effected by small composition rollers, adjusted in a roller carrier swinging on
                    a pivot. The rollers receive ink from a “fountain” or duct of ink at the top of
                    the machine, below which is an arrangement, such as a revolving disk, for
                    distributing the ink. The constant motion of the rollers and of the revolving
                    ink disk is equivalent to the manual movements of the operator who “rolls” at
                    the hand-press. The rollers are carried by self-acting appliances over the face
                    of the forme, and return to the ink table to be replenished with ink, after
                    which the impression takes place. The sheet to be printed is placed in proper
                    position on the platen, which is covered with paper or parchment, and is secured
                    there during the movement of the platen by movable fingers called <hi
                    rend="italic">grippers.</hi> The platen on advancing brings the paper in contact
                    with the type forme; after the printing it returns to its original position,
                    when the sheet is removed and another sheet adjusted ready for being printed.
                    The treadle platen press is only adapted for work on paper of small size, up to
                    half sheet demy, but within this limit it is greatly superior to the hand-press.
                    If sufficiently strong and well built, it gives a far more powerful impression,
                    and it occupies about a sixth of the space. Its great merit, however, is its
                    superior speed. The hand-press, when worked by two men, one rolling the types
                    and one pulling the handle of the press, produces only about 250 impressions per
                    hour. The treadle press is worked by a boy, who has only to depress the treadle
                    with his foot, and lay on and take off the sheets with his hands, and he can
                    work at the rate of more than 1000 per hour. The treadle press is also superior
                    to the hand-press in the uniformity of its results, since the automatic inking
                    ensures a greater regularity in the colour of the impressions than with the old
                    hand-inking process.</p>
                <p>The ordinary or ‘ ‘ double” platen press was, in principle, very similar to the
                    hand-press. It was about 13 feet long. The platen, in the centre, was massive,
                    as the machine printed sheets as large as double demy, and it had a
                    perpendicular motion, being guided in grooves and worked by a connecting rod
                    fixed to a cross beam and crank, which acquired its motion from the main shaft.
                    In other respects the machine differed from the hand-press in having two type
                    beds or coffins and two inking tables arranged at the ends of the carriage,
                    which travelled backwards and forwards, being worked by a drum underneath. The
                    paper to be printed was laid to marks on the frisket, and this was hinged on the
                    tympan, which in turn was fastened to the end of the coffin by hinges or joints.
                    The frisket and tympan were opened by running up bars at suitable positions.
                    After a newly printed sheet was removed, another was placed on the frisket,
                    which as the carriage moved ran down the bars and closed on the sheet, which
                    then received its impression. This arrangement was dangerous to the boys who had
                    to lay on the sheets.</p>
                <p>Formerly it was thought that the very finest printing could not be done by a
                    cylinder impressing a forme in the progress of its reciprocating motion, for
                    that was liable to slur or blur the impression. Hence platen presses were
                    employed for the best work. Of recent years engineers have brought the cylinder
                    press to such perfection that there is not the slightest danger, under the
                    superintendence of a capable man, of any slur. Working quite as well as the
                    platen press, the cylinder press is enormously quicker and more productive; it
                    requires less driving power; and much better inking is obtained, which is
                    all-important for fine woodcut printing. Accordingly, for even the best
                    illustrated book-work, the platen power-press is now almost entirely superseded
                    by the cylinder.</p>
                <p>Cylinder machines are of two kinds,—(1) presses in which the type is on a flat
                    plane and (2) those in which the type, or more correctly the impressing surface,
                    is cylindrical. The first are called <hi rend="italic">cylinder</hi> presses,
                    the second—a development of the first—the <hi rend="italic">rotary</hi> web
                    presses.</p>
                <p>The simplest kind of mechanical press is called the single-cylinder<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n731/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0731-0706"/> or one-sided machine, which has been recently
                    brought to the highest state of perfection by Mr Samuel Bremner. It is generally
                    used for commercial and fine book-work on one side of the paper. There are
                    different varieties of cylinder machines, distinguished by trade-marks or the
                    names of their makers; but the general principles, apart from details, are
                    practically identical. There is a strong cast-iron frame, with bearings to carry
                    the cylinder, which runs across the machine transversely, nearly in the centre.
                    The cylinder revolves by gearing connected with a main shaft, which also works
                    the other moving parts. This shaft is turned by a wheel for hand or steam
                    power.</p>
                <p>The table for carrying the type is also provided with a flat inking board of wood
                    or iron, used for distributing the ink. It travels backwards and forwards, that
                    is, with a reciprocating motion. At one end of the machine is the <hi
                    rend="italic">feeding-board,</hi> on which the pile of paper to be printed is
                    placed. The layer-on places each sheet against metal marks, consisting of
                    rectangular pieces of steel or brass mounted on a bar underneath, which rises
                    and falls according as the sheet is being laid to and taken away from them. When
                    placed against these marks, ensuring correct “lay,” the sheet is seized by
                    grippers or light metal claws fixed on a bar inside the cylinder. These clutch
                    the sheet and carry it forward round the cylinder, which in its revolution
                    brings it forcibly in contact with the type forme moving forward underneath,
                    when the impression is effected. Immediately after the grippers release their
                    hold, and the sheets are removed singly by an attendant called a <hi
                    rend="italic">taker-off,</hi> or by a mechanical automatic arrangement called a
                    <hi rend="italic">flyer,</hi> and deposited on the taking-off board. At the end
                    of the machine farthest from the laying-on board is fixed a trough, which
                    contains the ink; it is fitted with the <hi rend="italic">dud roller</hi> of
                    cast-iron, which revolves by means of a band or ratchet-wheel and pawl. A flat
                    bar or knife with a thin edge is set up against the metal roller lengthways by
                    adjusting screws, which regulate the passage of the ink, and permit a thin film
                    to pass the knife. A composition roller, called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >vibrator,</hi> is fixed underneath, which takes off the ink that has already
                    been deposited on the duct roller and leaves a ridge or strip of it on the
                    inking slab. As the carriage returns, this strip of ink is distributed on the
                    inking table by rollers placed diagonally across the machine. The diagonal
                    position gives them a waving motion; hence they are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >wavers.</hi> The inking of the forme is done by another set of rollers called
                    <hi rend="italic">inkers,</hi> placed near the impression cylinder. The inking
                    rollers receive their ink from what is distributed on the table and coat the
                    type while it is passing underneath them.</p>
                <p>Thus the nine operations of the hand-press requisite to print one impression are
                    greatly reduced. The bed carrying the type to and fro from the point of
                    impression moves mechanically, superseding the running in and out of the
                    carriage by the rounce and handle of the hand-press. The inking table, although
                    independent, forms part of the type table, and some of the rollers distribute
                    and others ink, this again being done mechanically and without a second
                    operator. The platen and the tympan, as well as the levers by which the
                    impression is given, are in effect combined in the cylinder, which rotates by
                    gearing, the pressure being applied during the motion of the table itself. The
                    laying-on of the sheet upon the tympan and folding it down on the forme are
                    superseded by the presentation of the paper to the grippers; and the taking-off
                    of the sheet after raising the tympan is superseded by removing it when released
                    by the grippers and laying it on the adjacent table,— both immeasurably easier
                    operations and done much more rapidly. Indeed both laying-on and taking-off may
                    be done automatically, as is explained below. The result is that, while two men
                    are required to print a sheet of book-work on one side of the paper at the speed
                    of 250 an hour at the hand-press, machines of this class worked by one operator
                    print about 1200 per hour. Even this comparison does not convey a complete idea
                    of the enormously increased productiveness of the cylinder machine over that of
                    the press. By the latter, the largest sheet practically that could be printed
                    was double demy, 23 × 35 inches, the superficies of which is 8 ∙5 square inches;
                    single-cylinder machines are now made to print eight sheet double crown, the
                    superficies of which is 4800 square inches. These sheets being afterwar&lt;ls
                    cut up into double crown sheets, the productiveness of the machine to the press
                    would be, per hour, about 8000 to 250.</p>
                <p>As already mentioned, a self-acting feeding apparatus has been invented for
                    supplying single sheets to cylinder machines. The pile of paper is laid on a
                    feeding board or table, between gauges. A pneumatic tube takes up one sheet at a
                    time; it is then run down tapes to a point at which india-rubber fingers bring
                    it to the side lay of the machine, and it is printed with perfect accuracy of
                    register. Once started, the machine works automatically, and the services of
                    both layer-on and taker-off are dispensed with.</p>
                <p>We may now describe that class of machines by which the paper is printed on both
                    sides, or perfected, during one passage through the machine. The Applegath and
                    Cowper or ordinary machine has two impression cylinders, having a continuous
                    rotary motion towards each other. The frame is necessarily long, usually about
                    15 feet, and the width of the machine about 5 feet, these dimensions depending
                    upon the size of the sheet to be printed. The table or carriage is double,
                    containing two beds for the two formes of type, to impress the two sides of the
                    paper, and two distributing tables for the ink. At each end is a complete roller
                    apparatus, consisting of duct, duct roller, vibrator, and wavers. Close to the
                    large cylinders on each side are the inking rollers. The table has a
                    reciprocating motion, as in a single-cylinder machine. The distinctive feature
                    is the ingenious manner in which the sheets are printed first on one side and
                    then on the other. This is effected by carrying them over cylinders and drums by
                    means of tapes. The pile of sheets stands on a high table placed at one end. The
                    sheet is fed into the apparatus and led round an entry drain; thence it is
                    carried round the large right-hand impressing cylinder, and underneath this, on
                    the table, which is moving at the same speed as the cylinder, is the inner forme
                    properly inked. The paper thus receives an impression on one side. It is next
                    led up to the right-hand drum, which it passes over, the printed side of the
                    sheet being then downwards. Continuing, it is brought under the second or
                    left-hand drum and on to the left-hand impression cylinder, which it passes with
                    the printed side still downwards, or next to the cylinder, exposing the other
                    side to the type of the outer forme on the table underneath. The drams have thus
                    reversed the position of the paper: the side which was outside when passing the
                    first forme is inside when passing the second forme, which accordingly prints
                    the sheet on the opposite or blank side. The sheet is finally run out by the
                    tapes and delivered in the space between the large cylinders, seized by a
                    taking-off boy, and deposited <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n732/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0732-0707"/> on a table or taking-off board. This press is
                    known as the <hi rend="italic">dropbar perfecting machine,</hi> owing to a
                    peculiarity of the arrangement by which the paper is conveyed into the tapes. In
                    front of the feeding table is a rod or bar of steel, along which are fitted
                    several metal disks or bosses about half an inch thicker than the bar itself.
                    These can be shifted, by means of small screws, to any position along the rod to
                    suit the size of the sheet to be printed. To this bar is fixed a short arm, with
                    a pulley at the end, which works round a wheel attached to a cam with a dip.
                    Every time the pulley drops into the dip, the bar descends upon the paper, which
                    is laid to marks at the front; and the bar, possessing a rotary motion from the
                    tapes, runs the sheet between a roller and a small drum on to the inner forme
                    cylinder, as already stated. Other kinds of machines are distinguished as the
                    web, having a web or a series of broad tapes which lie on the laying-on board
                    and are fastened to a small drum underneath it. The drum has a series of small
                    cogs, and when it is forced forward it moves the web or tapes in the same
                    direction. The sheet, having been laid to a back mark on the tapes, is propelled
                    between two revolving rollers and thus taken into the machine.</p>
                <p>There are several distinct types of perfecting presses in use, but we can only
                    notice one or two. In the Anglo-French machine, which was in-vented in England
                    but improved in France, grippers are used instead of tapes and the intermediate
                    drums for conveying the sheet from one cylinder to the other. The cylinders are
                    on a level, but alternately rise and fall, allowing the sheet to clear the
                    forme. Quite recently a singlecylinder perfecting press has been invented. The
                    cylinder is double the usual size and has two printing surfaces and a double set
                    of grippers. Two sheets are printed at each revolution, the first being the
                    white paper and the second the partly printed sheet which has immediately
                    preceded it. The sheet is fed in as to an ordinary single side press, printed on
                    one side, taken off, reversed, again gripped, and perfected, when it is
                    automatically delivered on the table.</p>
                <p>It has been mentioned that</p>
                <p>250 sheets or a <hi rend="italic">token</hi> per hour, printed on one side only,
                    represent the work of two men at the hand-press. Two youths at a perfecting
                    machine will complete from 1200 to 2000 copies per hour, equal to 4000
                    impressions on one side only,—an increase of about sixteen fold. This, however,
                    does not represent the whole of the superiority of these machines. Sheets much
                    larger than double crown (20 × 30 inches) can hardly be worked at a press; the
                    machine perfects a sheet nearly double this size—50 × 40 or four royal, so that
                    the proportionate product of the machine to the press is about as 32 to 1.</p>
                <p>Perfecting machines are not so much used for book-work as formerly. The
                    single-cylinder machine has been brought to such perfection, and is so superior
                    in its inking arrangements, that printers prefer it. In America nearly all
                    machines are one-sided. For newspapers of limited circulation, however, the
                    perfecting machine is well adapted. Complete copies of a journal are produced as
                    soon as the machine is started; extra copies can be worked off while newsagents
                    are waiting; and a number of sheets need not be printed off on one side to be
                    completed when a sudden demand arises.</p>
                <p>Fig. 13 shows a new form of French perfecting machine for printing book - work,
                    the Marinoni com bined perfecting and duplex single-cylinder machine. The
                    improvement in this machine over the perfecting two-cylinder machine described
                    above consists in the alteration of some mechanical parts, so that the same
                    machine can be used for printing sheets either on both sides or on one side
                    only. It therefore serves the purpose of two single - cylinder machines or of
                    one perfecting machine, the change from one to the other being very simple.</p>
                <p>The rotary press differs essentially from the cylinder machine. In the former the
                    printing surface and the impressing surface both rotate continuously, and the
                    paper,—not cut up into single sheets, but carried between the two cylinders in a
                    roll or web, like a ribbon, —receives successively an impression on each side,
                    after which it is cut up into sheets of the proper size and folded as it is run
                    out, the sheets being deposited on a table ready for removal.</p>
                <p>As representative of this class of machines we may take the Walter press, whose
                    mechanical arrangement is shown in fig. 14. The paper to be printed from, a
                    continuous web about 8000 yards in length, is wound on a small roller at <hi
                    rend="italic">P.</hi> It is passed over a tension roller, and then over the
                    damping cylinders <hi rend="italic">TV, TV,</hi> and thoroughly wetted on both
                    sides. The damping cylinders are hollow, and contain sponges from which the
                    water is distributed by centrifugal force, the outside of the cylinder being
                    covered with <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n733/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0733-0708"/> blankets. The paper next passes on to the
                    printing cylinders <hi rend="italic">T, T',</hi> on which the printing
                    surface—not composed of movable types but of stereo plates—is fixed, and to the
                    impression cylinders <hi rend="italic">I, Ï.</hi> The printing cylinders contain
                    each the plate in curvilinear shape, constituting the forme for one side of the
                    paper. The web is led between the printing and the impression cylinders, as
                    shown by the dotted line. After being printed on one side by <hi rend="italic"
                    >T,</hi> it travels round <hi rend="italic">I</hi> and receives an impression on
                    the other side from <hi rend="italic">T',</hi> thus being “perfected.” It then
                    passes on to the cutting cylinders <hi rend="italic">K, K,</hi> one of which has
                    a serrated knife, which enters the paper, and on the application of tension
                    divides the web, causing the peculiar saw-like edge seen in copies of journals
                    printed on rotary machines. The paper is next carried in over tapes to the point
                    where the complete severance takes place. Soon after they encounter a pendulous
                    frame, which delivers them in two piles on to the tables <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi>, <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> whence they are removed. There is an ink
                    supply trough <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which is connected with the distributing
                    rollers by a revolving metal roller <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> The distributing

                <p>The average rate of speed of the Walter press is 12,000 per hour, the sheets
                    being printed on both sides. In this apparatus everything is automatic: there is
                    self-feeding and self-delivery, the web of paper at one end being transformed
                    into properly printed single sheets at the other. The machine requires only one
                    man to superintend its general working, including the replacing of the web when
                    printed and the removal of the successive piles of sheets. In respect of speed,
                    if the perfecting machine is to the hand-press as 32 to 1, the rotary will be to
                    the hand-press as 96 to 1. The Walter press, requiring a space of only about 14
                    feet by 5, is not more remarkable for its speed and economy than for its
                    simplicity of construction and its compactness. And the same remark applies to
                    several other machines, such as the Victory, the Hoe, and the Prestonian, which
                    have since come into use. Their general appearance is that of a collection of
                    small cylinders or rollers, through which the paper seems to fly at railway
                    speed, issuing forth in two descending torrents of sheets accurately cut into
                    lengths. Without such machinery the prodigious issues of some of the morning
                    journals would not be possible. One daily paper averages a circulation of more
                    than a quarter of a million. This enormous number of sheets are printed in about
                    four hours, owing to the type matter being stereotyped and placed on several
                    presses.</p>
                <p>Printing from webs of paper instead of single sheets will probably be adopted in
                    the future for all newspapers and even books of large circulation. Hand-feeding
                    is limited by the ability of the operator to lay the sheets on the feeding-board
                    with the necessary accuracy. One chief obstacle to the more general adoption of
                    rotary printing is the expense of stereotyping the type formes. Although a
                    machine has been constructed in which movable types can be placed round the
                    periphery of an impressing cylinder, it cannot compete with the Walter and other
                    presses using stereo plates. The problem of printing directly from flat formes
                    of ordinary types, as well as from stereotypes, with paper supplied in the roll,
                    is one that may be commended to engineers. The saving in stereotyping in many
                    cases would be very considerable; but, even where this is not an object, the
                    readiness and ease with which the type could be manipulated would ensure for
                    such an apparatus admission into offices where the large rotaries of the present
                    day are inadmissible. It would also enable illustrated journals to be printed
                    from the web. The pictures introduced into some of our daily journals are very
                    rude when compared with those in periodicals printed on flatbed machines. This
                    is owing partly to the distortion that arises when the cast from a flat block is
                    accommodated to a curved surface, partly to the fact that stereotyping does not
                    give the fine and delicate reproduction that electrotyping supplies, and partly
                    to the imperfect inking powers of the machines. Quite recently a plan has been
                    patented whereby curved electrotypes of pictures can be fastened to blank or
                    depressed portions of an ordinary curved stereo plate; but the method is not
                    always practicable. With a flat-bed machine the forme to be printed from might
                    be of a composite kind,—partly movable types, partly stereotype, and partly
                    electrotype. One difficulty of constructing a web printing machine with a flat
                    bed is that of turning the sheet so that it may be printed almost simultaneously
                    on both sides. It would have to be reversed by the continued rotary movement of
                    the cylinder. This, however, is quite within the limits of practicability, and
                    experiments are now being made to devise a machine with this feature.</p>
                <p>For about three centuries after the invention of printing the formes were inked
                    by leather balls. When machine presses were introduced, their earliest inventor
                    tried to use cylinders covered with leather; but the plan was most
                    unsatisfactory, until a subsequent inventor adopted a composition of glue and
                    treacle, which was cast into cylinders having an inner “stock” of metal or wood.
                    For about half a century this composition was used exclusively for both hand and
                    machine presses. Since then glycerin has been introduced for roller making.
                    Hansard’s recipe, in use when the 8th edition of the present work was issued,
                    was—glue 4 parts, treacle 12 parts, Paris white 1 part. But a much better
                    composition is now formed of glue 10 parts, sugar 10 parts, and glycerin 12
                    parts. The glycerin has the property of always keeping the roller moist and
                    soft, while the tendency of glue and treacle is to dry and harden. A glycerin
                    roller lasts much longer than one of glue and treacle.</p>
                <p>Printing ink has peculiar qualities. It is required to change from the soft
                    adhesive state in which it is applied to the type to that of a perfectly hard
                    and dry substance after being transferred to the paper. This change of condition
                    must be under control, and when air is excluded the ink should keep in good
                    order any length of time. During its application to the type its solidification
                    should be as slow as possible, and unaccompanied by the emission of any
                    unpleasant or deleterious odour. It ought not to affect the rollers, and, having
                    been applied to the paper, its action should be confined to a very slight
                    penetration, just sufficient to prevent its detachment without injuring the
                    surface of the paper. It must dry into a hard, inodorous, and unalterable solid.
                    The ingredients of ink are burnt linseed or other oil, resin, and occasionally
                    soap, with various colouring matters; that for black ink is usually lamp black,
                    but charcoal and other cheaper materials are occasionally introduced. Ink is
                    removed from types and blocks by detergents, such as potash and pearl ash;
                    benzine is also well adapted for the purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Colour Printing.</hi></p>
                <p>The apparatus previously described is intended for monochrome printing, whatever
                    be the shade of the ink. When two colours or more have to be printed in one
                    composition, there must be a separate type forme or separate engraving, and a
                    separate printing, for each. Many attempts have been made to print several
                    colours simultaneously by dividing the trough or manipulating the rollers. All
                    these have been more or less unsuccessful, with the exception of a press
                    invented by Mr W. Conisbee, which prints from type formes in two colours. In
                    construction it is somewhat similar to the ordinary single-cylinder machine, but
                    is provided with two sets of inking apparatus, including ductor, wavers, and
                    inkers, each of which acts totally independent of the rest. The cylinder is
                    placed in the centre of the machine and makes two continuous revolutions, giving
                    an impression for each colour. There are two type formes, each containing only
                    the lines to be worked in one of the colours. These are in two beds adjoining
                    one another, and, the circumference of the cylinder being equal to the length of
                    one bed, one colour is printed by the first revolution and the other by the
                    second. The sheet is thus printed twice without being released from the
                    grippers, whereby perfect register is ensured. The speed is slow, averaging 300
                    to 400 complete impressions per hour.</p>
                <p>The method by which the beautiful coloured supplements issued occasionally with
                    illustrated newspapers are printed may be slightly referred to. A copy of the
                    artist’s painting is first of all made, on a scale regulated by the size of the
                    reproduction. This being supplied to the engraver, an outline or key block is
                    made and proofs pulled. It is now necessary to determine the tones of colour to
                    be used,—a process demanding great experience. The key block will, if printed
                    first, afford a guide for the registration of the subsequent printings;
                    sometimes, however, that is reserved for a later stage. The colours on which the
                    subsequent printings are done must be of a transparent nature. The blocks are
                    sometimes produced by the typographic etching process, which gives a softness,
                    delicacy, and variety unattainable by the graver. The blending of the colours is
                    the most delicate task the printer has to undertake. A large picture is often
                    printed in ten or more workings, some of them in their turn intensifying and
                    bringing previous colour workings into stronger relief, others giving shape and
                    form to the picture. Almost to the end of the process, however, the picture will
                    want vitality; its outlines will be hard and bare, or vague and undefined,
                    according to the sequence of the colours. Another working may give grey tones
                    where wanted, and may increase the depth and transparency of various parts. A
                    deep flesh working may have a marked effect on the development; and, near the
                    close of the series, if the entire colouring is found to be too warm, it may be
                    corrected by over-printing very nearly the whole subject. Chromo-typography has
                    undoubtedly made great strides during the past twenty years, its best results
                    being shown in the coloured prints for illustrated journals. For the production
                    of pictures for commercial and artistic purposes chromo-lithography is generally
                    resorted to on account of its relative economy. In lithography for typographic
                    purposes the line has to be cut and the space on both sides removed so as to
                    leave the line alone to be charged with the ink, or the white space has to be
                    etched away with an acid. The printing of isolated points too is easily effected
                    from a stone, whereas most minute labour is necessary to engrave them.
                    Typographic etching has here, however, been of great assistance. The differences
                    of printing surface caused by the colours are met and overcome by the
                    lithographic stone with great facility, even when the spaces are largest and
                    most uneven; it is quite the contrary in regard to typography, wherein the work
                    has to be charged with ink to a greater extent according to its size, and the
                    quantity <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n734/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0734-0709"/> of ink requisite varies with the fineness of the
                    strokes and of their distance apart. Owing to this we see in most letter-press
                    polychromatic prints a deficiency of transparency, of half-tints, of depth of
                    ground, and of general harmony. Even if it were possible to make chromo -
                    typography as easy as chromo - lithography, there would still be the obstacle of
                    its very much greater cost, owing to the expense of the engraving and of the
                    casts from the key block. In chromo-lithography the designer can repeat the
                    designs for the different stones by a process that costs almost nothing. Also in
                    the process of multiplying the blocks the deviation in the register of the
                    successive colours is practically unavoidable. In lithography the surface to be
                    printed is nearly level; hence the sheet is not shifted and twisted or stretched
                    in places, as it is in typography, owing to the alternate closeness and absence
                    of contact between the sheets and the raised and depressed surface of the block.
                    Whatever success the letter-press method has attained of late is owing to the
                    invention of electrotyping and process blocks, and to the improvement of
                    machinery. For to print these pictures enormous strength and rigidity, and the
                    most perfect arrangements for securing register, are absolutely essential.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Recent Changes.</hi></p>
                <p>We will now give a cursory glance at the changes that have been effected during
                    the last twenty-five years in the processes and the products of the art of
                    printing. That these have been of a most drastic kind may be gathered from a
                    comparison of the appliances figured and described in the 8th or the previous
                    editions of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi> with those
                    referred to above. The hand-press has been almost completely superseded by the
                    machine press. Cylindrical impression has displaced platen impression, and the
                    finest book-work and woodcut work are done on a cylinder press. In book-work,
                    indeed, other significant changes have taken place. Whereas formerly it was
                    deemed essential that the paper should be damped before printing, in order to
                    get a delicate and perfect impression, some of the finest books and periodicals
                    are now printed on dry paper, highly calendered, even the illustrated journals
                    and some of the evening papers being so worked. Then, it was thought necessary
                    for the safety of the type to interpose a thick soft blanket between it and the
                    pressing surface, whether cylinder or platen; now, it is found equally safe, and
                    far more conducive to a good impression, to make the packing as thin and hard as
                    possible. Then, fine woodcuts were “brought up” by the use of many “overlays”
                    and “underlays” to correct inequalities in the surface of the blocks and
                    emphasize some of the parts; now, although the art of “making ready’’ has been
                    brought to great perfection, the fewer and thinner the overlays employed the
                    better. And it may not be irrelevant to point out that the printing of woodcuts
                    has improved in the same degree as the engraving of them.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, however, the most remarkable change is that made in newspaper printing.
                    The highest achievement mentioned in the article “Printing” in the 8th edition
                    of this work was the six-cylinder Hoe machine. The makers of that apparatus
                    subsequently contrived machines of eight and ten cylinders. But they have now
                    been wholly superseded by the rotary presses on the Walter principle. The hand
                    feeding-in of single sheets is entirely done away with, and all newspapers of
                    considerable circulation are printed from long reels of paper, uncut, as
                    originally made at the paper-mill. The maximum number of copies which a machine
                    of this class would print with ten feeding attendants and four taking away
                    attendants would be 8000 an hour. For folding the 8000 printed copies five
                    folding machines and at least two attendants would be required to keep pace with
                    the printing machines. Thus nineteen men were required to print and fold 8000
                    copies per hour with the best machines as late as 1870. With a rotary machine
                    doing the same or a larger quantity of work only two men are required. The cost
                    for printing and folding 1000 copies by the Hoe machine was estimated at 1s.
                    4d., while with the rotary it is only about 2d. Hence the saving of wages to a
                    newspaper issuing 200,000 copies a day on 313 working days would be nearly £3700
                    in a year. This, in connexion with improvements in paper, or rather the
                    discovery of cheaper materials, bringing the price of “news” down to about 2d.
                    per lb—one quarter of its price a very few years ago—accounts for much of the
                    enterprise of modern journalism. For some time after the abolition of the paper
                    duty there was a loss on the circulation of a large-sized penny journal; now
                    there is a considerable gain. Lately rotary presses for small jobbing work have
                    been constructed; and before long the rotary principle will probably be rendered
                    available for illustrated periodicals and fine book-work, printed from webs or
                    reels of paper instead of single sheets. Great improvements have also been made
                    in type-founding, and the Roman and Italic founts now used by English printers
                    are equal to those of any country in the world. It is sometimes said that
                    English <hi rend="italic">éditions de luxe</hi> are not equal to those of the
                    French, and that this is owing to the inferiority of the founders. This is,
                    however, not quite true: some of the best French books are printed from English
                    types or from types cut in the English manner. It is also the fashion to compare
                    modern printed books with those of the Elzevirs and Baskerville. Yet as a matter
                    of fact their best faces have been reproduced with perfect success by modern
                    founders. From a mechanical point of view the impression given by the best
                    machine presses to-day is undoubtedly superior to that of the hand-presses of
                    the 17th and 18th centuries. If modern books suffer in any respect on comparison
                    with those of former times, which are so highly prized by bibliophiles, it is
                    owing to their want of general artistic <hi rend="italic">ensemble,</hi> and not
                    to any deficiency in mechanical execution. The artistic taste of English
                    printers has, however, been greatly raised during the last few years, and a very
                    interesting movement is going on which must produce important results in the
                    future. In 1880 Mr Andrew W. Tuer of London organized the Printers’ Specimen
                    Exchange, a scheme intended to promote the technical education of the working
                    printer. Each contributor to the exchange furnishes periodically a certain fixed
                    number of typographical specimens, all alike, which are collated into sets, and
                    again distributed to the members, each of whom gets a volume, consisting of one
                    copy of the work of each of his fellow-contributors. By this plan they become
                    acquainted with the progress made by their brethren, and good taste and good
                    work are fostered and mutually encouraged. The eighth quarto volume, issued in
                    1887, contains nearly 400 fine specimens of typography by as many different
                    hands. It forms also the best criterion of the character of the jobbing work
                    done at the present day, not only in England but abroad, for the scheme is of an
                    international character. The results of the revival in artistic printing during
                    the last decade are especially noticeable in jobbing work. Much of this
                    improvement is due to the superior material with which the printer is furnished,
                    and especially to the great variety of ornamental types which have been
                    introduced. The specimen books of the principal type-founders are splendid
                    volumes, containing several thousand different faces. The best work of German
                    printers is noteworthy for its studied neatness and attractiveness, tasteful and
                    harmonious arrangement of colour and tint, a characteristic and conscientious
                    attention to details of finish, exact register, and beauty of impression.
                    American work excels in originality of design, brilliancy of colour, and perfect
                    finish. English printers are closely following the best points of each of these
                    schools of typography. There is a distinct leaning at present to the German
                    style, but with little slavish imitation. The distinctness of English typography
                    is maintained, while the beautiful German combination borders, produced with
                    such profusion of late, are judiciously utilized, often in conjunction with
                    American type. In the arrangement of colours English printers prefer the quiet
                    harmonious tints of the Germans to the bold striking contrasts of the
                    Americans.</p>
                <p>The vast extent of the operations of the printing fraternity at the present day
                    is in remarkable contrast to those of the 15th century, when the making of books
                    was an art like the sculpture of statues or the designing of buildings. Now,
                    printing is a manufacture in which large capital and the greatest division of
                    labour are essential. The old printers were almost entirely independent of other
                    craftsmen. From the casting of the type to the mixing of the ink they did nearly
                    everything for themselves. Gradually the different departments of the art were
                    constituted separate and recognized trades. The type-founder was probably the
                    first to secede from the concern; then printers delegated to others the making
                    of presses; afterwards the ink and the rollers found separate and distinct
                    manufacturers; and there arose a class of persons who, though belonging to other
                    trades, made printing appliances a specialty, such as printers’ smiths,
                    printers’ joiners, and printers’ engineers. Subdivision again has taken place in
                    regard to the operations which chiefly appertain to printing. The same man was
                    formerly able to set up and print off the types, to fold the sheets perhaps, and
                    even to make them up into books. The operative printer has now become either a
                    pressman or a compositor. If he is of the first denomination, he may be classed
                    according as he works at press or machine. If he is a machinist, he may
                    superintend or be a “minder,” or he may be a layer-on or a taker-off of the
                    sheets. If he is a minder, he may understand only book machines or only news
                    machines; he may know all about platens and little about cylinders; or of
                    cylinders he may know only one kind. Entirely novel machines create a new class
                    of artisans. There are men perfectly competent to manage a Walter press who are
                    ignorant how to work two-colour or fine book-work machines. In the compositor’s
                    department division of labour is carried out to a still minuter degree. An
                    old-fashioned printer would set up indifferently a placard, a title-page, or a
                    book. At the present day we have jobbing hands, book hands, and news hands, the
                    word “hand” suggesting the factory-like nature of the business. There are
                    jobbing hands who confine themselves to posters, and know little about general
                    work even in this department. Book hands comprise those who set up the titles
                    and those who set up the body of the work. Of these latter again, while one man
                    composes, another, the “maker-up,” arranges the pages. Even the art of fitting
                    up the furniture or “dressing the chase” is given to the “quoin - drawer
                    overseer.” News hands include advertisement hands and general hands. Some men
                    work by day, others altogether by night; some do general <pb break="no"

                    others make up the galleys; others “prove” them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Old Style Printing.</hi></p>
                <p>Within the last few years there has been an interesting revival of the old style
                    of book printing. It owes its origin to Mr Whittingham of the Chiswick Press,
                    who in 1843 was desirous of printing in appropriate type a work of fiction the
                    diction of which was supposed to be that of the reign of Charles II. As the
                    original “old face” matrices of the first Caslon had been preserved, a fount was
                    cast from them, and on getting a proof with good ink, on good paper, from a
                    modern press the impression was found to be far superior to specimens printed
                    from the original fount. Since then the demand for old-faced characters has
                    steadily increased, and all founders now supply imitations of the old types.
                    Comparing the old face and the modern characters, the latter are more regular in
                    size, lining, setting, and colour,—using these words in the technical sense of
                    the founder; they have finer strokes and serifs, and produce in the page a more
                    regular and sparkling general effect. At the same time it may be conceded that
                    legibility has been to a certain extent sacrificed to beauty and general effect.
                    About 1882 an eminent French printer made a number of experiments to ascertain
                    what it is that constitutes legibility in type, and found that people read with
                    less fatigue according as the letters—(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) are rounder,
                    (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) are more equal in thickness, (c) have shorter
                    upstrokes, (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) are dissimilar to each other, and (<hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi>) are well proportioned to their own body. Drawings of
                    letters from old books were visible and legible at a distance at which modern
                    letters could not be distinguished. The revival has also brought about the
                    re-introduction of antique head-pieces and tail-pieces, vignettes, and initial
                    letters, which have been reproduced from old books by photography and
                    typo-etching. For this kind of printing white paper has given place to toned, of
                    a straw tint, which is often more agreeable to the eyes than the excessively
                    bleached paper which was hitherto the fashion. Also hand-made instead of
                    machine-made paper has to a large extent come into vogue. Its characteristic is
                    the “deckle edge ”, which distinguishes it from the clean-cut edge of machine
                    papers, and is highly prized by some bibliophiles. When extreme verisimilitude
                    is required, this kind of printing is done on the blank leaves of real old
                    books, some of which have been ruthlessly destroyed for this modern craze. On
                    the whole, however, the revival of old style printing has been beneficial: it
                    has encouraged printers to study the more artistic attributes of the productions
                    of the great printers of the past, and has educated the public taste by
                    presenting them with examples of the best kind of book-making.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Printing Establishment.</hi></p>
                <p>A large book-printing establishment contains many distinct departments, some of
                    which have not been previously referred to and may here be summarily mentioned.
                    The reading department, sometimes called the <hi rend="italic">closet,</hi>
                    consists of a number of small apartments, each furnished with a desk, a couple
                    of stools, and a shelf for books of reference, and having for its occupants the
                    reader and his reading-boy. There is also the warehouse, where all the printed
                    and unprinted sheets (or “white paper” as it is called, whatever its colour) are
                    stored. Adjacent to this are folding, cutting, hot and cold pressing, drying,
                    and other branches, each employing separate classes of artisans. Another
                    department is the machine-room, where, arranged in long rows with an avenue
                    between, are the various printing machines. The men in this part of the
                    establishment wear cotton vestments, covering all their other apparel, and caps,
                    invariably made of paper, something like clerical birettas. The machine overseer
                    has his box and keeps an account of the produce of each machine. Under him are
                    the persons whose business it is to cut out overlays for the cut or illustrated
                    formes. These men are in their way artists, for to them is attributable much of
                    the beauty and perfection of working of each block that goes through their
                    hands. They have by them three or four prints or “pulls” of the block, and their
                    tools consist of scissors, paste, a sharp knife or two, and perhaps a razor-like
                    blade set in a wooden handle. Their work is to deepen the shadows, raise the
                    lights, lower the edges, and perform a hundred other offices for a block.
                    Standing sentry over each machine is the machine minder; under him are the
                    takers-off and layers-on. The engine-room and boiler-house are close by, and
                    higher up may be the hand-press-room,—provided these appliances are used. Here
                    are the pressmen and their apprentices. There is the storekeeper’s department,
                    fitted up with shelves, racks, and drawers, for the orderly storage of type and
                    materials. The plate-safe or plate-room is the repository of the stereo and
                    electro plates, each plate being kept wrapped up in paper, with a distinctive
                    index number marked thereon. There are also rooms for casting rollers,
                    stereotyping rooms, drying rooms for paper, hydraulic pressing rooms, sinks for
                    washing formes, and lifts for conveying them from one department to another.
                    There will possibly be several composing-rooms, such as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >’stab,</hi> where all the men are paid on established weekly wages, the piece
                    room, where they are paid by results, and the apprentices’ room. There may be
                    rooms where particular jobs are done, especially if weekly periodicals are
                    turned out, and the names of these designate the rooms. At the end of each room
                    is the overseer. It is also a common practice for a number of men to form
                    themselves into a kind of business partnership called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >companionship</hi> or <hi rend="italic">'ship.</hi> All the transactions of the
                    compositor may be with his own <hi rend="italic">clicker,—</hi> the workman who
                    is selected to keep the accounts of the partnership. From him the compositor
                    receives his portion of copy and the necessary directions, and to him he gives
                    the matter when it is composed. At the end of the week he “writes his bill,”
                    delivers it to the clicker, and from the latter receives at pay time the wages
                    he has earned. The clicker gets the matter proved or “pulled” by the
                    proofpuller, who usually does nothing else but pull proofs. He will then send
                    the proof with the copy to the overseer, and the overseer sends it to the
                    reading department to be corrected. The proof, when corrected, is returned
                    through the overseer (who retains the copy) to the clicker, and he gives it to
                    the compositor who set it up. When the type is corrected a revise is pulled,
                    which goes through the same hands to the overseer again; and then it is
                    despatched to the author, editor, or publisher. In a well-ordered composing-room
                    strict silence is enjoined upon the workmen. Among the industrial pursuits there
                    is none more monotonous and more exacting, none demanding more patience,
                    sustained industry, and power of endurance than the compositor’s art. In a large
                    newspaper office the quantity of types picked up in a few hours is marvellous.
                    No better illustration of this could be given than the fact that several recent
                    issues of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> have consisted of three sheets or
                    twenty-four pages, each page comprising six columns. In one of these issues 84⅔
                    of the 144 columns were filled with advertisements, 2559 in number, set in
                    extremely small type; the remaining 59⅓ columns contained articles, reviews,
                    letters, reports, and paragraphs. The total length of the column aggregate was
                    264 feet (62 more than the height of the London Monument). If the matter
                    comprised in the paper, instead of being broken up into columns, had been set in
                    one continuous line it would have reached one mile 950 yards. The number of
                    separate types used in printing this issue was calculated at over two millions,
                    and the quantity of printed matter was reckoned to be equivalent to that
                    contained in two octavo volumes of 480 pages each. The literary and mechanical
                    staff of a first-rate London daily newspaper, excluding casual reporters and
                    unattached writers on various subjects, aggregates about 300 persons.</p>

                    record its progress and describe its products are unrivalled in their excellent
                    mechanical attributes, some equalling the highest class of book-work printing
                    and using paper of the most luxurious description. Their literary character is
                    usually worthy of their mechanical excellence, and they comprise an immense
