                    vineclad hills, 60 miles south-west of Coblentz and 86 miles south of Cologne.
                    It lies in the midst of a carefully cultivated and fertile plain, the rich
                    vegetation of which forms a pleasing setting to its red sandstone walls and
                    venerable towers. Most of the old streets of the town are quaint and irregular;
                    but much of the space enclosed within the circuits of the walls is now occupied
                    by orchards and gardens. The population of Treves in 1885 was 26,125,
                    five-sixths of whom were Roman Catholics. Their chief occupations are
                    fruit-growing and vine-dressing; the industries of the place, including the
                    manufacture of cotton and linen, dyeing, and tanning, are not very extensive. A
                    specialty of Treves is the preparation of stones for Gothic churches, which are
                    sent off ready to be at once placed in position. A river traffic is carried on
                    in wine, cattle, and wood.</p>
                <p>Treves claims to be the oldest town in Germany, and it contains more important
                    Roman remains than any other place in northern Europe. The most remarkable of
                    these is the Porta Nigra, a huge fortified gateway, 115 feet long, 70 to 95 feet
                    high, and 30 feet deep. It is formed of uncemented blocks of sandstone, held
                    together by clamps of iron, and now blackened with time; the details are very
                    rude. Opinions vary widely as to the date of its erection, but recent
                    authorities refer it to the 1st century of the Christian era. During the Middle
                    Ages the structure was converted into two churches, one above the other; all
                    additions have, however, now been removed, except the apse at the east end. The
                    basilica, long used as the archiepiscopal palace and now consecrated as a
                    Protestant church, probably dates from the reign of Constantine. The so-called
                    Roman baths are in all probability the relics of an extensive imperial palace.
                    Just outside the town are the remains of an amphitheatre, capable of
                    accommodating 30,000 spectators, where Constantine caused several thousand
                    Franks and Bructeri to be butchered for the public amusement. Perhaps the oldest
                    Roman remains in Treves are some of the piers of the bridge over the Moselle,
                    dating from about 28 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> This bridge, which is at one
                    corner of modern Treves, lay near the middle of the much more extensive Roman
                    city. There are also numerous Roman antiquities in the neighbourhood of Treves,
                    the most important of which are the Igel column, a sepulchral monument of the 2d
                    century, and the mosaic pavements at Nennig and Fliessem.</p>
                <p>Another group of interesting buildings belongs to the second period of prosperity
                    enjoyed by Treves under the rule of its mediaeval prelates. The cathedral,
                    described by Lübke as the most important example of pre-Carlovingian building in
                    Germany, mirrors the entire history of the town. Its kernel consists of part of
                    a Roman basilica of the 4th century, which seems to have been converted into a
                    Christian church at a very early period. It was restored by Bishop Nicetius
                    about 550, and in the 11th and 12th centuries it was again restored and greatly
                    extended by Archbishop Poppo and his successors, who added an apse at each end
                    and left it substantially in its present form. The cathedral is connected by
                    beautiful cloisters of the 13th century with the circular Liebfrauenkirche, one
                    of the most interesting early Gothic churches in Germany (1227-43), catching up
                    the architectural thread at the point dropped by the cathedral. Among the
                    treasures of the latter is the “holy coat of Treves,” believed by the devout to
                    be the seamless garment worn by our Saviour at the crucifixion, and said to have
                    been presented to the town by the empress Helena, the central figure in Treveran
                    Christian legend. Its exhibition in 1844 attracted a million and a half of
                    pilgrims to Treves. According to recent authorities, the earliest churches in
                    Treves were those of Sts Eucharius, Maximin, Matthew, and Paul, all without the
                    walls, now rebuilt or converted to secular purposes. Of the modern buildings
                    none call for special remark. The town library contains about 100,000 volumes,
                    including several valuable specimens of early printing. Its greatest treasure is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Codex Aureus,</hi> a manuscript of the Gospels presented
                    to the abbey of St Maximin by Ada, sister of Charlemagne. The same building also
                    contains an interesting collection of Roman and mediaeval antiquities.</p>
                <p>A mediaeval legend, preserved in an inscription on the old Rothes Haus inn,
                    places the foundation of Treves 1300 years before that of Rome, and ascribes it
                    to Thebetas, son of Ninus, king of Assyria. But, fable apart, we must still
                    allow that Treves has good claim to call itself the oldest town in Germany. It
                    is a little doubtful whether the Treviri were of Teutonic or Celtic stock. St
                    Jerome records that the language of the Treviri of the 4th century resembled
                    that of the Gauls of Asia; but, even if we admit this evidence as conclusive of
                    their Celtic origin, we must recognize the fact that they were Celts who were
                    long under Teutonic influence. Their authentic history begins with the story of
                    their subjection by Julius Caesar (56 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> who
                    describes them as a warlike race, with the best cavalry in Gaul. The Roman town,
                    <hi rend="italic">Colonia Augusta Trevirorum</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Treverorum),</hi> was probably founded by the emperor Claudius, and rapidly
                    obtained a wealth and importance which justified the poet Ausonius (4th century)
                    in describing it as the second metropolis of the empire, or “Rome beyond the
                    Alps.” It became the capital of Belgica Prima, and during the 4th century was a
                    favourite residence of Constantine and other Roman emperors. Most of the palaces
                    and public buildings, of which the remains are still extant, were built at this
                    period, while the surrounding hills were covered with villas. Treves was laid in
                    ruins by Attila in 451, and about 465 was permanently taken possession of by the
                    Franks. It was included in the kingdom of Austrasia, and became a German city in
                    870. Like its prototype Rome, it attained a second era of prosperity and
                    importance as an ecclesiastical capital (see below), and in the Middle Ages the
                    “Sancta Civitas Trevirorum” swarmed with “religious” of all kinds and grades.
                    Unlike most of the German episcopal cities, however, it did not succeed in
                    shaking off the ecclesiastical yoke, nor did it attain, except transitorily, the
                    position of a free imperial city. Wars and sieges occasionally checked but did
                    not stop its growth. Art and science were sedulously fostered in the monastic
                    schools, and a university, founded in 1473, existed down to 1798. The importance
                    of Treves departed with the overthrow of the ecclesiastical principality. In
                    1786 the last elector shifted his residence to Coblentz, and from 1794 to 1814
                    Treves was capital of the French department of the Sarre. Since the latter date
                    it has belonged to Prussia.</p>
                <p>The archbishopric and ecclesiastical electorate of Treves, bounded by Nassau,
                    Cologne, Luxemburg, Lorraine, the Rhenish Palatinate, Hesse-Rheinfels, and
                    Katzenelnbogen, had an area of about 3200 square miles and a population of
                    250,000 to 300,000. Its suffragan bishops were those of Metz, Tout, and Verdun,
                    and after 1777 also those of Nancy and St Dié. As elector of the German empire
                    the archbishop took the second place, and bore the style of arch-chancellor of
                    Gaul or Burgundy. Legend places the foundation of the bishopric of Treves in the
                    1st century of the Christian era, but the first bishop known to history is
                    Agricius, who flourished about 314. The see appears as an archbishopric in the
                    9th century, and in the Middle Ages the archbishops attained considerable
                    temporal power. Among the most prominent were Baldwin of Luxemburg (1307- 1354),
                    brother of the emperor Henry VII., who may be regarded as the founder of the
                    territorial greatness of the see, and Richard von Greiffenklau (1511-1531), who
                    distinguished himself by his successful opposition to the Reformation. The last
                    archbishop was Clemens Wenceslaus (1768-1802) of Saxony. The part of the
                    archbishopric on the left bank of the Rhine was taken by France in 1801, and the
                    rest was secularized in favour of the prince of Nassau-Weilburg in 1803. After
                    the fall of Napoleon the archbishopric was incorporated with Prussia. A new
                    bishopric of Treves was instituted in 1821, the boundaries of which are almost
                    conterminous with those of the old archbishopric; the bishop is a suffragan to
                    the archbishop of Cologne.</p>
