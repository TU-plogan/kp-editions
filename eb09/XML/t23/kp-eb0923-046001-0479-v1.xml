                <p><label type="entry">TORTOISESHELL</label>. The tortoiseshell of commerce consists
                    of the epidermic plates of the hawksbil1 turtle, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Caretta</hi><hi rend="italic">imbricata.</hi> The plates of the back or
                    carapace, technically called the head, are 13 in number, 5 occupying the centre,
                    flanked by 4 on each side. These overlap each other to the extent of one-third
                    of their whole size, and hence they attain a large size, reaching in the largest
                    to 8 inches by 13 inches, and weighing as much as 9 ounces. The carapace has
                    also 24 marginal pieces, called hoofs or claws, forming a serrated edge round
                    it; but these, with the plates of the plastron, or belly, are of inferior value.
                    The plates of tortoiseshell consist of horny matter, but they are harder, more
                    brittle, and less fibrous than ordinary horn. Their value depends on the rich
                    mottled colours they display—a warm translucent yellow, dashed and spotted with
                    rich brown tints—and on the high polish they take and retain. The finest
                    tortoiseshell is obtained from the Eastern Archipelago, particularly from the
                    east coast of Celebes to New Guinea; but the creature is found and tortoiseshell
                    obtained from all tropical coasts, large supplies coming from the West Indian
                    Islands and Brazil.</p>
                <p>Tortoiseshell is worked precisely as horn; but, owing to the high value of the
                    material, care is taken to prevent any waste in its working. The plates, as
                    separated by heat from the bony skeleton, are keeled, curved, and irregular in
                    form. They are first flattened by heat and pressure, and superficial
                    inequalities are rasped away. Being harder and more brittle than horn,
                    tortoiseshell requires careful treatment in moulding it into any form, and as
                    high heat tends to darken and obscure the material it is treated at as low a
                    heat as practicable. For many purposes it is necessary to increase the thickness
                    or to add to the superficial size of tortoiseshell, and this is readily done by
                    careful cleaning and rasping of the surfaces to be united, softening the plates
                    in boiling water or sometimes by dry heat, and then pressing them tightly
                    together by means of heated pincers or a vice. The heat softens and liquefies a
                    superficial film of the horny material, and that with the pressure effects a
                    perfect union of the surfaces brought together. Heat and pressure are also
                    employed to mould the substance into boxes and the numerous artificial forms
                    into which it is made up.</p>
                <p>Tortoiseshell has been a prized ornamental material from very early times. It was
                    one of the highly esteemed treasures of the far East brought to ancient Rome by
                    way of Egypt, and it was eagerly sought by wealthy Romans as a veneer for their
                    rich furniture. In modern times it is most characteristically used in the
                    elaborate inlaying of cabinet work known as buhl furniture. It is also employed
                    as a veneer for small boxes and frames. It is cut into combs, moulded into
                    snuffboxes and other small boxes, formed into knife-handles, and worked up into
                    many other similar minor articles. The plates from certain other tortoises,
                    known commercially as turtle-shell, possess a certain industrial value, but they
                    are either opaque or soft and leathery, and cannot be mistaken for
                    tortoiseshell. A close imitation of tortoiseshell can be made by staining
                    translucent horn. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Comb,</hi> vol. vi. p. 178.</p>
