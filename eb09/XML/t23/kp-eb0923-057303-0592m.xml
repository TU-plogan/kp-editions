                <p><label type="entry">TRINIDAD</label>, a West Indian island, lying north-east of
                    Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. lat. and 61° 39' and 62°</p>
                <p>W. long., being the most southern of the chain of islands separating the Atlantic
                    from the Caribbean Sea. Its area is 1754 square miles, or nearly 1,123,000
                    acres. In shape the island is almost rectangular, but from its north-west and
                    south-west corners project two long horns towards Venezuela, enclosing the Gulf
                    of Paria. The north-west horn terminates in several islands, in one of the
                    channels between which (the Boca Grande) lies the small British island of Patos.
                    The general aspect of Trinidad is level. But three parallel ranges, varying from
                    600 to 3100 feet in height and clothed with forests, run from</p>

                <p>east to west. The plains are watered by numerous streams, and the mountains are
                    deeply furrowed by innumerable ravines. The rivers falling into the gulf are
                    somewhat obstructed by shallows, especially the Caroni and the Couva.
                    Geologically, as well as botanically and zoologically, Trinidad differs little
                    from the adjacent mainland, with which at one time it probably was connected.
                    The soil, which is fertile, consists of clay, loam, and alluvial deposits. The
                    Moriche palm and mountain cabbage, as well as the cedar and the balata, are
                    prominent objects. Poisonous and medicinal plants grow everywhere, and the woods
                    contain an inexhaustible supply of timber. There are two mineral springs. The
                    most curious natural feature of the island is the pitch lake<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is vividly described by
                    Charles Kingsley in <hi rend="italic">At Last.</hi></p></note> in La Brea, 90
                    acres in extent, which furnishes an important export. The climate is healthy,
                    the mean temperature being in January 76° Fahr. and in September 79°; it
                    occasionally reaches 90°.</p>
                <p>The population, which numbered 109,638 in 1871, was returned in 1881 at 153,128
                    (83,716 males and 69,412 females), and in 1885 at 171,914. Of these about
                    100,000 are natives of the island, principally of African race, 50,000 are
                    coolies introduced from India (an industrious and prosperous element of the
                    population), while the remainder includes the English and other European
                    settlers. About 2000 coolies are introduced annually. Many French families from
                    other parts of the West Indies settled in Trinidad many years ago, and traces of
                    this and of the Spanish occupation are obvious in laws, municipal arrangements,
                    language, and population. The two principal towns are Port of Spain and San
                    Fernando. The former (34,000 inhabitants), the capital of the island, is built
                    on a gently inclined plain near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n593/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0593-0574"/> and is a fine and safe port. In the town there
                    are two cathedrals (the Roman Catholic and the Anglican), and outside it a
                    botanical garden. San Fernando, about 30 miles southward, with a population of
                    7000, is an important shipping place.</p>
                <p>Of the total area about 300,000 acres are cultivated. The principal productions
                    of the island are sugar and cocoa; coffee is also becoming important. Trinidad
                    has suffered much from the effect of foreign state bounties, especially the
                    export premiums of Germany and France. The sugar production in 1871 was 53,000
                    tons, in 1881 44,000 tons, and in 1885 64,000 tons. The principal exports in
                    1885 were—sugar, 64,000 tons (value £684,675); rum, 72,525 galls. (£7878);
                    molasses, 2,416,761 galls. (£45,835); cocoa, 14,904,840 lbs. (£421,974); coffee,
                    20,270 lbs.; asphalt, 28,505 tons raw and 6731 tons boiled; cocoa-nuts,
                    9,645,700; bitters (Angostura and others) and liquors, 32,240 galls.; the total
                    value was £2,246,664, including £707,421 specie and bullion. The imports in 1885
                    (including bullion and specie) were £2,241,478. Among the principal items are
                    cottons, linens, woollens, and textiles generally (largely from the United
                    Kingdom), £235,895; fish, flour, and provisions (principally from the United
                    States), £270,000; lumber (from Canada), £43,075; rice (half from India),
                    £113,940; hardware and machinery (principally from the United Kingdom),
                    £116,894; gold (principally from Venezuela in transit), £651,398. The sailing
                    vessels entering Trinidad ports in 1885 had a burden of 150,219 tons, the
                    steamers a burden of 385,950 tons. The total public revenue in 1885 was
                    £429,307, of which £240,444 was for customs and excise. The total expenditure
                    was £443,920. There are 145 public schools, of which 61 are Government and 61
                    assisted, with a total attendance of 13,282 scholars. The principal towns are
                    connected by railway lines.</p>
                <p>Trinidad was discovered by Columbus on 31st July 1496. It remained in Spanish
                    possession (although its principal town, San José de Oruña, was burnt by Sir
                    Walter Raleigh in 1595) until 1797, when a British expedition from Martinique
                    caused its capitulation, and it was finally ceded to Great Britain in 1802 by
                    the treaty of Amiens. Its real starting-point as a productive country was in
                    1781, when the Madrid Government began to attract foreign immigrants. Trinidad
                    is still strictly a crown colony of Great Britain. The legislative council
                    includes the governor as president, and six official and eight unofficial
                    members, all appointed by the crown. During the labour crisis caused by
                    emancipation and the subsequent equalization of the British duties on free and
                    slave-grown sugar, the colony was greatly assisted by the skilful administration
                    of Lord Harris, governor from 1846 to 1851.</p>
