                    army by the early gentilician tribes,—the Ramnes, the Tities, and the Luceres.
                    In the historical period the infantry in each legion were commanded by six
                    tribunes, and the number six is probably to be traced to the doubling of the
                    three tribes by the incorporation of the new elements which received the names
                    of <hi rend="italic">Ramnes secundi, Tities secundi, Luceres secundi.</hi> The
                    <hi rend="italic">tribuni celerum</hi> or commanders of the cavalry no longer
                    existed in the later times of the republic, having died out with the decay of
                    the genuine Roman cavalry.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    having exercised authority, when the king was banished, merely by virtue of

                    long as the monarchy lasted these tribunes were doubtless nominated by the
                    commander-inchief, the king; and the nomination passed over on the establishment
                    of the republic to his successors, the consuls. But, as the army increased, the
                    popular assembly insisted on having a voice in the appointments, and from 362
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> six tribunes were annually nominated by popular
                    vote, while in 311 the number was raised to sixteen, and in 207 to twenty-four,
                    at which figure it remained. The tribunes thus elected ranked as magistrates of
                    the Roman people, and were designated <hi rend="italic">tribuni militum a
                    populo,</hi> while those who owed their office to the consuls bore the curious
                    title of <hi rend="italic">tribuni rufuli.</hi> The rights of the assembly
                    passed on to the emperors, and “the military tribunes of Augustus” were still
                    contrasted with those nominated in the camp by the actual commanders. The
                    obscure designation <hi rend="italic">tribunus aerarius,</hi> “tribune of the
                    treasury,” had also, in all probability, a connexion with the early organization
                    of the army. The officer thus designated was at any rate the paymaster of the
                    troops, and the soldier who was defrauded of his pay was allowed to exact it
                    from this tribune by a very summary process. There was still another and
                    important class of tribunes who owed their existence to the army. In the long
                    struggle between the patrician and plebeian sections of the population, the
                    first distinctions in the public service to which the plebeians forced their way
                    were military, and the contest for admission to the consulate was in large part
                    a contest for admission to the. supreme command of the national forces. In 445
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the year in which mixed marriages of patricians
                    and plebeians were for the first time permitted, power was given to the senate
                    (then wholly patrician) of determining from year to year whether consuls or
                    military tribunes with consular authority <hi rend="italic">(tribuni militares
                    consulam potestate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">imperio)</hi> should be appointed.
                    But, even when the senate decided in favour of electing tribunes, no election
                    was valid without the express sanction of the senate superadded to the vote of
                    the centuriate assembly. If it happened to be too invidious for the senate
                    openly to cancel the election, it was possible for the patricians to obtain a
                    decision from the sacred authorities to the effect that some religious practice
                    had not been duly observed, and that in consequence the appointment was invalid.
                    According to tradition, recourse was had to this device at the first election, a
                    plebeian having been successful. Forty-five years elapsed after the creation of
                    the office before any plebeian was permitted to fill it, and it was held by very
                    few down to the time at which it was abolished (367 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>) and the plebeians were fully admitted to the consulate. The number
                    of consular <pb break="no"

                    three to six; there was no year without a patrician, and to the patrician
                    members were probably confined the most highly esteemed duties, those relating
                    to the administration of the law and to religion.</p>
                <p>But by far the most important tribunes who ever existed <hi rend="underline"
                    >in</hi> the Roman community were the tribunes of the commons <hi rend="italic"
                    >(tribuni plebis).</hi> These, as has been explained in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rome</hi> (vol. xx. p. 736 <hi rend="italic">sqj),</hi> were the most
                    characteristic outcome of the long struggle between the two orders, the
                    patrician and the plebeian. When in 494 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the
                    plebeian legionaries met on the Sacred Mount and bound themselves to stand by
                    each other to the end, it was determined that the plebeians should by themselves
                    annually appoint executive officers to stand over against the patrician
                    officers, —two tribunes (the very name commemorated the military nature of the
                    revolt) to confront the two consuls, and two helpers called aediles to balance
                    the two patrician helpers, the quaestors. The name aedile is obviously connected
                    with <hi rend="italic">aedes,</hi> “a temple,” and is an indication of the fact
                    that there was a religious core to the insurrection, just as there was a
                    religious core to the patrician opposition. The temple of Diana and Ceres on the
                    Aventine Hill became for a time to the plebeians what the temple of Saturn was
                    to the patricians,—their official centre and their record office. The insurgent
                    leaders also pressed religion into their service in another way. The masses
                    assembled on the Sacred Mount bound themselves by a solemn oath to regard the
                    persons of their tribunes and aediles as inviolable, and to treat as forfeited
                    to Diana and Ceres the lives and property of those who offered them insult. That
                    this purely plebeian oath was the real ultimate basis of the sanctity which
                    attached to the tribunate during the whole time of its existence can hardly be
                    believed, though this view has had powerful support both in ancient and in
                    recent times. The revolution must have ended in something which was deemed by
                    both the contending bodies to be a binding compact, although the lapse of time
                    has blotted out its terms. The historian Dionysius may have been only
                    technically wrong in supposing that peace was concluded between the two parties
                    by the fetial priests, with the forms adopted by Rome in making treaties with a
                    foreign state. If this were fact, the “sacrosanctity” of the tribunes would be
                    adequately explained, because all such formal <hi rend="italic">foedera</hi>
                    were “sacrosanct.” But, notwithstanding that the plebeians may safely be assumed
                    to have been conscious of having to a large extent sprung from another race than
                    the patricians and their retainers, it is not likely that the feeling was
                    sufficiently strong to permit of the compact taking the form of a treaty between
                    alien powers. Yet there must have been a formal acceptance by the patricians of
                    the plebeian conditions; and most probably the oath which was first sworn by the
                    insurgents was afterwards taken by the whole community, and the “sacrosanctity”
                    of the plebeian officials became a part of the constitution. There must also
                    have been some constitutional definition of the powers of the tribunes. These
                    rested at first on an extension of the power of veto which the republic had
                    introduced. Just as one consul could annul an act or order of his colleague, so
                    a tribune could annul an act or order of a consul, or of any officer inferior to
                    him. There was no doubt a vague understanding that only acts or orders which
                    sinned against the just and established practice of the constitution should be
                    annulled, and then only in cases affecting definite individuals. The tribune was
                    to give his help against illegality in concrete instances. The cases which arose
                    most commonly concerned the administration of justice and the levying of
                    troops.</p>
                <p>Although the revolution of 494 gave the tribunes a foothold in the constitution,
                    it left them with no very definite resources against breaches of compact by the
                    patricians. The traditional history of the tribunate from 494 to 451 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> is obscure, and, so far as details are concerned,
                    nearly worthless; but there is a thread running through it which may well be
                    truth. λVe hear of attacks by patricians on the newly won privileges, even of
                    the assassination of a tribune, and of attempts on the part of the plebeians to
                    bring patrician offenders to justice. The assembled plebeians attempt to set up
                    a criminal jurisdiction for their own assembly parallel to that practised by the
                    older centuriate assembly, in which the nobles possess a preponderating
                    influence. Nay, more, the plebs attempts something like legislation; it passes
                    resolutions which it hopes to force the patrician body to accept as valid. As to
                    details, only a few are worth notice. In the first place, the number of tribunes
                    is raised to ten, how we do not know; but apparently some constitutional
                    recognition of the increase is obtained. Then an alteration is made in the mode
                    of election. As to the original mode, the ancient authorities are hopelessly at
                    variance. Some of them gravely assert that the appointment lay with the assembly
                    of the curiae—the most ancient and certainly the most patrician in Rome, even if
                    we allow the view, which, in spite of great names, is more than doubtful—that
                    the plebeians were members of it at any time when it still possessed political
                    importance. The opinion of Mommsen about the method of election is more
                    plausible than the others. It was in accordance with the Roman spirit of order
                    that the tribunes, in summoning their assemblies, should not ask the plebeians
                    to come <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> as individuals, and vote by heads, but
                    should organize their supporters in bands. The <hi rend="italic">curia</hi> was
                    certainly a territorial district, and the tribunes may have originally used it
                    as the basis of their organization. If tribunes were elected by plebeians massed
                    <hi rend="italic">curiatim,</hi> such a meeting would easily be mistaken in
                    later times for the <hi rend="italic">comitia curiata.</hi> At any rate, a
                    change was introduced in 471 by the Publilian Law of Volero, which directed that
                    the tribunes should be chosen in an assembly organized on the basis of the
                    Servian or local tribe, instead of the <hi rend="italic">curia.</hi> This
                    assembly was the germ of the <hi rend="italic">comitia tributa.</hi> The
                    question by what authority the Law of Volero was sanctioned is difficult to
                    answer. Possibly the law was a mere resolution of the plebeians with which the
                    patricians did not interfere, because they did not consider that the mode of
                    election was any concern of theirs. In the first period of the tribunate the
                    tribunes almost certainly agitated to obtain for their supporters a share in the
                    benefits of the state domain. And, whatever view may be taken of the movement
                    which led to the decemvirate, an important element in it was of a certainty the
                    agitation carried on by the tribunes for the reduction of the 1aw of Rome to a
                    written code. Until they obtained this, it was impossible for them effectually
                    to protect those who appealed against harsh treatment by the consuls in their
                    capacity of judges.</p>
                <p>During the decemvirate the tribunate was in abeyance. It was called into life
                    again by the revolution of 449, which gave the tribunes a considerably stronger
                    position. Their personal privileges and those of the aediles were renewed, while
                    sacrosanctity was attached to a body of men called <hi rend="italic">judices
                    decemviri,</hi> who seem to have been the legal assistants of the tribunes. The
                    road was opened up to valid legislation by the tribunes through the assembly of
                    the tribes, but in this respect they were submitted to the control of the
                    senate. The growth of the influence of the tribe assembly over legislation
                    belongs rather to the history of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Comitia</hi> (<hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.</hi>) than to that of the tribunate. After the Hortensian Law
                    of 287 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> down to the end of the republic nearly all
                    the legislation of Rome was in the hands of the tribunes. The details of the
                    history of the tribunate in its second period, from 449 to 367 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> are hardly less obscure than those which belong to
                    the earlier time. There was, however, on the whole, undoubtedly an advance in
                    dignity and importance. Gradually a right was acquired of watching and
                    interfering with the proceedings of the senate, and even with legislation.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n577/mode/1up"

                <p>Whether the absolute right of veto had been achieved before 367 may well be
                    doubted. But the original or right of pro tecting individuals, was, during this
                    period, undergoing a very remarkable expansion. From forbidding a single act of
                    a magistrate in relation to a single person, the tribunes advanced to forbidding
                    by anticipation all acts of a certain class, whoever the persons affected by
                    them might prove to be. It therefore became useless for the senate or the
                    comitia to pass ordinances if a tribune was ready to forbid the magistrates to
                    carry them out. Ultimately the mere announcement of such an intention by a
                    tribune was sufficient to cause the obnoxious project to drop: that is to say,
                    the tribunes acquired a right to stop all business both in the deliberative
                    assembly, the senate, and in the legislative assemblies, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >comitia.</hi> The technical name for this right of veto is <hi rend="italic"
                    >intercessio.</hi> To what extent the tribunes during the time from 449 to 367
                    took part in criminal prosecutions is matter of doubt. The XII. Tables had
                    settled that offenders could only be punished in person by the centuries, but
                    tradition speaks of prosecutions by tribunes before the tribes where the penalty
                    sought was pecuniary. Tire two main objects of the tribunes, however, at the
                    time of which we are speaking were the opening of the consulate to plebeians and
                    the regulation of the state domain in the interests of the whole community. Both
                    were attained by the Licinio-Sextian Laws of 367.</p>
                <p>Then a considerable change came over the tribunate. From being an opposition
                    weapon it became an important wheel in the regular machine of state. The senate
                    became more and more plebeian, and a new body of nobility was evolved which
                    comprised both orders in the state. The tribunes at first belonged to the same
                    notable plebeian families which attained to the consulate. The old friction
                    between senate and tribunes disappeared. It was found that the tribunate served
                    to fill some gaps in the constitution, and its power was placed by common
                    consent on a solid constitutional basis. From 357 to 134 B.C. (when Tiberius
                    Gracchus became tribune) the tribunate was for the most part a mere organ of
                    senatorial government. As the change made by the Gracchi was rather in the
                    practice than in the theory of the tribunate, it will be convenient at this
                    point to give a definite sketch of the conditions and privileges attaching to
                    the office.</p>
                <p>Even after the difference between patrician and plebeian birth had ceased to be
                    of much practical consequence in other directions, the plebeian character was a
                    necessity for the tribune. When the patricians P. Sulpicius Rufus and, later, P.
                    Clodius (the antagonist of Cicero) desired to enter on a demagogic course, they
                    were compelled to divest themselves of their patrician quality by a peculiar
                    legal process. Even the patricians who became so by mere fiat of the emperors
                    were excluded from the tribunate. The other necessary qualifications were for
                    the most part such as attached to the other Roman magistracies,—complete
                    citizenship, absence of certain conditions regarded as disgraceful, fulfilment
                    of military duties. The minimum age required for the office was, as in the case
                    of the quaestorship, twenty-seven. The tribunate stood outside the round of
                    magistracies the conditions of which were regulated by the Villian Law of 180
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The election took place in a purely plebeian
                    assembly, ranged by tribes, under the presidency of a tribune selected by lot.
                    The tribune was bound by law to see a complete set of ten tribunes appointed.
                    Technically, the tribunes were reckoned, not as magistrates of the Roman people,
                    but as magistrates of the Roman plebs; they therefore had no special robe of
                    office, no lictors, but only messengers <hi rend="italic">(viatores),</hi> no
                    official chair, like the curule seat, but only benches <hi rend="italic"
                    >(subsellia).</hi> Their right to summon the plebs together, whether for the
                    purpose of listening to a speech (in which case the meeting was a <hi
                    rend="italic">contio)</hi> or for passing ordinances <hi rend="italic">(comitia
                    tributa),</hi> was rendered absolute by the “laws under sacred sanction” <hi
                    rend="italic">(leges sacratae),</hi> which had been incorporated with the
                    constitution on the abolition of the decemvirate. The right to summon the senate
                    and to lay business before it was acquired soon after 367, but was seldom
                    exercised, as the tribunes had abundant means of securing what they wanted by
                    pressure applied to the ordinary presidents,—the consuls or the urban praetor.
                    When an <hi rend="italic">interregnum</hi> came about and there were no
                    “magistrates of the Roman people,” the plebeian tribunes became the proper
                    presidents of the senate and conductors of ordinary state business. At the end
                    of the republic there were <hi rend="italic">interregna</hi> of several months’
                    duration, when the tribunes held a position of more than usual importance. A
                    tenure of the tribunate did not, until a comparatively late period (probably
                    about the time of the Second Punic War), confer a claim to a permanent seat in
                    the senate. The candidates for the office were mainly young men of good family
                    who were at the beginning of their political career, but the office was often
                    filled by older men of ambition who were struggling upwards with few advantages.
                    The plebeian aediles very soon after 367 became dissociated from the tribunes
                    and associated with the curule aediles, so that in the political hierarchy they
                    really ranked higher than those who were originally their superior officers.</p>
                <p>The real kernel of the tribune’s power consisted in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >intercessio</hi> or right of annulling ordinances, whether framed by the senate
                    or proposed by a magistrate to the <hi rend="italic">comitia,</hi> or issued by
                    a magistrate in pursuance of his office. From 367 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    down to the time of the Gracchi the power of veto in public matters was on the
                    whole used in the interests of the aristocratic governing families to check
                    opposition arising in their own ranks. A recalcitrant consul was most readily
                    brought to obedience by an exercise of tribunician power. But, although modern
                    readers of the ancient historians are apt to carry away the idea that the
                    tribunate was an intensely political office, it is safe to say that the
                    occasions on which tribunes found it possible to play a prominent part in
                    polities were extremely few, even in the late republic. On the other hand, the
                    tribunes found a field for constant activity in watching the administration of
                    justice and in rendering assistance to those who had received harsh treatment
                    from the magistrates. The tribunes were in fact primarily legal functionaries,
                    and constituted in a way the only court of appeal in republican Rome. It was to
                    this end that they were forbidden to pass a whole night away from the city,
                    except during the Latin festival on the Alban Mount, and that they were expected
                    to keep their doors open to suppliants by night as well as by day. They held
                    court by day in the Forιm close by the Porcian basilica, and frequently made
                    elaborate legal inquiries into cases where their help was sought. Naturally this
                    ordinary humdrum work of the tribunes has left little mark on the pages of the
                    historians, but we hear of it not unfrequently in Cicero’s speeches and in other
                    writings which deal with legal matters. According to the general principle of
                    the constitution, magistrates could forbid the acts of magistrates equal to or
                    inferior to themselves. For this purpose the tribunes were deemed superior to
                    all other officers. If a tribune exercised his veto no other tribune could annul
                    it, for the veto could not be itself vetoed, but it was possible for another
                    tribune to protect a definite individual from the consequences of disobedience.
                    The number of the tribunes (ten) made it always possible that one might baulk
                    the action of another, except at times when popular feeling was strongly roused.
                    In any case it was of little use for a tribune to move in any important matter
                    unless he had secured the co-operation or at least the neutrality of all his
                    colleagues. The veto was not, however, absolute in all directions. In some it
                    was limited by statute: thus the law passed by Gaius Gracchus about the consular
                    provinces did not permit a tribune to veto the annual decree of the senate
                    concerning them. When there was a dictator at the head of the state, the veto
                    was of no avail against him. One of the important political functions of the
                    tribunes was to conduct prosecutions of state offenders, particularly
                    ex-magistrates. These prosecutions began with a sentence pronounced by the
                    tribune upon the culprit, whereupon, exercising the right given him by the XII.
                    Tables, the culprit appealed. If the tribune sought to inflict punishment on the
                    culprit’s person, the appeal was to the assembly of the centuries; if he wished
                    for a large fine, the appeal was to the assembly of the tribes. As the tribune
                    had no right to summon the centuries, he had to obtain the necessary meetings
                    through the urban praetor. In the other event he himself called together the
                    tribute assembly and proposed a bill for fining the culprit. But the forms of
                    trial gone through were very similar in both cases.</p>
                <p>It is commonly stated that a great change passed over the tribunate at the time
                    of the Gracchi, and that from their day to the end of the republic it was used
                    as an instrument for setting on foot political agitation and for inducing
                    revolutionary changes. This view is an inversion of the facts. The tribunate did
                    not create the agitation and the revolutions, but these found vent through the
                    tribunate, which gave to the democratic leaders the hope that acknowledged evils
                    might be cured by constitutional means, and in the desperate struggle to realize
                    it the best democratic tribunes strained the theoretic powers of their office to
                    their ruin. For the bad tribunes did not hesitate to use for bad ends the powers
                    which had been strained in the attempt to secure what was good. But herein the
                    tribunate only fared like all other parts of the republican constitution in its
                    last period. The consuls and the senate were at least as guilty as the tribunes.
                    After a severe restriction of its powers by Sulla and a restoration by Pompey,
                    which gave a twenty years’ respite, the tribunate was merged into the imperial
                    constitution, of which indeed it became the chief corner-stone. The emperors did
                    not become tribunes, but took up into their privileges the essence of the
                    office, the “tribunician authority.” This distinction between the essential
                    principle of the office and the actual tenure of the office was a creation of
                    the late republic. Pompey, for example, when he went to the East, was not made
                    proconsul of all the Eastern provinces, but he exercised in them a “proconsular
                    authority” which was superior to that of the actual proconsuls,—an authority
                    which was the prototype of the imperial authority on its military side.
                    Similarly the emperor, as civil governor, without being tribune, exercised
                    powers of like quality with the powers of the tribune, though of superior force.
                    By virtue of his tribunician authority he acquired a veto on legislation, he
                    became the supreme court of appeal for the empire, and to his person was
                    attached the ancient sacrosanctity. Augustus showed the highest statesmanship in
                    founding his power upon a metamorphosed <pb break="no"

                    dictatorship, upon traditions which were democratic rather than upon traditions
                    which were patrician and optimate. The tribunes continued to exist till a late
                    period, with gradually vanishing dignity and rights; but it is not necessary
                    here to trace their decay in detail.</p>
                <p>The name “tribune” was once again illuminated by a passing glory when assumed by
                    Cola di Rienzi. The movement which he headed was in many respects extremely like
                    the early movements of the plebeians against the patricians, and his scheme for
                    uniting Italy in one free republic was strangely parallel with the greatest
                    dream of the Gracchi. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Rome,</hi> vol. xx. p. 800 <hi

                <p>The history of the tribunate is interwoven with that of Rome, and must, to a
                    large extent, be sought for in the same sources. The principles attaching to the
                    office are profoundly analysed by Mommsen in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Staatsrecht,</hi> and are clearly set forth by E. Herzog in his <hi

                    1884). (J∙ S. R.)</p>
