                    unalloyed metal was first introduced cannot be ascertained with certainty. All
                    we know is that about the 1st century the Greek word κασσ√τ∈pos designated tin,
                    and that tin was imported from Cornwall into Italy after, if not before, the
                    invasion of Britain by Julius Caesar. From Pliny’s writings it appears that the
                    Romans in his time did not realize the distinction between tin and lead: the
                    former was called <hi rend="italic">plumbum album</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >candidum</hi> to distinguish it from <hi rend="italic">plumbum nigrum</hi>
                    (lead proper). The word <hi rend="italic">stannum</hi> definitely assumed its
                    present meaning in the 4th century (H. Kopp).</p>
                <p>Grains of metallic tin occur as a subordinate admixture in the gold ores of
                    Siberia, Guiana, and Bolivia. Of tin mineral compounds (which are not numerous)
                    tinstone, SnO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is the most important; besides it
                    only tin pyrites, which, according to Rammelsberg, exists in two varieties, FeCu
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SnS <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> and ZnFeCu <hi

                    8</hi>, need be named here.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tinstone or Cassiterite.—</hi> This native oxide of tin, SnO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, forms very hard quadratic crystals of specific
                    gravity 6’8. The pure mineral is colourless, and it is very scarce; most
                    specimens are brown owing to the presence of ferric or manganic oxide. The faces
                    of the crystals exhibit diamond lustre. There is also another native form, known
                    as “wood tin,” occurring in roundish masses with a fibrous radiating fracture.
                    The ore is found in veins or layers within the older crystalline rocks and
                    slates. Being much more highly proof against the action of water and carbonic
                    acid than its matrix, the ore often presents itself in loose crystals as part of
                    the sand of rivers (stream tin). The oldest known deposit of tinstone is that of
                    Cornwall, where it occurs in granite and in the “killas” (a kind of metamorphic
                    clayish slate), associated with wolframite, apatite, topaz, mica, tourmaline,
                    arsenide of iron, and other minerals. Cornish tin ore is characteristically rich
                    in arsenic. Minor Euro <hi rend="subscript">:</hi> pean deposits occur in the
                    Erzgebirge, in Brittany, and in Galicia (Spain). A very considerable deposit of
                    pure ore (chiefly stream tin) exists in the island of Banca; and in Malacca
                    tinstone is found. Other relatively abundant deposits occur in Bolivia and Peru,
                    and in Queensland and New South Wales (lately discovered).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metallurgy.—</hi> In the extraction of tin from tinstone ore
                    the first step is to pound the crude ore and wash away the lighter gangue with
                    water (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Metallurgy,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 59). The washed
                    ore is “roasted” to burn away the arsenic and sulphur and to convert the iron,
                    originally present in the heavy and compact form of pyrites or arsenide, into
                    light friable oxide, which is removed by a second washing process. If much oxide
                    of copper is contained in the product, it is extracted with dilute sulphuric
                    acid, and from the solution is recovered by precipitation with metallic iron
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Copper,</hi> vol. vi. p. 347). The purified ore, known
                    as “black tin,” goes to the smelting furnace. During the roasting process the
                    ore must be constantly agitated to prevent caking, and to bring the
                    arseniferous, &amp;c., parts to the surface. To save manual labour, Oxland and
                    Hocking have constructed a mechanical roaster. It consists of a slanting tube of
                    boiler-iron, coated inside with fire-brick. The lower end opens into the
                    fire-place; the upper communicates with a set of chambers for the condensation
                    of the white arsenic produced. The washed ore, after being dried on the top of
                    the chamber, is run thence by a funnel into the pipe, which is made to rotate
                    about its axis from three to eight times per minute. Before the ore has
                    travelled far down the arsenic and sulphur catch fire, and by the time it
                    reaches the bottom it is fully roasted. It falls into a receptacle below the
                    level of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0420-0401"/> fire. Of the impurities of the ore the wolframite
                    (tungstate of iron and manganese) is the most troublesome, because on account of
                    its high specific gravity it cannot be washed away as gangue. To remove it,
                    Oxland fuses the ore with a certain proportion of carbonate of soda, which
                    suffices to convert the tungsten into soluble alkaline tungstate, without
                    producing noteworthy quantities of soluble stannate from the oxide of tin; the
                    tungstate is easily removed by treatment with water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Smelting.—</hi> The purified ore is mixed with about one-fifth
                    of its weight of anthracite smalls, the mixture being moistened to prevent it
                    from being blown off by the draught, and is then fused on the sole of a
                    reverberatory furnace for five or six hours. The slag and metal produced are
                    then run off and the latter is cast into bars; these are in general contaminated
                    with iron, arsenic, copper, and other impurities. To refine them, the bars are
                    heated cautiously on an inclined hearth, when relatively pure tin runs off,
                    while a skeleton of impure metal remains. The metal run off is further purified
                    by <hi rend="italic">poling, i.e.,</hi> by stirring it with the branch of a
                    tree,—the apple tree being preferred traditionally. This operation is no doubt
                    intended to remove the oxygen diffused throughout the metal as oxide, part of it
                    perhaps chemically by reduction of the oxide to metal, the rest by conveying the
                    finely diffused oxide to the surface and causing it to unite there with the
                    oxide scum. After this the metal is allowed to rest for a time in the pot at a
                    temperature above its freezing point and is then ladled out into ingot forms,
                    care being taken at each stage to ladle off the top stratum. The original top
                    stratum is the purest, and each succeeding lower stratum has a greater
                    proportion of impurities; the lowest consists 1argely of a solid or semi-solid
                    alloy of tin and iron.</p>
                <p>To test the purity of the metal, the tin-smelter heats the bars to a certain
                    temperature just below the fusing point, and then strikes them with a hammer or
                    lets them fall on a stone floor from a given height. If the tin is pure it
                    splits into a mass of granular strings. Tin which has been thus manipulated and
                    proved incidentally to be very pure is sold as grain tin. A lower quality goes
                    by the name of block tin. Of the several commercial varieties Banca tin is the
                    purest; it is indeed almost chemically pure. Next comes English grain tin. For
                    the preparation of chemically pure tin two methods are employed. (1)
                    Commercially pure tin is treated with nitric acid, which converts the tin proper
                    into an insoluble hydrate of SnO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, while the copper,
                    iron, &amp;c., become nitrates; the oxide is washed first with dilute nitric
                    acid, then with water, and is lastly dried and reduced by fusion with black flux
                    or cyanide of potassium. (2) A solution of pure stannous chloride in very dilute
                    hydrochloric acid is reduced with a galvanic current. According to Stolba,
                    beautiful crystals of pure tin can be obtained as follows. A platinum basin,
                    coated over with wax or paraffin outside, except a small circle at the very
                    lowest point, is placed on a plate of amalgamated zinc, lying on the bottom of a
                    beaker, and is filled with a solution of pure stannous chloride. The beaker also
                    is cautiously filled with acidulated water up to a point beyond the edge of the
                    platinum basin. The whole is then left to itself, when crystals of tin gradually
                    separate out on the bottom of the basin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Properties of Pure Tin.—</hi> Án ingot of pure tin is pure
                    white (except for a slight tinge of blue); it exhibits considerable lustre and
                    is not subject to tarnishing on exposure to normal air. The metal is pretty soft
                    and easily flattened out under· the hammer, but almost devoid of tenacity. That
                    it is elastic, within narrow limits, is proved by its clear ring when struck
                    with a hard body under circumstances permitting of free vibration. The specific
                    gravity of ingot tin is 7'293 at 13° C. (Matthiessen). A tin ingot, though
                    seemingly amorphous, has a crystalline structure, consisting of an aggregate of
                    quadratic octahedra; hence the characteristic crackling noise which a bar of tin
                    gives out when being bent. This structure can be rendered visible by superficial
                    etching with dilute acid. As the minuter crystals dissolve more quickly than the
                    larger ones, the surface assumes a frosted appearance <hi rend="italic">{moirée
                    métallique),</hi> not unlike that of a frozen window-pane in winter time. Its
                    crystalline structure must account for the striking fact that the ingot, when
                    exposed for a sufficient time to very low temperatures (to -39° C. for 14
                    hours), becomes so brittle that it falls into powder under a pestle or hammer;
                    it indeed sometimes crumbles into powder spontaneously. At ordinary temperatures
                    tin proves fairly ductile under the hammer, and its ductility seems to increase
                    as the temperature rises up to about 100° C. At some temperature near its fusing
                    point it becomes brittle <hi rend="italic">{vide supra),</hi> and still more
                    brittle from -14° C. downwards. This behaviour of the metal may probably be
                    explained by assuming that in any tin crystal the coefficient of thermic
                    expansion has one value in the direction of the principal axis and another in
                    that of either of the subsidiary axes. From 0° to 100° the two coefficients are
                    practically identical; below -14° and from somewhere above 100° C. upwards they
                    assume different values; and, as the several crystals are oriented in a lawless
                    fashion, this must tend to disintegrate the mass. Tin fuses at 232° · 7
                    (Persoz); at a red heat it begins to volatilize slowly; at 1600° to 1808° C.
                    (Carnelley and Williams) it boils. The hot vapour produced combines with the
                    oxygen of the air into white oxide, SnO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Industrial Applications.—</hi> Commercially pure tin is used
                    (principally in Germany) for the making of pharmaceutical apparatus, such as
                    evaporating basins for extracts, infusion pots, stills, &amp;c. It is also
                    employed for making two varieties of tin-foil,—one for the silvering of mirrors
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mirror,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 500), the other for wrapping
                    up chocolate, toilet soap, tobacco, &amp;c. The mirror foil must contain some
                    copper to prevent it from being too readily amalgamated by the mercury. For
                    making tin-foil the metal is rolled into thin sheets, pieces of which are beaten
                    out with a wooden mallet. As pure tin does not tarnish in the air and is proof
                    against acid liquids, such as vinegar, lime juice, &amp;c., it is utilized for
                    culinary and domestic vessels. But it is expensive, and tin vessels have to be
                    made very heavy to give them sufficient stability of form; hence it is generally
                    employed merely as a protecting coating for utensils made essentially of copper
                    or iron. The tinning of a copper basin is an easy operation. The basin, made
                    scrupulously clean, is heated over a charcoal fire to beyond the fusing point of
                    tin. Molten tin is then poured in, a little powdered sal-ammoniac added, and the
                    tin spread over the inside with a bunch of tow. The salammoniac removes the last
                    unavoidable film of oxide, leaving a purely metallic surface, to which the tin
                    adheres firmly. For tinning small objects of copper or brass <hi rend="italic"
                    >{i.e.,</hi> pins, hooks, &amp;c.) a wet-way process is followed. One part of
                    cream of tartar, two of alum, and two of common salt are dissolved in boiling
                    water, and the solution is boiled with granulated metallic tin (or, better,
                    mixed with a little stannous chloride) to produce a tin solution; and into this
                    the articles are put at a boiling heat. In the absence of metallic tin there is
                    no visible change; but, as soon as the metal is introduced, a galvanic action
                    sets in and the articles get coated over with a firmly adhering film of tin.
                    Tinning wrought iron is effected by immersion. The most important form of the
                    operation is making tinned from ordinary sheet iron (making what is called
                    “sheet tin”). The iron plates, having been carefully cleaned with sand and
                    muriatic or sulphuric acid, and lastly with water, are plunged into heated
                    tallow to drive away the water without oxidation of the metal. They are next
                    steeped in a bath, first of molten ferruginous, then of pure tin. They are then
                    taken out and kept suspended in hot tallow to enable the surplus tin to run off.
                    The tin of the second bath dissolves iron gradually and becomes fit for the
                    first bath. To tin cast-iron articles they must be decarburetted superficially
                    by ignition within a bath of ferric oxide (powdered haematite or similar
                    material), then cleaned with acid, and tinned by immersion, as explained above.
                    By far the greater part of the tin produced metallurgically is used for making
                    tin alloys, the majority of which have been treated of in preceding articles;

                    at a red heat in nitrogen, a vacuum, or hydrochloric acid, without
                    decomposition. The vapour density below 700° C. corresponds to Sn <hi
