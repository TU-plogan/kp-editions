                    the nervous system, consisting in an increased reflex excitability of the spinal
                    cord and manifesting itself by painful tonic spasm of the voluntary muscles
                    throughout the body. The disease shows itself under various conditions. It
                    occasionally occurs, particularly in tropical countries, without apparent cause,
                    and has thus been known to affect numbers of persons simultaneously <hi

                    tetanus).</hi> But by far the greater number of cases occur in connexion with a
                    wound or other injury, more especially in the extremities, probably implicating
                    some of the peripheral nerves. Certain forms of injury, as punctured, lacerated,
                    and gunshot wounds, are more liable to be followed by tetanus than others. In
                    many cases the liability bears no proportion to the extent of the wound.
                    Exposure to cold after injury is an important exciting cause. The symptoms of
                    tetanus in its most usual forms generally appear during the healing process of a
                    wound, but occasionally they arise after cicatrization is completed. Sometimes
                    they are preceded by appearances of irritation in the wound or its
                    neighbourhood, but this is exceptional. The earliest indications of the disease
                    usually show themselves, no matter where the wound is situated, by stiffness
                    about the muscles of the jaw, causing difficulty in opening the mouth, which
                    soon increases to lockjaw or trismus. This is accompanied by spasm in
                    neighbouring muscles, and the drawn features and exposed teeth give to the
                    countenance the peculiar expression known as <hi rend="italic">risus
                    sardonicus.</hi> The rigidity extends to the muscles of the neck, back, chest,
                    abdomen, and extremities, and the body frequently assumes a bent attitude,
                    either backward <hi rend="italic">(opisthotonos),</hi> forward <hi rend="italic"
                    >(empros-thotonos),</hi> or laterally <hi rend="italic">(pleurosthotσnos).</hi>
                    This general muscular rigidity, which at first is not constant but occasionally
                    undergoes relaxation, is accompanied by frequently recurring convulsive
                    seizures, which are readily excited by the slightest irritation, such as from a
                    draught of cool air, a bright light, the closing of a door, &lt;fcc. In such
                    attacks there is great suffering and the expression of the face is indicative of
                    agony; and the function of respiration may be seriously involved and asphyxia
                    threaten or actually take place. The temperature of the body sometimes rises to
                    a high degree. The attack is usually acute and after a few days either passes
                    off or, as is more frequent, terminates fatally, either by asphyxia from tonic
                    spasm of the respiratory muscles or from exhaustion consequent on the violence
                    of the symptoms together with the absence of sleep. Throughout the whole course
                    of the disease the mind is clear. In idiopathic tetanus the symptoms are less
                    severe, the course more chronic, and recoveries more common than in those which
                    depend upon a wound or injury. The puerperal form, with symptoms which differ in
                    no way from those described, is rare and occurs either after parturition or
                    after abortion. Tetanus in new-born children, also a rare form, usually shows
                    itself a day or two after birth by obvious difficulty in the acts of sucking and
                    swallowing; by the supervention of trismus, together with tonic contraction of
                    the muscles of the limbs and body, sometimes accompanied by convulsive seizures;
                    and by a peculiar low whining cry, seldom absent and very characteristic.
                    Various opinions have been held as to the cause of this form of tetanus, some
                    referring it to the wound produced by severance of the umbilical cord, others to
                    pressure upon the bones of the head in parturition, &amp;c. It has not yet been
                    satisfactorily explained. Although sometimes recovered from, it is usually
                    fatal.</p>
                <p>The symptoms of poisoning by strychnine bear a strong resemblance to those of
                    tetanus. They are, however, more acute and develop in connexion with something
                    which has been taken; further, the absence of a wound and the fact that the
                    spasm affects the muscles of the extremities first, and not those of the jaws,
                    as in tetanus, serve to establish the diagnosis. In <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hydrophobia</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> which in certain of its symptoms
                    resembles tetanus, the absence of trismus, the dread of water, and the violent
                    spasms on attempting to drink, together with the history of the case, readily
                    enable a distinction to be made. Various other forms of nervous disease
                    accompanied by tetanic symptoms, such as cerebro-spinal meningitis, hysteria in
                    some forms, &amp;c., may be still more clearly distinguished from true
                    tetanus.</p>
                <p>The pathology of tetanus is referred to in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pathology</hi> (vol. xviii. p. 391). No constant changes are observed in the
                    body after death from tetanus. The most common are great dilatation of the
                    blood-vessels of the spinal cord and sometimes evidence of inflammatory action,
                    but these are probably the effects of the symptoms rather than their cause.</p>
                <p>For the treatment of tetanus many remedies have been employed. Where a source of
                    irritation in or about a wound can be made out, it ought to be dealt with by the
                    surgeon. Of medicinal agents those which diminish the reflex excitability of the
                    spinal cord and relax the spasm are to be recommended. But it is not safe to
                    employ all substances which produce these effects. Thus tobacco and its active
                    principle nicotine act powerfully in this way, but they are attended with danger
                    from their poisonous properties, and the same may be said of curari, conium,
                    calabar bean, &lt;fcc., all of which have been used in tetanus. Opium carefully
                    administered sometimes produces a markedly beneficial effect, as does also
                    Indian hemp. Chloroform or ether inhalation greatly mitigates the severity of
                    the spasm. Chloral hydrate and bromide of potassium or ammonium are among the
                    most useful agents which can be employed, and they may be given separately or,
                    still better, in combination. As adjuvants, the warm bath, the absence of all
                    noise and excitement, and the maintenance of the strength by appropriate
                    nutriment should not be neglected.</p>
