                    antiquated, <hi rend="italic">scheel),</hi> one of the metallic elements of
                    chemistry. The mineral tungsten (meaning in Swedish “heavy stone ”) used to be
                    taken for a tin ore until this was disproved by Cronsted. Scheele showed in 1781
                    that it is a compound of lime with a peculiar acid, the metallic nature of which
                    was recognized in the same year by Bergmann. It occurs only as a component of a
                    number of relatively rare minerals, the most important of which are wolfram or
                    wolframite, (Fe, Mn)O.WO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and scheelite (tungsten),
                    CaOWO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mineralogy).</hi>
                    The metal is prepared from the pure oxide WO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> by
                    reduction with hydrogen in a platinum tube at a high temperature. It forms
                    resplendent tin-white or grey plates, or a dull black powder similar to
                    hydrogen-reduced iron. Sp. gr. = 19∙129, water of 4° C. = 1 (Roscoe). It is more
                    difficult to fuse than even <hi rend="smallcaps">Manganese (</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">).</hi> It is unalterable in
                    ordinary air; oxygen and even chlorine act upon it only at a high temperature.

                    tungstic acid, is the more important. Impure trioxide is producible by treating
                    scheelite (WO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> CaO) with hot hydrochloric acid.
                    Wolframite is not so readily decomposed; but when fused with twice its weight of
                    chloride of calcium it passes into lime salt, obtainable as an insoluble residue
                    by lixiviation of the fuse with water. The oxide obtained forms a yellow powder
                    insoluble in water and in hydrochloric acid. To purify it, it is washed,
                    dissolved in aqueous ammonia, and the filtered solution evaporated, when an acid
                    tungstate of ammonia separates out in scales of great purity. These, when heated
                    in air, leave behind them a pseudo-morphose of pure yellow oxide. Trioxide of
                    tungsten combines with basic oxides into tungstates; but the proportion in which
                    it unites with a given base is subject to great variation: for instance, the
                    quantity Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> 0 of soda unites into so many definite
                    tungstates with 1, 1½, 2, 2⅓, 2⅖, 2½, 4 times WO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    and in each case more or less of water. To each of these soda salts corresponds
                    theoretically a certain tungstic acid,—to the salt Na <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> OW <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> 0 <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, for

                    as metatungstic acid, <pb break="no"

                    it dissolves in water and the solution unites with bases into meta-tungstates.
                    Most meta-tungstates are soluble in water; of the tungstates proper only the
                    alkali salts are so soluble. The soda tungstate, 5Na <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O.12WO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + <hi rend="italic">x</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, known as para-tungstate of soda, is made
                    industrially by fusing wolframite with carbonate of soda and lixiviating the
                    fuse with water. The insoluble oxides of iron and manganese are filtered off;
                    the filtrate, while still hot, is nearly neutralized with hydrochloric acid and
                    allowed to crystallize. It forms large crystals containing twenty-one,
                    twenty-five, or twentyeight times H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O according to
                    the temperature at which they are formed. The salt has been recommended as a
                    mordant in dyeing and calico-printing, but has not taken root in these
                    industries. Oppenheim and Versmann recommended it before 1862 as the best means
                    for rendering textile fabrics uninflammable. If a solution of the para-tungstate
                    is boiled with hydrated tungstic acid (as obtained by precipitating any ordinary
                    alkaline tungstate solution with hydrochloric acid in the heat), or is simply
                    mixed with excess of acetic acid, the meta-tungstate is formed; in the latter
                    case it separates out as a heavy oil. Meta-tungstate of soda forms octahedral
                    crystals of the composition Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. 4WO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 10H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. If concentrated
                    warm solutions of this salt and the equivalent quantity of chloride of barium
                    are mixed and allowed to cool after addition of a little hydrochloric acid,
                    meta-tungstate of barium crystallizes out as BaO. 4WO <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> + 9H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, in large quadratic pyramids which
                    are very easily soluble in water. From this salt the free acid is easily
                    produced by addition of the exact quantity of sulphuric acid required to
                    precipitate the baryta, and from it any other metatungstate is easily produced.
                    Meta-tungstic acid solution is a sensitive and characteristic precipitant for
                    almost all alkaloids (strychnine, quinine, &amp;c.). The alkaloid, whatever its
                    name, goes down as a flocculent insoluble meta-tungstate. Tungstic acid combines
                    with phosphoric acid and with silicic acids into highly complex phospho-tungstic
                    acids and silico-tungstic acids. Of the formel· there is quite a series, each
                    consisting of one P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>

                    kinds) are easily soluble in water. The phospho-acids are delicate precipitants
                    for all alkaloids.</p>
                <p>The binoxide, WO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is obtained when the trioxide is
                    reduced by hydrogen at a dull red heat. This oxide is very prone to pass into
                    trioxide or tungstate. An interesting and beautiful class of compounds of WO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, WO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and bases are known
                    as tungsten bronzes. The first of these was discovered by Wohler. Normal
                    tungstate of soda, Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> OWO3, is fused, and trioxide
                    added to it as long as it dissolves. The product is then heated in hydrogen as
                    long as water goes away, and the substance thus reduced is exhausted
                    successively with water, hydrochloric acid, caustic potash ley, and again with
                    water. A residue of the composition Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. W <hi

                    specific gravity 6∙617, which conduct electricity like a metal. Only
                    hydrofluoric acid dissolves this soda-tungsten bronze. There are a number of
                    other tungsten bronzes, all distinguished by metallic lustre and magnificent
                    purple, red, yellow, or blue colours.</p>

                    When heated on charcoal with (not too much) carbonate of soda or cyanide of
                    potassium in the reducing flame, they yield a grey heavy powder of metal,
                    obtainable by elutriation. The process fails in the presence of too much alkali.
                    Insoluble tungstates <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> the ordinary tungsten
                    minerals) are disintegrable by fusion with alkaline carbonate; the fuse, when
                    treated with water, yields a solution of alkaline tungstate. This solution, when
                    mixed with excess of hydrochloric acid, gives a white precipitate of hydrated
                    trioxide, which on boiling becomes yellow by partial dehydration. The yellow
                    unignited precipitate is soluble in aqueous ammonia. If tungstate of alkali
                    solutions are mixed with hydrochloric acid and then treated with metallic zinc,
                    they become blue through the formation of a compound of WO <hi rend="subscript">

                    this reaction gains in definiteness through the presence of phosphoric acid. (W.
