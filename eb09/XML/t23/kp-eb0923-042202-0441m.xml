                    the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia,</hi> and toads and frogs are the only
                    representatives of the <hi rend="italic">Anura</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Batrachia</hi> indigenous to Britain. To an ordinary observer the toad is
                    proved to be an amphibian by its moist soft skin, an anuran or tailless
                    amphibian by the want of a separate tail. The toad differs from the frog in the
                    following points :—It has no teeth on either of its jaws or on the roof of its
                    mouth, while the frog has a series of fine teeth on the upper jaw and also teeth
                    on the palate; the tongue in both animals is attached in front and free behind,
                    but that of the frog is forked at its free extremity, that of the toad is not;
                    the skin of the toad is rough with large protuberant warts, while that of the
                    frog is smooth; the body of the toad is more globular and puffy than that of the
                    frog; the hind legs in the toad are shorter, and the posterior digits not so
                    completely webbed, the animal being more terrestrial in its habits than the
                    frog. In the toad, as in the frog, there are four digits anteriorly, five
                    posteriorly. The warts of the toad’s skin contain large cutaneous glands, which
                    secrete a thick yellowish fluid with acrid properties, capable of irritating and
                    producing slight inflammation on the human skin. The use of this secretion is
                    probably to protect the toad from being devoured by carnivorous animals. Like
                    other <hi rend="italic">Amphibia,</hi> it has a large membranous bladder
                    communicating with the terminal part of the intestine—the allantoic bladder,—in
                    which fluid accumulates, probably from the kidneys, though the ureters do not
                    open directly into the bladder. The toad, when handled or alarmed in any way,
                    ejects the contents of its bladder. Owing to these peculiarities and its
                    appearance, the animal is commonly regarded with loathing, and credited with far
                    more poisonous properties than it possesses. In its breeding habits the toad
                    resembles the frog: its eggs are fertilized externally at the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0442-0423"/> moment of extrusion, as in the frog, the parents
                    resorting to the water for the purpose of reproduction. The ova are laid in
                    spring, and are arranged, not in shapeless masses, but in a string containing a
                    double series of eggs adhering by their gelatinous envelopes; the string extends
                    to a length of three or four feet. The tadpoles are similar to those of the
                    frog, but blacker; their metamorphosis takes place in the same manner, the three
                    pairs of external gills being first absorbed and replaced for a time by internal
                    gills, which are in their turn lost, the branchial slits being closed by the
                    coalescence of the opercular membrane with the skin. The metamorphosis is
                    complete in autumn. The toad is carnivorous, feeding on flies and other insects
                    and worms. It hibernates in winter, passing its period of torpidity in holes or
                    burrows in the earth. The finding of toads in a state of hibernation has given
                    rise to stories of their being found in the centre of trunks of trees or
                    imbedded in solid rock. The myth of the jewel in the head (Shakespeare) is
                    probably founded on the brightness of the eyes, in which the iris is
                    flame-coloured.</p>
                <p>There are two kinds of toad in Britain,—the Common Toad, which is almost black in
                    colour, and the Natter jack Toad, which is lighter, smaller, and has a bright
                    yellow line along the middle of the back. The length of the common toad is 3∣
                    inches, of the natter-jack 2f inches. The male natter jack possesses a bladder
                    or vocal sack beneath the throat communicating with the mouth, which acts as a
                    resonator to its voice; its cry is “gluck-gluck.” The vocal sack is absent in
                    the common toad, and only incompletely developed in the Green Toad of the
                    Continent.</p>
                <p>In zoological classification the toad belongs to the genus <hi rend="italic"
