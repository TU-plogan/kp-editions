                <p><label type="entry">THALLIUM</label>, one of the rarer elements of chemistry. Its
                    discovery is one of the outcomes of Bunsen and Kirchhof’s method of spectrum
                    analysis. When Crookes, in 1861, applied this method to the flue-dust produced
                    in the roasting of a certain kind of pyrites he observed in its spectrum a green
                    line foreign to all then known spectra, and concluded that his substance must
                    contain a new element, to which he gave the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >thallium,</hi> from 0αλλ&lt;k, a green twig. Crookes presumed that his thallium
                    was something of the order of sulphur, selenium, or tellurium; but Lamy, who
                    anticipated him in isolating the new element, found it to be a metal. Our
                    present knowledge of the chemistry of thallium is based chiefly upon the labours
                    of Crookes.</p>
                <p>The chemical character of thallium presents striking peculiarities. Dumas once
                    called it the “<hi rend="italic">omithorhynchus paradoxus</hi> of metals.” As an
                    elementary substance, it is very similar in its mechanical and physical
                    properties to lead; like lead it forms an almost insoluble chloride and an
                    insoluble iodide. But the hydroxide of thallium, in most of its properties,
                    comes very close to those of the alkaH metals; it is strongly basilous, forms an
                    insoluble chloroplatinate, and an alum strikingly similar to the corresponding
                    potassium compounds. Yet, unlike potassium or lead, it forms a feebly basic
                    sesquioxide similar to manganic oxide, Mn <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.</p>
                <p>Traces of thallium exist in many kinds of pyrites, as used for vitriol-making.
                    The only known mineral of which it forms an essential component is the
                    “crookesite” of Skrikerum, Smâland, Sweden, which, according to Nordenskiöld,
                    contains 33 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3 of selenium, 45 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 8 of copper, 3 ’ 7 of silver, and 17*2 of thallium in
                    100 parts. Crookesite, however, is scarce. The best raw materials for the
                    preparation of thallium are the flue-dusts produced industrially in the roasting
                    of thalliferous pyrites and the “chamber muds” accumulating in vitriol-chambers
                    wrought with such pyrites; in both it is frequently associated with <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Selenium (⅛.v.).</hi> The flue-dust from the pyrites of Theux,
                    near Spa (Belgium), according to Böttcher, contains 0 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 5 to 0 ’ 75 per cent, of thallium; that of the pyrites of Meggen,
                    according to Carstanjen, as much as 3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 per
                    cent.; while that of the pyrites of Ruhrort yielded 1 per cent, of the pure
                    chloride to Gunning.</p>
                <p>For the extraction of the metal from chamber mud, the latter is boiled with
                    water, which extracts the thallium as T1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. From the filtered solution the thallium is
                    precipitated by addition of hydrochloric acid, as T1C1, along, in general, with
                    more or less of chloride of lead. The mixed chlorides are boiled down to dryness
                    with oil of vitriol to convert them into sulphates, which are then separated by
                    boiling water, which dissolves only the thallium salt. From the filtered
                    solution the thallium is recovered, as such, by means of pure metallic zinc, or
                    by electrolysis. The (approximately pure) metallic sponge obtained is washed,
                    made compact by compression, fused in a porcelain crucible in an atmosphere of
                    hydrogen, and cast into sticks. Methods for the final purification of the metal
                    will easily be deduced from what follows.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">metal</hi> is bluish white; it is extremely soft but almost
                    devoid of tenacity and elasticity. Its specific gravity is 11’86. It fuses at
                    290° C.; at a white heat it boils and can be distilled in hydrogen gas. When
                    heated in air it is readily oxidized, with formation of a reddish or violet
                    vapour. When exposed to the air it readily draws a film of oxide; the tarnished
                    metal when plunged into water reassumes its metallic lustre, the oxide film
                    being quickly dissolved. When kept in contact with water and air it is gradually
                    converted into hydroxide, T1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> OH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O or T10H.</p>
                <p>This <hi rend="italic">hydrate,</hi> T10H, most conveniently prepared by
                    decomposing the solution of the sulphate with baryta water, crystallizes from
                    its <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n237/mode/1up"

                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, which dissolve readily in water, forming an
                    intensely alkaline solution, which acts as a caustic, like, for instance,
                    potash-ley, and like it greedily absorbs carbonic acid from the atmosphere. But,
                    unlike the alkalies, it readily loses its water at 100° C. and even at the
                    ordinary temperature, to pass into the state of anhydrous T1 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, which is black or black-violet.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">chloride,</hi> T1C1, is readily obtained from the solution
                    of any thallous salt <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> the sulphate), by addition of
                    hydrochloric acid, as a white precipitate similar in appearance to chloride of
                    silver, like which it turns violet in the light and fuses below redness into a
                    (yellow) liquid which freezes into a horn-like flexible mass. The specific
                    gravity of this “horn” thallium, as one might call it, is 7'02. One part of the
                    precipitated chloride dissolves at 0° C. in 500 parts of water, and in 70 parts
                    at 100° C. It is less soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid. Carbonate of soda
                    solution dissolves it pretty freely.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">iodide,</hi> Til, is a yellow precipitate, which requires
                    16,000 parts of cold water and still more of solution of iodide of potassium for
                    its solution.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">chloroplatinate,</hi> PtCl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> Tl
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, readily obtainable from thallous-salt solutions by

                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), is a yellow precipitate soluble in no less than
                    15,600 parts of cold water.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">carbonate,</hi> T1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, comes closer to the lithium compound than to any other
                    ordinary carbonate. It forms resplendent monoclinic prisms, soluble at 18° C. in
                    19 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 1 and at 100° in 4‘46 parts of water. A stable
                    bicarbonate, T1HCO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, does exist.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sulphate,</hi> T1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, forms rhombic prisms isomorphous with K <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. It dissolves at 18° C.
                    in 20 ’ 8 and at 101° in 5’2 parts of water. It unites with vitriol into an acid
                    salt, T1HSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + 3H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O,
                    and with sulphate of alumina into an “alum,” A1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (SO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> T1 <hi

                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Thallic salts</hi> are related to thallous pretty much as
                    manganic are to manganous. The chloride, T1C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is
                    obtained as a solution by passing chlorine into a suspension of thallous
                    chloride in water. The solution, when evaporated <hi rend="italic">in
                    vacuo,</hi> deposits colourless crystals, T1C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + H
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. For the oxide, if chlorine be passed into a
                    solution of thallous chloride in carbonate of soda a brown precipitate is
                    produced, which, after drying, has the composition T1 <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. When
                    heated with strong hydrochloric acid it evolves chlorine and yields T1C1; when
                    heated with oil of vitriol it yields oxygen gas and thallous sulphate. Thallic
                    sulphate, however, does exist,—in crystals, T1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (SO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 7H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, soluble in dilute sulphuric acid, but decomposed by

                <p><hi rend="italic">Analysis.—</hi> All thallium compounds volatile or liable to
                    dissociation at the temperature of the flame of a Bunsen lamp impart to such
                    flame an intense green colour. The spectrum consists of only one line, which, of
                    course, has a definite position in the spectrum, and consequently is easily
                    identified,—a most delicate test.</p>
                <p>From solutions containing it as thallous salt the metal is easily precipitated as
                    chloride, iodide, or chloroplatinate by the corresponding reagents (see <hi

                    black precipitate, insoluble in excess of reagent. Thallic salts are easily
                    reduced to thallous by means of solution of sulphurous acid, and thus rendered
                    amenable to the above reactions.</p>
                <p>The atomic weight of thallium was determined very carefully by Crookes. He found
