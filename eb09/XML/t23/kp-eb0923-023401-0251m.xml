                <p><label type="entry">THEISM</label><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> term theism has
                    three significations. In its widest acceptation its object is the Divine,
                    whether regarded as personal or impersonal, as one being or as a number of
                    beings. In this sense theism is coextensive with religion and worship, includes
                    all forms of polytheism and of pantheism, as well as all varieties of
                    monotheism, and so may be said to denote the genus of which polytheism,
                    pantheism, and monotheism are species. The conception of the Divine, in its
                    utmost abstractness and generality, is, however, so vague that it may reasonably
                    be doubted if the forms of theism, thus understood, can be distributed into
                    strictly logical and natural species, with definitions at once perfectly
                    distinct in themselves and exactly accordant with phenomena. It may seem as if
                    polytheism and monotheism must, by arithmetical necessity, be exclusive of each
                    other and exhaustive of theism; but this is not so. Pantheism may clearly
                    partake of the nature of both, and has been sometimes extravagantly
                    polytheistic, sometimes only doubtfully distinguishable from fully developed
                    monotheism. Probably few, if any, polytheistic religions are purely
                    polytheistic, or, in other words, do not imply in some mode and measure the
                    unity as well as the plurality of the Divine. Christian monotheism answers to a
                    formal definition of monotheism only inasmuch as it holds to the unity of the
                    Godhead, but contravenes it inasmuch as it holds that in the one Godhead there
                    are three Divine persons, each God.</p>
                <p>The complete negation of theism in its generic sense is atheism—the denial of the
                    existence or of the knowability of the Divine. It is only in modern times that
                    the word atheism has acquired this meaning, only in recent times that it has
                    come to be exclusively employed with this meaning. The Greeks meant by it simply
                    disbelief in the Greek gods. The early Christians were called atheists because
                    they refused to acknowledge the pagan deities. Protestants have been charged by
                    Roman Catholics and Roman Catholics by Protestants with atheism. Throughout even
                    the 18th century the word was used in an extremely loose manner, and often
                    affixed to systems by which the existence and agency of God were unequivocally
                    recognized. Atheism, in the sense now generally admitted to be alone
                    appropriate, may be of three species,—namely, denial of the existence of the
                    Divine, denial that the Divine has been shown to exist, and denial that it can
                    be known that the Divine exists. The first species has been called <hi
                    rend="italic">dogmatic atheism,</hi> the second <hi rend="italic">critical
                    atheism</hi>; and the third has been designated, and may conveniently be
                    designated, <hi rend="italic">religious agnosticism.</hi> Agnosticism <hi
                    rend="italic">per se</hi> should not be identified with atheism or with any of
                    its forms. The term antitheism has been used by some theologians, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Chalmers and Foster, as equivalent to dogmatic atheism;
                    but it may with much more practical advantage be employed to denote all systems
                    of belief opposed to theism, either in the generic sense already indicated, or
                    in the specific sense of monotheism. Understood in this latter mode, it is much
                    more comprehensive than the term atheism. Polytheism and pantheism are alike
                    antitheistic theories, although on different grounds; while only those theories
                    which deny that there is evidence for belief even in the existence of any god,
                    any divine being, are atheistic.</p>
                <p>It is somewhat remarkable that the term theism by itself never occurs in its
                    etymological and generic sense, never means as a separate word what it means in
                    the compounds atheism, polytheism, pantheism, and monotheism. Ordinarily it is
                    identified with monotheism, and consequently opposed to polytheism and to
                    pantheism, as well as to atheism. Whereas polytheism acknowledges a plurality of
                    finite gods, theism as monotheism acknowledges only one absolute infinite God.
                    Whereas pantheism regards all finite things as merely aspects, modifications, or
                    parts of one eternal self-existent being—all material objects and all particular
                    minds as necessarily derived from a single infinite substance,—and thus
                    combines, in its conception of the Divine, monism and determinism, theism as
                    monotheism, while accepting monism, rejects determinism, and attributes to the
                    Divine all that is essentially implied in free personal existence and agency.
                    Pantheism is, however, wonderfully protean, and rarely conforms to its ideal;
                    hence the systems called pantheistic are seldom purely pantheistic, and are
                    often more monotheistic than pantheistic.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the term theism is employed in a still more special sense, namely, to
                    denote one of two kinds of monotheism, the other kind being <hi rend="italic"
                    >deism.</hi> Although <hi rend="italic">deus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >theos</hi> are equivalent, deism has come to be distinguished from theism. The
                    former word first appeared in the 16th century, when it was used to designate
                    antitrinitarian opinions. In the 17th century it came to be applied to the view
                    that the light of nature is the only light in which man can know God, no special
                    revelation having been given to the human race. Dr Samuel Clarke, in the Boyle
                    Lectures preached in 1705, distributed deists into four classes. The first class
                    “pretend to believe the existence of an eternal, infinite, independent,
                    intelligent being, and, to avoid the name of Epicurean atheists, teach also that
                    this supreme being made the world; though at the same time they agree with the
                    Epicureans in this, that they fancy God does not at all concern Himself in the
                    government of the world, nor has any regard to, or care of, what is done
                    therein.” The second class acknowledge not only that God made all things, but
                    that He sustains and governs them, yet deny that He has any regard in His
                    government to moral distinctions, these being merely the products of human will
                    and law. The third class believe in the being, natural attributes, providence,
                    and to some extent in the moral attributes and government of God, but deny the
                    immortality of the soul and a future state of rewards and punishments. The
                    fourth class acknowledge the being, natural and moral perfections, and
                    providence of God, as also the immortality of the soul and a future state of
                    rewards and punishments, yet profess to believe only what is discoverable by the
                    light of nature, without believing any divine revelation (Clarke, <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Attributes,</hi> pp. 140-153, ed. 1823). This division is
                    not an exact classification, nor does it rest on any precise definition of
                    deism, but it, with substantial accuracy, discriminates and grades the varieties
                    of English deism. Clarke did not contrast deism with theism, or even employ the
                    latter word. His contemporary, Lord Shaftesbury, on the other hand, generally
                    used the term theism, yet only as synonymous with deism, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n252/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0252-0235"/> and with a protest against either being opposed
                    to revelation <hi rend="italic">(Characteristics,</hi> vol. ii. p. 209, ed.
                    1727). Kant, in his <hi rend="italic">Kritik der reinen Vernunft,</hi>
                    explicitly distinguished and opposed deism and theism, but in a very peculiar
                    manner. “The person who believes in a transcendental theology alone is termed a
                    <hi rend="italic">deist;</hi> he who acknowledges the possibility of a natural
                    theology also, a <hi rend="italic">theist.</hi> The former admits that we can
                    cognize by pure reason alone the existence of a supreme being, but at the same
                    time maintains that our conception of this being is purely transcendental, and
                    that all that we can say of it is that it possesses all reality, without being
                    able to define it more closely. The second asserts that reason is capable of
                    presenting us, from the analogy of nature, with a more definite conception of
                    this being, and that its operations, as the cause of all things, are the results
                    of intelligence and .free will. The former regards the supreme being as <hi
                    rend="italic">the cause of the world—</hi> whether by the necessity of his
                    nature, or as a free agent, is left undetermined; the latter considers this
                    being as the <hi rend="italic">author of the world” ( Werke,</hi> ii. 49ι,
                    edited by Rosenkranz, Meiklejohn’s tr., 387-8). The account here given of deism
                    seems neither self-consistent nor intelligible, and applies, equally well or
                    equally ill, to every system—atheistic, agnostic, pantheistic, idealistic, or
                    materialistic—which admits the existence but not the intelligence or personality
                    of an <hi rend="italic">Urwesen,</hi> eternal being, or first cause; and the
                    account of theism excludes all reference to revelation, and applies to every
                    form of what has been regarded as deism. In recent theology deism has generally
                    come to be regarded as, in common with theism, holding in opposition to atheism
                    that there is a God, and in opposition to pantheism that God is distinct from
                    the world, but as differing from theism in maintaining that God is separate from
                    the world, having endowed it with self-sustaining and self-acting powers, and
                    then abandoned it to itself. This distinction is real, and perhaps the best
                    attainable. At the same time many called deists must be admitted not to have
                    taught deism thus understood; for example, most of the “English deists” did not
                    deny that God was present and active in the laws of nature, but merely denied
                    that He worked otherwise than through natural laws. If by deism be meant belief
                    in a personal God who acts only through natural laws, and by theism belief in a
                    personal God who acts both through natural laws and by special interventions,
                    this distinction also is real, and may be useful. The chief objection to it is
                    that deism when so contrasted with theism does not denote, or even include, what
                    theologians have generally agreed to call by the name.</p>
                <p>The present article will treat specially of theism in the sense of monotheism,
                    but not to the exclusion of the relations between theism thus understood and
                    theism in other acceptations.</p>
                <p>Monotheism has been very generally assumed to have been the primitive religion.
                    Lord Herbert, Cudworth, and others have elaborately defended this opinion in the
                    past, and it still finds learned advocates. On the other hand, the vast majority
                    of recent anthropologists hold that religion originated in some rude phase of
                    polytheism, and that monotheism has been everywhere preceded by polytheism.
                    Schelling, Max Müller, and Hartmann have maintained that the starting-point of
                    religion λvas <hi rend="italic">henotheism,</hi> an imperfect kind of
                    monotheism, in which God was thought of as one, only because others had not yet
                    presented themselves to the mind,—a monotheism of which polytheism was not the
                    contradiction, but the natural development. Pantheism has also been frequently
                    represented to be the earliest phase of religion. All these representations,
                    however, will be found on examination to be very conjectural. The present state
                    of our knowledge does not warrant our holding any view regarding the nature of
                    primeval religion as established. The data which carry us farthest in our search
                    for the historical origin of religion are undoubtedly the names expressive of
                    the Divine which have been preserved in the most ancient languages. They show us
                    how men conceived of the Divinity long before the erection of the oldest
                    monuments or the inscription of the oldest records. Language is much older than
                    any of the statements in language. But language by no means carries us back to
                    primitive man, or even to the historical origin of the idea of deity. The
                    Egyptian word <hi rend="italic">nutar</hi> and the names of the Egyptian gods
                    found in the oldest Egyptian inscriptions prove that at a date long before the
                    Egyptians wrote history, or are known to have worshipped animals or ancestors,
                    they conceived of Divinity as power, and their deities as great cosmic forces;
                    but, as that word and these names cannot be shown to have belonged to man’s
                    primitive speech, they cannot show what was man’s primitive religious belief,
                    and do not disprove that the forefathers of the people who first used them may
                    have had some lower and ruder conception of the Divine than that which they
                    convey. There are, according to Dr Legge, no words in the Chinese language known
                    to be older than <hi rend="italic">ti, t'ien, shaηg-ti,</hi> and these words are
                    good historical evidence that the Chinese conceived of the Divine, thousands of
                    years before the Christian era, as a universal ruling power, comprehending the
                    visible heavens, and an invisible, infinite, omnipresent force, manifested in
                    the azure of the firmament, possessed so far of intellectual and moral
                    qualities, and working towards ethical ends. There is no evidence that when the
                    Chinese first used these words they worshipped fetiches, but neither is there
                    evidence to the contrary, and even if there were it would not disprove that the
                    ancestors of the Chinese had passed through an era of fetichism. All members of
                    the Semitic family of languages have the word <hi rend="italic">El,</hi> or some
                    modification of it, to denote deity, and hence we may conclude that the Semites
                    had the word in this sense before they separated and became distinct peoples,
                    but not that the idea of God originated when the word was first thus employed.
                    All members of the Teutonic group of languages have the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >God,</hi> or some slightly modified form thereof, and all members of the Slavic
                    group of languages have the word <hi rend="italic">Bog,</hi> or some
                    modification thereof, to express the same conception: it does not follow that
                    either Teutons or Slavs had no idea of deity until the former so applied the
                    word <hi rend="italic">God,</hi> and the latter so applied the word <hi
                    rend="italic">Bog.</hi> Both Teutons and Slavs are Aryans, and there is an older
                    Aryan term for deity than either <hi rend="italic">God</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bog.</hi> The Sanscrit <hi rend="italic">deva,</hi> the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >deus,</hi> and the northern <hi rend="italic">ti, tivar,</hi> are forms of a
                    word which must have been used by the Aryans to express their idea of the Divine
                    when, in a prehistoric age, they lived together in their original home; but we
                    are not entitled to infer that even that prehistoric Aryan term is the oldest
                    word for deity. It may not be older than the primitive Semitic word or the
                    primitive Turanian word, or the <hi rend="italic">nutar</hi> of the Egyptians,
                    or the <hi rend="italic">t'ien</hi> of the Chinese, or the earliest designations
                    for the Divine in the earliest African and American languages. And there may
                    have been Divine names older than any of these. The science of language has been
                    able to reconstruct in part a prehistoric Aryan language, and may similarly be
                    able to reconstruct a prehistoric Semitic language, a prehistoric Turanian, and
                    perhaps a prehistoric Hamitic language. Should it proceed thus far it will
                    probably perceive that all these prehistoric languages arose out of a still
                    earlier prehistoric language in which also were words expressing ideas of the
                    Divine. There may be many strata of language buried too deep for human
                    excavation in the abysses of unrecorded time. By no possibility<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n253/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0253-0236"/>, therefore, can the analysis of existing
                    languages disclose to us the oldest name for deity or the historical origin of
                    the idea of deity. Geology shows the vast antiquity of man, and nothing proves
                    that he may not have been awed or comforted by thoughts of the Divine ages
                    before the invention of the oldest Aryan or Semitic words. It is merest
                    conjecture to assign the formation of the conception of deity to the dawn of
                    historic time. Between primitive speech, primitive religion, the primitive
                    condition of man, and the little streak of light called human history there
                    stretches an immeasurable expanse of darkness.</p>
                <p>The belief in primitive monotheism is generally rested on the authority of the
                    opening chapters of Genesis. It is, however, doubtful if the appeal to them be
                    legitimate, because doubtful if their strict historicity can be proved to those
                    who insist on judging them merely by critical and historical criteria, or even
                    if it can be fairly inferred from the view that they form part of a revelation.
                    Then, although these chapters plainly teach monotheism, and represent the God
                    whose words and acts are recorded in the Bible as no mere national God but the
                    only true God, they do not teach, what is alone in question, that there was a
                    primitive monotheism,—a monotheism revealed and known from the beginning. They
                    give no warrant to the common assumption that God revealed monotheism to Adam,
                    Noah, and others before the flood, and that the traces of monotheistic beliefs
                    and tendencies in heathendom are derivable from the tradition of this primitive
                    and antediluvian monotheism. The one true God is represented in Genesis as
                    making himself known by particular words and in particular ways to Adam, but is
                    nowhere said to have taught him that He only was God. Adam knew, of course, only
                    one God, as there was only one God to know; but that he knew there was only one
                    God we are not told, nor are any grounds given us even for conjecturing that he
                    knew it. We are told that God created the heavens and earth, but not that Adam
                    was told it, and we know too little about Adam to be able to conceive how he
                    could have understood the statement. We are informed that he knew God—the God
                    who manifested himself to him in particular acts, but not what general idea he
                    formed of God—whether henotheistic, pantheistic, or monotheistic, whether
                    definitely exclusive of polytheism or not, or in what measure anthropomorphic.
                    It is not otherwise as regards what is reported of Noah. In fact, primitive
                    monotheism is read into the records in Genesis only because they are read in an
                    inaccurate and uncritical manner. If read aright, it would be seen that, while
                    they speak much of how God acted towards man, they speak so extremely little as
                    to what early man knew of God that the appeal to them on behalf of the
                    hypothesis of primitive monotheism must be futile, even on the traditional view
                    of their authorship and historicity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>It is impossible to prove historically that monotheism was the primitive
                    religion. Were, then, the oldest known historical forms of religion
                    monotheistic? Many maintain they were, but adequate evidence has never been
                    adduced for the opinion. The oldest known religion is probably the Egyptian, and
                    for at least three thousand years its history can be traced by the aid of
                    authentic records contemporary with the facts to which they relate. Its origin,
                    however, is not disclosed by Egyptian history, and was unknown to the Egyptians
                    themselves. When it first appears in the light of history it has already a
                    definite form, a character not rude and simple, but of considerable elevation
                    and subtility, and is complex in contents, having certain great gods, but not so
                    many as in later times, ancestor-worship, but not so developed as in later
                    times, and animal worship, but very little of it as compared with later times.
                    For the opinion that its lower elements were older than the higher there is not
                    a particle of properly historical evidence,—not a trace in the inscriptions of
                    mere propitiation of ancestors, or of belief in the absolute divinity of kings
                    or animals; on the contrary, ancestors are always found propitiated through
                    prayer to some of the great gods, kings worshipped as emanations and images of
                    the sun-god, and the divine animals adored as divine symbols and incarnations.
                    The greater gods mentioned on the oldest tombs and in the oldest writings are
                    comparatively few, and their mere names—Osiris, Horus, Thoth, Seb, Nut, Anubis,
                    Apheru, Ra, Isis, Neith, Apis—conclusively prove that they were not ancient
                    kings or deceased ancestors, but chiefly powers of nature, and especially,
                    although not exclusively, of the heavens <hi rend="italic">; yet</hi> from the
                    earliest historical time they were regarded as not merely elemental, but as also
                    ethical powers, working indeed visibly and physically in the aspects and agents
                    of nature, yet in conformity to law and with intelligence and moral purpose.
                    Wherever the powers of nature are thus worshipped as gods, the feeling that the
                    separate powers are not all power, that the particular deities are not the whole
                    of divinity, must be entertained and will find expression. The Egyptians had
                    undoubtedly such a sense of the unity of the Divine from the dawn of their
                    history, and they expressed it so strongly in various ways from a very early
                    period that they have been pronounced monotheists not merely by theologians
                    attached to a traditional dogma but by most eminent Egyptologists—De Rougé,
                    Mariette, Brugsch, and Renouf. As these scholars, however, truthfully present
                    the facts, they satisfactorily refute themselves. A religion with about a dozen
                    great gods— distinct as regards their names, characteristics, histories,
                    relationships, symbols, and worship—is not monotheism in the ordinary or proper
                    sense of the term. A religion in which the Divine is viewed as merely immanent
                    in nature, and the deities deemed physical as well as moral, elemental as well
                    as ethical powers, is rather pantheistic than monotheistic. Further, all
                    assertions to the effect that the unity of the Divine is most emphatically
                    expressed in the earliest historical stages of the religion are contrary to the
                    evidence adduced even by those who make them. To quote Patah-Hotep as a proof of
                    the monotheism of the Egyptian religion in its oldest historical phase is as
                    uncritical as it would be to draw Homeric theology from the dialogues of Plato.
                    The Egyptian religion was a polytheism which implied monism; it was not
                    monotheism, which is exclusive of polytheism. Hence, notwithstanding frequent
                    approximations to monotheism, the general result of the development of its
                    monistic principles was pantheism, not monotheism. As to the ancient Chinese
                    religion, Dr Legge easily shows that Prof. Tiele’s description of it as “a
                    purified and organized worship of spirits, with a predominant fetichist
                    tendency,” has no historical warrant, but he fails completely to substantiate
                    his own view, namely, that it was a strict and proper monotheism. The names
                    T’ien and Ti afford no evidence that the early Chinese fathers regarded deity as
                    truly and properly spiritual and personal. It is not in the most ancient Chinese
                    writings that spirituality and personality <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n254/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0254-0237"/> are ascribed to T’ien, and such ascriptions are
                    exceptional in Chinese writings of any date. The great development of ancestor
                    worship in China has been largely due to the impersonal character of T’ien. The
                    arguments which have been adduced in support of the hypothesis of a primitive
                    Semitic monotheism are also insufficient. M. Renan’s belief in a monotheistic
                    instinct peculiar to the Semitic race has been so often and so convincingly
                    shown to be contradicted both by history and psychology that another refutation
                    of it might well be regarded as a mere slaying of the slain. Divine names like
                    El, Baal, Adon, and Melech, being the oldest terms in the Semitic languages
                    expressive of the Divinity, and having been retained through all the changes and
                    perversions of Semitic religion, have often been maintained to imply that
                    primitive Semitic belief was monotheistic. But in reality Baal, Melech, and Adon
                    were not names originally, or indeed at any time, given to the one Supreme God,
                    or exclusively to any particular god; on the contrary, they were titles
                    applicable to many different gods. The oldest historical form of Aryan
                    religion—the form in which the Vedas present it—is designated by Max Müller
                    henotheism, in opposition to the organized anthropomorphic polytheism to which
                    he restricts the term polytheism, but henotheism thus understood includes
                    polytheism in its wider and more ordinary acceptation, while it excludes
                    monotheism properly so called. The oldest known form of Aryan religion was
                    indubitably polytheistic in the sense of being the worship of various
                    nature-deities; and everything approximating to monotheism in India, Persia,
                    Greece, and other Aryan-peopled lands was the product of later and more advanced
                    thought. The assertion that history everywhere or even anywhere shows religious
                    belief to have commenced with monotheism is not only unsupported by evidence,
                    but contrary to evidence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    mentioned.</p></note></p>
                <p>While the oldest known religions of the world were thus not forms of monotheism,
                    neither were they mere polytheisms, wholly devoid of monistic and monotheistic
                    germs and tendencies. The Chinese religion, indeed, can hardly be said to have
                    been at any period a polytheism, the Chinese people no more regarding spirits
                    and deceased ancestors as gods than Roman Catholics so regard angels and saints.
                    They have throughout their whole known history explicitly and clearly
                    acknowledged the unity of the Divine—the uniqueness of T’ien (Ti, Shang-Ti). Had
                    they in like manner acknowledged the spirituality, personality, transcendence of
                    the Divine, their monotheism would have been indubitable. Then, even in those
                    ancient religions, where a plurality of deities is apparent, a sense of the
                    unity of the Divine is notwithstanding implied, and in the course of their
                    development comes to expression in various ways. It could not be otherwise, for
                    in these religions the divine powers (deities) are also powers of nature, and
                    hence sprung from and participant in a mysterious common nature, an ultimate and
                    universal agency which is at once the source of physical and divine existences
                    and forces. Neither nature-deities nor powers of nature are ever conceived of,
                    or indeed can be conceived of, as entirely distinct and independent. The lowest
                    forms of polytheism, such as fetichism and animism, have no more marked
                    characteristic than the indefiniteness of their idea of the Divine and the
                    imperfect individualization of their deities. In the highest forms of
                    nature-worship, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Vedic, Egyptian, and Baby
                    Ionian-Assyrian, the same trait is perceptible. This implicit monism of
                    natureworship may, through the action of various causes, come to explicit
                    utterance in diverse modes, and has in fact done so, with the result that even
                    in the oldest known polytheisms are to be found remarkable approximations to
                    monotheism. One form of approximation was henotheism. When worship is ardent and
                    earnest the particular god worshipped is apt to have ascribed to him the
                    attributes, as it were, of all the gods—an almost absolute and exclusive
                    godhead. Max Müller has shown how prominent a phenomenon henotheism is in the
                    Vedas. Page Renouf has shown that it is very conspicuous also in the ancient
                    inscriptions and hymns of Egypt. Horus, Ra, Osiris, Amun, Knum, were severally
                    spoken of as if each were absolute God, invested not only with distinctive
                    divine attributes but with all divine attributes. In the religious records of
                    Babylon and Assyria monotheistic approximations of the same kind are likewise
                    common. Now, in themselves such monotheistic modes of expression may truly be
                    held to be the products of passing moods of mind, not reflexions of permanent
                    conviction. But every mood of mind tends to perpetuate itself, and the
                    enthusiasm of piety which utters itself in henotheistic praises and prayers may
                    take abiding possession of the soul of a powerful ruler or even of the hearts of
                    a whole class of society or of a whole people, and may seem to them to find the
                    strongest possible confirmation in experience. We may illustrate from Assyrian
                    religious history. Tiglath-Pileser showed a marked preference for the worship of
                    Asshur, to him “king of all the gods,” “he who rules supreme over the gods.”
                    Nebuchadnezzar, again, showed a great partiality for the god Merodach, and
                    applied exclusively to him such magnificent titles as “the lord of all beings,”
                    “the lord of the house of the gods,” “the lord of lords,” “the lord of the
                    gods,” “the king of heaven and earth.” Nabonidus, on the other hand, specially
                    revered Sin, the moon-god, and represented him as “the great divinity,” “the
                    king of gods upon gods,” “the chief and king of the gods of heaven and earth.” A
                    preference of this kind might arise from some merely accidental or personal
                    cause, and be confirmed by experiences mainly individual, and yet have a vast
                    historical influence. The devotional choice of a people must tend, however,
                    still more than that of any monarch to the elevation of one god towards absolute
                    godhead. It was accordingly what raised Asshur, the special national god of the
                    Assyrians, to the head of the Babylonian-Assyrian pantheon during the Assyrian
                    period. In a struggle of deities for supremacy the national god has an immense
                    advantage in that he has both the piety and the patriotism of the people on his
                    side. His rule is identified with providence; he is credited with all the
                    victories and successes of the nation; and his power and godhead seem certified
                    by fact and experience. The logic of events in every advancing nation combines
                    with the essential tendencies of piety and with the growth of conscience and
                    reason to promote belief in the unity and perfection of the Divine. The general
                    course of providence is no more polytheistic than it is atheistic. The best
                    exemplification of the operation of the piety of an influential class in
                    transcending polytheism is Brahmanism. But for the impulse given by Brahmanical
                    piety Brahmanical speculation would never have reduced the Vedic gods to
                    manifestations of Brahma. Henotheistic forms of approximation to monotheism are
                    not, however, the only ones. Particular gods —all of them—may be dropped out of
                    view, and the generic thought of God alone retained. The mind and <pb break="no"

                    to the power of the powers, the God in the gods, God simply, the Divinity. The
                    formation of names expressing Divinity in the abstract is an evidence of the
                    existence of such a process, and names of the kind are to be found even among
                    very rude peoples. But there are more obvious and conclusive indications. In one
                    of the most ancient of books, for example, and probably the oldest manuscript in
                    the world, the maxims of Patah-Hotep, a wise Egyptian prince of the fifth
                    dynasty, God simply <hi rend="italic">(nutar)</hi> is often spoken of without a
                    name or any mythological characteristic, and in a way which is in itself quite
                    monotheistic. “If any one beareth himself proudly he will be humbled by God, who
                    maketh his strength.” “If thou art a wise man, bring up thy son in the love of
                    God.” “God loveth the obedient, and hateth the disobedient.” Sentences like
                    these standing alone would be pronounced by every one monotheistic; and even
                    when standing alongside of references to “gods” and “powers” they show that said
                    gods and powers were not deemed by the Egyptian sage inconsistent with oneness
                    of power and godhead or exhaustive of their fulness. In Babylonian-Assyrian
                    religious history there are also distinct traces of the rise of the spirits of
                    worshippers above particular deities, simply to deity. Sometimes they appear
                    with special clearness in connexions which tell of awakened and afflicted
                    conscience, of the pressure of a sense of sin and guilt forcing on the heart, as
                    it were, a conviction of One with whom it has to deal, of its need of the
                    forgiveness and favour, not of this god or of that, but of God. The following
                    passage may be cited as an instance. “O my Lord, my sins are many, my trespasses
                    are great, and the wrath of the gods has plagued me with disease, and with
                    sickness and sorrow. I fainted, but no one stretched forth his hand! I groaned,
                    but no one heard! O Lord, do not abandon Thy servant; in the waters of the great
                    stream do Thou take his hand; the sins which he has committed do Thou turn to
                    righteousness.” Many parallel passages might be drawn from Hindu, Greek, and
                    other sources. Clearness of moral perception is decidedly favourable to
                    monotheistic belief. The practical reason contributes as well as the speculative
                    reason, and precisely in the measure of its healthiness and vigour, to the
                    formation of a true idea of the Divine. It was due more to their moral
                    earnestness and insight than to their intellectual superiority that the Persians
                    came nearer to monotheism than any other people of heathen antiquity. Ahriman
                    was entirely evil, and therefore only to be hated and combated; while Ahuramazd
                    was absolutely divine, perfectly good, and therefore to be supremely worshipped
                    and obeyed. This moral dualism approached more closely to true monotheism than
                    the later speculative monism, which placed above both Ahuramazd and Ahriman
                    Zervanakarene, boundless time, indeterminate being, an ethically indifferent
                    destiny. Finally, reason in striving to understand and explain the world tends
                    towards monotheism. The mind cannot be expected to recognize the unity of God
                    until it recognizes the unity of nature; when it sees nature to be a whole, a
                    universe or cosmos, it cannot but form a conception of it which will be
                    pantheistic, if the unity of substance, law, and evolution be alone
                    acknowledged, and monotheistic if a unity of causality, rational plan, and
                    ethical purpose be also apprehended. In the measure in which reason advances
                    either on the path of scientific investigation or of philosophical speculation,
                    polytheism must retreat and disappear; in the measure in which it discerns
                    unity, order, system, moral government, indications of spiritual character and
                    design in the world, monotheism must rise and spread. Now, in the chief
                    progressive heathen nations reason, it can be proved, has gradually gained on
                    imagination. Hence the polytheisms which they built up in their youth have been
                    undermined and broken down by them in their maturity.<note anchored="true"

                <p>A monotheistic movement can be clearly traced in ancient Greece. The popular
                    religion of Greece, as it appeared in the Homeric poems, was as distinctly
                    polytheistic and as little monotheistic as any known religion. Its gods were all
                    finite, begotten, and thoroughly individualized beings. The need of unity was
                    responded to only by the supremacy of Zeus, and Zeus was subject to destiny,
                    surrounded by an aristocracy far from orderly or obedient, and participant in
                    weakness, folly, and vice. To its eternal honour the Greek spirit, however, was
                    not content with so inadequate a conception of the Divine, but laboured to
                    amend, enlarge, and elevate it. The poets and dramatists of Greece purified and
                    ennobled the popular myths, and, in particular, so idealized the character and
                    agency of Zeus as to render them accordant with a true conception of the
                    Godhead. The Zeus of Aeschylus and of Sophocles was not only not the Zeus of
                    Homer, but was a god belief in whom was inconsistent with belief in any of the
                    Homeric gods. The dramatists of Greece did not assail the popular conception of
                    Divinity, but they substituted for it one which implied that it was without
                    warrant or excuse. They developed the germs of monotheism in the Greek religion,
                    while leaving untouched its polytheistic assumptions and affirmations. These,
                    however, were not only persistently undermined, but often directly attacked by
                    the philosophers, some of whom eventually reached a reasoned knowledge of the
                    one absolute Mind. Xenophanes, Empedocles, and Anaxagoras were among the
                    pre-Socratic philosophers who, on grounds of reason, rejected the polytheism and
                    anthropomorphism of the current mythology, and advocated belief in one
                    allperfect divine nature. Socrates, although avoiding all attacks on the popular
                    religion calculated to weaken the popular reverence for divine things, had real
                    faith only in the one supreme Reason, the source and end of all things; and the
                    best representatives of later Greek philosophy were in this respect his
                    followers. Plato attained by his dialectic a conception of God which will always
                    deeply interest thoughtful men. God he deemed the highest object of knowledge
                    and love, the source of all being, cognoscibility, truth, excellence, and
                    beauty,—the One, the Good. The controversy as to whether his conception may be
                    more correctly designated theistic or pantheistic will, perhaps, never be
                    brought to a decisive conclusion, but in its general truth and grandeur it must
                    be admitted far to transcend either the monotheism of the vulgar or any popular
                    form of pantheism. Aristotle’s characteristic cautiousness of judgment showed
                    itself in the very meagreness of his theology. The representation which he gives
                    of God hardly meets at all the demands of affection and of practical life, yet
                    so far as it goes will be generally regarded as thoroughly reasonable. It is
                    more unequivocally theistic than that of Plato. It sets forth God as without
                    plurality and without parts; free from matter, contingency, change, and
                    development; the eternal unmoved mover, whose essence is pure energy; absolute

                    likeness is the goal towards which the whole universe tends. Stoicism was
                    originally and predominantly a materialistic or hylozoic form of pantheism; but
                    some of its greatest representatives conceived of God in a decidedly theistic
                    manner as the supreme moral reason. The beautiful hymn of Cleanthes to Zeus is
                    full of the purest devotional feeling, springing from a clear sense of personal
                    relationship to the one all-ruling personal Spirit. Greek philosophy proceeded
                    throughout its whole course in entire independence of the popular polytheism,
                    and was a continuous demonstration of its futility; and it largely contributed
                    to that reasoned natural knowledge of God which must underlie all rational
                    belief in revelation. It discerned in some measure all the chief arguments which
                    have since been employed as theistic proofs. It failed, however, to conceive of
                    God as truly creative, or of the universe as in its very substance the result of
                    divine action; it failed also to make evident, even to cultured minds, the
                    superiority of monotheism to pantheism and scepticism; and it failed especially
                    to convert the common people to faith in one sole Deity.<note anchored="true"

                    critical and historical investigations into which we cannot here enter (see <hi

                <p>The science of Old Testament theology, giving due heed to the results of
                    critical, historical, and exegetical research regarding the documents with which
                    it deals, has to trace by what means and through what stages Hebrew monotheism
                    was developed and established; and to the treatises on this science our readers
                    must be referred. The monotheistic movement in Israel was one of continuous
                    progress through incessant conflict until a result was reached of incalculable
                    value to humanity. That result was a faith in God singularly comprehensive,
                    sublime, and practical,— a faith which rested, not on speculation and reasoning,
                    but on a conviction of God having directly revealed Himself to the spirits of
                    men, and which, while ignoring metaphysical theorizing, ascribed to God all
                    metaphysical as well as moral perfections; a faith which, in spite of its
                    simplicity, so apprehended the relationship of God to nature as neither to
                    confound them like pantheism nor to separate them like deism, but to assert both
                    the immanence and the transcendence of the divine; a faith in a living and
                    personal God, the almighty and sole creator, preserver, and ruler of the world
                    <hi rend="italic">; a</hi> faith, especially, in a God holy in all His ways and
                    righteous in all His works, who was directing and guiding human affairs to a
                    destination worthy of His own character; and, therefore, an essentially ethical,
                    elevating, and hopeful faith. The existence of utterances in the Hebrew
                    Scriptures which show that Hebrew faith was not always thus enlightened, and
                    sometimes conceived of God as partial and cruel, is no reason for not
                    acknowledging the general justice and grandeur of its representation of the

                <p>The God of the Old Testament is also the God of the New. Christ and the apostles
                    accepted what Moses and the prophets had taught concerning God; they assigned
                    to</p>
                <p>Him no other attributes than had already been assigned to Him. Like Moses and the
                    prophets also they made no attempt formally to prove the existence or logically
                    to define the nature of God, but spoke of Him either as from vision or
                    inspiration. And yet their doctrine of God has original and peculiar features.
                    Thus, first, the fatherhood of God was taught with incomparable distinctness and
                    fulness by Jesus Christ,—a fatherhood not merely of natural creation or national
                    election, but of spiritual relationship of love, sympathy, mercy, and grace for
                    individual souls. Such fatherhood, if acknowledged at all, was only very rarely
                    and vaguely acknowledged in heathendom, and, although not wholly absent from the
                    Old Testament, is far from clearly and prominently there, and, indeed, is
                    present chiefly by implication in passages which refer directly only to God’s
                    connexion with the people of Israel, as an elect and covenant people; it is
                    conspicuous and central, however, in the conception of God introduced by
                    Christianity. Secondly, Divine fatherhood had its correlate in Divine sonship.
                    God is represented in the New Testament as revealing His fatherhood through His
                    Son, Jesus Christ. In Old Testament representations of Israel, the Messiah, and
                    Wisdom, and in the Logos doctrine of Judaeo-Alexandrian philosophy, some
                    approximations to this conception of the Divine may be traced, but they fell far
                    short of it. According to the New Testament, God is not merely infinitely
                    exalted above the world and definitely distinguished therefrom, nor merely
                    immanent and everywhere operative in nature, but also incarnate in Christ; and
                    Christ is not merely “the Son of man,” essentially sharing in humanity and truly
                    representing it before God, but also “the Son of God,” essentially sharing in
                    Divinity, and giving the fullest disclosure of it to man. The foundation of the
                    Christian faith as laid down in the New Testament is that Christ through His
                    unique relation as Son to the Father perfectly declared and expressed the nature
                    and will of God in relation to human salvation. Thirdly, God is exhibited in the
                    New Testament as the Spirit, the Holy Ghost, who dwells in the spirits of men,
                    to work in them the will of the Father, and to conform them to the image of the
                    Son. Only when thus exhibited can the revelation of the Divine name be regarded
                    from the New Testament point of view as other than manifestly incomplete. Even
                    the manifestation of God in Christ, being objective and single, must be
                    supplemented by a manifestation which is subjective and multiple, before the one
                    God, the one Christ, can find a place in the manifoldness of souls, the
                    multitude of separate hearts and lives. The manifestation of the Spirit is such
                    a manifestation, and completes in principle the revelation of the Christian idea
                    of God, the revelation of His threefold nature and name. This revelation
                    completed God can be thought of as absolute spirit, absolute love, absolute
                    good, and was, to some extent explicitly, and throughout implicitly, so
                    represented in the New Testament. It is precisely in virtue of the threefold
                    representation of God characteristic of the New Testament that Christianity is
                    still held by so many of the world’s profoundest thinkers as the absolute and
                    perfect religion, the crown and consummation of religion,—speculatively
                    considered, an absolute revelation of God, and practically considered, a perfect
                    salvation,—within which there may be infinite evolution and progress, but beyond
                    which there can be no true light or real growth.<note anchored="true"

                    the early Christians. It was not an ontological or even theological doctrine,
                    and will be identified by no competent exegete with the dogma of the Divine
                    Trinity set forth in the oecumenical creeds. The propositions constitutive of
                    the dogma of the Trinity—the propositions in the symbols of Nice,
                    Constantinople, and Toledo relative to the immanent distinctions and relations
                    in the Godhead— were not drawn directly from the New Testament, and could not be
                    expressed in New Testament terms. They were the products of reason speculating
                    on a revelation to faith—the New Testament representation of God as a father, a
                    redeemer, and a sanctifier—with a view to conserve and vindicate, explain and
                    comprehend it. They were only formed through centuries of effort, only
                    elaborated by the aid of the conceptions and formulated in the terms of Greek
                    and Roman metaphysics. The evolution of the doctrine of the Trinity was far the
                    most important fact in the doctrinal history of the church during the first five
                    centuries of its post-apostolic existence. To trace and describe it fully would
                    be almost to exhibit the history of Christian thought during these centuries. It
                    had necessarily an immense influence on the development of theism. The
                    acceptance of the catholic doctrine of the Trinity implied the rejection of
                    pantheism, of abstract monotheism, of all forms of monarch ianism or
                    unitarianism. It decided that theistic development was not to be on these lines
                    or in these directions. At the same time the dogma itself was a seed for new
                    growths of theistic thought, and demanded a development consistent with its own
                    nature. It is a doctrine, not as to the manifestations and revelations of
                    Godhead, but as to their ground and explanation, the constitution of Godhead, a
                    doctrine as to a trinity of essence, which accounts for the Trinity of the
                    gospel dispensation. It affirms the unity of God, but requires us to conceive of
                    His unity, not as an abstract or indeterminate self-identity, not as “sterile,
                    monotonous simplicity,” but as a unity rich in distinctions and perfections,—
                    the unity of an infinite fulness of life and love, the unity of a Godhead in
                    which there are Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a trinity of persons, a diversity
                    of properties, a variety of offices, a multiplicity of operations, yet sameness
                    of nature, equality of power and glory, oneness in purpose and affection,
                    harmony of will and work. It finds its dogmatic expression as to what is
                    ultimate in it in the formula—One substance in three persons, of which the first
                    eternally generates the second, and the third eternally proceeds from the first
                    and second. Now, manifestly, however much such a doctrine as this may have
                    satisfied thought on a revelation as to the Godhead, it cannot have exhausted or
                    completed it. If it answered certain questions it raised others, and these more
                    speculative and profound than those which had been answered. What is meant by
                    affirming God to be “substance” or “in three persons”? What is meant by divine
                    “generation” or “procession”? How are the substance and persons related? How are
                    the persons distinguished and interrelated? These and many kindred and connected
                    questions reason became bound to discuss by its adoption of the doctrine of the
                    Trinity. This obligation could only be temporarily and partially evaded or
                    concealed by representing the doctrine as “a mystery” to be accepted simply on
                    authority or with blind faith. Data of the doctrine may have been given to
                    faith, but the doctrine itself was the work of reason, and on no ground not
                    plainly absurd could that work be held to have terminated in 589 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d. As</hi> soon as an inspired record is left at all, as soon
                    as any speculation is allowed on its contents, as soon as the process of forming
                    doctrine is permitted to begin, all conceivable right to stop the movement
                    anywhere is lost. By the blending, however, of trinitarianism with theism the
                    whole character of the latter was, of necessity, profoundly changed. A
                    trinitarian theism must be vastly different from a Unitarian as regards
                    practice. It must be equally so as regards theory. It must be far more
                    speculative. By its very nature it is bound to undertake speculative labours in
                    which a simply Unitarian theism will feel no call to engage.<note

                <p>It was the general conviction of the early Christian writers that formal proofs
                    of the Divine existence were neither necessary nor useful. In their view the
                    idea of God was native to the soul, the knowledge of God intuitive, the mind of
                    man a mirror in which, if not rusted by sin, God could not fail to be reflected.
                    The design argument, however, came early into use and was frequently employed.
                    More speculative modes of reasoning were resorted to by Dionysius of Tarsus,
                    Augustine, and Boetius. The unity of God had to be incessantly affirmed against
                    polytheists, Gnostics, and Manichaeans. The incomprehensibility of God and His
                    cognoscibility were both maintained, although each was sometimes so emphasized
                    as to seem to obscure the other. That the knowledge of God may be reached by the
                    three ways of <hi rend="italic">causality, negation,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >eminence</hi> was implied by the pseudo-Dionysius, although only explicitly
                    announced by Scotus. Neither any systematic treatment of the Divine attributes
                    nor any elaborate discussion of single attributes was attempted. The hypothesis
                    of eternal creation found a vigorous defender in Origen, but met with the same
                    fate as the dualist hypothesis of uncreated matter and the pantheistic
                    hypothesis of emanation. Of all the patristic theologians Augustine was
                    undoubtedly the most philosophical apologist and exponent of theism. He alone
                    attempted to refute agnosticism, and to find a basis for the knowledge of God in
                    a doctrine of cognition in general. On the large, difficult, and as yet far from
                    adequately investigated subject, the influence of Platonic and Aristotelian,
                    Stoic and Academic, Neopythagorean and Neoplatonic speculation on the formation
                    of the Christian <hi rend="italic">doctrina</hi><hi rend="italic">de Deo,</hi>

                <p>Mohammed (570-632) founded a monotheistic religion which spread with amazing
                    rapidity through Arabia, Syria, Persia, North Africa, and Spain, and gave,
                    almost wherever it spread, a mighty impulse to the minds and wills of men. It
                    was received as the gift of special inspiration and revelation, although its
                    creed contained little of moment on which reason would seem to be incompetent to
                    decide. It had obvious merits, and must be admitted to have rendered real and
                    important services to culture, religion, and humanity, but had also conspicuous
                    faults, which have done much injury to individual, domestic, and national life.
                    If the latest were always the best, it would be the most perfect of the three
                    great theistic religions of the world; but it is, in fact, the least developed
                    and most defective. Instead of evolving and extending, it marred and mutilated
                    the theistic idea which it borrowed. Instead of representing God as possessed of
                    all spiritual fulness and perfections, it exhibited Him as devoid of the
                    divinest spiritual attributes. It recognized His transcendent exaltation above
                    His creatures, but not His sympathetic presence with His creatures; apprehended
                    vividly His almighty power, His eternity, His omnipresence and omniscience, but
                    only vaguely and dimly His moral glory, His love and goodness, His righteousness

                    essentially despotic will, and so fell far below the Jahveh of Moses,
                    essentially righteousness, and the Heavenly Father of Christ, essentially holy
                    love. Mohammedanism is almost as contrary to Christianity as one form of theism
                    can be to another. It is as unitarian as Christianity is trinitarian. Its
                    cardinal tenet is as distinctly anti-trinitarian as anti-polytheistic. It has
                    often been represented as having had the providential task assigned it of
                    preparing the way for Christianity by destroying polytheism; in reality, it has
                    hitherto offered a far more stubborn resistance to Christianity than any
                    polytheistic religion has done.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The mediaeval world was so complex, so full of contrasts and contradictions, that
                    it cannot be “summed up in a formula.” Most general statements current regarding
                    it will be found on examination only partially true. It is often described as
                    the age in which external religious authority ruled, and all religious thought
                    ran in narrow, strictly prescribed paths, whereas, in fact, the mediaeval
                    theologians were far freer to speculate on almost all points of religious
                    doctrine than Protestant divines have been. Because traditionalism abounded, it
                    is forgotten that rationalism also abounded; because scholasticism flourished,
                    that mysticism was prevalent; because theism was common, that pantheism,
                    speculative and practical, was not uncommon. The Middle Age was, however, <hi
                    rend="italic">par excellence,</hi> the age of theology. Theology never before or
                    since so interested and dominated the human intellect. Nearly every eminent
                    mediaeval thinker was a theologian. The chief streams of theistic belief and
                    speculation which traversed the Middle Age were three,—the Christian, Jewish,
                    and Mohammedan. The first was much the broadest and fullest. Few points of
                    theistic doctrine were left unhandled by the Christian divines of the Middle
                    Age. The conclusions came to on the chief points were various and divergent. As
                    to the manner in which God is known, for instance, some laid stress on faith or
                    authoritative revelation · others on immediate consciousness, the direct vision
                    of the pure in heart, the illumination of the Spirit of God in the minds and
                    hearts of the true children of God; others on reason and proof; and some
                    attempted mediation and synthesis. Anselm gave logical form to an <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> argument for the Divine existence based on the idea
                    of God as a being than whom a greater cannot be conceived. His most ingenious
                    attempt to demonstrate the absurdity of supposing the perfect, the infinite, to
                    be a mere subjective fiction prepared the way for the multitude of attempts,
                    identical or similar in aim, which have since been made. Thomas Aquinas was the
                    best representative of those who hèld that the invisible God was only to be
                    known through His visible works. He argued from motion to a mover, from effect
                    to cause, from the contingent to the necessary, from lower kinds of good to a
                    supreme good, and from order and purpose in the world to a governing
                    intelligence. Raymond of Sebonde added to the ontological and
                    physico-teleological arguments a moral argument. William of Occam criticized
                    keenly and un-favoùrably both the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> proofs, and held that the existence of God was
                    not a known truth but merely an article of faith. There was not less diversity
                    of view as to how far God may be known. Erigena held that even God Himself could
                    not comprehend His own nature, and Eckhart that the nature of God is necessarily
                    unknowable, as being a nature without nature, without predicates, without
                    opposites, pure oneness. That man cannot know God’s real nature, cannot know Him
                    <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">essentiam,</hi> cannot have a <hi
                    rend="italic">quidditiva</hi><hi rend="italic">cognitio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dei,</hi> and that the so-called attributes of God are only descriptive of the
                    effects of His operations as they appear to the human mind, or even are merely
                    symbols or metaphors, was maintained by many of the scholastic doctors. Aquinas,
                    for example, with all his confidence as a dogmatic systembuilder, so denied the
                    cognoscibility of God. That the human mind may have a true, although it cannot
                    have a perfect knowledge of God,—an apprehensive but not a comprehensive
                    knowledge of Him,—was, however, in the Middle Age, as it has been ever since,
                    the position most commonly taken up. The scholastic divines discussed a
                    multitude of foolish questions regarding God, but that was not due to
                    extravagant faith in the power of the human mind to know or comprehend God.
                    Prof. Sheldon very justly says, “on the whole, the scholastic theology,
                    notwithstanding some strong negative statements, assumes in reality a minimum of
                    acquaintanceship with the essential nature of God.” The negative statements are,
                    for the most part, those of the mystics with respect to the beatific vision.
                    Mediaeval discussions as to the nature of God turned chiefly on two points,—the
                    relation of the Divine essence to the Divine attributes and of the one Divine
                    substance to the three Divine persons. The conclusion come to by the vast
                    majority of scho!astic theologians on the first point was that the attributes
                    were not really or objectively in God, but merely human representations
                    reflected, as it were, on the idea of God, because the mental constitution of
                    man is what it is, and because God wished to be thought of in certain divers
                    manners. To hold them objectively real in God, and therefore intrinsically
                    distinct either from the essence of God or from one another, was considered to
                    be incompatible both with the incomprehensibility and with the absolute
                    simplicity of the Divine nature. Duns Scotus, in maintaining that the attributes
                    were <hi rend="italic">formalitates</hi><hi rend="italic">realiter</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">distinctae,</hi> took up an exceptional position. On the other
                    point the conclusion as generally reached was one seemingly quite inconsistent
                    with the foregoing, namely, that the persons were objectively and eternally real
                    and distinct. The discrepancy is especially apparent in those theologians <hi
                    rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> Anselm, Abelard, Hugo and Richard of St Victor,
                    Alexander of Hales, and Aquinas) who represented the persons of the Trinity as
                    corresponding to distinctions among the very attributes which they in another
                    reference denied to be distinct. The mediaeval schoolmen, with very few and
                    doubtful exceptions, conjoined with their theism the doctrine of the Trinity as
                    defined by the ancient church. Roscelin of Compiègne and Gilbert de la Porrée
                    laid themselves open to the charge of tritheism; and obviously nominalism, by
                    allowing nothing but a nominal existence to the essence or general nature of
                    which the individual is a specimen, tended towards tritheism,—towards resolving
                    the Trinity into a triad of Divine individuals or selfsubsistent beings,
                    connected only by a common specific character. While the schoolmen accepted the
                    doctrine of the Trinity on authority, they did not conceive themselves precluded
                    from endeavouring to illustrate it and to make it appear as consonant to reason
                    as possible. They sought to show its consistency with the unity of God, and its
                    general reasonableness by various speculative considerations, but especially by
                    the aid of analogies drawn from the constitution of the mind and even from
                    particular physical phenomena. They did not suppose that they were thereby
                    demonstrating the doctrine of the Trinity: they fully recognized that doctrine
                    to be the indication of a mystery, “dark with excess of light,” and the truth of
                    which could only be directly apprehended in the beatific vision conferred by the
                    highest and most special grace; but they proceeded on the belief that, inasmuch
                    as it was a central truth of revelation, the whole creation, and.</p>

                <p>above all, the nature and essence of man’s spirit, must bear witness to it. At
                    least one good result followed. Those who exercised their minds on the doctrine
                    of the Trinity were necessarily led in some measure to form another idea of God
                    than that of either an indeterminate unity or a confused synthesis of
                    attributes,—to think of Him, with some clearness and steadiness, in an organic
                    and harmonious manner, as absolute being, absolute life, absolute spirit,
                    absolute intelligence, absolute love. Such thought as this distinctly appeared
                    in Anselm, the St Victors, Aquinas, Bonaventura, Dante, &amp;c. The
                    omnipresence, omnipotence, and omniscience of God, and, generally, what are
                    called His metaphysical and intellectual attributes, were discussed with
                    excessive elaborateness and subtlety, while His moral attributes were left in
                    the background, or considered without sufficient earnestness or insight. The
                    problems regarding the relationship of the Divine attributes to human agency,
                    and, in particular, as to the compatibility of Divine prescience and
                    predestination with human freedom and responsibility, were even too laboriously
                    and minutely debated between the mediaeval Augustinians and their opponents.
                    What the disputants on both sides lacked was intellectual humility. They strode
                    along “dim and perilous ways” as if they were in plain and safe paths, or as if
                    their own faculties were superhuman. As to the general relation of God to the
                    universe, few, if any, of the schoolmen can be charged with deism. While
                    assigning to God a being and life transcending the universe, they also affirmed
                    that He was everywhere in the universe, everywhere wholly present, everywhere
                    essentially and actively present. Pantheism was prevalent all through the Middle
                    Ages, but only two of its representatives, perhaps—Erigena and Eckhart,— showed
                    much speculative capacity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Mohammedan theism drew chiefly from faith and fanaticism the force which carried
                    it onwards with such rapidity in its early career of conquest. At the same time
                    it powerfully stimulated reason, as soon appeared in remarkable intellectual
                    achievements. Of course, reason could not fail to reflect on the contents of the
                    faith by which it had been awakened. The result was the formation of many
                    schools of religious opinion. So far as our subject is concerned, however, all
                    mediaeval Mohammedan thinkers may be ranked as philosophers, theologians, or
                    mystics. The philosophers derived little of their doctrine from Mohammed. Even
                    in what they taught regarding God they followed mainly Aristotle, and in some
                    measure the Neoplatonists. They maintained the unity of God, but conceived of it
                    in a way unknown to Mohammed, namely, as a unity allowing of the reality of no
                    distinctions, qualities, or attributes in God. Then, although they affirmed the
                    unity of God in the strictest abstract manner, they were not monists but
                    dualists, inasmuch as they denied creation <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nihilo,</hi> and asserted the eternity of matter. The mode in
                    which they supposed the multiplicity of finite things to have been produced from
                    God was by a series of emanations originating in Divine intelligence, not in
                    Divine will. Their proofs of the Divine existence were, for the most part,
                    founded on the principle of causality. The philosophers did not openly oppose
                    the theism of the Koran, but they ignored it or set it aside, and represented it
                    as only a useful popular faith, not a response to the demands of cultured
                    reason. The “theologians,” on the other hand, took their stand upon the Koran,
                    sought to defend and develop into doctrine its representations of God, and to
                    show the inconclusiveness and inconsistencies of the teaching of the
                    philosophers regarding God. Even those of them, however, who exalted faith and
                    revelation most—the orthodox Motakallemin or Asharites—by no means dispensed
                    with philosophy and reason. It was chiefly on the metaphysical hypothesis of the
                    atomic constitution of matter that they rested their proofs of the Divine
                    existence. It was by subtle reasonings that they sought to establish the
                    non-eternity of matter and the unity and immateriality of God. It was on
                    speculative grounds that they contended God had eternally possessed all the
                    attributes ascribed to Him in the Koran. Their predestinationism was as
                    logically elaborated as that of the Augustinian scholastics. There flourished
                    for a short period a school of liberal Mohammedan theologians, the Motazil-ites,
                    who, while accepting the two fundamental doctrines of Islam—the unity of God and
                    the divine mission of Mohammed,—refused to regard the Koran as an absolute
                    religious authority, and sought to transform Mohammedanism into a reasonable and
                    ethical monotheism. They insisted on the rightful conformity of faith to reason,
                    on human freedom, and on the righteousness as well as the unity of God. They
                    endeavoured, in fact, to substitute for a God whose essence was absolute or
                    arbitrary will a God whose essence was justice. This meant, however, not to
                    develop or even reform, but to subvert and displace the Mohammedan idea of God,
                    and the wonder is, not that they failed in so arduous a task, but that they had
                    the courage to undertake it. Mohammedan mysticism (Sufism) was a reaction,
                    chiefly of the Persian mind, against the narrowness and harshness of the
                    monotheism of the Arabian prophet. Unlike philosophy, it was not a mere exotic,
                    but an indigenous growth within the Mohammedan area, and hence orthodoxy has
                    never been able to eradicate it. It has been the chief support of spiritual
                    feeling and the chief source of poetry in Mohammedan lands. It still flourishes,
                    has branches innumerable, and through its poets has shed seed widely even over
                    Christendom. The mystics refuse to think of God as an arbitrary unlimited Will,
                    separate and apart from everything; as one who reveals Himself clearly only
                    through the words of a prophet; as a being before whom man is mere dust and
                    ashes, and who demands no higher service than fear, unquestioning faith, and
                    outward obedience. In their view God is immanent in all things, expresses
                    Himself through all things, and is the essence of every human soul. There is not
                    only no God but God, but no being, life, or spirit except the being, life, and
                    spirit of God; and every man may be God’s prophet, and more even than His
                    prophet. For a man to know God is to see that God is immanent in himself, and
                    that he is one with God, the universal life which breathes through all things.
                    Such knowledge or vision must glorify all nature, and must dilate and rejoice
                    the heart of him who possesses it. Joy and ecstacy must characterize the worship
                    of the Sufi. A religious scepticism based on philosophical scepticism—disbelief
                    in the existence of God grounded on disbelief in any truth not guaranteed by
                    sense or mathematical demonstration—was not unknown among the Saracens, although
                    no work in defence of it has come down to us, and perhaps none may have been
                    written.</p>

                    God, yet cherished an ardent and exalted faith in God, based partly on the Koran
                    and partly on mystic contemplation and devout experience.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Jewish and Mohammedan religious thought were intimately connected in the Middle
                    Age, and ran a nearly parallel course. The Rabbanites and the Karaites of
                    Judaism corresponded to the orthodox and the Motazilites of Mohammedanism. In
                    their theism there was no new feature or peculiar significance. Jewish
                    theosophic mysticism found expression in the Kabbalah. The idea of God there
                    presented was at once excessively abstract and excessively fanciful. It must be
                    studied, however, in the original source or in special works. The Jewish
                    philosophers differed little from the Arabian philosophers in their teaching
                    regarding the evidences of the Divine existence, the nature and consequences of
                    the Divine unity, and the meaning of the Divine attributes. At the same time,
                    they, with a few exceptions, affirmed the non-eternity of matter, and did not,
                    1ike the Arabian Aristotelians, represent providence as merely general. They
                    maintained strongly the transcendence of God and the impossibility of the human
                    mind forming any positive conception of His essential being. They held that He
                    was known as necessarily existent, but also as in Himself necessarily
                    unknowable. Their view of the unity of God led them to an idea of God which may
                    not unjustly be designated agnostic, and which prevented their regarding either
                    nature or Scripture as a revelation of what God really is. Almost alone among
                    eminent Jewish writers of the Middle Age, Jehuda Halevi contended that the
                    representation of God given in the revelation to Israel was self-evidencing,
                    independent of the support of philosophy, and unattainable in any speculative
                    way. The function of reason was, in his view, not to sit in judgment on what had
                    been delivered regarding God to the Jews, but to repel the objections which
                    philosophy had brought against it, and to show the inadequacy of the results
                    reached by unaided human intelligence. Maimonides undertook to establish that
                    reason and faith, science and revelation, were at one in what they affirmed
                    regarding God, but in order to make out his thesis he sacrificed the literal
                    sense of Scripture whenever it did not accord with the tenets of his philosophy,
                    and substituted for the representation of God given through Moses and the
                    prophets one very different in character. His idea of God is highly abstract and
                    metaphysical,—the idea of a being so unlike every other being that no name or
                    predicate whatever when applied to Him can bear its ordinary, or indeed any
                    intelligible meaning. Existence, eternity, unity, power, wisdom, justice, and
                    other attributes, are not in Him what they are in any other being or even
                    analogous in Him to what they are in any other being.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In Christian Europe the human mind took a fresh start at the epoch of the
                    Renaissance. It revolted against the authorities to which it had long been
                    submissive, and exercised private judgment with a confidence uncorrected and
                    unmoderated by experience. It turned with ardour to the free discussion of the
                    greatest theme of thought, and probably at no period of history has there been
                    more individual diversity of opinion on that theme. God and His relation to the
                    universe were treated of from a multitude of points of view. Scepticism,
                    naturalism, and pantheism appeared in various forms; all ancient systems of
                    thought as to the Supreme Being found advocates; all modern theories as to the
                    nature of the Divine were in some measure anticipated. Did our limits permit it
                    would not be uninteresting to expound the speculations concerning Deity of
                    several of the writers of the Renaissance,— and especially, perhaps, of these
                    three—Nicolaus of Cusa, Giordano Bruno, and Thomas Campanella. The theosophic
                    mysticism of the period was a preparation for the Reformation.<note

                <p>The fusion of theology and philosophy was the distinctive feature of mediaeval
                    Christendom; their separation has been a marked characteristic of modern
                    Christendom. Even when both have been occupied with religious inquiries and
                    thoughts of God they have kept apart; they have often co-operated, but seldom
                    commingled. Theology has been on the whole cleric, and comparatively
                    conservative; philosophy has been on the whole laic, and comparatively
                    progressive. But for theology holding fast to what had been handed down as truth
                    regarding God there must have been little continuity or consistency in the
                    development of religious convictions; but for philosophy restlessly seeking ever
                    more light there would have been little growth or increase of knowledge of the
                    Divine.</p>
                <p>The Reformers held that there was a knowledge of God naturally planted in the
                    human mind, and also derivable from observation of the constitution and
                    government of the world, but that this knowledge was so marred and corrupted by
                    ignorance and sin as to require to be con firmed and supplemented by the far
                    clearer and fuller light of the special revelation inthe Scriptures. They were
                    deeply sensible of the evils which had arisen from the over-speculation of the
                    scholastic divines on the nature of God, and were under the ' impression that it
                    would have been well if men had been content to accept the statements of
                    Scripture on the subject with simple and unhesitating faith. Luther wished
                    theology to begin at once with Jesus Christ. Melanchthon said, “There is no
                    reason why we should devote ourselves much to these most lofty subjects, the
                    doctrine of God, of the unity of God, of the Trinity of God”; and in the early
                    editions of his <hi rend="italic">Loci Communes</hi> he entered into no
                    discussion of these themes. Zwingli in his <hi rend="italic">He Vera</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Falsa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Religione</hi> and even Calvin in his <hi rend="italic">Institutio Religionis
                    Christianae</hi> delineated the <hi rend="italic">doctrina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de Heo</hi> only in outline and general features. In the confessions of the
                    churches of the Reformation nothing which the ancient church had oecumenically
                    determined as regards that doctrine was rejected, and nothing new was added
                    thereto. It soon became apparent, however, that the mind would by no means
                    confine its thoughts of God within the limits which the Reformers believed to be
                    alone legitimate and safe. The idea of God is so central in religion that it
                    must affect and be affected by every change of thought on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n261/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0261-0244"/> any religious theme. The many and violent
                    controversies within Protestantism all reacted on the doctrine relative to
                    Deity, causing it to be studied with intense energy, but in a manner and spirit
                    very unfavourable, on the whole, to truth and piety. Every new dispute elicited
                    more abstruse conclusions and more subtle definitions. In the disputations of
                    orthodox divines of the 17th and 18th centuries as to the nature, the
                    attributes, the decrees, and the operations of God, we see scholasticism with
                    all its peculiarities reintroduced and often exaggerated. Yet Protestant theism
                    was in various respects an advance on that of the doctors of mediaeval
                    scholasticism. The protest of the Reformers against the faults of the scholastic
                    treatment regarding God did not lose its pertinency or value because their own
                    followers fell into these very faults. If the subsequent history plainly showed
                    that the doctrine could not have been so fixedly and exhaustively determined by
                    the ancient church as the Reformers supposed, it also showed that the scholastic
                    treatment of the doctrine had been justly condemned by them, and that
                    speculation regarding God when not rooted in spiritual experience must
                    necessarily be unfruitful. The scholasticism of Protestantism was in essential
                    contradiction to the genius and aim of Protestantism. Then, in the Protestant
                    doctrine of God more prominence was given than had previously been done to His
                    manifestation in redemption, to the relation of His character towards sin, and,
                    in particular, to the attribute of justice. The strong emphasis laid on the
                    righteousness of God marked a distinct ethical advance. At the same time the
                    idea of God in the older Protestant theology was far from ethically complete.
                    His fatherhood was strangely ignored or most defectively apprehended. Absolute
                    sovereignty had assigned to it the place which should have been given to holy
                    love, and was often conceived of in an unethical manner. Further, whereas among
                    mediaeval theologians it was the rule and not the exception, among Protestant
                    divines it was the rare exception and not the rule, to affirm God to be
                    unknowable. They asserted merely His incomprehensibility and man’s limited
                    knowledge of His perfections. They did not in general, however, abandon, at
                    least explicitly, the premiss from which mediaeval theologians inferred the
                    Divine incognoscibility, namely, that the absolute simplicity of the Divine
                    essence was incompatible with the existence of distinctions therein.<note

                <p>Difference of opinion as to the relation of reason to Scripture was in
                    the'Protestant world one of the chief causes of difference of belief as to God.
                    Assaults on trinitarianism were contemporary with the Reformation, and they
                    proceeded more on the conviction that the doctrine of the Trinity was
                    unreasonable than that it was unscriptural. The founder of Socinianism, indeed,
                    not only fully accepted the authority of Scripture, but went so far as to
                    represent it as the source of all religious truth, even of the primary truths of
                    natural religion <hi rend="italic">; yet,</hi> while he thus apparently and in
                    theory attributed the knowledge of God more to Scripture and less to reason than
                    did Luther or Calvin, really and in practice he did just the reverse, because he
                    conceived quite otherwise of the connexion between Scripture and reason. While
                    he held Scripture to be the source of religious truth, he also held reason to be
                    so the organ of religious truth that nothing contrary to reason could be
                    accepted on the authority of Scripture, and that only those declarations of
                    Scripture could be deemed to be interpreted aright which were interpreted in
                    accordance with the axioms of reason. Luther, on the other hand, proclaimed
                    aloud, Strangle reason like a dangerous beast if it dare to question Scripture;
                    and Calvin, although he did not speak so harshly, demanded the unqualified
                    submission of reason to the authority of Scripture. Antitrinitarianism has
                    maintained its ground throughout the Protestant area, has assumed a variety of
                    forms, and has exerted a powerful influence. It has been unable, it is often
                    said, to do more than revive the doctrines which distracted the ancient church
                    and were condemned by it as heresies. And this must be so far admitted. The
                    doctrine of the Trinity comprehends only a few propositions, and every departure
                    from it must involve a rejection of one or more of these, and must,
                    consequently, belong to some one of a very few possible types or classes of
                    belief. But essentially the statement is superficial and unjust. For the ways in
                    which, and the grounds on which, both the affirmations of which the doctrine
                    consists and the negations of these have been maintained have not been the same.
                    Alike the defences and the attacks have in the later era iiúplied a deeper
                    consciousness of the nature of the problems in dispute than those of earlier
                    times. As of history in general, so of the history of the doctrine of God, it
                    holds good that no present has been the mere reproduction of any past. The
                    rationalistic process was carried farther in English deism and its Continental
                    developments. Deism sought to found religion on reason alone. It represents
                    “nature” as the sole and sufficient revelation of God. There is no warrant for
                    the view that the deists held nature to be independent of God, selfconservative
                    and self-operative,—or, in other words, God to be withdrawn from nature, merely
                    looking on and “seeing it go.” They believed that God acted through natural
                    laws, and that it was doubtful if He ever acted otherwise than through these.
                    Whatever was taught about God in Christianity and other positive religions
                    beyond what reason could infer from nature ought, in their opinion, to be
                    rejected as fiction and superstition. All their zeal was negative,—against
                    “superstition.” What was positive in their own doctrine had but a feeble hold on
                    them. God was little more to them than a logical inference from the general
                    constitution of the world. They lacked perception of the presence of God, not
                    only in the Bible, but in all human life and history.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Modern philosophy, from its rise to the close of the 18th century, showed a
                    double development, the one ideal and the other empirical, the Cartesian and the
                    Baconian. The former was the more essentially religious. Descartes endeavoured
                    to found philosophy on an indubitable refutation of absolute scepticism. Such a
                    refutation he believed himself to have effected when he had argued that thought,
                    even in the form of doubt, necessarily implies the existence of him who thinks;
                    that the implication yields a universal criterion of certainty; and that the
                    presence of the idea of God in a man’s mind, the consciousness of the mind’s
                    imperfection, and especially the character of the mind’s concept of God as that
                    of the most real being containing every perfection, demonstratively establish
                    that God is and is what He is thought to be. God is and is true; therefore man
                    has not been made to err, and whatever he clearly and distinctly sees as true
                    must be true. In the opinion of Descartes, the idea of God is inherent in
                    reason, is the seal of all certainty, and the corner-stone of all true
                    philosophy. To the whole Cartesian school theology was the foundation of all
                    science. To Spinoza, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n262/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0262-0245"/> who most fully developed some of the distinctive
                    principles of Descartes, it was identical with all science, for to him God was
                    the only substance, and all things else were only His attributes or modes.
                    Besides the pantheism of Spinoza, the occasionalism of Guelinx, Malebranche’s
                    vision of things in God, Leibnitz’s pre-established harmony and optimism, and
                    Wolf’s rationalism were natural, if not necessary, outgrowths from the same
                    root,—Cartesian theism. Perhaps, of all the many services to the cause of theism
                    with which Cartesianism must be credited the greatest was that it constantly
                    gave prominence to the absolute perfection of God.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Saisset, in the first part of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Modem Pantheism</hi> has somewhat elaborate studies on (1) the
                    theism of Descartes, (2) God in the system of Malebranche, (3) the pantheism of
                    Spinoza, and (4) the theism of Leibnitz. Huber (1854) and Elvenich (1865) have
                    written special treatises on the Cartesian proofs of the Divine existence. Among
                    the most thorough studies of Spinoza are those of Camerar, Pollock, and
                    Martineau. Herder, Voigtländer, and others have maintained that he was a theist,

                    Bouillier’s.</p></note> Baconian or empirical philosophy was content if, by the
                    ways of causality and design, it could rise to an apprehension of a First Cause
                    and Supreme Intelligence. It tended of itself to a phenomenalism, sensationism,
                    associationism, unfavourable to theism. It was, however, counteracted,
                    restrained, and modified by Cartesianism and Platonism, and it naturally allied
                    itself with positive science. The massive defence of theism erected by the
                    Cambridge school of philosophy against atheism, fatalism, and the denial of
                    moral distinctions was avowedly built on a Platonic foundation. The popularity
                    during the 18th century of the design argument, and what was called
                    physico-theology, was largely due to the impression made on the general mind by
                    the brilliant discoveries of the founders of modern astronomy, chemistry, and
                    other physical sciences. Bishop Berkeley showed how an empirical philosophy
                    might be logically evolved into a theistic immaterialism, Hume how it might be
                    logically dissolved into an agnostic nihilism.</p>
                <p>In the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries mysticism had many representatives, several
                    of whom, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Weigel, Ottingen, Swedenborg, and
                    especially Jacob Boehme, are entitled to a considerable place in any detailed
                    history of theism. To the eyes of Boehme God revealed Himself from without and
                    within in the most real and intimate manner. In the powers, antagonisms, and
                    conjunctions of creation he saw the energies, struggles, and victories of the
                    creative Spirit itself; in the constitution and operations of physical and human
                    nature, the essential constitution and necessary processes of the Divine nature.
                    His thoughts of God were in striking contrast to those of the deists and natural
                    theologians of the 17th and 18 th centuries, and strikingly anticipated those of
                    a Schelling, Hegel, and Baader in the 19th century. Could Swedenborg’s doctrine
                    of correspondences be verified, our means of insight into the character of God
                    would be largely extended.</p>
                <p>The 19th century is sufficiently far advanced to allow us to see that a new epoch
                    even in the history of theism began near its commencement. The revolution in
                    philosophy initiated by Kant has profoundly affected theistic thought. It has
                    introduced that type of agnosticism which is what is most original and
                    distinctive in the antitheism of the present age, and at the same time
                    stimulated reason to undertake bolder inquiries as to the Divine than those
                    which Kant prohibited. The enlarged and deepened views of the universe attained
                    through the discoveries of recent physical science have rendered incredible the
                    idea of a God remote from the world, irresistible the conviction that the
                    eternal source of things must be immanent in their constitution, changes, and
                    laws. The rapid growth of biology and the spread of the doctrine of evolution
                    have not only tended in the same direction, but given a new and nobler
                    conception of the teleology of the universe, and, consequently, of God as the
                    supreme intelligence. History—which the natural theologians of the 18th century
                    so strangely ignored, which the solitary Italian thinker Vico alone recognized
                    with clearness and comprehensiveness of vision to be necessarily the chief scene
                    of the self-revelation of God—began with Lessing and Herder to be generally seen
                    in its true religious light. The comparative or historical method of study has
                    created two disciplines or sciences, comparative theology and Biblical
                    theology,—which are both largely occupied with tracing the development of the
                    idea of God. The ethical spirit of the age has so told on its religious teaching
                    that to no generation save that to which the gospel was originally given has the
                    Divine fatherhood been so distinctly set forth as to the present. Dogmatic
                    theology, especially in Germany, has been earnestly active; and its chief
                    representatives have laboured so to amend and advance the doctrine concerning
                    God that it may satisfy the new requirements which have arisen.</p>
                <p>It is now necessary briefly to indicate the present state of thought on the chief
                    points and problems of theism.</p>
                <p>As to the origin, then, of our actual idea of God, that, it is seen, can only be
                    the whole religious history of man which precedes it, and the whole religious
                    nature of man which underlies that history. It is absurd to refer exclusively to
                    any faculty, intuition, or feeling, any revelation or instruction, any person or
                    event, what can be traced in growth and formation through thousands of years,
                    and can be shown by facts and documents to have’ been influenced by all the
                    chief causes which have made history what it is. The history of the idea of God
                    is the centre of all history, both explained by and explaining it; and our
                    nineteenth-century idea of God is the result of the entire
                    historico-psychological process which has produced the culture and religion of
                    the 19th century. The idea of God is what it now is because God’s whole guidance
                    of man and man’s whole search for God, the whole economy and evolution of things
                    and the whole constitution and development of thought and feeling, have been
                    what they have been from the beginning of history to the present time.
                    Anthropology, comparative psychology, the science of language, comparative
                    theology, Biblical theology, the history of philosophy, and the history of
                    Christian doctrine, have all been engaged in attempting to discover the factors
                    and stages of the vast and complex process which has resulted in the accepted
                    idea of God; and, by their separate and conjunct endeavours, they have succeeded
                    in casting great light on all parts of the process.</p>
                <p>As to the absolute historical origin of theism—as to where, when, and how the
                    theistic conception of the Divine first obtained recognition among men—a
                    definitive answer has not yet been reached. But the labour expended on the
                    problem has not been wasted. It has made clearer the nature of the inquiry,
                    rendered apparent the unsatisfactoriness of previous solutions, opened up
                    glimpses of divers ways by which men have been led to belief in the unity of
                    God, and accumulated means and materials for future and probably more successful
                    work.</p>
                <p>The question as to the psychological origin of theism cannot be wholly separated
                    from that as to its historical origin. Unless theism can be shown to be the
                    primitive form of religion, it cannot be held to have had an entirely peculiar
                    and distinct psychological origin, but must be viewed as simply a phase or
                    development of religion. It cannot be said that there is as yet agreement as to
                    the psychological origin, or as to the psychological constitution even, of
                    religion. The hypothesis of a simple impartation of the knowledge of God and
                    spiritual things through primitive revelation, or through instruction and
                    tradition which go back to the first appearance of man on earth, still retains a
                    hold on certain conservative minds, but has received no confirmation from modern
                    science and discovery, and is plainly of its very nature inadequate. A
                    revelation relative to God in words or signs could have no meaning to a mind
                    devoid of thoughts of God; spiritual instruction is only possible where there
                    are spiritual powers to understand and profit by it; tradition will carry
                    nothing far to which intelligence is indifferent. There have been many attempts
                    made during the present century to refer the origin of belief in God to some
                    emotional source, some element or state of sensitivity. Thus Strauss has
                    reaffirmed the hypothesis of Epicurus, Lucretius, and Hume, that fear made the
                    gods; Feuerbach has resolved religion into desire, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n263/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0263-0246"/> God being conceived to be what man would wish
                    himself to be; Schleiermacher has argued that a feeling of absolute dependence,
                    of pure and complete passiveness, is our evidence for the presence of an
                    infinite energy, an infinite being; Mansel has represented the feeling of
                    dependence and the conviction of moral obligation as the sources of the
                    religious consciousness; Pfleiderer represents religion as a response to the
                    sense of conflict and contradiction between man’s feelings of dependence and of
                    freedom; Rauwenhoff traces its origin to respect <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Achtung),</hi> the root also of moral conduct and of family life; others have
                    referred it to specific ethical feelings; and many have represented it to be
                    essentially love. The number of these attempts and the diversity of these
                    results are explained by the complexity of religious feeling. In religion all
                    the feelings which raise man above the merely animal condition are involved. Man
                    is not religious by any one feeling or by a few feelings, but by the whole
                    constitution of his emotional nature. His heart, with all its wealth of
                    feelings, has been made for God. Hence all the theories referred to have easily
                    been shown to be one-sided, and to have exaggerated the significance and
                    influence in religion of particular emotional elements, but hence also they all
                    contain more or less important portions of the truth, and have all contributed
                    towards a knowledge of the full truth. Man is not only, however, disposed by all
                    his chief sentiments for religion, but all these sentiments, when normally and
                    healthfully developed, tend towards theism. It is only in a theistic form of
                    religion that they can find true rest and satisfaction. One God can alone be the
                    object of the highest devotional fear, can alone be regarded as ideally perfect,
                    or as a being on whom the worshipper is absolutely dependent, can alone be loved
                    with the whole heart and esteemed with undivided reverence, can alone be
                    recognized as the sole author of the moral law, the alone good. The theories
                    which trace the origin of religion to feeling have the merit of recognizing that
                    religion is not an affair of mere intellect; that the Divine could not even be
                    known by men if they had not feelings and affections as well as intellectual
                    powers; that, if God be love, for example, He can only be known by love; that,
                    if He have moral attributes, we must have moral feelings in order to be able to
                    recognize them. On the other hand, in so far as those theories represent
                    religion as reducible to mere feéling or as independent of intellect, they have
                    the fault of overlooking that all the feelings included in religion presuppose
                    apprehensions and judgments, and are valid only in so far as they have the
                    warrant of intelligence. It is as much an error, however, to account for
                    religion by any one intellectual principle as by any one emotional element.
                    Religion has no one special seat, such as “the central point of unity behind
                    consciousness,” imagined by Schleiermacher; no “special organ,” such as
                    “conscience” was supposed to be by Schenkel; and no one special principle of
                    cognition, such as the law of causality has been represented to be by several
                    philosophers and theologians. All the ultimate principles of cognition are
                    involved in religion, and all lead, if consistently followed far enough, to
                    theism. The whole head as well as the whole heart has been made for religion,
                    and for the perfect form of religion. Max Müller, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hibbert Lectures,</hi> traces the idea of God to a special faculty of
                    religion—“a subjective faculty for the apprehension of the infinite,” “a mental
                    faculty, which, independent of, nay, in spite of, sense and reason, enables man
                    to apprehend the infinite under different names and under varying disguises.”
                    This view will not bear, perhaps, a close scrutiny. The infinite, as an <hi
                    rend="italic">implicit condition</hi> of thought, is not more involved in
                    religious than in other thought. We cannot think anything as finite without
                    implying the infinite. Space cannot be thought of except as <hi rend="italic"
                    >extensively,</hi> nor time except as <hi rend="italic">pro-tensively,</hi>
                    infinite. As a condition of thought, the infinite is involved in religious
                    knowledge only so far as it is involved in all knowledge. On the other hand, as
                    an <hi rend="italic">explicit object</hi> of thought, it is not present in the
                    lower forms of religion at all, which exist only because the thought of infinity
                    is not associated in the religious consciousness with that of Deity, except
                    where reflexion is somewhat highly developed; and, even in the highest stages of
                    religion, it is only apprehended as one aspect of Deity. Infinity is not God,
                    but merely an attribute of the attributes of God, and not even an exclusively
                    Divine attribute. The hypothesis that the idea of God is gained by intuition or
                    vision is proved to be erroneous by the fact that the idea of God, and the
                    process by which it is reached, are capable of being analysed, and therefore not
                    simple, and likewise by the variety and discordance of the ideas of God which
                    have been actually formed. The apprehension of God seems to be only possible
                    through a process which involves all that is essential in the human
                    constitution—will, affection, intelligence, conscience, reason,—and the ideas
                    which they supply—cause, design, goodness, infinity, &amp;c. These are so
                    connected that they may all be embraced in a single act and coalesce in one
                    grand issue. During the <hi rend="underline">la</hi> st thirty years there has
                    been more psychological investigation as to the origin and nature of religion
                    than during all previous history, and the whole tendency of it has been to set
                    aside all solutions which represent man as religious only in virtue of
                    particular sentiments or principles, and to make manifest that the psychology of
                    religion is that of the entire human nature in a special relationship. The best
                    of the later investigations are much more thorough and comprehensive than any of

                <p>The agnosticism originated by Kant has been one of the distinctive and prominent
                    phenomena in the history of religion and theism during the 19th century. It
                    sprang out of an earlier agnosticism. Hume and his predecessors admitted that
                    the conditions of thought —otherwise, the categories of experience or ideas of
                    reason—were in appearance necessary and objectively valid, but in reality only
                    arbitrary and subjective, their seeming necessity and objectivity being
                    illusory, and consequent on mere repetitions and accidental associations of
                    sensations and feelings. Kant showed that they were not only seemingly but
                    really necessary to thought, and irresolvable into the particular in experience.
                    He denied, however, that we are entitled to consider them as of more than
                    subjective applicability,—that what we necessarily think must necessarily be, or
                    be as we think it. He affirmed all knowledge to be confined to experience, the
                    phenomenal, the conditioned. It was quite in accordance with this view of the
                    limits of knowledge that he should have denied that we can know God, even while
                    he affirmed that we cannot but think of God. It was by no means in obvious
                    harmony with it that he should have affirmed that we must, on moral grounds,
                    retain a certain belief in God. Sir W. Hamilton and Dean Mansel followed Kant in
                    holding that we can have no knowledge of God in Himself, as knowledge is only of
                    the relative and phenomenal. They strove to show that the notions of the
                    unconditioned, the infinite, the absolute, are mere negations of thought, which
                    destroy themselves by their mutual contradictions and by the absurdities which
                    they involve. Yet both of these philosophers held that there is a revelation of
                    God in Scripture and conscience, and that we are bound to believe it, not indeed
                    as teaching us what God really is, but λvhat He wishes us to believe concerning
                    Him. Herbert Spencer, adopting Kant’s theory of the limits of knowledge, and
                    regarding as decisive Hamilton and ManseΓs polemic against the philosophies of
                    the Absolute, has concluded that the only truth underlying professed
                    revelations, positive religions, and so-called theological sciences is the
                    existence of an unknowable and unthinkable cause of all things. In the view of
                    the Positivist the unknowable itself is a metaphysical fiction. The Kantian
                    doctrine has had a still more extensive influence in Germany than in Britain,
                    and German philosophers and theologians have displayed great ingenuity in their
                    endeavours to combine with it some sort of recognition of God and of religion.
                    Fries, De Wette, and others have relegated religion to the sphere of faith,
                    Schleiermacher and his followers to that of feeling, Ritschl and his school to
                    that of ethical wants, F. A. Lange to that of imagination, &amp;c. Their common
                    aim has been to find for piety towards God a special place which they can fence
                    off from the rest of human nature, so as to be able to claim for religion
                    independence of reason, speculation, and science, a right to existence even
                    although necessarily ignorant of the object of its faith, feeling, moral sense,
                    or phantasy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Among works

                <p>The movement indicated has led to no direct conclusion which has obtained, or is
                    likely to obtain, general assent. It has had, however, a very important indirect
                    result. It has shown how interested in, and dependent on, a true criticism or
                    science of cognition are theism and theology. It has made increasingly manifest
                    the immense significance to religion of the problem as to the powers and limits
                    of thought which Kant stated and discussed with so much vigour and originality.
                    Hence research into what the Germans call “die erkenntnisstheoretischen
                    Grundsätze”—the philosophical bases—of theism has been greatly stimulated and
                    advanced by the movement. This is an enormous gain, which more than compensates
                    for sundry incidental losses. Kant’s solution of the problem which he placed in
                    the foreground of philosophy has not been found to be one in which the mind can
                    rest. From his agnosticism down to the very empiricism which it was his aim to
                    refute descent is logically inevitable. The agnosticism of piety has in no form
                    been able to discover a halting place,—a spot on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n264/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0264-0247"/> which to raise theism or any solid religious
                    construction. In no form has it been able to prove its legitimacy, to maintain
                    its selfconsistency, or to defend itself successfully against the agnosticism of
                    unbelief. It is, therefore, not surprising that it should have been very
                    generally regarded as dangerous to theism in reality, even when friendly to it
                    in intention. Yet there is much in the theory of cognition on which it proceeds
                    which the theist can utilize. Indeed, no theory of cognition can afford a
                    satisfactory basis to theism which does not largely adopt and assimilate that of
                    Kant. He has conclusively shown that all our knowledge is a synthesis of
                    contingent impressions and necessary conditions; that without the latter there
                    can be neither sense, understanding, nor reason; that they constitute
                    intelligence, and are the light of mind; that they also pervade the whole world
                    of experience and illuminate it; that there is neither thing nor thought in the
                    universe which does not exhibit them in some of their aspects; that apart from
                    them there can be no reality, no truth, no science. The agnostic corollaries
                    appended to this theory by Kant and others, instead of being necessary
                    consequences from it, are inconsistent with it. Kant and the agnostics say that
                    we know only the conditioned; but what they prove is that we know also the
                    conditions of thought, and that these conditions are themselves unconditioned,
                    otherwise they would not be necessary. They affirm that we can know only the
                    phenomenal and relative, but what they establish is that it is as impossible to
                    know only the relative and phenomenal as to know only the absolute and noumenal,
                    and that in so far as we know at all we know through ideas which are absolute
                    and noumenal in the only intelligible, and in a very real and important, sense.
                    They maintain, what is very true, if not a truism, that the categories are only
                    valid for experience, and they imply that this is because experience limits and
                    defines the categories, whereas, according to their own theory, it is the
                    categories which condition experience and enter as constituents into ' all
                    experience, so that to say that the categories are only valid for experience
                    means very little, experience merely existing so far as the categories enable us
                    to have it, and being valid so far as the categories are legitimately applied,
                    although not farther, which leaves no more presumption against religious
                    experience than against sensible experience. They have denied the objective
                    validity of the categories or necessary conditions of thought. This denial is
                    the distinctive feature of all modern agnosticism; and the theist who would
                    vindicate the reality of his knowledge of God, the legitimacy of his belief in
                    God, the worth of his religious experience, must refute the reasonings by which
                    it has been supported; show that consciousness testifies against it, the
                    subjectivity of any true category being unthinkable and inconceivable; and
                    indicate how its admission must subvert not only the foundation of theology but
                    of all other sciences, and resolve them all into castles in the air, or into
                    such stuff as dreams are made of. In the accomplishment of this task as much
                    guidance and aid may be found, perhaps, in the theories of cognition of Ferrier
                    and Rosmini as from those of any of the Germans; but Hegel and his followers,
                    not a few of the Herbartists, Ulrici, Harms, and many other German thinkers,
                    have contributed to show the falsity of the critical theory at this point.
                    Amended here, it is a theory admirably fitted to be the corner-stone of a
                    philosophical theism.</p>
                <p>More may be attempted to be done in the region of the necessary and
                    unconditioned. The conditions of thought, the categories of experience, the
                    ideas of reason are all linked together, so that each has its own place and is
                    part of a whole. And of what whole? The idea of God. All the metaphysical
                    categories are included therein, for God is the Absolute Being; all the physical
                    categories, for He is Absolute Force and Life; all the mental categories, for He
                    is Absolute Spirit; all the moral categories, for He is the Absolutely Good. The
                    idea of God is the richest, the most inclusive, the most comprehensive, of all
                    ideas. It is the idea of ideas, for it takes up all other ideas into itself and
                    gives them unity, so that they constitute a system. The whole system issues
                    into, and is rendered organic by, the idea of God, which, indeed, contains
                    within itself all the ideas which are the conditions of human reason and the
                    grounds of known existence. All sciences, and even all phases and varieties of
                    human experience, are only developments of some of the ideas included in this
                    supreme and. all-comprehensive idea, and the developments have in no instance
                    exhausted the ideas. Hence in the idea of God must be the whole truth of the
                    universe as well as of the mind. These sentences are an attempt to express in
                    the briefest intelligible form what it was the aim of the so-called philosophy
                    of the Absolute to prove to be not only true, but <hi rend="italic">the
                    truth.</hi> Hegel and Schelling, Krause and Baader, and their associates, all
                    felt themselves to have the one mission in life of making manifest that God was
                    thus the truth, the light of all knowledge, self-revealing in all science, the
                    sole object of all philosophy. The Absolute with which they occupied themselves
                    so earnestly was no abstraction, no fiction, such as Hamilton and Mansel
                    supposed it to be,—not the wholly indeterminate, not that which is out of all
                    relation to everything or to anything, not the Unknowable,—but the ground of all
                    relationship, the foundation alike of existence and of thought, that which it is
                    not only not impossible to know, but which it is impossible not to know, the
                    knowledge of it being implied in all knowledge. Hegel expressed not only his own
                    conviction, but the central and vital thought of the whole anti-agnostic
                    movement which culminated in. him when he wrote, “The object of religion is,
                    like that of philosophy, the eternal truth itself in its objective existence: it
                    is God, and nothing but God, and the explanation of God. Philosophy is not a
                    wisdom of the world, but a knowledge of the unworldly; not a knowledge *of
                    outward matter, of empirical being and life, but knowledge of that which is
                    eternal, of that which is God and which flows from His nature, as that must
                    manifest and develop itself. Hence philosophy in explaining religion explains
                    itself, and in explaining itself explains religion. Philosophy and religion thus
                    coincide in that they have one and the same object.” The adherents of the
                    philosophy of the Absolute must be admitted to have fallen, in their revulsion
                    from agnosticism, into many extravagances of gnosticism; but a theist who does
                    not sympathize with their main aim, and even accepts most of the results as to
                    which they are agreed, cannot be credited with having much philosophical insight
                    into what a thorough and consistent theism implies. A God who is not the
                    Absolute as they understood the term, not the Unconditioned revealed in all that
                    is conditioned, and the essential content of all knowledge at its highest,
                    cannot be the God either of a profound philosophy or a fully-developed religion.
                    The philosophy of the Absolute was, on the whole, a great advance towards a
                    philosophical theism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Οη

                <p>And yet it was largely pantheistic, and tended strongly towards pantheism. This
                    was not surprising. Any philosophy which is in thorough earnest to show that God
                    is the ground of all existence and the condition of all knowledge must find it
                    difficult to retain a firm grasp of the personality and transcendence of the
                    Divine and to set them forth with due prominence. Certainly some of the most
                    influential representatives of the philosophy of the Absolute ignored or
                    misrepresented them. The consequence was, however, that a band of thinkers soon
                    appeared who were animated with the most zealous desire to do justice to these
                    aspects of the Absolute, and to make evident the one-sidedness and inadequacy of
                    every pantheistic conception of the Divine. This was the common aim of those who
                    gathered around the younger Fichte, and whose literary organ was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zeitschrift für Philosophie.</hi> Chalybäus, K. Ph. Fischer,
                    Sengler, Weisse, Wirth, and Ulrici may be named as among the ablest and most
                    active. The Roman Catholic Giinther and his followers worked in much the same
                    spirit. Lotze has effectively co-operated by his ingenious defence of the thesis
                    that “perfect personality is to be found only in God, while in all finite
                    spirits there exists only a weak imitation of personality; the finiteness of the
                    finite is not a productive condition of personality, but rather a limiting
                    barrier to its perfect development.” This movement also, then, has tended to
                    develop and contributed to enrich the theory of theism. Its special mission has
                    been to prove that theism is wider than pantheism, and can include all the truth
                    in pantheism, while pantheism must necessarily exclude truth, in theism
                    essential to the vitality and vigour both of religion and of morality.<note

                <p>The philosophy of the Absolute, judged of from a distinctly theistic point of
                    view, was defective on another side. It regarded too exclusively the necessary
                    and formal in thought, trusted almost entirely to its insight into the
                    significance of the categories and its powers of rational deduction. Hence the
                    idea of the Divine which it attained, if vast and comprehensive, was also vague
                    and abstract, shadowy and unimpressive. Correction was needed on this side also,
                    and it came through Schleiermacherand that large company of theologians, among
                    whom Lipsius and Ritschl are at present the most prominent, who have dwelt on
                    the importance of proceeding from immediate personal experience, from the direct
                    testimony of pious feeling, from the practical needs of the moral life, &amp;c.
                    From these theologians may be learned that God is to be known, not through mere
                    intellectual cognition, but through spiritual experience, and that no dicta as
                    to the Divine not verifiable in experience, not efficacious to sustain piety and
                    to promote virtue, to elevate and purify the heart, to invigorate the will, to
                    ennoble <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n265/mode/1up"

                    communities, are likely to be true. Experience of the Divine can be the richest
                    and surest experience only if it not merely implies all that is absolute and
                    necessary in consciousness and existence, but is also confirmed and guaranteed
                    by all that is relative and contingent therein.</p>
                <p>What are known as “the proofs” for the Divine existence have ’ from the time of
                    Kant to the present been often represented as sophistical or useless. This view
                    is, however, less prevalent than it was. During the last twenty years the proofs
                    have been in much greater repute, and have had far more labour expended on them,
                    than during the previous part of the century. They have, of course, been
                    considerably modified, in conformity with the general growth of thought and
                    knowledge. For instance, they are no longer presented elaborately analysed into
                    series or groups of syllogisms. It is recognized that the fetters which would
                    assuredly arrest the progress of physical and mental science cannot be
                    favourable to that of theology. ìt is recognized that the validity of the proofs
                    must be entirely dependent on the truthfulness with which they indicate the
                    modes in which God reveals Himself, the facts through which man apprehends the
                    presence and attributes of God, and that, therefore, the more simply they are
                    stated the better. Man knows God somewhat as he knows the minds of his
                    fellow-men—namely, inferentially,—yet through an experience at once so simple
                    and so manifold that all attempts at a syllogistic representation of the process
                    must necessarily do it injustice. The closeness and character of the connexion
                    of the proofs have also come to be more clearly seen. They are perceived to
                    constitute an organic whole of argument, each of which establishes its separate
                    element, and thus contributes to the general result—confirmatory evidence <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> God is, and complementary evidence as to <hi
                    rend="italic">what</hi> God is. The explanation of this doubtless is that the
                    apprehension of God is itself an organic whole, a complex and harmonious
                    process, involving all that is essential in the human mind, yet all the
                    constituents of which are so connected that they may be embraced in a single act
                    and coalesce into one grand issue.</p>
                <p>The cosmological argument concludes from the existence of the world as temporal
                    and contingent, conditioned and phenomenal, to the existence of God as its one
                    eternal, unconditioned, self-existent cause. It is an argument which has been in
                    no respect discredited by recent research and discussion, which is in substance
                    accepted not only by theists but by pantheists, and which forms the basis even
                    of the philosophy of Herbert Spencer. The principle on which it proceeds—the
                    principle of causality—has only come to be more clearly seen to be ultimate,
                    universal, and necessary. The hypothesis of an infinite series of causes and
                    effects has not had its burden of irrationality in the least diminished. The
                    progress of science has not tended to show that the world itself may be
                    reasonably regarded as eternal and self-existent; in the view of theists it has
                    only tended to render more probable the doctrine that all physical things must
                    have their origin in a single non-physical cause. The necessity of determining
                    aright the bearings of the new views reached or suggested by science as to the
                    ultimate constitution of matter, the conservation of energy, cosmic evolution,
                    the age and duration of the present physical system, &amp;c., has been the chief
                    factor in the latest developments of the argument <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">contingentia mundi.</hi> The teleological argument, which
                    concludes from the regularities and adjustments, preconfonnities and harmonies,
                    in nature that its first cause must be an intelligence, has been both corrected
                    and extended owing to recent advances of science and especially of biological
                    science. The theory of evolution has not shaken the principle or lessened the
                    force of the argument, while it has widened its scope and opened up vistas of
                    grander design, but it has so changed its mode of presentation that already the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bridgewater Treatises</hi> and similar works are to some
                    extent antiquated. Perhaps the most promising of the later applications of the
                    argument is that which rests on the results obtained by a philosophical study of
                    history, and which seeks to show that the goal of the evolution of life, so far
                    as it has yet proceeded, is the perfecting of human nature, and the eternal
                    source of things a power which makes for truth and righteousness. The ethical
                    argument—the proof from conscience and the moral order— held a very subordinate
                    place in the estimation of writers on natural theology until Kant rested on it
                    almost the whole weight of theism. It has ever since been prominent, and has
                    been the argument most relied on to produce practical conviction. Much
                    importance is now rarely attached to those forms of the metaphysical argument
                    which are deductions from a particular conception, as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> of a perfect being. Ignorance alone, however, can account for the
                    assertion often met with that the argument is generally abandoned. It has only
                    been transformed. It has passed from a stage in which it was presented in
                    particular ontological forms into one in which it is set forth in a general
                    epistemological form. As at present maintained it is to the effect that God is
                    the idea of ideas, the ultimate in human thought, without whom all thought is
                    confusion and self-contradiction. . In this form, by what theologians and
                    religious philosophers possessed of much speculative insight is it not
                    held?<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the present
                    writer’s <hi rend="italic">Theism,</hi> and the indications of the literature
                    given in the notes.</p></note></p>
                <p>The changes adopted in the methods of theistic proof have all tended in one
                    direction, namely, to remove or correct extreme and exaggerated conceptions of
                    the Divine transcendence and to produce a true appreciation of the Divine
                    immanence,—to set aside deism and to enrich theism with what is good in
                    pantheism. The general movement of religious speculation within the theistic
                    area has been towards mediation between the extremes of pantheism and of deism,
                    towards harmonious combination of the personal self-equality and the universal
                    agency of the Divine. Positive science has powerfully co-operated with
                    speculation in giving support and impulse to this movement. While the modern
                    scientific view of the world does not result in pantheism, it affords it a
                    partial and relative justification, and requires a theism which, while
                    maintaining the personality of God, recognizes God to be in all things and all
                    things to be of God, through God, and to God. It may be said that theism has
                    always thus recognized the Divine immanence. The vague recognition of it,
                    however, which precedes scientific insight and the conquest and absorption of
                    pantheism is not to be identified with the realizing comprehension of it which
                    is their result.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the

                <p>As to the further treatment of the idea of God in recent or contemporary
                    theology, the following may be mentioned as, perhaps, the chief distinctive
                    features :—first, the general endeavour to present the idea as a harmonious
                    reflex of the Divine nature and life, instead of as a mere aggregate of
                    attributes; secondly, and consequently, the greater care shown in the
                    classification and correlation of the attributes, so as to refer them to their
                    appropriate places in the one great organic thought; and, thirdly, the more
                    truly ethical and spiritual representation given of the Divine character. To
                    realize the nature and import of the first of these features it is only
                    necessary to compare the expositions given of the idea of God in the works of
                    such theologians as Nitzsch, Thomasius, Dorner, Philippi, Kahnis, and even more
                    in those of the representatives of German speculative theism, with such as are
                    to be found in the treatises of Hill, Watson, Wardlaw, and Hodge, which,
                    although published in the present century, express only the views of an earlier
                    age. As to the second point, there has of late been a vast amount of thought
                    expended in endeavouring so to classify and co-ordinate the attributes, and so
                    to refer them to the various moments of the Divine existence and life, as that
                    God may be able to be apprehended both in His unity and completeness,
                    self-identity and spiritual richness, as one whole harmonious and perfect
                    personality. Of the work attempted in this direction our limits will not allow
                    us to treat. In regard to the third feature, any one who will peruse an essay
                    like Weber’s <hi rend="italic">Vom Zorne Gottes,</hi> or RitschΓs <hi
                    rend="italic">De Ira Dei,</hi> and compares the way in which the Biblical
                    conception of the wrath of God is there presented with the mode of exhibiting it
                    prevalent for so many ages, is likely to be convinced that considerable progress
                    has been made even in recent times in the study of the moral aspects of God’s
                    character. That the Divine glory must centre in moral perfection, in holy love,
                    is a thought which is undoubtedly being realized by all theists with
                    ever-increasing clearness and fulness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Bruch, <hi rend="italic">Lehre</hi><hi rend="italic">von den

                    inadequate.</p></note></p>
                <p>It follows from the above that theistic thought has been moving in a direction
                    which could not fail to suggest to those influenced by it that a rigidly
                    Unitarian conception of God must be inadequate, and that the trinitarian
                    conception might be the only one in which reason can rest as self-consistent. So
                    long as the simplicity of the Divine nature was conceived of as an abstract
                    self-identity, intelligence could not venture to attempt to pass from the unity
                    to the trinity of the Godhead, or hope for any glimpse of the possibility of
                    harmoniously combining them. But, this view of the simplicity of the Divine
                    nature having been abandoned, and an idea of God attained which assigns to Him
                    all the distinctions compatible with, and demanded by, completeness and
                    perfection of personality, the doctrine of the Trinity necessarily entered on a
                    new stage of its history. The free movement of thought in this century, far from
                    expelling it from its place in the mind of Christendom, has caused it to strike
                    deeper root and grow with fresh vigour. Never since the Nicene age has
                    theological speculation been so actively occupied with the constitution of the
                    Godhead, and with the trinitarian representation thereof, as from the
                    commencement of the present century. It is, of course, impossible here to
                    describe any of the attempts which, during this period, have been made to show
                    that the absolute Divine self-consciousness implies a trinitarian form of
                    existence, and that intelligently to think the essential Trinity is to think
                    those moments in the Divine existence without which personality and
                    self-consciousness are unthinkable; or that a worthy conception of Divine love
                    demands a trinitarian mode of life; or that a world distinct from God
                    presupposes that God as triune is in and for Himself a perfect and infinite
                    world, so that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n266/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0266-0249"/> His attributes and activities already fully
                    realized in the trinitarian life can proceed outwards, not of necessity but of
                    absolute freedom; or that the whole universe is a manifestation of His triune
                    nature, and all finite spiritual life a reflexion of the archetypal life,
                    selfsustained and self-fulfilled therein. All the more thoughtful trinitarian
                    divines of the present endeavour to make it apparent that the doctrine of the
                    Trinity is not one which has been merely imposed upon faith by external
                    authority, but one which satisfies reason, gives expression to the
                    self-evidencing substance of revelation, and explains and supports religious
                    experience. If it be thought that their success has not been great, it has to be
                    remembered that they have been labouring near the commencement of a movement,
                    and so at a stage when all individual efforts can have only a very limited
                    worth. To one general conclusion they all seem to have come, namely, that the
                    idea of God as substance is not the only idea with which we can connect, or in
                    which we may find implied, tri-personality. The category of substance is, in
                    some respects, one very inapplicable to God, as the philosophy of Spinoza has
                    indirectly shown. If the theologians referred to be correct, the doctrine of the
                    Trinity is not specially dependent upon it. In their view God cannot be thought
                    of consistently as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Absolute Life, Absolute
                    Intelligence, or Absolute Love, unless He be thought of in a trinitarian
                    manner.</p>
                <p>While trinitarian theism has thus during the present century shown abundant
                    vitality and vigour, it cannot be said to have gained any decided victory over
                    Unitarian theism. The latter has also within the same period spread more widely
                    and shown more practical activity, more spiritual life, than in any former age.
                    The unitarianism represented by a Martineau is a manifest advance on that which
                    was represented by a Priestley. Theism in its Unitarian form is the creed of
                    very many of the most cultured and most religious minds of our time, alike in
                    Europe and America. In this form it has also signally shown its power in
                    contemporary India. Brahmoism is, perhaps, the most remarkable example of a
                    Unitarian theism which exhibits all the characteristics of a positive faith and
                    a churchly organization. The Unitarian theism of the present age is
                    distinguished by the great variety of its kinds or types. None of these, it must
                    be added, are very definite or stable. Hence Unitarian theism is often seen to
                    approximate to, or become absorbed into, agnosticism or pantheism, cosmism or
                    humanitarianism. This may be due, however, less to its own character than to the
                    character of the age.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The mind of man has clearly not yet ceased to be intensely interested in thoughts
                    of God. There are no grounds apparent for supposing that it will ever cease to
                    seek after Him or to strive to enlarge its knowledge of His ways. And, if the
                    idea of God be what has been suggested in the foregoing pages, the search for
                    God cannot fail to meet with an ever-growing response. If the idea of God be the
                    most comprehensive of ideas, inclusive of all the categories of thought and
                    implicative of their harmonious synthesis and perfect realization, all thought
                    and experience must of its very nature tend to lead onwards to a fuller
                    knowledge of God. For the knowledge of God, on this view, consists in no mere
                    inference reached through a process of theological argumentation, but in an
                    ever-growing apprehension of an ever-advancing self-revelation of God; and all
                    philosophy, science, experience, and history must necessarily work together to
                    promote it.</p>
                <p>All speculative thought, whether professedly metaphysical or professedly
                    theological, is conversant with ideas included in the idea of God. It deals with
                    what is necessary in and to thought; and within that sphere, notwithstanding
                    many aberrations, it has made slow but sure progress. The history of
                    philosophical speculation is not only, like the whole history of man,
                    essentially rational, but it is, in substance, the history of reason itself in
                    its purest form,—not the record of an accidental succession of opinions, but of
                    the progressive apprehension by reason of God’s revelation of Himself in its own
                    constitution. “There is much in the history of speculative thought, just as in
                    the outward life of man, that belongs to the accidental and irrational—errors,
                    vagaries, paradoxes, whimsicalities, assuming in all ages the name and the guise
                    of philosophy. But, just as the student of the constitutional history of England
                    can trace, amidst all the complexity and contingency of outward and passing
                    events, through successive times and dynasties, underneath the waywardness of
                    individual passion and the struggle for ascendency of classes and orders, the
                    silent, steady development of that system of ordered freedom which we name the
                    constitution of England, so, looking back on the course which human thought has
                    travelled, we shall be at no loss to discern beneath the surface change of
                    opinions, unaffected by the abnormal displays of individual folly and unreason,
                    the traces of a continuous onward movement of mind.”<note anchored="true"

                    this continuous onward movement is towards the clearer and wider apprehension of
                    the whole system of ultimate truths which is comprehended in the idea of the
                    Absolute Truth. The thoughts of men as to God are necessarily enlarged by
                    increase of insight into the conditions of their own thinking. The disquisitions
                    of merely professional theologians on the nature and attributes of God have done
                    far less to elucidate the idea of God than the philosophical views of great
                    speculative thinkers, and would have done less than they have actually
                    accomplished were it not for the guidance and suggestion found in these
                    views.</p>
                <p>The sciences co-operate with speculative philosophy and with one another in
                    aiding thought to grow in the knowledge of God. The greatness, the power, the
                    wisdom, the goodness, of the God of creation and providence must be increasingly
                    apprehended in the measure that nature and its course, humanity and its history,
                    are apprehended; and that measure is given us in the stage of development
                    attained by the sciences. “God’s glory in the heavens,” for example, is in some
                    degree visible to the naked eye and uuinstructed intellect, but it becomes more
                    perceptible and more impressive with every discovery of astronomy. Not otherwise
                    is it as regards all the sciences. Each of them has its distinctive and
                    appropriate contribution to bring towards the completion of the revelation of
                    God, and cannot withhold it.</p>
                <p>But the idea of God is not one which can be rightly apprehended merely through
                    intellect speculatively exercised or operating on the findings of science. It
                    requires to be also apprehended through moral experience and the discipline of
                    life. Neither individuals nor communities can know more of God as a moral being
                    than their moral condition and character permit them to know. The apprehension
                    of God and the sense of moral distinctions and moral obligations condition each
                    other and correspond to each other. History shows us that sincere and pious men
                    may receive as a supematurally revealed truth the declaration that God is love,
                    and yet hold that His love is very limited, being real only to a favoured class,
                    and that He has foreordained, for His mere good pleasure, millions of the human
                    race to eternal misery. How was such inconsistency possible? Largely because
                    these men, notwithstanding their sincerity and piety, were lacking in that love
                    to man through experience of which alone God’s love can be truly apprehended. In
                    like manner, it is not only the science of law which cannot advance more rapidly
                    than the sense of justice, but also theology so far as it treats of the
                    righteousness of God. Thus the knowledge of God is conditioned and influenced by
                    the course of man’s moral experience.</p>
                <p>The same may be said of the distinctively religious experience. In it also there
                    has been a continuous discovery and a continuous disclosure of God. It is not
                    long since the ethnic religions were very generally regarded as merely stages of
                    human folly, so many monuments of aversion to God and of departure from the
                    truth as to God. It was supposed that they were adequately described when they
                    were called “idolatries” and “superstitions.” This view rested on a strangely
                    unworthy conception both of human nature and of Divine providence, and is fast
                    passing away. In its place has come the conviction that the history of religion
                    has been essentially a process of search for God on the part of man, and a
                    process of self-revelation on the part of God to man, resulting in a continuous
                    widening and deepening of human apprehension of the Divine. All, indeed, has not
                    been progress in the history of religion either in the ethnic or Christian
                    period; much has been the reverse; but all stages of religion testify that man
                    has been seeking and finding God, and God making Himself known unto man.</p>
                <p>But, while knowledge of God may reasonably be expected unceasingly to grow, in
                    all the ways which have been indicated, from more to more, it is not to be
                    supposed that doubt or denial of God’s existence must, therefore, speedily
                    disappear. Religious agnosticism cannot fail to remain long prevalent. The very
                    wealth of contents in the idea of God inevitably exposes the idea to the
                    assaults of agnosticism. All kinds of agnosticism merge into agnosticism as to
                    God, from the very fact that all knowledge implies and may contribute to the
                    knowledge of God. The more comprehensive an idea is from the more points can it
                    be assailed, and the idea of God, being comprehensive of all ultimate ideas, may
                    be assailed through them all, as, for example, through the idea of being, or of
                    infinity, or of causality, or of personality, or of rectitude. Then, in another
                    way, the unique fulness of the idea of God explains the prevalence of
                    agnosticism in regard to it. The ideas are not precisely in God what they are in
                    man or nature. God is being as man or nature is not; for He is independent and
                    necessary being, and in that sense the one true Being. God is not limited by
                    time and space as creatures are; for, whereas duration and extension merely are
                    predicates of creatures, the corresponding attributes of God are eternity and
                    immensity. God as first cause is a cause in a higher and more real sense than
                    any second cause. So as to personality, intelligence, holiness, love. Just
                    because the idea of God is thus elevated in all respects, there are many minds
                    which fail or refuse to rise up to it, and which because of its very truth
                    reject it as not true at all. They will not hear of that Absolute Truth which is
                    simply the idea of God; but that they reject it is their misfortune, not any
                    argument against the truth itself. (R. F.) </p>
