                    the modern vernaculars, in all of which it has assumed the form <hi
                    rend="italic">tfιag</hi> (commonly written <hi rend="italic">thug),</hi> with a
                    specific meaning. The Thugs were a well-organized confederacy of professional
                    assassins, who in gangs of from 10 to 200 travelled in various guises through
                    India, wormed themse!ves into the confidence of wayfarers of the wealthier
                    class, and, when a favourable opportunity occurred, strangled them by
                    throwing<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n344/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0344-0327"/> a handkerchief or noose round their necks, and
                    then plundered and buried them. All this was done according to certain ancient
                    and rigidly prescribed forms and after the performance of special religious
                    rites, in which the consecration of the pick-axe and the sacrifice of sugar
                    formed a prominent part. From their using the noose as an instrument of murder
                    they were also frequently called <hi rend="italic">Phânsigars,</hi> or
                    “noose-operators.” Though they themselves trace their origin to seven Mohammedan
                    tribes, Hindus appear to have been associated with them at an early period; at
                    any rate, their religious creed and practices as staunch worshippers of Devi
                    (Kâlî, Durgâ), the Hindu goddess of destruction, had certainly no flavour of
                    Islam in them. Assassination for gain was with them a religious duty, and was
                    considered a holy and honourable profession. They had, in fact, no idea of doing
                    wrong, and their moral feelings did not come into play. The will of the goddess
                    by whose command and in whose honour they followed their calling was revealed to
                    them through a very complicated system of omens. In obedience to these they
                    often travelled hundreds of miles in company with, or in the wake of, their
                    intended victims before a safe opportunity presented itself for executing their
                    design; and, when the deed was done, rites were performed in honour of that
                    tutelary deity, and a goodly portion of the spoil was set apart for her. The
                    fraternity possessed also a jargon of their own (Ramâsî), as well as certain
                    signs by which its members recognized each other in the remotest parts of India.
                    Even those who from age or infirmities could no longer take an active part in
                    the operations continued to aid the cause as watchers, spies, or dressers of
                    food. It was owing to their thorough organization, the secrecy and security with
                    which they went to work, but chiefly to the religious garb in which they
                    shrouded their murders, that they could, unmolested by Hindu or Mohammedan
                    rulers, recognized as a regular profession and paying taxes as such, continue
                    for centuries to practise their craft. Both the fractions into which they were
                    divided by the Nerbudda river laid claim to antiquity: while the northern,
                    however, did not trace their origin farther back than the period of the early
                    Mohammedan kings of Delhi, the southern fraction not only claimed an earlier and
                    purer descent, but adhered also with greater strictness to the rules of their
                    profession.</p>
                <p>The earliest authenticated mention of the Thugs is found in the following passage
                    of Zíáu-d din Barní’s <hi rend="italic">History of Firoz Sháh</hi> (written
                    about 1356): “In the reign of that sultan,” that is, about 1290, “some Thugs
                    were taken in Delhi, and a man belonging to that fraternity was the means of
                    about a thousand being captured. But not one of these did the sultan have
                    killed. He gave orders for them to be put into boats and to be conveyed into the
                    lower country, to the neighbourhood of Lakhnautí, where they were to be set
                    free. The Thugs would thus have to dwell about Lakhnautí, and would not trouble
                    the neighbourhood of Delhi any more” (Sir H. M. Elliot’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of India,</hi> vol. iii. p. 141). The first European travellers who
                    speak of them without mentioning their name are Thevenot (1665) and Fryer
                    (1673). Though instances of Thuggee had been known to the English rulers in
                    India for many years, and sporadic efforts had been made by them towards the
                    extinction of the gangs, it was not till Lord W. Bentinck (1828-35) took
                    vigorous steps in this matter that the system was gradually unmasked, and
                    finally all but stamped out. His chief agent, Captain (afterwards Sir William)
                    Sleeman, with several competent assistants, and the co-operation of a number of
                    native states, succeeded in completely grappling with the evil, so that up to
                    October 1835 no fewer than 1562 Thugs had been committed, of which number 382
                    were hanged and 986 transported or imprisoned for life. It is true that,
                    according to the <hi rend="italic">Thuggee and Dacoity Report for 1879,</hi> the
                    number of registered Punjabi and Hindustani Thugs then still amounted to 344.
                    But all of these had already been registered as such before 1852. It may,
                    therefore, fairly be assumed that none are alive now, and that the whole
                    fraternity may be considered as extinct.</p>
