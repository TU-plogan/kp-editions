                    1754. His father, who was of a younger branch of the princely family of Chalais,
                    was an <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n39/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0039-0030"/> officer in the army of Louis XV., and his mother,
                    also of noble family, was a member of the royal household at Versailles. An
                    accident in infancy rendered Talleyrand lame for life, and changed his whole
                    career. His upbringing was, in accordance with the fashionable heartlessness of
                    the day, entirely left to strangers; and while a boy he was, in consequence of
                    his lameness, formally deprived by a <hi rend="italic">conseil de famille</hi>
                    of his rights of primogeniture,—his younger brother, the Comte d’Archambaud,
                    taking his place; and he was destined for the church. He keenly felt the blow,
                    but was powerless to avert it; and he used his enforced profession only as a
                    stepping-stone to his ambition, always despising it, and coolly and defiantly
                    forsaking it when he found it an embarrassment.</p>
                <p>When he was removed from the country he was sent to the Collège d’Harcourt, where
                    he speedily distinguished himself; and in 1770, when sixteen years of age, he
                    became an inmate of the Séminaire de St Sulpice, his education being completed
                    by a course in the Sorbonne. Much as Talleyrand despised the church as a career,
                    he never ceased highly to appreciate theology as a training, and he publicly
                    testified to its value to the statesman and specially to the diplomatist. While
                    achieving distinction as a student, he carefully cultivated such society as
                    might promote his advancement; and it was in the circle of Madame du Barry that
                    his cynicism and wit, reported by her to the king, gained him the position of
                    abbé. To his arts of manner were added, not only his advantages of birth and
                    scholarship, but a penetrating judgment of men and affairs, a subtle audacity,
                    and a boundlessly selfish ambition. As early as 1780 we find this <hi
                    rend="italic">abbe malgré lui</hi> to have reached the important position of
                    “agent-general” of the French clergy. His ability and his flagrant immorality
                    alike rendered him a marked man, and the latter did not prevent his appointment,
                    in accordance with his father’s dying request to the king, as bishop of Autun in
                    January 1789. The clergy of his own diocese immediately elected him a member of
                    the states-general; and he delivered before his constituents one of the most
                    remarkable speeches which the crisis produced, containing a sagacious and
                    statesmanlike programme of the reforms which the condition of France demanded.
                    He thus entered the assembly as one of its leaders.</p>
                <p>The states-general had hardly met ere Talleyrand’s influence was called into
                    play. He successfully urged the clergy to yield to the demand of the commons
                    that the three estates should meet together; and the nobles could thereafter
                    only follow the example thus set. On the question of the extent of the
                    assembly’s authority he again sided with the popular leaders. As a financier of
                    great foresight and power he soon became justly celebrated; and his position in
                    the assembly may be estimated by his appointment as one of a committee of eight
                    to frame the project of a constitution. All his previous successes were,
                    however, eclipsed by the daring with which he attacked the rights and privileges
                    of his own order. He had seconded the proposals that the clergy should give up
                    their tithes and plate for the benefit of the nation, and on 10th October 1789
                    he himself proposed a scheme whereby the landed property of the church should be
                    confiscated by the state. On 2d November, after violent debates, his project was
                    carried, and the old clergy thereafter ranked him as an enemy. But his general
                    popularity so much increased that he was charged by the national assembly to
                    prepare a written memoir in defence of its labours; and the manifesto, read on
                    February 10, 1790, was received with great approval throughout the country. On
                    the 16th he was elected president of the assembly for the usual brief term. On
                    various subjects he was now looked up to as an authority,—on education, on
                    electoral and ecclesiastical reform, on banking, and on general finance. His
                    career as a diplomatist had not yet begun.</p>
                <p>On July 14, 1790, Talleyrand, at the head of 300 clergy, assisted at the fête in
                    the Champ de Mars in commemoration of the fall of the Bastille, and publicly
                    blessed the great standard of France. By this time, however, the dispute as to
                    the civil constitution of the clergy had broken out, the decision of the
                    assembly being resisted by the king, backed by the pope. When in November the
                    king yielded, Talleyrand boldly took the required oath, only two bishops
                    following his example. New bishops were elected by the assembly, and these he,
                    in open defiance of the church, consecrated. In the end of April 1791 he was
                    suspended from his functions and excommunicated by the pope. Without a moment’s
                    hesitation Talleyrand abandoned his profession, which he never afterwards
                    resumed. He had been false to its vows, and had scandalized it by his shameless
                    life. It was only in the preceding February that he had, in declining nomination
                    for the archbishopric of Paris, felt, indiscreetly enough and contrary to his
                    usual practice, the necessity of writing to the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi>
                    a hypocritical confession of his gambling propensities, stating his gains at
                    30,000 francs. Although in 1801 the excommunication was recalled, it was nearly
                    half a century after his first act of defiance ere he became personally
                    reconciled to the church, and then only when he was at the point of death.</p>
                <p>On purely political lines, however, Talleyrand’s career became more and more
                    celebrated. In the beginning of the same month of April 1791, his friend
                    Mirabeau having just died, he was appointed to succeed him as a director of the
                    department of Paris, a position which still further increased his influence in
                    the circles of the metropolis. On the flight of the king in June, Talleyrand
                    leaned at first and cautiously towards the duke of Orleans, but finally declared
                    for a constitutional monarchy with Louis XVI. still on the throne. Ere the
                    constitutional assembly brought its existence to a close on 14th September, he
                    unfolded before it his magnificent scheme of national education, which, in the
                    words of Sir Henry Bulwer, “having at one extremity the communal school and at
                    the other the Institute, exists with but slight alterations at this very day.”
                    The assembly had voted that none of its members should be members of the new
                    legislative body, so that Talleyrand was free; besides, events were hurrying on
                    with strange and critical rapidity; and Talleyrand left France for England,
                    reaching London in the end of January 1792. With this visit his diplomatic
                    career may be said to have begun.</p>
                <p>He was not formally accredited, but had in his pocket an introduction to Lord
                    Grenville by Delessart the foreign minister; the king himself was aware of his
                    mission, the ostensible object of which was to conciliate England. Talleyrand
                    for his part shared the ulterior views of Narbonne, the minister of war, that it
                    would be for the advantage of his country to divert its energies, which were
                    morbidly directed to its internal troubles, into another channel, and to
                    precipitate an Austrian war. Although received well in London society, he found
                    the want of official credentials a fatal obstacle to his diplomatic
                    negotiations, and he returned to Paris, whence he was almost immediately again
                    despatched to the English court under much more favourable conditions. He was
                    nominally only attendant with De Chauvelin, the minister plenipotentiary, but he
                    was really the head of the embassy, and he carried with him a letter of Louis
                    XVI. to George III. At this time, indeed, Talleyrand’s relations with Louis were
                    very close,—far closer than he afterwards cared or dared to avow. All, however,
                    was of no avail. The startling course of the Revolution made the English look
                    askance <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n40/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0040-0031"/> upon his mission, and he returned baffled to
                    Paris, where he arrived shortly before the <hi rend="italic">coup djetat</hi> of
                    the 10th of August. But this place, where his wariest manoeuvres were outdone by
                    the rapidity of the popular movements, and where at any turn of affairs he might
                    lose his head, was not to his liking; and by the middle of September he is for
                    the third time in London. It is characteristic of the man—of the dexterity as
                    well as audacity of his intrigue—that he who had but shortly before carried with
                    him a letter of favour from Louis XVI. was, now that royalty was abolished, the
                    bearer of a specific passport— “going to London by our orders ”—under the hand
                    of Danton. Equally characteristic is the express falsehood with which he opens
                    his negotiations: he writes at once to Lord Grenville, “I have at this time
                    absolutely no kind of mission in England ”—he was selling his library and
                    seeking repose. His courtesies were not returned; and, although he succeeded in
                    making friends in certain high quarters, he was, in the end of January 1794,
                    under the provisions of the Alien Act, ordered to leave England. Fortified with
                    an introduction by Lord Lansdowne to Washington, he sailed for the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>A decree of the convention had issued against Talleyrand during his stay in
                    England. He was an <hi rend="italic">emigre.</hi> But as the excesses of the
                    period drew to a close the proscription was recalled on the appeal of Chénier,
                    who founded on Talleyrand’s relations with Danton and his mission to England in
                    the service of the Revolution! On July 25, 1795, he arrived at Hamburg, whence
                    he passed to Berlin, and, after a short stay there, to Paris. He was received
                    with enthusiasm in the circles of fashion and intrigue. He would have been
                    eagerly welcomed by any of the political parties as a strength; but the
                    Directory was in power, and he supported it. Within the Directory he supported
                    Barras, as against his compeers. He was thus a moderate constitutionalist and in
                    the way of advancement.</p>
                <p>During his absence from France he had been elected a member of the Institute. He
                    was now elected its secretary. In this capacity he read before it two
                    memoirs—one on the “commercial relations of the United States with England,” and
                    the other “on the advantages of withdrawing from new colonies in present
                    circumstances.” These memoirs exhibit Talleyrand at the very maturity of his
                    powers, and are sufficient to establish his position as one of the most
                    far-seeing and thoughtful statesmen that France ever possessed. The first paper
                    shows how, in spite of the War of Independence, the force of language, race, and
                    interest must in his view bind England and the States together as natural
                    allies; and it contains that remarkable passage (which once read is never
                    forgotten) in which the civilization of America is described as exhibited in
                    space as well as in time,—as the traveller moves westward from State to State he
                    appears to go backward from age to age. The papers, which were read in April and
                    July of 1797, made his claim to state recognition irresistible, and towards the
                    end of the latter month he was appointed to the post of foreign minister.</p>
                <p>He had been carefully scanning the political situation, and he accurately foresaw
                    that the Directory, which represented no one set of opinions, but only a vain
                    compound of all, could not stand against unity of policy backed by force, and in
                    the meantime could be manipulated. Thus with a brutal swiftness its personnel
                    becomes changed. Barras with his sluggish moderation remains; but, behind and
                    through him, it is the dexterous purpose of Talleyrand that is at work. This is
                    the first characteristic of his administration. Its second is the ability which
                    he displays in his communications with the diplomatic service, in view of the
                    rupture with England. Its third is the shamelessly corrupt manner in which he
                    approaches the American ambassadors on the subject of the seizure of certain
                    ships, on the conclusion of a commercial treaty between England and the States,
                    putting himself in his public and powerful position at their service,—if the
                    bribe were suitably large. And its fourth is that he is hardly in the chair of
                    office until he has shrewdly selected Bonaparte as the object of his assiduous
                    flatteries, writing to him in semi-confidence, and laying the basis of their.
                    future intimacy. But his first term of office was short: the American
                    ambassadors spurned his offer and let his conduct be publicly known, with the
                    result that for this and other reasons he resigned his post. Public opinion was
                    outraged. His official corruption, however, was not ended, for Talleyrand turned
                    everything into gold; in his later diplomacy also he could always be bought; and
                    this public immorality was but too faithfully reflected in his private life, in
                    which gambling was his passion and a source of his vast wealth.</p>
                <p>Out of office, but still pulling the strings of the Directory, he awaited the
                    arrival of Napoleon in Paris, and it was his hand which was most powerful in
                    shaping the events of the 18th and 19th Brumaire—9th and 10th November 1799. He
                    reconciled Sieyès to Bonaparte; a majority of the Directory—Sieyès, Ducos, and
                    at last at his persuasion even Barras—resigned; the Directory collapsed, and the
                    consulate was established (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Napoleon</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sieyès).</hi> Napoleon was the first and Talleyrand the second
                    man in France.</p>
                <p>He was now an absolutist, the whole drift of his influence being in the direction
                    of consolidating, under whatever title, the power of Bonaparte. For many years
                    henceforward Talleyrand’s career is part of the general history of France. He is
                    soon again foreign minister; and he is acknowledged to have been the ablest
                    diplomatist of an age when diplomacy was a greater power than it has ever been
                    before or since. To him falls a full share of responsibility for the kidnapping
                    and murder of the Duc d’Enghien in March 1804 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sa
                    vary).</hi> He had assisted at the councils when the atrocity was planned, and
                    he wrote to the grand-duke justifying the seizure of the prince while on Baden
                    territory. His hand in the matter was of course concealed. But, when one advised
                    him to tender his resignation, he demurely remarked, “If, as you say, Bonaparte
                    has been guilty of a crime, that is no reason why I should be guilty of a
                    folly.” In other and more agreeable directions he had prostrated himself before
                    Napoleon’s purposes, approving among other things of the policy of the Concordat
                    (15th July 1801), and securing thereby the recall of his excommunication. To the
                    pope’s grateful brief, which gave him liberty “to administer all civil affairs,”
                    lie coolly gave a wide interpretation, and he shortly thereafter married. He of
                    course supported and defended first the consulship for life and then the
                    crowning of the emperor.</p>
                <p>By and by, however, a change comes over his political attitude, and it is not
                    long ere Napoleon detects it. This change we date, with Sainte-Beuve, from the
                    end of January 1809. Before the peace of Tilsit, July 8, 1807, from Jena
                    onwards, he had personally accompanied the great conqueror; after it they stood
                    apart, for the statesman saw in those brilliant but ceaseless conquests the
                    prelude to the ruin of his master and his country. He was now prince of
                    Benevento, and he withdrew from the ministry, receiving at his own desire the
                    title of vice-grandelector of the empire. Yet he had not disapproved of thq
                    Spanish war; the young princes had even been entrusted to his surveillance at
                    his country house at Valençay. But anything might have happened to the emperor
                    in Spain, and Talleyrand had evidently been calculating the chances <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n41/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0041-0032"/> of the future. So at the date stated the
                    explosion occurs, Napoleon pouring upon Talleyrand all the fury of his
                    invective, reproaching him with the affair of the Due d’Enghien, and clamouring
                    to know where his enormous wealth had come from,—how much he had gained at play
                    or on the stock exchange, and what was the sum of his bribes by foreign powers.
                    Over and over again such scenes are repeated, the burden of the fierce
                    reproaches being always the same; but Talleyrand stands impassive as a statue,
                    remarking once, but not till he is out of the room, and is limping away, “What a
                    pity that such a great man has been so badly brought up !” or sending in, at
                    another time, a resignation, which of course is not accepted. The reproaches of
                    the emperor were only too well founded, his minister having reaped a vast
                    harvest from the smaller powers at the formation of the Rhenish Confederation;
                    it is indeed recorded that Talleyrand once put a figure upon his gains in this
                    department of corruption— the figure being no less than sixty million
                    francs.</p>
                <p>It is undoubtedly to his credit, however, that he steadily resisted a warlike
                    policy, and that he was particularly opposed to the Russian invasion. He was
                    occasionally employed in diplomatic negotiations, and was even again offered the
                    post of foreign minister if he would give up that of vice-grand-elector. This
                    offer, which would have placed him at the mercy of Napoleon, he declined, and
                    the breach between the two widened. Before the events of 1814 his hotel had
                    become the centre of anti-Napoleonic intrigue; as the crisis approached he
                    communicated with the allies; when it was at hand he favoured a regency, and
                    appeared anxious that Marie Louise should remain in Paris; and when this was
                    abandoned he carefully arranged a feigned departure himself, but that his
                    carriage should be turned back at the city gates; he did return; and the emperor
                    Alexander was his guest at the Hotel Talleyrand! The revolution was his work;
                    and his nominee Louis XVIIL ascended the throne. For a third time, and again
                    under a new master, he was appointed foreign minister. It would be difficult to
                    overestimate the splendid services which he now rendered to France. In Paris, on
                    23d April, the treaty was concluded under which the soldiers of the allies were
                    to leave French soil; and Talleyrand successfully urged that the territory of
                    France should be the enlarged territory of 1792, and also that the great art
                    treasures of which so many European cities had been despoiled should remain in
                    Paris. A final tι*eaty of peace between Europe and France was concluded on 30th
                    May, and in September the congress of Vienna assembled. It was the scene of
                    Talleyrand’s greatest triumphs. He succeeded single-handed in breaking up the
                    confederation of the allies, and in reintroducing the voice of France into the
                    deliberations of the European powers. Further, on January 3, 1815, a secret
                    treaty was concluded between Austria, France, and England.</p>
                <p>When Napoleon escaped from Elba and advanced towards Paris, Louis XVIII. retired
                    to Ghent. Although the congress of Vienna was thus broken up, Talleyrand made no
                    haste to follow him thither. He was puzzled, and remained so during the Hundred
                    Days. He despised Louis, and an early approach to Bonaparte was out of the
                    question. He therefore coolly betook himself to Carlsbad, remarking, when an
                    explanation was asked for, that the first duty of a diplomatist after a congress
                    was to attend to his liver! Waterloo of course decided him. He appeared at
                    Ghent, and was but coldly received. The foreign powers, however, intervened,
                    conscious after Vienna of Talleyrand’s value; and, among others, Wellington
                    insisted that the great diplomatist must be taken into the councils of
                    Louis,—with the result that he became prime minister at the second restoration.
                    But his position was one of extreme difficulty. The king disliked him; there
                    were scenes bordering on violence in the royal presence; the Russian emperor
                    intimated his hostility to him; he shared the odium of having a man like Fouché
                    for a colleague; Chateaubriand and his party hated and beset him. Fortunately an
                    excuse of a broad and national kind soon presented itself. He objected to the
                    conditions which the allies were imposing upon France, refused to sign the
                    treaty, and on 24th September resigned office.</p>
                <p>He retired into private life, in which he remained for fifteen years. He only
                    spoke in the House of Peers three times during this period,—twice (1821 and
                    1822) in favour of the liberty of the press, and once (1823) to protest against
                    the Spanish war. But in 1830, when Charles X.’s reign was evidently imperilled,
                    he again is at the centre of intrigue; and it is actually at his private but
                    urgent suggestion that Louis Philippe heads the revolution, taking, to begin
                    with, the title of lieutenant-general of the kingdom. Declining the post of
                    foreign minister, he proceeded to London as ambassador, conducting himself and
                    serving his country with his usual consummate skill. He returned crowned with
                    success after the formation of the Quadruple Alliance. In November 1834 he
                    resigned, and quitted public life for ever.</p>
                <p>He emerged from his retirement on March 3, 1838, to pronounce before the
                    Institute the éloge of Reinhard, and in so doing to treat of diplomacy in
                    general, and to suggest an indirect but adroit apology for his own career. He
                    was received with unbounded enthusiasm by the élite of French literature and
                    society—Cousin even exclaiming that the éloge was worthy of Voltaire. His last
                    illness, which had by this time shown itself, soon prostrated him. He was
                    visited on his death-bed by crowds of celebrities, including the king. He died
                    on May 17, 1838, at the great age of eighty-four. He is buried at Valençay.</p>
                <p>According to his desire, his memoirs under his own hand will not appear till
                    1890.</p>
                <p>There is a considerable body of anonymous and untrustworthy literature both in
                    French and English on the subject of this sketch. For the earlier part of
                    Talleyrand’s career, see the general literature of the Revolution; for the
                    Napoleonic, the general histories, including especially the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs</hi> of the Due de Rovigo; for the third and last, also the general
                    histories, and especially the <hi rend="italic">Correspondence between
                    Talleyrand and Louis XVIII.,</hi> edited by Pullain (1880; transi, into English,
                    1881), and the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> of Guizot. References abound to
                    the private life of Talleyrand, and on it see also the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire Politique et</hi><hi rend="italic">Vie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Intime,</hi> by G. Touchard-Lafosse (1848), and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Souvenirs</hi><hi rend="italic">Intimes 'sur</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ. de
                    Talleyrand,</hi> by Amedée Piehot (1870). The student must be on his guard in
                    perusing most of this last-mentioned literature. For many years the <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">Politique</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    Privée,</hi> by G. Michaud (1853), stood practically uncorrected, although
                    evidently a studied and bitter attack. The view taken by Louis Blanc in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Dix</hi><hi rend="italic">Ans</hi> (translated into English in
                    1845) is also quite distorted, and if one wishes to see a complete misreading of
                    Talleyrand’s career it can be found in Blanc’s tenth chapter of his fifth book.
                    Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer rendered great service by his life of Talleyrand,
                    published in his <hi rend="italic">Historical Characters</hi>; and the worth and
                    accuracy of Bulwer’s biography, which was speedily translated into French, has
                    been amply acknowledged by Sainte-Beuve in his valuable treatise (lectures) on
                    Talleyrand, published in 1870. Reference should also be made to Mignet, Bastide,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires Politiques</hi> of Lamartine.</p>
                <p>Caution will have to be exercised in reading Talleyrand's autobiography, which
                    will not appear till 1890. The testimony of contemporaries will not be available
                    to check it, and Talleyrand is proved to have presided at the destruction of
                    much documentary evidence implicating himself, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> at
                    the moment when the Russian emperor was living at his house. (T. S.)</p>
