                    that present the prayers of the saints before God, is sent in human form to
                    conduct Tobias on his journey. Thus aided, Tobias not only recovers his father’s
                    money, but by killing a fish which attacks him as he washes his feet in the
                    Tigris, becomes possessed of two invaluable drugs, its liver with the heart and
                    its gall. By fumigation with the former he drives away the demon Asmodeus, who
                    had slain the seven bridegrooms of a virtuous Jewish maiden, Sara of Ecbatana,
                    his own kinswoman, and so wins a good wife, and with the gall he heals his
                    father’s eyes. In spite of the absurd machinery and other puerilities, the story
                    is ingeniously constructed, and the picture of Tobit’s piety is natural and
                    touching, so that the whole is a very good exhibition of the weakness and the
                    strength of Judaism as it was among the Israelites of the dispersion.</p>
                <p>The date of the book cannot be precisely determined. It was written before the
                    destruction of the temple (xiv. 5), and is cited by early Christian writers. On
                    the other hand, it is in the highest degree probable that the Greek text is
                    original,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the

                    about the middle of this century, or a little earlier, at the time of bitter
                    conflict with the Greeks, seems to accord best with the tone of the book. The
                    sympathy shown for the victims of tyranny, to whom burial was denied, acquires
                    fresh meaning when compared with such a passage as 2 Mac. v. 10, and the
                    prominence given to eschatological hopes in the closing verses fits a time when
                    interest in the prophecies of Israel’s future glory was revived by the struggle
                    for national independence in Judaea.</p>
                <p>That Tobit was written by a Jew of the Eastern dispersion (so, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> Ewald, <hi rend="italic">Gesch.,</hi> iv. 269) will hardly be
                    maintained by any one who accepts the Greek text as original. The book remained
                    almost unknown to the Syriac church, a fact which tells strongly against the
                    hypothesis of an Eastern origin; and at the period to which the work can be best
                    referred Egypt is the only probable place for a Jewish-Greek composition. The
                    writer knows nothing about the geography of the East beyond a few names which
                    every Jew must have heard,— the Tigris, which, by an error common among the
                    Greeks but hardly possible to an Oriental Jew, he regards as flowing between
                    Nineveh and Media; Rhagae, which was a royal residence of the Parthians; the
                    famous city of Ecbatana; and Elymais (ii. 10), which was associated with the
                    disaster of Antiochus Epiphanes. And in both forms of the Greek text (vi. 9 in
                    the common text, and v. 6 in the longer) Rhagae is falsely represented as quite
                    near Ecbatana.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Nöldeke
                    shows that the same error in a less gross form appears in both texts in chap.
                    ix. The further erroneous statement of the longer text that Ecbatana lies in a
                    plain occurs also in Diod., ii. 13, 6, in a passage dependent on Ctesias, from
                    whom the addition may have been taken.</p></note> Nöldeke surmises, as others
                    have done before him, that the “fish” which attacked Tobias was the Egyptian
                    crocodile, and this conjecture is raised almost to certainty when we read in
                    Kazwini i. 132 that the smell of the smoke of crocodile’s liver cures epilepsy
                    and that its dung and gall cure leucoma, which was the cause of Tobit’s
                    blindness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Very similar
                    statements as to the medical virtues of the crocodile (aquatic or terrestrial)
                    occur in Greek and Latin writers.</p></note> Thus the cures of Sara and Tobit
                    are natural <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> the longer Greek text, vi. 4 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.)</hi>; the angel’s help is necessary only to secure the
                    medicaments and explain their use.</p>
                <p>But though the story may have been written in Egypt it contains Persian elements.
                    There is no inconsistency in this, for the authors of Jewish Haggada generally
                    borrowed the themes which they embellished, and that from very various quarters.
                    In fact, at the close of our book there is a brief allusion to another
                    story,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The story of
                    Nadab and Achiacharus. The names are uncertain, and one text substitutes Aman

                    quite unknown to us, which the author evidently did not invent. The proof of a
                    Persian element in the tale lies, not in the localities, but in the angelology
                    and demonology. Asmodeus is the Iranian evil spirit Aeshmâ Daevâ, and Raphael,
                    as the guardian of Tobias, has a strong resemblance to the Iranian Çraosha. Such
                    precise adaptations of Zoroastrian ideas were hardly the common property of
                    Judaism at so early a date; they lead us to conjecture that the writer borrowed
                    from an Iranian story.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Compare what is said under <hi rend="smallcaps">Thousand and One Nights</hi>
                    (p. 312) as to the probable influence of an Iranian legend on the book of
                    Esther.</p></note> And only in this way can we explain the appearance of the dog
                    who goes out and returns with Tobias and Raphael. This trait is so inconsistent
                    with Jewish feelings towards the unclean animal that it is omitted in the Hebrew
                    and Chaldee versions. But to the Iranians the dog was not only a sacred animal,
                    the protector of herds and homes, but was the companion of the protecting spirit

                <p>The Greek text of Tobit is found in a shorter recension (the usual text) and in a
                    longer form preserved in the Codex Sinaiticus (published by F. H. Reusch, 4to,
                    Bonn, 1870). There are fragments of another form of the longer text in several
                    cursives. All the forms are given in Fritzsche’s <hi rend="italic">Libri
                    Apocryphi,</hi> Leipsic, 1871. The shorter text, in the judgment of Fritzsche
                    and Nöldeke, is the earlier. The longer text is also represented by the Latin
                    versions, the second part of the rare Syriac version (the first part is from the
                    hexaplar Greek), and two closely allied Jewish versions, the Aramaic (published
                    by Neubauer, from a unique Midrash in the Bodleian, Oxf., 1878) and the Hebrew,
                    first printed in Constantinople (1516), reprinted by Münster in 1542 (whence its
                    common name <hi rend="italic">Ilebraeus Λfunsteri)</hi> and included in
                    Neubauer’s edition. The Aramaic seems to be a late form of the text known to
                    Jerome, and of which he made use for the Vulgate Latin; it is certainly a
                    translation from the Greek. There are recent commentaries on Tobit by Fritzsche
