                    rend="italic">{Deutscher Orden, Deutsche Ritter, Orden der Ritter des Hospitales
                    St Marien zu Jerusalem),</hi> is one of the three great military and religious
                    orders to which the crusades gave birth. Its name is derived from a German
                    hospital founded at Jerusalem in 1128, which disappeared on the capture of the
                    Holy City by the Saracens in 1187. The pity excited in the minds of some German
                    merchants by the sufferings of the Christian soldiers at the siege of Acre in
                    1190 induced them to revive the work of this society under a somewhat different
                    form; and eight or nine years later the society, as thus resuscitated, was
                    converted into a military order. Like the two other military orders, the
                    Teutonic order adopted the Augustine rule of life; and, in addition to the
                    ordinary monastic vows, the members laid upon themselves the special obligations
                    of tending sick and wounded pilgrims and of fighting the pagans. Frederick, duke
                    of Swabia, took the young order under his protection, and it soon received
                    charters from the pope and emperor, entitling it to the same privileges as the
                    Templars and Knights of St John. Whatever was the case at first, the members of
                    the order were ultimately required to be Germans of honourable birth. Priest
                    brothers were introduced about 1220, and afterwards half-brothers, like the <hi
                    rend="italic">frères servants d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">armes</hi> of the other
                    orders, who did not require to be of noble birth, and might, to some extent,
                    continue their ordinary secular occupations. The distinguishing garb of the
                    order consisted of a white mantle with a black cross.</p>
                <p>Almost at once a rich stream of benefactions of all kinds began to flow into the
                    coffers of the order, which gradually acquired extensive territories in
                    Palestine and also in Germany and other parts of Europe. Its first seat was at
                    Acre, and the first grand-master was a Rhenish knight named Herman Walpot of
                    Bassenheim. The order rose to great power and influence under Herman von <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Salza</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.vf,</hi> who held the office of
                    grand-master from about 1210 to 1239, and enjoyed the fullest confidence of both
                    emperor and pope. He Avas also keen enough to see the hopelessness of the
                    attempt to expel the Mohammedans from the Holy Land, and eagerly hailed the
                    opportunity of transferring the activity of the order to another sphere which
                    was afforded by the invitation to undertake a crusade against the heathen
                    Prussians. The successful progress of this crusade, the aggrandizement thereby
                    accruing to the order, and its subsequent decline have already been narrated in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Prussia</hi> (vol. xx. pp. 5-6). Soon after the
                    beginning of the struggle, in 1237, the Teutonic order absorbed the order of the
                    Brothers of the Sword, a union which brought Courland, Semgallen, and Livonia to
                    swell its territories. In 1291, when Acre, the last stronghold of the Franks in
                    Palestine, fell the order removed its headquarters to Venice; but, when its
                    centre of gravity became so obviously shifted to the extensive territories Avon
                    from the Prussians, the seat of government Avas transferred (1309) to <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Marienburg</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.vf</hi> on the Vistula,
                    where a splendid castle Avas erected for the grand-masters. The grand-mastership
                    of Weinrich von Kniprode (1351-82) is the most prosperous period in the history
                    of the order. Its territorial possessions far exceeded those attained by either
                    of the rival orders, stretching from the Oder on the Avest to the Gulf of
                    Finland on the east, and containing a population of two to three million souls.
                    Its government at first Avas excellent, and for a time it may be said to have
                    played the leading rôle in the political history of northern Europe. Wherever
                    the order spread, Christianity and German national life were introduced. Its
                    revenues Avere very large, and its ranks Avere kept full by hosts of aspirants
                    to a share in its pious and lucrative crusades.</p>
                <p>So long as the order maintained its OAvn high standard all Avent Avell with it.
                    But its internal decay Avas synchronous Avith external events that Avould alone
                    have been extremely perilous. The union of Poland and Lithuania in 1386 raised
                    up a jealous neighbour, Avhose power it was Avellnigh impossible in the long run
                    to resist, Avhile the nominal conversion of the latter to Christianity struck at
                    the root of the order’s prosperity by depriving it of its mission. When there
                    were no more heathens within reach to convert and despoil, the chief attraction
                    to outsiders to join its ranks disappeared. After the conversion of Prussia into
                    a secular duchy the Teutonic order still continued to exist as an ecclesiastical
                    organization, possessing eleven bailiAvicks in different parts of Europe, Avith
                    a total area of 850 square miles and 88,000 inhabitants. The headquarters Avere
                    fixed at Mergentheim in Swabia. Its political importance Avas of course now a
                    thing of the past, and the scattered position of the bailiAvicks only emphasized
                    its Aveakness. In 1801 the bailiAvicks to the Avest of the Rhine Avere absorbed
                    by France, and in 1809 the order Avas entirely suppressed by Napoleon, its lands
                    going to the secular principalities within Avhich they lay. In 1840 the order
                    Avas resuscitated in Austria, Avhere it <hi rend="smallcaps">uoav</hi> exists as
                    a semi-religious knighthood, presided over by a royal archduke. Of late it has
                    been doing something tθAvards justifying its existence and connecting itself
                    Avith its past history by engaging in the ambulance service in time of Avar. The
                    bailiAvick of Utrecht, Avhich survived the decree of Napoleon, also still
                    exists, but the Dutch representatives of the order have become Protestants. The
                    jeAvel of the order consists of a black and Avhite cross, surmounted by a helmet
                    with three feathers.</p>
                <p>The complete organization of the Teutonic order included a grand-master <hi
                    rend="italic">dιοchmeister},</hi> provincial masters <hi rend="italic"
                    >(lanélmeisler)</hi> for the greater provinces, and commanders <hi rend="italic"
                    >(kοmturen)</hi> for the smaller districts and castles. The power of these
                    officers was not, however, absolute. The grand-master co-operated with a chapter
                    consisting of the provincial masters and five other important functionaries,
                    while the provincial masters in turn had to consult with the council formed by
                    the knight commanders. The privileges enjoyed by the order in its palmy days
                    Avere of the most extensive nature, and its relations to both church and state
                    Avere often of a most exceptional nature.</p>
