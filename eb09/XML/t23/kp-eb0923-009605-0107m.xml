                    Kursk on the E., Poltava on the S., and Kieff and Minsk on the W., has an area
                    of 20,233 square miles. Its surface is an undulating plain, 650 to 750 feet high
                    in the north, and from 370 to 600 feet in the south, deeply grooved by ravines
                    and the valleys of the rivers. In the north, “beyond the Desna,” about one-third
                    of the area is under wood (which is rapidly disappearing), and marshes occur
                    along the courses of the rivers; while to the south of the Desna the soil is
                    dry, sometimes sandy, and assumes the characters of a steppeland as one proceeds
                    southward. Chalk deposits prevail in the north, and Eocene in the south. The
                    government is watered by the Dnieper (which forms its western boundary for 178
                    miles) and its tributaries the Soj and the Desna. The latter, which flows
                    through Tchernigoff for nearly 350 miles, is navigable, and timber is brought
                    down its tributaries. Corn, linseed, timber, brandy, hemp, and sugar are shipped
                    on the Dnieper, Soj, and Desna, and salt imported. The climate is much colder in
                    the woody tracts of the north than in the south; the average yearly temperature
                    at the town of Tchernigoff is 44° ’ 4 (January, 23°; July, 68° ’ 5).</p>
                <p>The population, which is rapidly increasing, reached 1,996,250 in 1883. It is
                    chiefly Little Russian (85'6 per cent.); Great Russians (6Ί per cent.), mostly
                    Raskolniks, and White Russians (5 ’ 6 per cent.) inhabit the northern districts.
                    Jews have spread rapidly since last century, and now number more than 45,000.
                    There are, besides, some 20,000 Germans as well as Greeks at Nyezhin.
                    Agriculture is the principal occupation; in the north, however, many of the
                    inhabitants are engaged in the timber trade and various domestic industries.
                    Cattle-breeding is carried on in the central districts, and there were in 1883
                    572,200 horses, 515,300 cattle, and 948,000 sheep. Beet is extensively
                    cultivated, and in 1884 2 million cwts. of beet-root were delivered to the
                    thirteen sugar-works within the government. The culture of tobacco is also
                    increasing, upwards of 500,000 cwts. being produced annually. Hemp is widely
                    cultivated in the north, and the milder climate of the south encourages
                    gardening. Bee-keeping is extensively carried on by the Raskolniks. Tar, pitch,
                    and a large variety of wooden manufactures are largely produced in the forest
                    districts, as also are woven fabrics, felts, and leather wares. Limestone,
                    grindstones, china-clay, and building stone are quarried. Manufactures have
                    begun to develop rapidly of late; by 1881 their yearly production reached
                    £1,340,000 (£860,000 from sugar-works and distilleries). Trade is active,
                    especially since the opening of the railway between Kieff and Kursk, which runs
                    through Tchernigoff. The government is divided into fifteen districts, the chief
                    towns (with populations in 1885) being Tchernigoff (19,000), Borzna (13,700),
                    Glukhoff (16,450), Gorodnya (3550), Konotop (16,420), Kozelets (4430), Krolevets
                    (9190), Mglin (10,880), Novgorod-Syeversk (8020), Novozybkoff (11,920), Nyezhin
                    (43,020), Oster (3550), Sosnitsa (5650), Starodub (23,890 in 1880), and Surazh
                    (3770). A number of unimportant towns (14 <hi rend="italic">posads</hi> and 49
                    <hi rend="italic">myestechki)</hi> possess municipal institutions.</p>
