                    (1817-1862), one of the most strongly-marked individualities of modern times,
                    spent the greater part of his life in the neighbourhood of the place where he
                    was born—Concord, a village town of Massachusetts, pleasantly situated some
                    twenty miles northwest of Boston, amidst a pastoral country of placid beauty. To
                    Thoreau this Concord country contained all of beauty and even grandeur that was
                    necessary to the worshipper of nature: he once journeyed to Canada; he went west
                    on one occasion; he sailed and explored a few rivers; for the rest, he haunted
                    Concord and its neighbourhood as faithfully as the stork does its ancestral
                    nest. John Thoreau, his father, who married the daughter of a New England
                    clergyman, was the son of a John Thoreau of the isle of Jersey, who, in Boston,
                    married a Scottish lady of the name of Burns. This last-named John was the son
                    of Philippe Thoreau and his wife Marie le Gallais, persons of pure French blood,
                    settled at St Helier, in Jersey. From his New England Puritan mother, from his
                    Scottish grandmother, from his Jersey-American grandfather, and from his remoter
                    French ancestry Thoreau inherited distinctive traits: the Saxon element perhaps
                    predominated, but the “hauntings of Celtism” were prevalent and potent. The
                    stock of the Thoreaus was a robust one; and in Concord the family, though never
                    wealthy nor officially influential, was ever held in peculiar respect. As a boy,
                    Henry drove his mother’s cow to the pastures, and thus early became enamoured of
                    certain aspects of nature and of certain delights of solitude. At school and at
                    Harvard university he in nowise distinguished himself, though he was an
                    intelligently receptive student; he became, however, proficient enough in Greek,
                    Latin, and the more general acquirements to enable him to act for a time as a
                    master. But long before this he had become apprenticed to the learning of nature
                    in preference to that of man: when only twelve years of age he had made
                    collections for Agassiz, who had then just arrived in America, and already the
                    meadows and the hedges and the stream-sides had become cabinets of rare
                    knowledge to him. On the desertion of schoolmastering as a profession Thoreau
                    became a lecturer and author, though it was the labour of his hands which mainly
                    supported him through many years of his life: professionally he was a surveyor.
                    In the effort to reduce the practice of economy to a fine art he arrived at the
                    conviction that the less labour a man did, over and above the positive demands
                    of necessity, the better for him and for the community at large; he would have
                    had the order of the week reversed,—six days of rest for one of labour. It was
                    in 1845 he made the now famous experiment of Walden. Desirous of proving to
                    himself and others that man could be as independent of his kind as the
                    nest-building bird, Thoreau retired to a hut of his own construction on the
                    pine-slope over against the shores of ΛValden Pond,—a hut which he built,
                    furnished, and kept in order entirely by the labour of his own hands. During the
                    two years of his residence in Walden woods he lived by the exercise of a little
                    surveying, a little job-work, and the tillage of a few acres of ground which
                    produced him his beans and potatoes. His absolute independency was as little
                    gained as if he had camped out in Hyde Park; relatively he lived the life of a
                    recluse. He read considerably, wrote abundantly, thought actively if not widely,
                    and came to know beasts, birds, and fishes with an intimacy more extraordinary
                    than was the case with St Francis of Assisi. Birds came at his call, and forgot
                    their hereditary fear of man; beasts lipped and caressed him; the very fish in
                    lake and stream would glide, unfearful, between his hands. This exquisite
                    familiarity with bird and beast would make us love the memory of Thoreau, if his
                    egotism were triply as arrogant, if his often meaningless paradoxes were even
                    more absurd, if his sympathies were even less humanitarian than we know them to
                    have been. His <hi rend="italic">Walden,</hi> the record of this fascinating two
                    years’ experience, must always remain a production of great interest and
                    considerable psychological value. Some years before Thoreau took to Walden woods
                    he made the chief friendship of his life, that with Emerson. He became one of
                    the famous circle of the transcendentalists, always keenly preserving his own
                    individuality amongst such more or less potent natures as Emerson, Hawthorne,
                    and Margaret Fuller. From Emerson he gained more than from any man, alive or
                    dead; and, though the older philosopher both enjoyed and learned from the
                    association with the younger, it cannot be said that the gain was equal. There
                    was nothing electrical in Thoreau’s intercourse with his fellow-men; he gave off
                    no spiritual sparks. He absorbed intensely, but when called upon to illuminate
                    in turn was found wanting. It is with a sense of relief that we read of his
                    having really been stirred into active enthusiasm anent the wrongs done the
                    ill-fated John Brown. With children he was affectionate and gentle, with old
                    people and strangers considerate. In a word, he loved his kind as animals, but
                    did not seem to find them as interesting as those furred and feathered. In 1847
                    Thoreau left Walden Lake abruptly, and for a time occupied himself with
                    lead-pencil making, the parental trade. He never married, thus further
                    fulfilling his policy of wha <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> t one of his
                    essayistbiographers has termed “indulgence in fine renouncements.” At the
                    comparatively early age of forty-five he died, on 6th May 1862. His grave is in
                    the beautiful cemetery of Sleepy Hollow, beside those of Hawthorne and
                    Emerson.</p>
                <p>Thoreau’s fame will rest on <hi rend="italic">Walden,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Excursions,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> though he wrote
                    nothing which is not deserving of notice. Up till his thirtieth year he dabbled
                    in verse, but he had little ear for metrical music, and he lacked the spiritual
                    impulsiveness of the true poet. He had occasional flashes of insight and could
                    record beautifully, notwithstanding: his little poem “Haze” is surcharged with
                    concentrated loveliness. His weakness as a philosopher is his tendency to base
                    the laws of the universe on the experience-born, thought-produced convictions of
                    one man—himself. His weakness as a w riter is the too frequent striving after
                    antithesis and paradox. If he had had all his own originality without the itch
                    of appearing <pb break="no"

                    irresistible. As it is, Thoreau holds a unique place. He was a naturalist, but
                    absolutely devoid of the pedantry of science; a keen observer, but no retailer
                    of disjointed facts. He thus holds sway over two domaius: he has the adherence
                    of the lovers of fact and of the children of fancy. He must always be read,
                    whether lovingly or interestedly, for he has all the variable charm, the strange
                    saturninity, the contradictions, austerities, and delightful surprises, of
                    Nature herself.</p>
