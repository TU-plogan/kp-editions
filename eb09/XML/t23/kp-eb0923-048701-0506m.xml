                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Apparently the first ornithologist to make
                    the bird known was Albin, who figured it in 1738 from the life, yet badly, as "
                    The Crownbird of Mexico.” He had doubtless been misinformed as to its proper
                    country; but Touracos were called “Crown-birds” by the Europeans in West Africa,
                    as witness Bosman’s <hi rend="italic">Description of the Coast of Guinea</hi>
                    (1721), ed. 2, p. 251, and W. Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Voyage to Guinea</hi>
                    (1745), p. 149, though the name was also given to the Crowned Cranes, <hi
                    rend="italic">Balearica.</hi></p></note> and presumably that applied to it in
                    Guinea, whence it had been brought alive. It is the <hi rend="italic">Cuculus
                    persa</hi> of Linnseus, and <hi rend="italic">Turacus</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corythaix persa</hi> of later authors, who perceived that it required generic
                    separation. Cuvier, in 1799 or 1800, Latinized its native name (adopted in the
                    meanwhile by both French and German writers) as above, for which barbarous term
                    liliger, in 1811, substituted a more classical word. In 1788 Isert described and
                    figured <hi rend="italic">(Beobacht. Gesellsch. naturf. Freunde,</hi> iii. pp.
                    16-20, pl. 1) a bird, also from Guinea, which he called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Musophaga violacea.</hi> Its affinity to the original Touraco was soon
                    recognized, and both forms have been joined by modern systematists in the Family
                    <hi rend="italic">Musophagidae,</hi> commonly Englished Plantain-eaters or
                    Touracos, sometimes spelt Tourakoos.</p>
                <p>To take first the Plantain-eaters proper, or the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Musophaga,</hi> of which only two species are known. One about the size of a
                    Crow is comparatively common in museums, and is readily recognized by having the
                    horny base of its fine yellow bill prolonged backwards over the forehead in a
                    kind of shield. The top of the head, and the primaries, except their outer edge
                    and tip, are deep crimson; a white streak extends behind the eye; and the rest
                    of the plumage is of a rich glossy purple. The second species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >AL rossae,</hi> which is rare, chiefly differs by wanting the white eye-streak.
                    Then of the Touracos—the species originally described is about the size of a
                    Jay, and has the head, crest (which is vertically compressed and tipped with
                    red), neck, and breast of a fine grass-green, varied by two conspicuous white
                    streaks—one, from the gape to the upper part of the crimson orbit, separated by
                    a black patch from the other, which runs beneath and behind the eye. The
                    wingcoverts, lower part of the back, and tail are of a bright steel-purple, the
                    primaries deep crimson, edged and tipped with bluish-black. Over a dozen other
                    congeneric species, more or less resembling this, have now been described, and
                    all inhabit some district of Africa; but there is only room here to mention that
                    found in the Cape Colony and Natal, where it is known as the “Lory” <hi
                    rend="italic">(cf.</hi> vol. xv. p. 7, note 1), and, though figured by Daubenton
                    and others, first differentiated in 1841 by Strickland <hi rend="italic">(Ann.
                    Nat. History,</hi> vii. p. 33) as <hi rend="italic">Turacus albicristatus—</hi>
                    its crest having a conspicuous white border, while the steel-purple of <hi
                    rend="italic">T. persa</hi> is replaced by a rich and glossy bluish-green of no
                    less beauty. In nearly all the species of this genus the nostrils are almost
                    completely hidden by the frontal feathers; but there are two others in which,
                    though closely allied, this is not the case, and some systematists would place
                    them in a separate genus <hi rend="italic">Gallirex;</hi> while another species,
                    the giant of the Family, has been moved into a third genus as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corythaeola cristata.</hi> This differs from any of the foregoing by the
                    absence of the crimson coloration of the primaries, and seems to lead to another
                    group, <hi rend="italic">Schizorrhis,</hi> in which the plumage is of a still
                    plainer type, and, moreover, the nostrils here are not only exposed but in the
                    form of a slit, instead of being oval as in all the rest. This genus contains
                    about half a dozen species, one of which, <hi rend="italic">S. concolor,</hi> is
                    the Grey Touraco of the colonists in Natal, and is of an almost uniform
                    slaty-brown. A good deal has been written about these birds, which form the
                    subject of one of the most beautiful monographs ever published <hi rend="italic"
                    >—De Toerako's afgebeld en beschreven,—</hi> by Schlegel and Westerman, brought
                    out at Amsterdam in 1860; while the latest collected information is contained in
                    an elaborate essay by Herr Schalow <hi rend="italic">(Jour. f.
                    Ornithologie,</hi> 1886, pp. 1-77). Still, much remains to be made known as to
                    their distribution throughout Africa, and their habits. They seem to be all
                    fruit-eaters, and to frequent the highest trees, seldom coming to the ground.
                    Very little can be confidently asserted as to their nidification, but at least
                    one species of <hi rend="italic">Schizorrhis</hi> is said to make a rough nest
                    and therein lay three eggs of a pale blue colour. An extraordinary peculiarity
                    attends the crimson coloration which adorns the primaries of so many of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Musophagidae.</hi> So long ago as 1818, Jules Verreaux observed
                    <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1871, p. 40) that in the case of
                    <hi rend="italic">T. albicristatus</hi> this beautiful hue vanishes on exposure
                    to heavy rain and reappears only after some interval of time and when the
                    feathers are dry.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    fact of this colouring matter being soluble in water was incidentally mentioned
                    at a meeting of the Zoological Society by Mr Tegetmeier, and brought to the
                    notice of Prof. Church, who, after experiment, published in 1868 <hi
                    rend="italic">(Student and Intellectual Observer,</hi> i. pp. 161-168) an
                    account of it as “Turacin, a new animal pigment containing copper.” Further
                    information on the subject was given by Monteiro <hi rend="italic">(Chem.
                    News,</hi> xxviii. p. 201; <hi rend="italic">Quart. Jour. Science,</hi> ser. 2,
                    iv. p. 132). The property is possessed by the crimson feathers of all the birds
                    of the Family.</p></note></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Musophagidae</hi> form a very distinct Family of Prof.
                    Huxley’s <hi rend="italic">Coccygomorphae,</hi> having perhaps the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coliidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cuculidae</hi> as their
                    nearest allies. Eyton pointed out <hi rend="italic">(Ann. Nat. History,</hi>
                    ser. 3, ii. p. 458) a feature possessed in common by the latter and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Musophagidae,</hi> in the “process attached to the anterior edge
                    of the ischium,” which he likened to the so-called “marsupial” bones of
                    Didelphian Mammals. J. T. Reinhardt has also noticed (<hi rend="italic">Vidensk.
                    Meddels. Naturhist. Forening,</hi> 1871, pp. 326-341) another Cuculine character

                    Plantain-eaters and Touracos; but too much dependence must not be placed on
                    that, since a similar structure is presented by the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Frigate-bird</hi> (vol. ix. p. 786) and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Petrels</hi>
                    (vol. xviii. p. 711). A corresponding process seems also to be found in <hi

                    all the species of <hi rend="italic">Musophagidae</hi> is curiously serrated or
                    denticulated along the margin, and the feet have the outer toe reversible. No
                    member of the Family is found outside of the continental portion of the
