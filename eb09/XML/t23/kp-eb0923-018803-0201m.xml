                    limited and certain period of time.</p>
                <p>(1) It denotes (or rather did denote) a fixed time during which the courts are
                    open for legal proceedings. Terms in this sense affected only what used to be
                    called the superior courts,—that is, the Queen’s Bench, Common Pleas, and
                    Exchequer. They were originally the leisure seasons of the year which were not
                    occupied by great feasts or fasts of the church or by agriculture. Their origin
                    is no doubt to be traced back to the legislation of the early Christian
                    emperors, the principle being adopted in England through the influence of
                    ecclesiastical judges, and still surviving in the universities and Inns of
                    Court. Terms were regulated by many Acts of parliament, the effect of which was
                    to confine to a comparatively short period the time during which the courts
                    could sit <hi rend="italic">in banco,—</hi> that is, for the decision of
                    questions of law as distinguished from the decision of questions of fact. There
                    were four terms, Hilary, Easter, Trinity, and Michaelmas, the average duration
                    of each being about three weeks. All legislation on the subject previous to 1873
                    is now merely of historical interest, for by the Judicature Act of that year the
                    division of the year into terms was abolished so far as related to the
                    administration of justice.</p>
                <p>(2) It denotes the time during which an interest in an estate for life or for
                    years is enjoyed, also the interest itself, because such an interest must
                    determine at a definite time. If the interest be for life, it is an estate of
                    freehold; if for years, only a personal interest in real estate, and so
                    personalty, even though the length of the term—for instance, 1000 years—may far
                    exceed in duration any possible life estate. A term of years is of two
                    kinds,—the first that created by an ordinary lease reserving a rent, as of a
                    house or a building lease; the second that created by a settlement or a will,
                    usually without rent reserved, for the purpose of securing payment of money,
                    such as portions to younger children, by the owner of the land. Both kinds have
                    been considerably affected by recent legislation. For instance, the Conveyancing
                    Act, 1881, enables a mortgagor or mortgagee in possession to make certain
                    leases. Before 1845 provision was always made in conveyances for keeping on foot
                    a term to attend the inheritance, as it was called,—that is, for assigning the
                    remainder of a term to trustees for the protection of the owner of the property
                    against rent-charges or other incumbrances created subsequently to the term,
                    although the term had been satisfied,—that is, the purpose for which the term
                    had been created had been fulfilled. By 8 and 9 Vict. c. 112 the assignment of
                    satisfied terms was rendered unnecessary. The Conveyancing Acts, 1881 and 1882,
                    give power to enlarge the unexpired residue of a long term in certain cases into
                    the fee simple.</p>
                <p>In Scotland terms are the days at which rent or interest is payable. They are
                    either legal or conventional: the legal are Whitsunday and Martinmas; the
                    conventional are fixed by agreement between the parties. A recent Act (44 and 45
                    Vict. c. 39) makes uniform the law as to removal terms in burghs. Terms as times
                    of court sittings were defined by 6 Anne c. 53, which fixed four terms—
                    Martinmas, Candlemas, Whitsuntide, and Lammas—for the now obsolete Court of
                    Exchequer. By 19 and 20 Vict. c. 56, s. 26, the winter and summer sittings of
                    the Court of Session are to be held to correspond with the Exchequer terms.</p>
