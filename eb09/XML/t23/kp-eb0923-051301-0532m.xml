                <p><label type="entry">TRANSCAUCASIA</label>, the name given to that portion of the
                    Russian empire (in Caucasus, Armenia, and Asia Minor) which lies to the south of
                    the main Caucasus ridge. It comprises the governments of Kutais (inclusive of
                    the province of Batum), Tiflis, Elisabethpol, Erivañ, and Kars, with parts of
                    Daghestan and most of Baku, and the separate military districts of Tchernomorsk
                    and Zakataɫy. Sometimes Transcaucasia is identified with Southern Caucasus, and
                    then it is intended to include the whole of Daghestan. So defined, it would have
                    an area of 95,930 square miles, and a population of 4,173,380.</p>
                <p>Three regions must be distinguished :—(1) the narrow strip of land between the
                    main Caucasus ridge and the Black Sea <hi rend="smallcaps">(Tchernomorsk</hi>
                    district, <hi rend="italic">q.v</hi>.); (2) the broad valley, watered by the
                    Rion in the west and the Kura in the east, which separates the main Caucasus
                    ridge from the region next to be mentioned; (3) the highlands, mountains, and
                    plateaus of Lazistan, Kars, and Armenia.</p>
                <p>The valley referred to, which crosses the isthmus from the Black Sea to the
                    Caspian, consists of two widely different sections,—the drainage-area of the
                    Rion, which is Mediterranean in its physical characteristics, and the valley of
                    the Kura and Araxes, which slopes to the Caspian, and in its lower parts becomes
                    purely cis-Caspian. The Mesques or Meshik Mountains (3000-5000 feet), a ridge
                    running south-west to north-east, and probably a continuation of the Black Sea
                    coast ridge (Tchorokh Mountains), separate the two. The drainage area of the
                    Rion, which corresponds approximately to the government of Kutais, includes the
                    former provinces of Imeritia, Mingrelia, Guria, and Swanetia on the upper Ingur
                    and Tshenis-tshali. With the exception of the valley of the Rion (some 25 miles
                    broad), and the sandy and marshy littoral, it is wholly occupied by spurs of the
                    main Caucasus ridge, the Meshik, and the Wakhan Mountains; the last-named rise
                    to 10,000 and 11,000 feet above the sea in their highest summits, and are
                    intersected by deep and fertile valleys. The region is characterized by a heavy
                    rainfall and a moist maritime climate. The vegetation, which is luxuriant, is of
                    a circum-Mediterranean character: fine forests of deciduous trees clothe the
                    mountain slopes, and the highland villages nestle amid thickets of azalea,
                    almond, and rhododendron. Maize, the mulberry, the vine, and a great variety of
                    fruit trees are cultivated. Mingrelia and Imeritia are the real gardens of
                    Caucasus; but the high valleys tributary to the Ingur, inhabited by Swanians,
                    are wild and difficult of access; in some of them, which are narrow and marshy,
                    fevers and scurvy prevail. The Rion is not navigable, and of its tributaries
                    only the Tshenis-</p>
                <p>tshali and the Kvirila are worthy of mention. Several lakes (such as the
                    Paleostom, surrounded by marshes at the mouth of the Rion) occur in the coast
                    region. The population consists of Imeritians, Mingrelians, Gurians, and
                    Swanians, all belonging to the Kartvelian branch of Caucasians (see vol. x. p.
                    433), with a few Ossetians, Jews, Armenians, and Tartars. Russians are not
                    numerous.</p>
                <p>The pass of Suram, by which the Transcaucasian railway now crosses the Mesques
                    Mountains, leads from the valley of the Rion to that of the Kura. Spurs from the
                    Caucasus and the Anti-caucasus fill up the broad longitudinal depression between
                    these, so that above Tiflis the bottom of the valley is but a narrow strip. But
                    below that city it suddenly widens, and stretches for nearly 350 miles eastward
                    towards the Caspian with a steadily increasing breadth, until it becomes nearly
                    100 miles wide in the steppe of Mugañ on the Caspian littoral. The snow-clad
                    peaks of the main Caucasus, descending by short steep slopes, fringe the valley
                    on the north-east; while a huge wall, much lower, and having the characters of a
                    border-ridge of the Armenian plateau, bounds the valley on the south-west.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For this valley and the
                    contrasts between the Caucasus and Anti-caucasus, see Radde s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Omis Caucasica,</hi> Cassel, 1884.</p></note> The floor of the valley gently
                    slopes from 1200 feet at Tiflis to 500 feet in its middle, and to 85 feet below
                    the level of the ocean on the Caspian shore; but a plateau ranging from 2000 to
                    3000 feet in height, very fertile along the Aɫazañ, a left-hand tributary of the
                    Kura, stretches along the southern hillfoots of the main ridge. In its lower
                    course the Kura is joined by the Araxes, a river nearly as large as itself,
                    which brings to it the waters of the Armenian plateau.</p>
                <p>The highest mountains of the Caucasus enclose the upper parts of the valley (now
                    the government of Tiflis). An unbroken series of peaks, from 10,000 to 12,600
                    feet in height, mostly snow-clad and separated by but slight depressions, is
                    seen in profile as one looks from some height of the Anticaucasus towards the
                    main chain and the broad valley of the Kura. Deep short gorges and valleys
                    indent the steep slopes which are inhabited by Ossetians, Tushes, Pshavs, and
                    Khevsurs in the west, and by the various tribes of the Lesghians in the east.
                    Every available patch is used in these high and stony valleys for the culture of
                    barley, even at heights of 7000 and 8000 feet above the sea; but cattle-breeding
                    is the chief resource of the mountaineers, whose little communities are
                    separated from one another by passes in few cases lower than 10,000 feet. The
                    steppes which cover the bottom of the valley are for the most part too dry to be
                    cultivated without irrigation. It is only nearer the hillfoots in Kahetia, where
                    multitudinous streams supply the fields and the gardens of the plateau of the
                    Atazan, that wheat, millet, and maize are grown, and orchards, vineyards, and
                    mulberry-tree plantations are possible. Lower down the valley cattle-rearing
                    becomes the chief source of wealth, while in the small towns and villages of the
                    former Georgian kingdom (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Georgia)</hi> various petty
                    trades, testifying to a high development of artistic taste and technical skill,
                    are widely diffused. Further down the Kura, in the government of Elizabethpol,
                    and especially on the right bank of the river, a population of Russian
                    agriculturists—chiefly Nonconformists —is rapidly springing up, so that corn is
                    exported from the villages on the Ganja. The slopes of the Anticaucasus are
                    covered with beautiful forests, and the vine is grown at their base, while in
                    the broad and wide steppes the Tartars rear cattle, horses, and sheep. The lower
                    part of the Kura valley, which belongs mainly to the province of Baku, assumes
                    the character of a dry steppe where the rainfall hardly reaches 13∙7 inches at
                    Baku, and is still less in the Mugañ steppe (in most striking contrast with the
                    moistness of the Lenkoran region close by). The steep slopes of the Great
                    Caucasus are still covered with thriving forests; but forests and meadows
                    disappear in the steppe, whose scanty vegetation has a Central-Asian character.
                    Only <hi rend="italic">tugais,</hi> or thickets of poplar, dwarf oak, tamarisk,
                    and so on, follow the actual course of the Kura, whose delta is covered with
                    impenetrable growths of rushes. The Mugañ steppe, however, does not deserve its
                    ancient evil reputation; the serpents with which it was said to abound are
                    entirely fabulous, and in the winter it is full of life; herds of antelopes roam
                    over it, and its southern irrigated parts promise to become the granary of
                    Caucasus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Seidlitz, <hi

                    although its unirrigated parts will probably never recover their former
                    richness, the Kura having excavated its bed to a much greater depth. The
                    Apsheron peninsula, in which the Great Caucasus terminates at Baku, to be
                    continued farther south-east by a submarine plateau of the Caspian, is the seat
                    of those remarkable naphtha springs which have recently given rise to an
                    important industry and now supply most of the Volga steamers with fuel; while
                    the western shores of the wide Kizil-agatch Bay—the Tatysh, or Lenkoran district
                    on the slopes of the Armenian plateau—on account of their rich vegetation,
                    fertile soil, and moist climate, are one of the most beautiful possessions of
                    Russia in Asia.</p>

                <p>The population includes only a few Russians (about 16,000); the majority are
                    Tartar shepherds, next to whom come the Iranian Tates and Talyshes (the latter
                    probably aborigines of Baku), who constitute 23∙1 per cent. of the population;
                    some 27,000 Armenians, chiefly about Shemakha, and 35,000 Kurins, or Lezghians,
                    on the slope of the Great Caucasus, must be added, as also some Jews and
                    Arabs.</p>
                <p>A mining industry of some importance has been growing up of late in this part of
                    Transcaucasia. The copper works of Kedabek in Elizabethpol yield from 10,000 to
                    15,000 cwts. of copper annually; nearly 300,000 cwts. of manganese are extracted
                    in Kutais, and 30,000 cwts. of sulphur in Daghestan and Baku; the coal-mines of
                    Kutais, the alum ores of Elizabethpol, and the fire-clay and cement of
                    Tchernomorsk, are but recently opened up.</p>
                <p>The highlands of Transcaucasia, which extend from north-west to south-east for
                    nearly 375 miles, with an average width of 160 miles, must in their turn be
                    subdivided into two sections—the Armenian plateau, including the provinces of
                    Erivañ and Kars and parts of Baku, and the Black Sea coast-region, including the
                    former province of Batum (now the Batum and Artvin districts of Kutais).</p>
                <p>The former of those is an immense plateau separated by the valley of the Araxes
                    from the highlands of Adherbaijan and of Turkish Armenia, which belong to the
                    drainage-areas of the Euphrates or those of Lakes Van and Urmia. All over Kars
                    and Erivañ is a series of plateaus ranging in altitude from 5000 to 6500 feet,
                    sometimes quite flat, sometimes broadly undulating, covered with rich meadows,
                    and for the most part available for agriculture. Dome-shaped mountains,
                    isolated, or grouped into relatively low ridges, rise from these plateaus to
                    heights which range from 8000 to 9500 feet, and occasionally reach 10,000 or
                    11,000 above sea-level. Several summits in the east exceed that height, and the
                    Alaghöz reaches 13,436 feet.</p>
                <p>This plateau region is bounded on the south by the valley of the Araxes, the
                    river which forms the frontier with Turkey, except where it is crossed by Russia
                    in the south of Kars and west of Erivañ. There the river flows in a broad valley
                    4500 feet above sea-level, and the Kars plateau falls towards it by a steep
                    slope, while on the other side a steep, rocky ridge of exceedingly wild aspect
                    rises as the northern border-ridge of the South Armenian (Alashkert) plateau and
                    the water-parting between the Caspian Sea and the Indian Ocean. This ridge,
                    which includes the Allah-dagh and Kösa-dagh (10,720 and 11,260 feet
                    respectively), as also the Great and Little Ararats (17,100 and 12,990 feet),
                    has no general name, but is described under the names of Shah-ioly, or
                    Agri-dagh.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>W. Massalsky,
                    “Government of Kars,” in <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> of Russ. Geogr. Soc.,
                    vol. xxiii., 1887.</p></note></p>
                <p>A number of lakes occur on the plateau, especially along its northern
                    border-ridge, the chief being that of Goktcha, an extensive alpine basin (500
                    square miles 6310 feet above sea-level) surrounded by wild mountains. Most of
                    the depressions of the plateau bear traces of having been under water during the
                    Lacustrine (Post-Glacial) period. Granites and other unstratified rocks
                    constitute the nucleus of the Armenian and Kars plateaus. These are covered with
                    Azoic slates, and partly with Devonian and Carboniferous deposits; Jurassic and
                    Cretaceous are wanting, but the Tertiary (Eocene and Miocene) are widely spread
                    both in the valley of the Rion and Kura and in the depressions of the plateau.
                    Rocks of volcanic origin are widely diffused all over Erivañ: the Alexandropol
                    plateau, surrounded by extinct volcanoes, is all covered with volcanic products,
                    which overlie the Tertiary deposits and in turn are covered with Glacial
                    boulder-clay.</p>
                <p>The Alaghöz, the Ararats, and the peaks around Lake Goktcha are huge trachitic
                    masses surrounded by volcanic rocks. Iron and copper ores are widely spread;
                    alum and rock-salt are obtained, the latter at Kulpi and Nakhichevan. Mineral
                    springs are numerous. The region is watered by the upper Araxes—too rapid and
                    rocky to be navigated—and its tributaries, most of which flow at the bottoms of
                    deep gorges. The upper Kura waters western Kars. The climate presents all the
                    varieties which might be expected in a region of so varied altitudes. While
                    cotton grows in the dry and hot climate of the valley of the lower Araxes, the
                    winter is severe on the plateau, and Alexandropol (5010 feet) has an average
                    temperature of only 41° ∙5 (Jan. 12° ∙8; July, 73° ∙6). The difference between
                    summer and winter is still more striking at Erivañ (3210 feet), which has in
                    January an average of only 5° while that of August reaches 77°∙7. On the Kars
                    plateau the winter is still more severe. Kaghyzman (4620 feet) and Sary-kamysh
                    (7800 feet) have the winter temperature of Finland, and the latter place, with
                    an annual mean the same as that of Hammerfest (36° F.), has frosts of</p>
                <p>27° and heats of 99°. The vegetation of the Kars plateau reflects these extremes
                    of climate, and, besides the alpine vegetation of the high <hi rend="italic"
                    >yailas</hi> (alpine meadows), we find there the Anatolian, Armenian, and Pontic
                    floras meeting. The population of Erivañ consists of Armenians (54 per cent.),
                    Tartars (40 per cent.), some 28,000 Kurds, and some 4400 Russians, together with
                    a few Greeks and Jews. In localities under 4000 feet cotton and rice are the
                    chief crops, oil-yielding plants, the vine, the mulberry, and fruit trees being
                    also cultivated. Higher up wheat and barley are grown, while at altitudes above
                    6000 and 7000 feet the Tartars and Kurds support themselves by rearing cattle.
                    Many petty trades are developed in the towns among the Armenians, and the trade
                    of Erivañ with Persia and Turkey amounts to about 10,000,000 roubles.</p>
                <p>The population of the province of Kars (167,610 in 1883) is very mixed. In a
                    remote antiquity it was inhabited by Armenians, whose capital Ani, Mren with its
                    beautiful ruins of a grand cathedral, and several other towns now in ruins
                    testify to the former wealth and populousness of the country. After the fall of
                    the Armenian empire the Turks occupied the region; Kurds from Kurdistan and
                    Diarbekr invaded the alpine pasturages of the valley of the Araxes; later on,
                    Kabards, Circassians, Osses, and Karapapakhs found refuge there; and finally,
                    after the last war the Mohammedans emigrated to Asia Minor (82,760 in 1878-81),
                    while Christian Armenians, Greeks, Russian Raskolniks, and some Yezids took
                    their place. The population consists now of Turks, Armenians, Turcomans, Greeks,
                    Kurds, Adherbaijan Tartars, Gipsies, and Russians. The Kars <hi rend="italic"
                    >sanjak,</hi> which was one of the granaries of Turkey, has lost this
                    reputation; but the crops (chiefly wheat and barley) are now again increasing
                    where the early frosts do not interfere with agriculture. Cotton is raised in
                    the Olty region; and in the valley of the Araxes gardening and the culture of
                    the silkworm are widely diffused; while cattle-rearing is the chief source of
                    income in the highlands, especially with the Kurds, who move their felt tents on
                    the <hi rend="italic">yailas</hi> to higher levels as the summer sun burns up
                    the vegetation.</p>
                <p>The western part of the Transcaucasian highlands comprises the Batum and Artvin
                    districts, which now belong to Kutais. The whole of the region is occupied by
                    alpine ridges—the Pontic ridge in the west, and those of Arjar and Arsian in the
                    east, whose highest peaks rise to 10,000 and 11,000 feet, without, however,
                    reaching the limits of perpetual snow. The Tchorokh and its tributaries,
                    mountain streams enclosed in deep valleys, water the region; the Tchorokh is
                    navigable by small boats for 60 miles.</p>
                <p>The coast region enjoys an excellent climate; the average yearly temperature at
                    Batum is 65° F., that of the coldest month (February) being 41°∙5 <hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> and that of July 76°∙5. During the last four years the
                    thermometer never fell lower than 39°∙5 at Batum. The rainfall is excessive
                    (93∙4 inches), and days are recorded on which the amount of rain exceeded 10
                    inches. The region has accordingly a very luxuriant and subtropical vegetation,
                    and even higher up the hills the villages are literally buried amidst gardens.
                    The higher hills have luxuriant meadows. Rice is cultivated in the coast region,
                    and millet, barley, tobacco, and a variety of fruit-trees on higher altitudes.
                    The inhabitants (about 90,000 in 1884) are chiefly Georgians, approaching the
                    Gurians most nearly. The Lazes number about 2000 and the Kurds about 1000. A few
                    Khemshilli, or Mohammedan Armenians, have found refuge in the gorge of
                    Makrial.</p>

                    important than those of northern Caucasus. <hi rend="smallcaps">Tiflis</hi> (<hi

                    (13,000), to which tradition assigns an age of 4000 or 5000 years, has grown
                    rapidly of late, owing to its situation at the head of the alluvial plain of the
                    Rion and the proximity of the Tkvibula coal deposits and the Kvirila manganese
                    mines. Khoni (4000) and Orpiri are mere administrative centres of Kutais.
                    Redut-kale (620) has lost its importance as a seaport, and Poti (3110), at the
                    mouth of the Rion, has not yet become an important port, notwithstanding efforts
                    to improve its roadstead and its railway connexion with Tiflis and Baku. The
                    chief Black Sea port of Transcaucasia is <hi rend="smallcaps">Batum (</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.),</hi> which has been diligently fortified of late, and has
                    now a population of 12,000. Artvin (5860) and Ardjari are the two other chief
                    towns of the Batum region. The chief towns of the government of Tiflis besides
                    its capital are Gori, capital of Georgia (population 4800), Mtzhet (770) at the
                    junction of the Vladikavkaz highway with the Transcaucasian railway, Telav
                    (7020), Dushety (3600), Zakataɫy (1080), chief town of a separate military
                    district, and Sig-nakh (10,340), which are built in the spurs of the main chain;
                    while Akhaɫtsikh (18,270), on the upper Kura and on the Kars plateau, is a busy
                    centre for petty trades. The old city of Ahaɫkaɫaki (3200) on the same plateau
                    is now a Russian fort. <hi rend="smallcaps">Elizabethpol, Nukha,</hi> and <hi

                    with Mikhailovsk in the Transcaspian region, derives its importance from the

                    delta of the Kura, and notable for its fisheries, are the only places of
                    importance in the province of Baku. <hi rend="smallcaps">Erivañ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.υ.)</hi> (12,450), capital of the province of Erivañ, and the
                    chief city of the Armenian plateau, is one of the oldest cities of the country,
                    and, owing to its position, would be much more important than it is, but for its
                    climate. Etchmiadzin, or Vagarshapad (2910), is the real capital (the Rome) of
                    Armenia, for its antiquities, monastery, library, and printing offices.
                    Nakhitchevañ (5390)—the Naxuana of Ptolemy—is another centre of Armenia. The
                    most populous town of the region, however, is Alexandropol (23,010) or <hi

                    fortress of Transcaucasia,—the other towns of Erivañ being Ani, or Oni,
                    Novobayazet at Lake Goktcha, and Ordubad (3600). The long-disputed <hi

                    province of the same name, annexed in 1878. Kaghyzman (3700), on the upper
                    Araxes, is but a collection of clay houses surrounded by rich gardens; Ardahan
                    (1270), on the upper Kura, and Olty (530) are the only other towns of Kars
                    worthy of notice as administrative centres. (P. A. K.)</p>
