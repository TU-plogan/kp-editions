                    all the rest of his life. The date of his death is uncertain, but it must have
                    been at least six or seven years later than the council of Chalcedon (451).
                    Although thoroughly devoted to the ideals of monasticism, he discharged his
                    episcopal duties with remarkable zeal and fidelity. He was diligent in the cure
                    of souls, labouring hard and successfully for the conversion of the numerous
                    Gnostic communities and other heretical sects which still maintained a footing
                    within the diocese. He himself claims to have brought more than a thousand
                    Marcionites within the pale of the church, and to have destroyed many copies of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Diatessaron</hi> of Tatian, which were still in
                    ecclesiastical use; and he also exerted himself to improve the diocese, which
                    was at once large and poor, by building bridges and aqueducts, beautifying the
                    town, and similar works.</p>
                <p>As an exegete Theodoret belongs to the Antiochene schoo1, of which Diodorus of
                    Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia were the heads. He was not actually the
                    personal disciple of either, but he adopted their methods, though without the
                    consistency and boldness of the first-narned. His extant commentaries (those on
                    Canticles, on the Prophets, on the book of Psalms, and on the Pauline
                    epistles—the last the most valuable) are among the best performances of the
                    fathers of the"church. They are brief, yet not wanting in that element of
                    practical edification on which Chrysostom lays special weight as characteristic
                    of the Antiochenes. In addition to these complete commentaries, we have
                    fragments of some others (of that on Isaiah, for example), principally met with
                    in catenae. There are also special elucidations of some difficult Scripture
                    texts.</p>

                <p>Theodoret’s chief importance is as a dogmatic theologian, it having fallen to his
                    lot to take part in the great monophysite-Nestorian controversy and to be the
                    most considerable opponent of the views of Cyril and Dioscurus of Alexandria.
                    For more than twenty years he maintained the struggle against. the Alexandrian
                    dogmatic and its formulae <hi rend="italic">(Θεοτόκος,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >εvωσις</hi><hi rend="italic">καθ' υπόστασιν, μία ύπόστασις, ενωσις φυσική,</hi>
                    and the like), and taught that in the person of Christ we must strictly
                    distinguish two natures <hi rend="italic">(hypostases'),</hi> which are united
                    indeed in one person <hi rend="italic">(prosopon),</hi> but are not amalgamated
                    in essence. For these years his history coincides with that of the Eastern
                    Church from 430 to 451, and for this very reason it is impossible to sketch it
                    even briefly here (see Hefele, <hi rend="italic">Conc.- gesch.,</hi> vol. ii.).
                    The issue was not unfavourable to Theodoret’s cause, but melancholy enough for
                    Theodoret himself: the council of Chalcedon condemned monophysitism indeed, but
                    he unhappily yielded to pressure so far as also to take part in pronouncing
                    “anathema upon Nestorius, and upon all who call not the Holy Virgin Mother of
                    God, and λvho divide the one Son into two.” As Theodoret had previously been a
                    constant defender of Nestorius, it was impossible for him to concur in this
                    sentence upon his unfortunate friend with a clear conscience, and in point of
                    fact he did not change his own dogmatic position. It is distressing, therefore,
                    to find him in his subsequent <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi> classing Nestorius
                    as a heretic, and speaking of him with the utmost hostility. Some of Theodoret’s
                    dogmatic works are no longer extant: of his five books ∏epi <hi rend="italic"
                    >όνανθρωπήσεως,</hi> for example, directed against Cyril after the council of
                    Ephesus, we now possess fragments merely. A good deal of what passes under his
                    name has been wrongly attributed to him. Certainly genuine are the refutation
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ανατροπή)</hi> of Cyril’s twelve <hi rend="italic"
                    >αναθεματισμοί</hi> of Nestorius, and the <hi rend="italic">Έρανίστης,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Πολύμορφος</hi> (written about 446), consisting of three
                    dialogues, entitled respectively Ατp∈ιrτos, <hi rend="italic">'Ασύγχυτος,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">'Απαθής,</hi> in which the monophysitism of Cyril is
                    opposed, and its Apollinarian character insisted on. Among the
                    apologetico-dogmatic works of Theodoret must be reckoned his ten discourses Π«ρΙ

                <p>Theodoret gives a valuable exposition of his own dogmatic in the fifth book of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Αιρετικής κακομυθίας όπιτομή,</hi> already referred

                    writers vary greatly in their estimate of Theodoret’s christology and of his

                    latest of his works in the domain of church history (it was written after 451),
                    is a source of great though not of primary importance for the history of the old
                    heresies. In spite of the investigations of Volkmar and Hilgenfeld, we are still
                    somewhat in the dark as to the authorities he used. The chief uncertainty is as
                    to whether he knew Justin’s <hi rend="italic">Syntagma,</hi> and also as to
                    whether he had access to the <hi rend="italic">Philosophunιena</hi> of
                    Hippolytus in their complete form. Besides this work Theodoret has also left us
                    a church history in five books, from 324 to 429, which was published shortly
                    before the council of Chalcedon. The style is better than that of Socrates and
                    Sozomen, as Photius has remarked, but as a contribution to history the work is
                    inferior in importance. It is probable that its author was acquainted with the
                    labours of Socrates; he appears also to have used those of Philostorgius the
                    Arian, but not those of Sozomen. Something indeed still remains to be cleared up
                    as to the sources he employed; apart, however, from some documents he has
                    preserved, relating to the Arian controversy, he does not contribute much that
                    is not to be met with in Socrates. He made a thorough study of the writings of
                    Athanasius for the work. As regards chronology he is not very trustworthy; on
                    the other hand, his moderation towards opponents, not excepting Cyril, deserves
                    recognition. The <hi rend="italic">'Ελληνικών θεραπευτική παθημάτων</hi><hi

                    written before 438—is of an historical and apologetic character, very largely
                    indebted to Clement of Alexandria and Eusebius; it aims at showing the
                    advantages of Christianity as compared with Hellenism, and deals with the
                    assaults of pagan adversaries. The superiority of the Christian faith both
                    philosophically and ethically is set forth, the chief stress being laid on
                    monachism, with which heathen philosophy has nothing to compare. Much prominence
                    is also given to the cult of saints and martyrs.</p>
                <p>On this side of his character, however, Theodoret can best be studied in the
                    thirty ascetic biographies of his <hi rend="italic">Φιλόθεος ιστορία.</hi> This
                    collection, which has been widely read, is a pendant to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Lausiaca</hi> of Palladius and the monkish tales
                    of Sozomen. For the East it has had the same importance as the similar writings
                    of Jerome, Sulpicius, Severus, and Cassianus for the West. It shows that the
                    “sobriety” of the Antiochene scholars can be predicated only of their exegesis;
                    their style of j&gt;iety was as exaggerated in its devotion to the ideals of
                    monasticism as was that of their monophysite opponents. Indeed, one of the
                    oldest leaders of the school, Diodorus of Tarsus, was himself among the
                    strictest ascetics.</p>
                <p>Nearly 200 letters of Theodoret have come down to us, partly in a separate
                    collection, partly in the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi> of the councils, and
                    partly in the Latin of Marius Mercator; they are of great value not only for the
                    biography of the writer but also for the history of his diocese and of the
                    church in general.</p>
                <p>The edition of Sirmond (Paris, 1642) was afterwards completed by Gamier (1684),
                    who has also written dissertations on the author’s works. Schulze and Nösselt
                    published a new edition (6 vols., Halle, 1769-74) based on that of their
                    predecessors; a glossary was afterwards added by Bauer. The reprint will be
                    found in vols, lxxx.-lxxxiv. of Migne, and considerable portions occur in
                    Mansi.</p>
