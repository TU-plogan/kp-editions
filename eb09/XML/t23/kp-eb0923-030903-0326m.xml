                    and belonged to the class of moderately wealthy farmers. His father died while
                    Thompson was very young, and his mother speedily married a second time. But he
                    seems to have been well cared for, and his education was so far from neglected
                    that, according to his own statement, he was at the age of fourteen sufficiently
                    advanced “in algebra, geometry, astronomy, and even the higher mathematics,” to
                    calculate a solar eclipse within four seconds of accuracy. In 1766 he was
                    apprenticed to a storekeeper at Salem, in New England, and while in that
                    employment occupied himself in chemical and mechanical experiments, as well as
                    in engraving, in which he attained to some proficiency. The outbreak of the
                    American war put a stop to the trade of his master, and he thereupon left Salem
                    and went to Boston, where he engaged himself as assistant in another store. He
                    afterwards applied himself to the study, with a view to the practice, of
                    medicine, and then (although, as he affirms, for only six weeks and three days)
                    he became a school teacher—it is believed at Bradford on the Merrimack. Thompson
                    was at that period between eighteen and nineteen years old, and at nineteen, he
                    says, “I married, or rather I was married.” His wife was the widow of a Colonel
                    Rolfe, and the daughter of a Mr Walker, “a highly respectable minister, and one
                    of the first settlers at Rumford,” now called Concord, in New Hampshire. His
                    wife was possessed of considerable property, and was his senior by fourteen
                    years. This marriage was the foundation of Thompson’s success. Within three
                    years of it, however, he left his wife in America to make hís way to wealth and
                    distinction in Europe, and, although his only child by her, a daughter,
                    subsequently joined him, he never saw and, so far as anything appears to the
                    contrary, never attempted or desired to see her again.</p>
                <p>Soon after his marriage Thompson became acquainted with Governor Wentworth of New
                    Hampshire, who, struck by his appearance and bearing, conferred on him the
                    majority of a local regiment of militia. He speedily became the object of
                    distrust among the friends of the American cause, and it was considered prudent
                    that he should seek an early opportunity of leaving the country. On the
                    evacuation of Boston by the royal troops, therefore, in 1776, he was selected by
                    Governor Wentworth to carry despatches to England. On his arrival in London he
                    almost immediately attracted the attention of Lord George Germaine, secretary of
                    state, who appointed him to a clerkship in his office. Within a few months he
                    was advanced to the post of secretary of the province of Georgia, and in about
                    four years he was made undersecretary of state. His official duties, however,
                    did not materially interfere with the prosecution of scientific pursuits, and in
                    1779 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Among the subjects to which
                    he especially directed his attention were the explosive force of gunpowder, the
                    construction of firearms, and the system of signalling at sea. In connexion with
                    the last, he made a cruise in the Channel fleet, on board the “Victory,” as a
                    volunteer under the command of Admiral Sir Charles Hardy. On the resignation of
                    Lord North’s administration, of which Lord George Germaine was one of the least
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n327/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0327-0310"/> lucky and most unpopular members, Thompson left
                    the civil service, and was nominated to a cavalry command in the revolted
                    provinces of America. But the War of Independence was practically at an end, and
                    in 1783 he finally quitted active service, with the rank and half-pay of a
                    lieutenant-colonel. He now formed the design of joining the Austrian army, for
                    the purpose of campaigning against the Turks, and so crossed over from Dover to
                    Calais with Gibbon, who, writing to his friend Lord Sheffield, calls his
                    fellow-passenger “Mr Secretary-Colonel-Admiral-Philosopher Thompson.” At
                    Strasburg he was introduced to Prince Maximilian, afterwards elector of Bavaria,
                    and was by him invited to enter the civil and military service of that state.
                    Having obtained the leave of the British Government to accept the prince’s
                    offer, he received the honour of knighthood from George HL, and during eleven
                    years he remained at Munich as minister of war, minister of police, and grand
                    chamberlain to the elector. His political and courtly employments, however, did
                    not absorb all his time, and he contributed during his stay in Bavaria a number
                    of papers to the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi> But that he
                    was sufficiently alert as the principal adviser of the elector the results of
                    his labours in that capacity amply prove. He reorganized the Bavarian army; he
                    suppressed mendicity and found employment for the poor; and he immensely
                    improved the condition of the industrial classes throughout the country by
                    providing them with work and instructing them in the practice of domestic
                    economy. Of the prompt and the businesslike manner in which he was wont to carry
                    his plans into execution a single example may serve as an illustration. The
                    multitude of beggars in Bavaria had long been a public nuisance and danger. In
                    one day Thompson caused no fewer than 2600 of these outcasts and depredators in
                    Munich and its suburbs alone to be arrested by military patrols, and transferred
                    by them to an industrial establishment which he had prepared for their
                    reception. In this institution they were both housed and fed, and they not only
                    supported themselves by their labours but earned a surplus for the benefit of
                    the electoral revenues. The principle on which their treatment proceeded is
                    stated by Thompson in the following memorable words :—“To make vicious and
                    abandoned people happy,” he says, “it has generally been supposed necessary
                    first to make them virtuous. But why not reverse this order <hi rend="italic"
                    >1</hi> Why not make them first happy, and then virtuous ?” In 1791 he was
                    created a count of the Holy Roman Empire, and chose his title of Rumford from
                    the name as it then was of the American township to which his wife’s family
                    belonged. In 1795 he visited England, one incident of his journey being the loss
                    of all his private papers, including the materials for an autobiography, which
                    were contained in a box stolen from off his postchaise in St Paul’s Churchyard.
                    During his residence in London he applied himself to the discovery of methods
                    for curing smoky chimneys and the contrivance of improvements in the
                    construction of fireplaces. But he was quickly recalled to Bavaria, Munich being
                    threatened at once by an Austrian and a French army. The elector fled from his
                    capital, and it was entirely owing to Rumford’s energy and tact that a hostile
                    occupation of the city <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> was prevented. It w as now
                    proposed that he should be accredited as Bavarian ambassador in London; but the
                    circumstance that he was a British subject presented an insurmountable obstacle.
                    He, however, again came to England, and remained there in a private station for
                    several years. In 1799 he, in conjunction with Sir Joseph Banks, projected the
                    establishment of the Royal Institution, which received its charter of
                    incorporation from George III. in 1800. Rumford himself selected Sir Humphry
                    Davy as the first scientific lecturer there. Until 1804, when he definitively
                    settled in France, Rumford lived at the Royal Institution in Albemarle Street,
                    or at a house which he rented at Brompton, where he passed his time in the
                    steady pursuit of those researches relating to heat and light and the economy of
                    fuel on which his scientific fame is principally based. He then established
                    himself in Paris, and married (his first w ife having been dead for many years)
                    as his second wife the wealthy widow of Lavoisier, the celebrated chemist. With
                    this lady he led an extremely uncomfortable life, till at last they agreed to
                    separate. Rumford took up his residence at Auteuil, where he died suddenly in
                    1814, in the sixty-second year of his age.</p>
                <p>He was the founder and the first recipient of the Rumford medal of the London
                    Royal Society. He was also the founder of the Rumford medal of the American
                    Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the Rumford professorship in Harvard
                    university. His complete works were published by the American Academy of Arts
                    and Sciences at Boston in 1872; and a full and extremely interesting memoir of
                    the author which was issued with them was republished in London by Messrs
                    Macmillan in 1876. (F. DR.)</p>
