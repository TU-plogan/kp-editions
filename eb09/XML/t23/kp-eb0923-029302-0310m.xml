                    Pittheus, king of Traezen. Thus through his father he was descended from
                    Erechtheus and the autochthones of Attica; through his mother he came of the
                    Asiatic house of Pelops. Aegeus, being childless, went to Delphi to consult the
                    god, who gave him an ambiguous answer. He went to Traezen, and told the oracle
                    to Pittheus, who, seeing its bearing, contrived that Aegeus should have
                    intercourse with his daughter Aethra. Aegeus then departed to Athens, and in due
                    time Aethra, who remained at Traezen, brought forth Theseus. It was given out
                    that the child’s father was Poseidon, the great god of Traezen, and in after
                    ages the Traezenians pointed to the Holy Isle as the place where Poseidon and
                    Aethra met, and where Aethra raised a temple to Athene Apaturia, at which
                    Traezenian maids dedicated their girdles before marriage. For his tutor and
                    guardian young Theseus had one Cannidas, to whom, down to Plutarch’s time, the
                    Athenians were wont to sacrifice a black ram on the eve of the festival of
                    Theseus. On passing out of boyhood, Theseus, in accordance with custom, went to
                    Delphi, and there cut off his front hair. Aegeus had deposited his sword and
                    boots under a heavy rock, telling Aethra that, if she gave birth to a son who,
                    on attaining manhood, should be able to lift the rock and remove the sword and
                    boots, she was to send him with all secrecy to his father at Athens. Theseus now
                    lifted the rock, removed the sword and boots, and set out for Athens. He
                    encountered many adventures on the way. First he met Periphetes, surnamed
                    Corynetes (Clubman). Him Theseus slew, and carried off his club. At the isthmus
                    of Corinth dwelt Sinis, called the Pine-Bender, because he killed his victims by
                    fastening them to the top of a pine tree (or two pine-trees), which he had bent
                    down and then suffered to fly up. Theseus hoisted the Pine-Bender on his own
                    pine-tree. Now, the deceased Pine-Bender had a pretty daughter, who ran and hid
                    herself in a thicket where asparagus grew plentifully; and, when Theseus came to
                    look for her, she prayed to the asparagus, and promised that if it would hide
                    her she would never injure asparagus any more. Theseus wiled her from the
                    thicket, and from their union sprang the family of the Ioxids, who worshipped
                    asparagus. Next Theseus despatched the Crommyonian sow (or boar), a dreadful
                    monster. Then he flung over the cliff the wicked Sciron, who, while his guests
                    were perforce washing his feet, used to kick them over into the sea. In Eleusis
                    Theseus wrestled with and killed Cercyon. A little farther on he slew
                    Procrustes, who had only one bed for all comers: if his guest was too short for
                    the bed, he stretched him out <hi rend="italic">; if</hi> he was too long, he
                    cut him down to the requisite length. At the Cephissus Theseus was met by the
                    Phytalid family, who purified him from the taint of bloodshed. As he passed
                    through the streets of Athens, his curls and long garment reaching to his ankles
                    drew on him the derision of some masons, who were putting on the roof of the new
                    temple of Apollo Delphinius: “Why,” they asked, “was such a pretty girl out
                    alone î,” In reply Theseus took the bullocks out of their cart and flung them
                    higher than the roof of the temple. He found his father married to Medea, who
                    had fled from Corinth. Being a witch, she knew Theseus before his father did,
                    and tried to persuade Aegeus to poison his son; but Aegeus at last recognized
                    him by his sword, and took him to his arms. Theseus was now declared heir to the
                    throne, and the Pallantids, who had hoped to succeed to the childless king,
                    conspired against Theseus, but he crushed the conspiracy. He then attacked the
                    flame-spitting bull of Marathon and brought it alive to Athens, where he
                    sacrificed it to Apollo Delphinius. Now comes the adventure of the Cretan
                    Minotaur (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Minos),</hi> whom Theseus slew by the aid of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Ariadne (j.v.).</hi></p>
                <p>While Theseus was in Crete, Minos, wishing to see whether Theseus was really the
                    son of Poseidon, flung his ring into the sea. Theseus dived and brought it up,
                    together with a golden crown, the gift of Amphitrite. On the return voyage the
                    ship touched at Naxos, and there Theseus abandoned Ariadne. He landed also at
                    Delos, and there he and the youths danced the crane dance, the complicated
                    movements of which were meant to imitate the windings of the Labyrinth.<note

                    an elaborate crane dance, in which the dancers are dressed up with skins and the

                    was still danced by the Delians round the horned altar—an altar entirely
                    composed of left-sided horns. Theseus had promised Aegeus that, if he returned
                    successful, the black sail with which the fatal ship always put to sea<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So, too, the ship that sailed
                    annually from Thessaly to Troy with offerings to the shade of Achilles put to
                    sea with sable sails (Philostratus, <hi rend="italic">Heroica,</hi> xx. 25). The
                    ship that was to bring Iseult to the mortally wounded Tristram was to hoist a
                    white sail if she was on board, a black sail if she was not. The black sails
                    recur in the modern Greek version of the tale of Theseus. Compare <hi

                    for a white one. But he forgot his promise; and, when from the Acropolis at
                    Athens Aegeus descried the black sail out at sea, he flung himself from the
                    rock, and died. Hence at the festival which commemorated the return of Theseus
                    there was always weeping and lamentation. Theseus now carried out a political
                    revolution in Attica by abolishing the semi-independent powers of the separate
                    townships and concentrating those powers at Athens, and he instituted the
                    festival of the Panathenaea,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Besides the Panathenaea, Theseus is said to have instituted
                    the festival of the <hi rend="italic">Synoikia</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metoikia.</hi> Wachsmuth ingeniously supposes that the latter festival
                    commemorated the local union in a single city of the separate settlements on the
                    Acropolis and its immediate neighbourhood, while the Panathenaea commemorated
                    the political union of the whole of Attica (C. Wachsmuth, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Stadt Athen im</hi><hi rend="italic">Altcrthum,</hi>
                    p. 453 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi></p></note> as a symbol of the unity of the
                    Attic race. Further, according to a democratic tradition, he abolished the
                    monarchy, and substituted in its place a popular government; but, to obviate the
                    evils of a pure democracy, he instituted the three classes or castes of the
                    eupatrids (nobles), geomori (husbandmen), and demiurgi (artisans). He also
                    minted coins bearing the figure of an ox. He extended the territory of Attica as
                    far as the isthmus of Corinth.</p>
                <p>He was the first to celebrate in their full pomp the Isthmian games in honour of
                    Poseidon; for the games previously instituted by Hercules in honour of
                    Melicertes had been celebrated by night, and had partaken of the nature of
                    mysteries rather than of a festival. Of Theseus’s adventures with the Amazons
                    there were different accounts. According to some, he sailed with Hercules to the
                    Euxine, and there won the Amazon Antiope as the meed of valour; others said that
                    he sailed on his own account, and captured Antiope by stratagem. Thereafter the
                    Amazons attacked Athens. Antiope fell fighting on the side of Theseus, and her
                    tomb was pointed out on the south side of the acropolis. By Antiope Theseus had
                    a son, Hippolytus. On the death of Antiope, Theseus married Phaedra. She fell in
                    love with her stepson Hippolytus, who, resisting her advances, was accused by
                    her to Theseus of having attempted her virtue. Theseus in a rage imprecated on
                    his son the wrath of Poseidon. His prayer was answered: as Hippolytus was
                    driving beside the sea, a bull issuing from the waves terrified his horses, and
                    he was thrown and killed. This tragic story is the subject of one of the extant
                    plays of Euripides.</p>
                <p>The famous friendship between Theseus and Pirithous, king of the Lapiths,
                    originated thus. Hearing of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n312/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0312-0295"/> strength and courage of Theseus, Pirithous
                    desired to put them to the test. Accordingly he drove away from Marathon some
                    cows which belonged to Theseus. The latter pursued, but, when he came up with
                    the robber, the two heroes were so filled with admiration of each other that
                    they swore brotherhood. At the marriage of Pirithous to Hippodamia (or Deidamia)
                    a fight broke out between the Lapiths and Centaurs, in which the Lapiths,
                    assisted by Theseus, were victorious, and drove the Centaurs out of the country.
                    Theseus and Pirithous now carried off Helen from Sparta, and when they drew lots
                    for her she fell to the lot of Theseus, who took her to Aphidnae, and left her
                    in charge of his mother Aethra and his friend Aphidnus. He now descended to the
                    lower world with Pirithous, to help his friend to carry off Proserpine. But the
                    two were caught, and confined in Hades till Hercules came and released Theseus.
                    Meantime Castor and Pollux had captured Aphidnae, and carried off their sister
                    Helen and Aethra. When Theseus returned to Athens, he found that a sedition had
                    been stirred up by Menestheus, a descendant of Erechtheus, one of the old kings
                    of Athens. Failing to quell the outbreak, Theseus in despair sent his children
                    to Euboea, and, after solemnly cursing the Athenians, sailed away to the island
                    of Scyrus, where he had ancestral estates. But Lycomedes, king of Scyrus, took
                    him up to a high place, and cast him into the sea, that he died. Others said
                    that he fell of himself over the cliff as he was taking his evening walk.
                    Menestheus reigned at Athens, but, when he died before Troy, the sons of Theseus
                    recovered the kingdom. Long afterwards, at the battle of Marathon (490 B.C.),
                    many of the Athenians thought they saw the phantom of Theseus, in full armour,
                    charging at their head against the Persians. When the Persian war was over, the
                    Delphic oracle bade the Athenians fetch the bones of Theseus from Scyrus, and
                    lay them in Attic earth. It fell to Cimon’s lot in 469 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> to discover the hero’s grave at Scyrus, and bring back his bones to
                    Athens. They were deposited in the heart of Athens, and henceforth escaped
                    slaves and all persons in peril sought and found sanctuary at the grave of him
                    who in his life had been a champion of the oppressed. His chief festival was on
                    the 8th of the month Pyanepsion (October 21st), but the 8th day of every month
                    was also sacred to him.</p>
                <p>Whatever we may think of the historical reality of Theseus, his legend seems to
                    contain recollections of historical events, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">συνοικισμόν,</hi> whether by this we understand the political
                    centralization of Attica at Athens or a local union of previously separate
                    settlements on the site of Athens. The birth of Theseus at Traezen points to the
                    immigration of an Ionian family or tribe from the south. With this agrees the
                    legend of the contest between Athene and Poseidon for supremacy on the acropolis
                    of Athens, for Theseus is intimately connected with Poseidon, the great Ionian
                    god. Aegeus, the father of Theseus, has been identified by some modern scholars
                    with Poseidon.</p>
                <p>The Athenian festival in October, popularly supposed to commemorate the return of
                    Theseus from Crete, is interesting, as some of its features are identical with
                    those of harvest-festivals still observed in the north of Europe. Thus the <hi

                <p>The well-preserved Doric temple to the north of the acropolis at Athens, commonly

                    of Theseus reposed. But archaeologists are now much divided on this question. It
                    is agreed, however, that the temple is of the 5th century B.C., and that the
                    date of its construction cannot differ widely from that of the Parthenon.<note
