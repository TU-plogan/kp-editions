                    Quae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Summa Reipublicae,</hi> prefixed to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Codex).</hi> When the commission of sixteen eminent lawyers was
                    created in 530 for the far more laborious and difficult duty of compiling a
                    collection of extracts from the writings of the great jurists of the earlier
                    empire, Tribonian was made president and no doubt general director of this
                    board. He had already been raised to the office of quaestor, which at that time
                    was a sort of ministry of law and justice, its holder being the assessor of the
                    emperor and his organ for judicial purposes, something like the English lord
                    chancellor of the later Middle Ages. The instructions given to these sixteen
                    commissioners may be found in the constitution <hi rend="italic">Deo Auctore
                    (Cod.,</hi> i. 17, 1), and the method in which the work was dealt with in the
                    constitution <hi rend="italic">Tanta (Cod.,</hi> i. 17, 2), great praise being
                    awarded to Tribonian, who is therein called ex-quaestor and ex-consul, and also
                    as magister officiorum. This last constitution was issued in December 533, when
                    the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> was promulgated as a law-book. During the
                    progress of the work, in January 532, there broke out in Constantinople a
                    disturbance in the hippodrome, which speedily turned to a terrible insurrection,
                    that which goes in history by the name of Nika, the watchword of the insurgents.
                    Tribonian was accused of having prostituted his office for the purposes of gain,
                    and the mob searched for him to put him to death (Procop., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pers.,</hi> i. 24-26). Justinian, yielding for the moment, removed him from
                    office, and appointed a certain Basilides in his place. After the suppression of
                    the insurrection the work of codification was resumed. A little earlier than the
                    publication of the <hi rend="italic">Digest,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pandects,</hi> there had been published another but much smaller law-book, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Institutes,</hi> prepared under Justinian’s orders by
                    Tribonian, with Theophilus and Dorotheus, professors of law (see Preface to <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutes).</hi> About the same time the emperor placed Tribonian
                    at the head of a fourth commission, consisting of himself as chief and four
                    others,—Dorotheus, professor at Beyrut, and three practising advocates, who were
                    directed to revise and re-edit the first <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi> of
                    imperial constitutions. The new <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi> was published in
                    November 534 (see constitution <hi rend="italic">Cordi Nobis</hi> prefixed to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Codex).</hi> With it Tribonian’s work of codification was
                    completed. But he remained Justinian’s chief legal minister. He was reinstated
                    as quaestor some time after 534 (Procop., <hi rend="italic">Pers.,</hi> i. 25;
                    <hi rend="italic">Anecd.,</hi> 20), and seems to have held the office as long as
                    he lived. He was evidently the prime mover in the various changes effected in
                    the law by the novels of Justinian <hi rend="italic">(Novellae
                    Constitutiones),</hi> which became much less frequent and less important after
                    death had removed the great jurist. The date of his death has been variously
                    assigned to 545, 546, and 547. Procopius says <hi rend="italic">(Anecd.,</hi>
                    20) that, although he left a son and many grandchildren, Justinian confiscated
                    part of the inheritance.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0575-0556"/>
                <p>The above facts, which are all that we know about Tribonian, rest on the
                    authority of his contemporary Procopius and of the various imperial
                    constitutions already cited. There are, however, two articles in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lexicon</hi> of Suidas under the name “Tribonianos.” They appear
                    to be different articles, purporting to refer to different persons, and have
                    been generally so received by the editors of Suidas and by modern legal
                    historians. Some authorities, however, as for instance Gibbon, have supposed
                    them to refer to the same person. The first article is unquestionably meant for
                    the jurist. It is based on Procopius, whose very words are to some extent
                    copied, and indeed it adds nothing to what the latter tells us, except the
                    statement that Tribonian was the son of Macedonianus, was <hi rend="italic">άπò
                    δικηγόρωv τῶν ύπάρχων,</hi> and was a heathen and atheist, wholly averse to the
                    Christian faith. The second article says that the Tribonian to whom it refers
                    was of Side (in Pamphylia), was also ᾀπò <hi rend="italic">δικηγόρωv τῶν
                    υπάρχων,</hi> was a man of learning, and wrote various books, among which are
                    mentioned certain astronomical treatises, a dialogue <hi rend="italic">On
                    Happiness,</hi> and two addresses to Justinian. None of these books relate to
                    law; and the better opinion seems to be that there were two Tribonians,
                    apparently contemporaries, though possibly some of the attributes of the jurist
                    have been, by a mistake of the compilers or transcribers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lexicon</hi> of Suidas, extended to the man of letters of the same
                    name.</p>
                <p>The character which Procopius gives to the jurist, even if touched by personal
                    spite, is entitled to some credence, because it is contained in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Histories</hi> and not in the scandalous and secret <hi
                    rend="italic">Anecdota.</hi> It is as follows:—“Tribonian was a man of great
                    natural powers, and had attained as high a culture as any one of his time; but
                    he was greedy of money, capable of selling justice for gain, and every day he
                    repealed or enacted some law at the instance of people who purchased this from
                    him according to their several needs. . . . He was pleasant in manner and
                    generally agreeable, and able by the abundance of his accomplishments to cast
                    into the shade his faults of avarice” <hi rend="italic">(Pers.</hi>, i. 24, 25).
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Anecdota</hi> Procopius adds as an illustration of
                    Justinian’s vanity the story that he took in good faith an observation made to
                    him by Tribonian while sitting as assessor, that he (Tribonian) greatly feared
                    that the emperor might some day, on account of his piety, be suddenly carried up
                    into heaven. This agrees with the character for flattery which the minister
                    seems to have enjoyed. The charge of heathenism we find in Suidas is probable
                    enough; that is to say, Tribonian may well have been a crypto-pagan, like many
                    other eminent courtiers and litterateurs of the time (including Procopius
                    himself), a person who, while professing Christianity, was at least indifferent
                    to its dogmas and rites, cherishing a sentimental recollection of the older and
                    more glorious days of the empire.</p>
                <p>In modern times Tribonian has been, as the master workman of Justinian’s
                    codification and legislation, charged with three offences, —bad Latinity, a
                    defective arrangement of the legal matter in the <hi rend="italic">Code</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Digest,</hi> and a too free handling of the extracts from the
                    older jurists included in the latter compilation. The first of these charges
                    cannot be denied; but it is hard to see why a lawyer of the 6th century, himself
                    born in a Greek-speaking part of the empire, should be expected to write Latin
                    as pure as that of the age of Cicero, or even of the age of Gaius and the
                    Antonines. To the second charge also a plea of guilty must be entered. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Code</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> are badly arranged
                    according to our notions of scientific arrangement. These, however, are modern
                    notions. The ancients generally cared but little for what we call a philosophic
                    distribution of topics, and Tribonian seems to have merely followed the order of
                    the Perpetual Edict which custom had already established, and from which custom
                    would perhaps have refused to permit him to depart. He may more fairly be blamed
                    for not having arranged the extracts in each title of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Digest</hi> according to some rational principle; for this would have been
                    easy, and would have spared much trouble to students and practitioners ever
                    since. As to the third complaint, that the compilers of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Digest</hi> altered the extracts they collected, cutting out and inserting
                    words and sentences at their own pleasure, this was a process absolutely
                    necessary according to the instructions given them, which were to prepare a
                    compilation representing the existing law, and to be used for the actual
                    administration of justice in the tribunals. The so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Emblemata</hi> (insertions) of Tribonian were therefore indispensable, though,
                    of course, we cannot say whether they were always made in the best way. Upon the
                    whole subject of the codification and legislation in which Tribonian bore a
                    part, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Justinian.</hi></p>
                <p>Tribonian, from the little we know of him, would seem to have been a remarkable
                    man, and in the front rank of the great ones of his time. There is nothing to
                    show that he was a profound and philosophical jurist, like Papinian or Ulpian.
                    But he was an energetic clear-headed man, of great practical force and skill,
                    cultivated, accomplished, agreeable, flexible, possibly unscrupulous, just the
                    sort of person whom a restless despot like Justinian finds useful. His interest
                    in legal learning is proved by the fact that he had collected a vast legal
                    library, which the compilers of the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> found valuable
                    (see const. <hi rend="italic">Tanta</hi>).</p>
                <p>The usual criticisms on Tribonian may be found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anti-Tribonianus</hi></p>
                <p>(1567) of Francis Hotman, the aim of which is shown by its alternative title, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sive discursus in quo jurisprudentiae Tribonianeae sterilitas et
                    legum patriarum excellentia exhibetur</hi>; and an answer to them in J. P. von
