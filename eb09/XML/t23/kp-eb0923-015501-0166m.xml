                    at and striking the apple which had been placed on the head of his little son by
                    order of Gessler, the tyrannical Austrian bailiff of Uri, is so closely bound up
                    with the legendary history of the origin of the Swiss Confederation that they
                    must be considered together. Both appear first in the 15th century, probably as
                    results of the war for the Toggenburg inheritance (1436-50); for the intense
                    hatred of Austria, greatly increased by her support of the claims of Zurich,
                    favoured the circulation of stories which assumed that Swiss freedom was of
                    immemorial antiquity, while, as the war was largely a struggle between the civic
                    and rural elements in the Confederation, the notion that the (rural) Schwyzers
                    were of Scandinavian descent at once separated them from and raised them above
                    the German inhabitants of the towns.</p>
                <p>The Tell story is first found in a ballad the first nine stanzas of which
                    (containing the story) were certainly written before 1474. There is no mention
                    made of the names of the bailiff or of his master, or of the hat placed on a
                    pole. Tell is called “the first Confederate,” and his feat is treated as the
                    real and only reason why the Confederation was formed and the tyrants driven out
                    of the land. It is probably to this ballad that Melchior Russ of Lucerne (who
                    began his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> in 1482) refers when, in his account
                    (from Justinger) of the evil deeds of the bailiffs in the Forest districts, he
                    excuses himself from giving the story. He goes on to narrate how Tell, irritated
                    by his treatment, stirred up his friends against the governor, who seized and
                    bound him and was conveying him by boat to his castle on the Lake of Lucerne,
                    when a storm arose, and Tell, by reason of his great bodily strength, was, after
                    being unbound, given charge of the rudder on his promise to bring the boat
                    safely to land. He steers it towards a shelf of rock, called in Russ’s time
                    Tell’s Platte, springs on shore, shoots the bailiff dead with his crossbow, and
                    goes back to Uri, where he stirs up the great strife which ended in the battle
                    of Morgarten. In these two accounts, which form the basis of the Uri version of
                    the origin of the Confederation, it is Tell and Tell only who is the actor and
                    the leader. We first hear of the cruelties of Austrian bailiffs in the Forest
                    districts in the <hi rend="italic">Bernese Chronicle</hi> of Conrad Justinger
                    (1420). No names or details are given, and the dates are different in the two
                    recensions of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> as “olden days before Bern
                    was founded” (z.e., before 1191) and 1260. Several details, but only one name,
                    are added in the <hi rend="italic">De Nobilitate et Rusticitate Dialogue</hi>
                    (cap. 33) of Felix Hemmerlin, a canon of Zurich, who wrote it after 1451 and
                    before 1454; in this last year he was imprisoned by the Schwyzers, whom he had
                    repeatedly insulted and attacked in his books. According to him, the men of
                    Schwyz and of Unterwalden were the first to rise, those of L <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi> ri following suit much later. But neither Justinger
                    nor Hemmerlin makes any allusion to Tell or his feat.</p>
                <p>The Tell story and the “atrocities” story are first found combined in a MS. known
                    as the <hi rend="italic">White Book of Sarnen.</hi> They are contained in a
                    short chronicle written between 1467 and 1476, probably about 1470, and based on
                    oral tradition. Many details are given of the oppressions of the bailiffs: we
                    hear of Gessler, of the meeting of Stou-pacher of Schwyz, Fürst of Uri, and a
                    man of Nidwald at the Rütli,—in fact, the usual version of the legend. To give
                    an instance of tyranny in L’ri, the author tells us the story of the refusal of
                    “der Thäll” to do reverence to the hat placed on a pole, of his feat of skill,
                    and of his shooting the bailiff, Gessler, from behind a bush in the “hollow way”
                    near Küssnacht. Tell is represented as being one of those who swore at the Rütli
                    to drive out the oppressors; but the narrative of his doings is merely one
                    incident in the general movement which began quite independently of him. The
                    chronology is very confused, but the events are placed after Rudolph’s election
                    to the empire in 1273. This is the only account in which Tell is called “der
                    Thäll,” which name he himself explains by saying, “If I were sharp <hi
                    rend="italic">(witzig)</hi> I should be called something else and not der Tall,”
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the simpleton or slow-witted man. The only other
                    known instances of the Uri version of the legend relating to the origin of the
                    Confederation are the Latin hexameters of Glareanus (1515), in which Tell is
                    compared to Brutus as “assertor patriae, vindex ultorque tyrannum,” and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Urnerspiel</hi> (composed in 1511-12), a play acted in Uri, in
                    which Russ’s version is followed, though the bailiff, who is unnamed, but
                    announces that he has been sent by Albert of Austria, is slain in the “hollow
                    way.” Tell is the chief of the Rütli leaguers, and it is his deed which is the
                    immediate occasion of the rising against the oppressors, which is dated in 1296.
                    Mutius <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n167/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0167-0156"/> (1540) is the latest writer who, in his
                    description of the origin of the Confederation, does not mention Tell and his
                    act. The two stories are now firmly bound together; the version contained in the
                    <hi rend="italic">White Book</hi> is the accepted one, though small additions in
                    names and dates are often made.</p>
                <p>The task of filling up gaps, smoothing away inconsistencies, rounding off the
                    tale, was accomplished by Giles <hi rend="smallcaps">Tschudi</hi> (&lt;2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>.v.), whose recension was adopted, with a few
                    alterations, by Von Müller in his <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    Confederation</hi> (1780). In the final recension of Tschudi’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle</hi> (1734-36), which, however, differs in many particulars from the
                    original draft still preserved at Zurich, we are told how Albert of Austria,
                    with the view of depriving the Forest lands of their ancient freedom, sent
                    bailiffs (among them Gessler) to Uri and Schwyz, who committed many tyrannical
                    acts, so that finally on 8th November 1307, at the Rütli, Werner von Stauffacher
                    of Schwyz, Walter Fürst of Uri, Arnold von Melchthal in Unterwalden, each with
                    ten companions, among whom was William Tell, resolved on a rising to expel the
                    oppressors, which was fixed for New Year’s day 1308. A few days later (November
                    18) the Tell incident takes place (described according to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >White Book</hi> version), and on the appointed date the general rising. Tschudi
                    thus finally settled the date, which had before varied from 1260 to 1334. He
                    utterly distorts the real historical relations of the Three Lands, though he
                    brings in many real historical names, their owners being made to perform
                    historically impossible acts, and introduces many small additions and
                    corrections into the story as he had received it In particular, while in his
                    first draft he speaks of the bailiff as Gryssler—the usual name up to his time,
                    except in the <hi rend="italic">White Book</hi> and in Stumpff <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> of 1548—in his
                    final recension he calls him Gessler, knowing that this was a real name. Later
                    writers added a few more particulars,—that Tell lived at Bürglen and fought at
                    Morgarten (1598), that he was the son-in-law of Fürst and had two sons (early
                    18th century), àc. Johannes von Müller gave a vivid description of the oath at
                    the Rütli by the three (Tell not being counted in), and threw Tschudi’s version
                    into a literary form, adding one or two names and adopting that of Hermann for
                    Gessler, calling him of “Bruneck.” Schiller’s play gave the tale a world-wide
                    renown.</p>
                <p>The story was, on the ground of want of evidence, regarded as suspicious by
                    Guilliman in a private letter of 1607, and doubts were expressed by the brothers
                    Iselin (1727 and 1754) and by Voltaire (1754); but it was not till 1760 that the
                    legend was definitely attacked, on the ground of its similarity to the story of
                    Tokko (see below), in an anonymous pamphlet by Freudenberger, a Bernese pastor.
                    This caused great stir; it was publicly burnt by order of the Government of Uri,
                    and many more or less forged proofs and documents were produced in favour of
                    Tell. The researches of J. E. Kopp<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Documents for the History of the Federal
                    Alliances,</hi> 1835 and 1851, and his <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> part ii.,
                    1847.</p></note> first cleared up the real early history of the league, and
                    overthrew the legends of the JJ7u7e <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> and Tschudi.
                    Since then many writers have worked in the same direction. Vischer (1867) has
                    carefully traced out the successive steps in the growth of the legend, and
                    Rochholz (1877) has worked out the real history of Gessler as shown in authentic
                    documents. The general result has been to show that a mythological marksman and
                    an impossible bailiff bearing the name of a real family have been joined with
                    confused and distorted reminiscences of the events of 1245-47, in which the
                    names of many real persons have been inserted and many unauthenticated acts
                    attributed to them.</p>
                <p>The story of the skilful marksman who succeeds in striking some small object
                    placed on the head of a man or child is very widely spread: we find it in
                    Denmark (Tokko), Norway (two versions), Iceland, Holstein, on the Rhine, and in
                    England (William of Cloudesley). How it came to be localized in Uri we do not
                    know; possibly, through the story of the Scandinavian colonization of Schwyz,
                    the tale was fitted to some real local hero.</p>
                <p>The alleged proofs of the existence of a real William Tell in Uri in the 14th
                    century break down hopelessly. (1) The entries in the parish registers are
                    forged. (2) As to the Tell chapels—(«) that in the “hollow way” near Kiissnacht
                    was not known to Melchior Russ and is first mentioned by Tschudi (1570). (5)
                    That on Tell’s Platte is also first mentioned in Tschudi. The document which
                    alleges that the chapel was built by order of a “lands-gemeinde” held in 1388,
                    at which 114 men were present who had been personally acquainted with Tell, was
                    never heard of till 1759. The procession in boats to the place where the chapel
                    stands may be very old, but is not connected with Tell till about 1582. (c)</p>
                <p>The chapel at Bürglen is known to have been founded in 1582. Other documents and
                    statements in support of the Tell story have even less claim to credit. It has
                    been pointed out above that with two exceptions the bailiff is always called
                    Gryssler or Grissler, and it was Tschudi who popularized the name of Gessler,
                    though Grissler occurs as late at 1765. Now Gessler is the name of a real
                    family, the history of which from 1250 to 1513 has been worked out by Rochholz,
                    who shows in detail that no member ever played the part attributed to the
                    bailiff in the legend, or could have done so, and that the Gesslers could not
                    have owned or dwelt at the castle of Kiissnacht; nor could they have been called
                    Von Bruneck.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Urηerspiel</hi> the name of the bailiff’s servant who
                    guarded the hat on the pole is given as Heintz Vogely, and we know that
                    Friedrich Vogeli was the name of one of the chief military officers of Peter von
                    Hagenbach, who from 1469 to 1474 administered for Charles the Bold, duke of
                    Burgundy, the lands (Alsace, &amp;c.) pledged to him by Sigismund of Hapsburg.
                    Now Hagenbach is known to have committed many cruelties like those attributed to
                    the bailiffs in the legend, and it has been plausibly conjectured that his case
                    has really given rise to these stories, especially when we find that the
                    Confederates had a hand in his capture and" execution, that in a document of
                    1358 Hagenbachs and Gesslers appear side by side as witnesses, and that the
                    Hagenbachs had frequent transactions with the Hapsburgs and their vassals.</p>
                <p>Among the vast number of books and pamphlets on the Tell story, the two most to
                    be recommended are W. viseher, <hi rend="italic">Die Sage von der Befreiung der

                    summaries of the controversy will be found in any modern book on Swiss history,
                    and more particularly in G. von wyss, <hi rend="italic">Ueber d. Gesch. d. drei
