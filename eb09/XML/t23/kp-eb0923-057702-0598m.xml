                    Rome for decisive victories over foreign enemies; for victories in civil war or
                    over rebels a triumph was not allowed. The power of granting a triumph rested
                    with the senate; and it was a condition of granting it that the victorious
                    general, on his return from the war, should not have entered the city until he
                    entered it in triumph. Lucullus on his return from Asia waited outside of Rome
                    three years for his triumph. The triumph consisted of a solemn procession,
                    which, starting from the Campus Martius outside the city walls, passed through
                    the city to the Capitol. Rome was <hi rend="italic">en fete,</hi> the streets
                    gay with garlands, the temples open. The procession was headed by the
                    magistrates and senate, who were followed by trumpeters and then by the spoils,
                    which included not only arms, standards, statues, Ac., but also representations
                    of battles, and of the towns, rivers, and mountains of the conquered country,
                    models of fortresses, &amp;c. Next came the victims destined for sacrifice,
                    especially white oxen with gilded horns. They were followed by the prisoners who
                    had not been sold as slaves but kept to grace the triumph; they were put to
                    death when the procession reached the Capitol. The chariot which carried the
                    victorious general <hi rend="italic">(triumphator)</hi> was crowned with laurel
                    and drawn by four horses. The general was attired like the Capitoline Jupiter in
                    robes of purple and gold borrowed from the treasury of the god; in his right
                    hand he held a laurel branch, in his left an ivory sceptre with an eagle at the
                    point. Above his head the golden crown of Jupiter was held by a slave who
                    reminded him in the midst of his glory that he was a mortal man. Last came the
                    soldiers shouting <hi rend="italic">Io triumphe</hi> and singing songs both of a
                    laudatory and scurrilous kind. On reaching the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol,
                    the general placed the laurel branch (in later times a palm branch) on the lap
                    of the image of the god, and then offered the thank-offerings. A feast of the
                    magistrates and senate, and sometimes of the soldiers and people, concluded the
                    ceremony, which in earlier times lasted one day but in later times occupied
                    several. A naval or maritime triumph was sometimes celebrated for victories at
                    sea. Generals who were not allowed a regular triumph by the senate had a right
                    to triumph at the temple of Jupiter Latiaris on the Alban Mount.</p>
