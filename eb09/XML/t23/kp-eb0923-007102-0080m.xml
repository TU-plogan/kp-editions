                    (1692-1770), violinist, composer, and musical theorist, was born at Pirano,
                    April 12, 1692, and in early life studied, with equal want of success, for the
                    church, the law courts, and the profession of arms. His life as a young man was
                    wild and irregular, and his temper extremely violent and impulsive. His
                    unfitness for an ecclesiastical career was manifest: and, after failing in
                    jurisprudence, he crowned his improprieties by clandestinely marrying the niece
                    of Cardinal Cornaro, archbishop of Padua. Though the family of Tartini had been
                    legally ennobled, the cardinal resented the marriage as a disgraceful
                    mésalliance, and denounced it so violently that the unhappy bridegroom, thinking
                    his life in danger, fled for safety to a monastery at Assisi, where, calmed by
                    the soothing influence of the religious life, his character underwent a complete
                    change. Docile and obedient, as he had before been passionate and headstrong, he
                    studied the theory of music under Padre Boemo, the organist of the monastery,
                    and, without any assistance whatever, taught himself to play the violin in so
                    masterly a style that his performances in the church became the wonder of the
                    neighbourhood. For more than two years his identity remained undiscovered, but
                    one day the wind blew aside a curtain behind which he was playing, and one of
                    his hearers recognized him and betrayed his retreat to the cardinal, who,
                    hearing of his changed character, readmitted him to favour and restored him to
                    his wife.</p>
                <p>Tartini next removed to Venice, where the fine violinplaying of Veracini excited
                    his admiration and prompted him to repair, by the aid of good instruction, the
                    shortcomings of his own self-taught method. After this he studied for some time
                    at Ancona; and here, about 1714, he made the curious acoustical discovery on
                    which his fame as a theorist chiefly rests. He observed that, when two notes are
                    sounded together on the violin with sufficient intensity, a third sound,
                    distinct from both, is simultaneously produced. For the production of this
                    “third sound,” as he called it, Tartini failed to account on strict mathematical
                    principles. When the two primary notes form an impure consonance, the “third
                    sound” of Tartini (now known as a difference tone of the first order) is
                    accompanied by beats due to the presence of different tones of higher orders,
                    the existence of which, unknown of course to Tartini, has been established by
                    Helmholtz. Tartini made his observations the basis of a theoretical system which
                    he set forth in his <hi rend="italic">Trattato di Musica, secondo la vera
                    scienzia dell</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Armonia</hi> (Padua, 1754) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Dei Principij dell</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Armonia Musicale</hi>
                    (Padua, 1767). In 1721 he returned to Padua, where he was appointed solo
                    violinist at the church of San Antonio. From 1723 to 1726 he acted as conductor
                    of Count Kinsky’s private band, but afterwards returned to his old post at
                    Padua, where he died on February 16, 1770.</p>
                <p>Tartini’s compositions are very numerous, and faithfully illustrate his
                    passionate and masterly style of execution, which surpassed in brilliancy and
                    refined taste that of all his contemporaries. He frequently headed his pieces
                    with an explanatory poetical motto, such as “Ombra cara,” or “Volgete il riso in
                    pianto o mie pupille.” Concerning that known as <hi rend="italic">ll Τrillο del
                    Diαvοlο,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Devil’s Sonata,</hi> he told a curious
                    story to Lalande, in 1766. He dreamed that the devil had become his slave, and
                    that he one day asked him if he could play the violin. The devil replied that he
                    believed he could pick out a tune, and thereupon he played a sonata so exquisite
                    that Tartini thought he had never heard any music to equal it. On awaking, he
                    tried to note down the composition, but succeeded very imperfectly, though the
                    resulting <hi rend="italic">Devil’s Sonata</hi> is one of his best and most
                    celebrated productions.</p>
                <p>Besides the theoretical works we have mentioned, Tartini wrote a <hi
                    rend="italic">Trattato delle Appogiature,</hi> posthumously printed in French,
                    and an unpublished work, <hi rend="italic">Delle Ragioni e delle
                    Broporzioni,</hi> the MS. of which has been lost.</p>
