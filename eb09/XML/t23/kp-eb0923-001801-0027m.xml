                <p><label type="entry">TABRÎZ, <hi rend="smallcaps">Tavris</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tavriz</hi></label>, a town of Persia, capital of the province
                    of Adarbaijân (Azerbijan, ancient Atropatene), is situated in 38° 4' N. lat. and
                    46° 18' E. long., more than 4000 feet above the sea, at the eastern end of a
                    wide valley, through which runs a river whose waters irrigate the gardens that
                    encircle the town. In 1812 the walls had a circumference of 3∣ miles.
                    Overlooking the valley on the north-east and east are bold bare rocks, while to
                    the south rises the more regular peak of Sahand. The town possesses few
                    buildings of note, and of the extensive ruins but few merit attention. Mounsey
                    in 1866 mentioned the blue mosque; the <hi rend="italic">ark</hi> or citadel,
                    containing the palace of the heir-apparent,—a large frowning building near the
                    centre of the town; the Great Maidan, an open square; <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0028-0019"/> and the bazaars. The mosque, which he ascribes to
                    Shdlι Abbas, is that of the Turcoman Jahan Shâh (1410-1468). Abbas Mirza
                    converted the citadel into an arsenal. Among the ruins of old Tauris the
                    sepulchre of the Mogul sultan, Ghazan Khân, is no longer to be distinguished,
                    except as part of a huge tumulus. It is situated about 2 miles south-west from
                    the modern town, but far within the original boundaries. The “spacious arches of
                    stone and other vestiges of departed majesty” with which Porter found it
                    surrounded in 1818 were possibly remains of the college <hi rend="italic"
                    >(madrasa)</hi> and monastery <hi rend="italic">(zdwiya)</hi> where Ibn Batuta
                    found shelter during his visit to the locality. In spite of the cholera
                    visitation of 1822 and other occasional ravages of sickness, and the severe cold
                    of winter, the climate of Tabriz is proverbially healthy. Its orchards and fruit
                    gardens have a high reputation, and its running streams make amends for
                    ill-paved and narrow streets and sorely defective municipal arrangements.
                    General Schindler estimated the population in 1886 at about 170,000,—a number
                    agreeing with the latest local census. The same authority states that the city
                    contains 8 tombs of imâmzâdehs, 318 mosques, 100 public baths, 166
                    caravanserais, 3922 shops, 28 guard-houses, and 5 Christian (Armenian) churches;
                    but this account must comprise in some of its items more buildings than are
                    actually in use. There are said to be nearly 3000 Armenians in the place.</p>
                <p>Tabriz is a city of extensive commerce, a great emporium for the trade of Persia
                    on the west, and the special mart between Turkey, Russia, and Persia. It
                    possesses an international telegraph station, and the line passes hence to
                    Tiflis and Europe on one side and to Teheran on the other. Subsidiary lines have
                    been constructed to near Astara on the Caspian (136 miles long) and to Saujbulak
                    on the Kurdish frontier (125 miles long). Eastwick in 1860 estimated the value
                    of the exports to Turkey at about £600,000 and to Russia at about £400,000,
                    exclusive of smuggling. The chief imports were British, and some Swiss—coloured
                    cotton goods, grey calicoes, and broadcloth,—with miscellaneous goods from
                    Germany. In 1881 there was a marked improvement in the trade of Tabriz, mainly
                    in increased imports from Constantinople. In 1885 the imports amounted to
                    £721,730 and the exports to £306,687. The principal items of the former were
                    cottons (from England), woollen cloth (from Austria and Germany), sugar (from
                    France), and tea (from Holland); of the latter dried fruits (to Russia) and silk
                    (to France, Austria, and Switzerland). There are lead mines near Tabriz, and
                    cobalt and copper are obtainable from the Sahand.</p>
                <p>There is perhaps no city in Persia on which so much has been recorded by native
                    and foreign writers as Tabriz. Among the former Ibn Batuta, the Arab, and Hamd
                    Ullah, the Persian, are notable. Of the latter may be mentioned Chardin, Porter,
                    Ouseley, Tancoigne, Morier, Du Pré, Malcolm, Lady Sheil, Eastwick, Mounsey,
                    Schindler, and Madame Dieulafoy (in <hi rend="italic">Tour du Monde,</hi> 1883).
                    The name <hi rend="italic">Tabriz</hi> has been a subject of much comment and
                    conjecture, but there is no doubt that it is taken from the ancient name of
                    Tauris. The history of Tabriz is a long and painful record of sieges and
                    conflicts, of earthquakes and destruction by natural causes. Of late years it
                    has recovered to some extent its former high position, and is in many respects a
                    worthy rival to the capital.</p>
