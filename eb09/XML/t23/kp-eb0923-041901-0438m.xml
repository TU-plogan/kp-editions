                    the camp, began the Flavian line of emperors, the last three Caesars. Titus was
                    born in 40, the year of the assassination of the fourth Caesar, Caius Caligula,
                    and was brought up in the household of Claudius, with that emperor’s son,
                    Britannicus. There was a story that he was dining at Nero’s table when
                    Britannicus was poisoned, and that he himself tasted the fatal cup, and had in
                    consequence a serious illness. Some time afterwards he erected two statues to
                    the young prince’s memory. Educated in the imperial court, he was thoroughly
                    trained in all elegant accomplishments: he could speak Greek fluently, and could
                    compose verses; he was a proficient in music; he could write shorthand, and
                    could imitate handwriting so skilfully that he used to say that he might have
                    been a most <pb break="no"

                    fine commanding expression, and a vigorous frame, well trained in all the
                    exercises of a soldier. As a young man he served with credit in Germany and in
                    Britain, and he practised at the bar. Soon he had the command of a legion, and
                    joined his father in Syria; he took an active part in the Jewish war, capturing
                    several important fortresses, among them Tarichaeae and Gamala. In 68 he went at
                    his father’s bidding on a visit of congratulation to the newly proclaimed
                    emperor, Galba; but, hearing of Galba’s death and of the general confusion in
                    the Roman world, he returned to his father in Palestine, having in the meantime
                    consulted the oracle of the Paphian Venus as to his prospects and received a
                    favourable answer. In the following year Vespasian, who, through his son’s
                    pleasing manner and adroit management, had made a friend of Mucianus, the
                    governor of Syria, became emperor, and left Titus to finally settle the Jewish
                    war by the capture of Jerusalem. Titus conducted the siege of the city, which
                    for some months was defended amid incredible horrors, with signal ability, and
                    took and destroyed it in September 70. The army saluted their victorious general
                    by the title of “imperator”; in the East Titus was now supreme, and practically
                    emperor. On his return to Italy by way of Alexandria he fell in with that
                    strange professor of mystical philosophy and magic, Apollonius of Tyana, and
                    listened, it is said, to his pedantic talk and advice. As soon as he arrived at
                    Rome there was the usual triumph for a decisive victory, and both father and son
                    shared it. On the arch of Titus, as it is called, erected some few years
                    afterwards (see vol. xx. p. 830), may still be seen sculptured representations
                    of Jewish captives and of the captured trophies. Titus was now formally
                    associated with his father in the government, with the title of Caesar, and
                    during the nine remaining years of Vespasian’s reign he controlled the
                    administration, and was in fact emperor. He was anything but popular; he had the
                    character of being luxurious, self-indulgent, profligate, and cruel. Summary
                    execution of obnoxious persons seems to have been not uncommon. There was a bad
                    scandal too about his connexion with the shameless Jewish beauty Berenice, the
                    sister of the Agrippa of the Acts of the Apostles; both brother and sister
                    followed Titus to Rome, and were allowed to reside in the imperial palace.
                    Public opinion at Rome was outraged, and Titus, though he had promised Berenice
                    marriage, felt obliged to send her back to the East. Vespasian died in 79,
                    leaving his son a safe throne and a well-filled treasury. The forebodings of the
                    people were agreeably disappointed, for Titus, who, it was feared, would be a
                    second Nero, was known as the “love and delight of mankind.” It is possible that
                    his popularity was in some degree due to the fears which the depravity of his
                    brother Domitian, who, it was known, was to succeed him, had begun to excite;
                    but he had the tact to make himself liked by all. He seems to have been
                    thoroughly kindly and goodnatured; he delighted in giving splendid presents, and
                    his memorable saying, “I have lost a day,” is said to have been uttered one
                    evening at the dinner table when he suddenly remembered that he had not bestowed
                    a gift on any one that day.</p>
                <p>Titus, like his father, spent money on great public works and in adding to the
                    magnificence of Rome. The Colosseum was completed and dedicated in his reign,
                    with combats of gladiators, shows of wild beasts, and sham sea-fights and
                    representations of some of the great Greek naval battles. He gave the city what
                    we should now call “a people’s palace” in his splendid baths, which surpassed
                    those of Agrippa and of Nero, and supplied the mob with every luxurious
                    appliance free of cost.</p>
                <p>During his reign, in 79, occurred the memorable eruption of Vesuvius which
                    destroyed Herculaneum and Pompeii. The emperor visited the scenes of desolation
                    and contributed liberally to the relief of the distressed inhabitants. During
                    his absence a fire raged for three days at Rome, in which the Capitol was burnt;
                    then followed a pestilence, and again Titus not only helped freely with his
                    purse, but took pains to acquaint himself with the sufferers and gave them his
                    personal sympathy. Italy and the Roman world generally were quiet and peaceful
                    during this brief reign. The only fighting was in Britain under Agricola, who in
                    the year 80 carried the Roman arms into Scotland as far as the Tay. In the
                    following September Titus died, being in his fortieth year, after a reign of two
                    years and rather more than two months. On his deathbed he said, so the story
                    went, that there was but one thing of which he repented: this was commonly
                    supposed to point to his having spared to punish his brother Domitian, who had
                    more than once plotted against his life, and whose succession to empire he must
                    have felt would be a calamity for Rome. The verdict of history is on the whole
                    favourable to Titus, and perhaps deservedly so; but the general feeling
                    throughout the Roman world after his death was that he had been fortunate in the
                    briefness of his reign.</p>
