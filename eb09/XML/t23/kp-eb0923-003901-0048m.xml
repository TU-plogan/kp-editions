                    By this title are known two eminent Rabbinic scholars, both named <hi

                    grandfather Rashi, six teachers (1) his own father, (2) his brother Ribam, (3)
                    his brother Rashbam, (4) Rabbenu Ya'akob b. Shimshon,<note anchored="true"

                    of the last-named eminent teacher, but also a great mathematician and
                    astronomer, though a terribly bad poet. His commentary on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aboth</hi> is in part printed, and is to be found, more or less perfect, in
                    various libraries in Europe, although not recognized as his. It is ascribed
                    variously to Rashi, to Rashbam, and others. There are copies of it in Cambridge
                    (Add. 1213; Add. 1523), Oxford (Opp. 317), the British Museum (Add. 27201), the

                    his age. For not only was he the greatest Talmudist after his maternal

                    lexicographer, grammarian, and Biblical commentator of no mean order; that he

                    must have been a Levite; and if so, the Shemuel Hallevi mentioned by R. Ya'akob
                    b. Shimshon as his teacher, in the Cambridge MS. Add. 1213, leaf 275, is very

                    ascribed that his life was saved by a knight during the second crusade, in which
                    the whole congregation of Rameru was reduced to beggary, after many of its
                    members had been ruthlessly slain.</p></note> and that he was a man of great
                    wealth, with which he generously supported, not merely his own poorer hearers,

                <p>His works are the following :—</p>
                <p>(1) Commentary on Job, and, no doubt, on other parts of the Bible (see Camb.
                    Univ. Lib. MS. Dd. 8. 53, leaves 15, <hi rend="italic">4a, lla, 12b).</hi> All

                    1885, 8vo). That these “decisions” are really by Rabbenu Tham is proved by the
                    before-named MS., leaves 10α and 16α, where the book is quoted by an author of
                    the 13th century. (3) <hi rend="italic">Sepher Hayyashar</hi> (Vienna, 1810,
                    folio). Although this work, in its present form, is the compilation of one of
                    Rabbenu Tham’s disciples, R. Yishak b. Durbal by name (also called Isaac of
                    Russia; see Schiller-Szinessy, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue,</hi> i. p. 164, and
                    ii. p. 66), not only is the foundation Rabbenu Tham’s (see Preface), but the
                    contents also are virtually his. Compare the Cambridge MS. Add. 667. 1, <hi

                    >Tosaphoth</hi> in the Babylonian Talmud are indirectly also by Rabbenu Tham;
                    and he is virtually the first Tosaphist. It is true that his father, his brother
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Rashbam</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> and his uncle
                    Rabbenu Yehudah b. Nathan had written <hi rend="italic">Tosaphoth</hi> before
                    him, and that this kind of literary activity lasted to within the first quarter
                    of the 14th century. Still, most and the best of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tosaphoth</hi> now in our hands rest on Rabbenu Tham and his school. (5) <hi

                    He was killed at London in the tumult on the coronation day of Richard
