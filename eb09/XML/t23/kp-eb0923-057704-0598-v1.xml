                    promontory of Asia Minor. The name “Troad” is never used by Homer,—who calls the

                    Herodotus. The Troad is bounded on the north by the Hellespont and the
                    westernmost part of the Propontis, on the west by the Aegean Sea, and on the
                    south by the Gulf of Adramyttium. The eastern limit was variously defined by
                    ancient writers. In the widest acceptation, the Troad was identified with the

                    Caicus, which flows into the Aegean south of Atarneus. But the true eastern
                    boundary is undoubtedly the range of Ida, which, starting from near the
                    south-east angle of the Adramyttian Gulf, sends its north-western spurs nearly
                    to the coast of the Propontis, in the region west of the Aesepus and east of the
                    Granicus. Taking Ida for the eastern limit, we have the definition which, as
                    Strabo says, best corresponds with the actual usage of the name Troad. Ida is
                    the key to the physical geography of the whole region; and it is the peculiar
                    character which this mountain-system imparts to the land west of it that
                    constitutes the real distinctness of the Troad from the rest of Mysia. Nature
                    has here provided Asia Minor with an outwork against invaders from the
                    north-west; and as in the dawn of Greek legend the Troad is the scene of the
                    struggle between Agamemnon and Priam, so it was in the Troad that Alexander won
                    the battle which opened a path for his further advance.</p>
                <p>The length of the Troad from north to south—taking a straight line from the
                    north-west point, Cape Sigeum (Yeni Shehr), to the south-west point, Cape Lectum
                    (Babà-Calessi) —may be roughly given as forty miles. The breadth, from the
                    middle point of the west coast to the main range of Ida, is not much greater.
                    The whole central portion of this area is drained by the Mendere (the ancient
                    Scamander), which rises in Ida and is by far the most important river of the
                    Troad. The basin of the Mendere is divided by hills into two distinct parts, a
                    southern and a northern plain. The southern—anciently called the Samonian plain
                    —is the great central plain of the Troad, and takes its modern name from
                    Bairamitch, the chief Turkish town, which is situated in the eastern part of it
                    near Ida. It is of an elongated form, the extent from north to south being large
                    in proportion to the average width, and is enclosed by hills which, especially
                    towards the south, are low and undulating. From the north end of the plain of
                    Bairamitch the Mendere winds in large curves through deep gorges in metamorphic
                    rocks, and issues into the northern plain, stretching to the Hellespont. This is
                    the plain of Troy, which has an average length of seven or eight miles from
                    north to south, with a breadth of some two or three from east to west. The hills
                    which enclose it on the south and east are quite low, and towards the east the
                    acclivities are in places so gentle as to leave the limits of the plain somewhat
                    indefinite. Next to the basin of the Mendere, with its two plains, the best
                    marked feature in the riversystem of the Troad is the valley of the Touzla, the
                    ancient Satniois. The Touzla rises in the western part of Mount Ida, south of
                    the plain of Bairamitch, from which its valley is divided by hills; and, after
                    flowing for many miles almost parallel with the south coast of the Troad, from
                    which, at Assus, it is less than a mile distant, it enters the Aegean about ten
                    miles north of Cape Lectum. Three alluvial plains are comprised in its course.
                    The easternmost of these, into which the river issues from rugged mountains of
                    considerable height, is long and narrow. The next is the broad plain, which is
                    overlooked by the lofty site of Assus, and which was a fertile source of supply
                    to that city. The third is the plain at the embouchure of the river on the west
                    coast. This was anciently called the Halesian (Άλ <hi rend="italic">ήσιον</hi>)
                    plain, partly from the maritime salt-works at Tragasae, near the town of
                    Hamaxitus, partly also from the hot salt-springs which exist at some distance
                    from the sea, on the north side of the river, where large formations of
                    rock-salt are also found. Maritime salt-works are still in operation at the
                    mouth of the river, and its modern name (Touzla = salt) preserves the ancient
                    association. A striking feature of the southern Troad is the high and narrow
                    plateau which runs parallel with the Adramyttian Gulf from east to west, forming
                    a southern barrier to the valley of the Touzla, and walling it off from a thin
                    strip of seaboard. This plateau seems to have been formed by a volcanic upheaval
                    which came late in the Tertiary period, and covered the limestone of the south
                    coast with two successive flows of trachyte. The lofty crag of Assus, washed by
                    the sea, is like a tower standing detached from this line of mountainwall. The
                    western coast is of a different character. North of the Touzla extends an
                    undulating plain, narrow at first, but gradually widening. Much of it is covered
                    with the valonia oak <hi rend="italic">(Quercus Aegilops),</hi> one of the most
                    valuable products of the Troad. Towards the middle of the west coast the
                    adjacent ground becomes higher, with steep acclivities, which sometimes rise
                    into peaks; and north of these, again, the seaboard subsides towards Cape Sigeum
                    into rounded hills, mostly low.</p>
                <p>The timber of the Troad is supplied chiefly by the pineforests on the slopes of
                    Mount Ida. But nearly all the plains and hills are more or less well wooded.
                    Besides the valonia oak, the elm, willow, cypress, and tamarisk shrub abound.
                    Lotus, galingale, and reeds are still plentiful, as in Homeric days, about the
                    streams in the Trojan plain. The vine, too, is cultivated, the Turks making from
                    it a kind of syrup and a preserve. In summer and autumn water-melons are among
                    the abundant fruits. Cotton, wheat, and Indian corn are also grown. The Troad
                    is, indeed, a country highly favoured by nature—with its fertile plains and
                    valleys, abundantly and continually irrigated from Ida, its numerous streams,
                    its fine west seaboard, and the beauty of its scenery. Under a good government,
                    it could not fail to be exceedingly prosperous. Under Turkish rule, the natural
                    advantages of the land suffice to mitigate the poverty of the sparse population,
                    but have scarcely any positive result.</p>
                <p>In the Homeric legend, with which the story of the Troad begins, the people
                    called the Troes are ruled by a king Priam, whose realm includes all that is
                    bounded by “Lesbos, Phrygia, and the Hellespont” <hi rend="italic">(Il.,</hi>
                    xxiv. 544), <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the whole “Troad,” with some extension
                    of it, beyond Ida, on the north-west. According to Homer, the Achaeans under
                    Agamemnon utterly and finally destroyed Troy, the capital of Priam, and
                    overthrew his dynasty. But there is an Homeric prophecy that the rule over the
                    Troes shall be continued by Aeneas and his descendants. From the “Homeric” Hymn
                    to Aphrodite, as well as from a passage in the 20th book of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Iliad</hi> (75-353)—a passage undoubtedly later than the bulk
                    of the book—it is certain that in the seventh or sixth century B.c. a dynasty
                    claiming descent from Aeneas reigned in the Troad, though the extent of their
                    sway is unknown. The Homeric tale of Troy is a poetic creation, for which the
                    poet is the sole witness. The analogy of the French legends of Charlemagne
                    warrants the supposition that an Achaean prince once held a position like that
                    of Agamemnon. We may suppose that some memorable capture of a town in the Troad
                    had been made by Greek warriors. But we cannot regard the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Iliad</hi> in any closer or more exact sense as the historical document of
                    a war. The geographical compactness of the Troad is itself an argument for the
                    truth of the Homeric statement that it was once united under a strong king. How
                    that kingdom was finally broken up is unknown. Thracian hordes, including the
                    Treres, swept into Asia Minor from the north-west about the beginning of the
                    seventh century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and it is probable that, like
                    the Gauls and Goths of later days, these fierce invaders made havoc in the
                    Troad. The Ionian poet Callinus has recorded the terror which they caused
                    further south.</p>
                <p>A new period in the history of the Troad begins with the foundation of the Greek
                    settlements. The earliest <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n600/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0600-0579"/> and most important of these were Aeolic.
                    Lesbos and Cyme in Aeolis seem to have been the chief points from which the
                    first Aeolic colonists worked their way into the Troad. Commanding positions on
                    the coast, such as Assus and Sigeum, would naturally be those first occupied;
                    and some of them may have been in the hands of Aeolians as early as the 10th
                    century B.C. It appears from Herodotus (v. 95) that about 620 B.C. Athenians
                    occupied Sigeum, and were resisted by Aeolic colonists from Mytilene in Lesbos,
                    who had already established themselves in that neighbourhood. Struggles of this
                    kind may help to account for the fact noticed by Strabo, that the earlier
                    colonies had often migrated from one site in the Troad to another. Such changes
                    of seat have been, he observes, frequent causes of confusion in the topography;
                    and the fact has an important bearing on attempted identifications of the more
                    obscure ancient sites.</p>
                <p>Among the Greek towns in the Troad, three stand out with especial
                    prominence—Ilium in the north, Assus in the south, and Alexandria Troas in the
                    west. The site of the Greek Ilium is marked by the low mound of Hissarlik
                    (“place of fortresses”) in the Trojan plain, about three miles from the
                    Hellespont. The early Greek settlers in the Troad naturally loved to take
                    Homeric names for their towns. The fact that Homer places the town of Dardania
                    far inland, on the slopes of Ida, did not hinder the founders of the Aeolic
                    Dardanus from giving that name to their town on the shores of the Hellespont.
                    The site of the historical Thymbra, again, cannot be reconciled with that of the
                    Homeric Thymbra. Similarly, the choice of the name Ilion in no way justifies the
                    assumption that the Greek settlers found that spot identified by tradition with
                    the site of the town which Homer calls Ilios. It does not even warrant the
                    hypothesis that they found a shrine of Athene Ilias existing there. For them, it
                    would be enough that the sounding name could be safely appropriated,—the true
                    site of Homeric Ilias being forgotten or disputed,—and that their town was at
                    least in the neighbourhood of the Homeric battlefields. The Greek Ilium may have
                    been founded about 700 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is noticeable that no
                    ancient writer suggests a later date than the time of Croesus (<hi rend="italic"
                        >c</hi>. 550 B.C.); and Strabo says that the establishment of the colony at
                    Hissarlik—after previous occupation of a different site—took place “in the time
                    of the Lydians” (έπί Λυδῶ <hi rend="italic">v</hi>). It would be reasonable to
                    infer that the Greek Ilium preserved some well-marked traces of Lydian
                    influence, perhaps in architecture or art, perhaps in manners or traditions. The
                    traces of Lydian workmanship found in the excavations at Hissarlik are thus
                    easily explained, without recourse to the shadowy hypothesis of a distinct
                    Lydian settlement on the spot. When Xerxes visited the Trojan plain, he “went up
                    to the Pergamon of Priam,” and afterwards sacrificed to the Ilian Athene
                    (Herod., vii. 42). It is doubtful whether the “Pergamon” meant was at the Greek
                    Ilium, or at another site (to be mentioned presently), Bunárbashi; strong
                    reasons in favour of the latter have lately been adduced by Mr George
                    Nikolaides, in his Ίλιάδος <hi rend="italic">Στρατηγική ∆ιaσκεvή.</hi> In the
                    4th century Ilion is mentioned among the towns of the Troad which yielded to
                    Dercyllidas (399 B.c.), and as captured by Charidemus (359 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.).</hi> It possessed walls, but was a petty place, of little strength.
                    In 344 B.c. Alexander, on landing in the Troad, visited Ilium. In their temple
                    of Athene the Ilians showed him arms which had served in the Trojan war,
                    including the shield of Achilles. Either then, or after the battle of Granicus,
                    Alexander directed that the town should be enlarged, and should have the rank of
                    “city,” with political independence, and exemption from tribute. The battle of
                    Ipsus (301 B.c.) added north-western Asia Minor to the dominions of Lysimachus,
                    who executed the intentions of Alexander. He gave Ilium a wall 5 miles in
                    circumference, incorporating with it some decayed towns of the neighbourhood,
                    and built a handsome temple of Athene. In the 3d century B.C. Ilium was the head
                    of a federal league (<hi rend="italic">κοινόν</hi>) of free Greek towns, which
                    probably included the district from Lampsacus on the Hellespont to Gargara on
                    the Adramyttian Gulf. Twice in that century Ilium was visited by Gauls. On the
                    first occasion (278 B.c.) the Gauls, under Lutarius, sought to establish a
                    stronghold at Ilium, but speedily abandoned it as being too weak for their
                    purpose. Forty years later (218 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> Gauls were
                    brought over by Attalus I. to help him in his war against Achaeus. After
                    deserting his standard they proceeded to pillage the towns on the Hellespont,
                    and finally besieged Ilium, from which, however, they were driven off by the
                    troops of Alexandria Troas. At the beginning of the 2d century <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Ilium was in a state of decay. As Demetrius of
                    Scepsis tells us, the houses “had not even roofs of tiles,” but merely of
                    thatch. Such a loss of prosperity is sufficiently explained by the incursions of
                    the Gauls and the insecure state of the Troad during the latter part of the 3d
                    century. The temple of the Ilian Athene, however, retained its prestige. In 192
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Antiochus the Great visited it before sailing
                    to the aid of the Aetolians. In 190 B.C., shortly before the battle of Magnesia,
                    the Romans came into the Troad. At the moment when a Roman army was entering
                    Asia, it was politic to recall the legend of Roman descent from Aeneas. Lucius
                    Scipio and the Ilians were alike eager to do so. He offered sacrifice to the
                    Ilian Athene; and after the peace with Antiochus (189 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.)</hi> the Romans annexed Rhoeteum and Gergis to Ilium, “not so much in
                    reward of recent services, as in memory of the source from which their nation
                    sprang.” The later history of Ilium is little more than that of Roman benefits.
                    A disaster befell the place in 85 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when Fimbria
                    took it, and left it in ruins; but Sulla presently caused it to be rebuilt.
                    Augustus, while confirming its ancient privileges, gave it new territory.
                    Caracalla (211-217 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> visited Ilium, and like
                    Alexander paid honours to the tomb of Achilles. The latest coins found on the
                    site are those of Constantius II. (337-361). In the 4th century, as some
                    rhetorical “Letters” of that age show, the Ilians still did a profitable trade
                    in attracting tourists by their pseudo-Trojan memorials. After the 4th century
                    the place is lost to view. But we find from Constantine Porphyrogenitus
                    (911-959) that in his day it was one of the places in the Troad which gave names
                    to bishoprics.</p>
                <p>While the Greek Ilium at Hissarlik owed its importance to a sham pretension,
                    which amused sight-seers and occasionally served politicians, Assus, on the
                    south coast, has an interest of a more genuine kind, and is, indeed, a better
                    type of ancient town-life in the Troad. Its situation is one of the most
                    magnificent in all the Greek lands. The seaward faces of the isolated and
                    sea-washed rock on which Assus stood are carved to south and south-west into
                    terraces. The natural cleavage of the trachyte into joint planes had already
                    scarped out shelves which it was comparatively easy for human labour to shape;
                    and so, high up on this cone of trachyte, the Greek town of Assus was built,
                    with its colonnades, baths, theatre, its public walks and its monuments of the
                    dead, mounting tier above tier, till the summit of the crag λvas crowned with a

                    also of great historical interest. In front is Lesbos, one of whose towns,
                    Methymna, is said to have sent forth the founders of Assus, as early, perhaps,
                    as 1000 or 900 B.C. The whole south coast-line of the Troad is seen, and in the
                    south-east the ancient territory <pb break="no"

                    Northward the Touzla is seen winding through its rich valley from a rocky defile
                    in the east to the oak-forests in the western hills. This valley was traversed
                    by the road which St Paul must have followed when he came overland from
                    Alexandria Troas to Assus, leaving his fellow-travellers to proceed by sea. The
                    north-west gateway of Assus, to which this road led, is still flanked by two
                    massive towers, of Hellenic work, and of an age which leaves no doubt that they
                    are the same between which St Paul entered the town. On the shore below, the
                    ancient mole at which he embarked for Mytilene with his companions can still be
                    traced by large blocks under the clear water. Assus affords the only harbour on
                    the 50 miles of coast between Cape Lectum and the east end of the Adramyttian
                    Gulf; hence it must always have been the chief shipping-place for the exports of
                    the southern Troad. Too much off the highways to become a centre of import
                    trade, it was thus destined to be a commercial town, content with a modest
                    provincial prosperity. The great natural strength of the site protected it
                    against petty assailants; but, like other towns in that region, it has known
                    many masters,— Lydians, Persians, the kings of Pergamum, Romans, and Ottoman
                    Turks. From the Persian wars to about 350 B.c. Assus enjoyed at least partial
                    independence. It was about 348-345 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> that Aristotle
                    spent three years at Assus with Hermeas, an ex-slave who had succeeded his
                    former master Eubulus as despot of Assus and Atarneus. Aristotle has left some
                    verses from an invocation to Arete (Virtue), commemorating the worth of Hermeas,
                    who had been seized by Persian treachery and put to death. Under its Turkish
                    name of Beihram, Assus<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>The name Assus probably means “dwelling,” “town,” being connected
                            with the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">vas,</hi> “to dwell,” which appears

                            example in his “steep Pedasus” on the Satniois, and it has been
                            suggested by Mr J. T. Clarke that Pedasus may have been identical in

                    the southern Troad, being the place to which loads of valonia (acorn-cups for
                    tanning) are conveyed by camels from all parts of the country. The recent
                    excavations at Assus, conducted by explorers representing the Archaeological
                    Institute of America, have yielded results far more valuable for the history of
                    Greek art and architecture than any excavations yet undertaken in the Troad. The
                    sculptures form one of the most important links yet discovered between Oriental
                    and early Greek art, especially in respect of the types of animals. The later
                    Hellenic town-walls of Assus also well repay the new study which they have
                    received. With their ramparts, towers, and posterns they form the finest and
                    most instructive extant specimen of Greek military engineering. The director of
                    the exploration, Mr J. T. Clarke, published in 1882 an excellent report on the
                    work so far as it had then been carried.</p>
                <p>Alexandria Troas stood on the west coast at nearly its middle point, a little
                    south of Tenedos. It was built by Antigonus, perhaps about 310 B.C., and was
                    called by him Antigonia Troas. Early in the next century the name was changed by
                    Lysimachus to Alexandria Troas, in honour of Alexander’s memory. As the chief
                    port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, and
                    the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance. The site is now
                    covered with valonia oaks; but the circuit of the old walls can be traced, and
                    in several places they are fairly well preserved. They had a circumference of
                    about 6 English miles, and were fortified with towers at regular intervals.
                    Remains of some ancient buildings, including a bath and gymnasium, can be traced
                    within this area. The harbour had two large basins, now almost choked with sand.
                    A Roman colony was sent to the place, as Strabo mentions, in the reign of
                    Augustus. The abridged name “Troas” (Acts xvi. 8) was probably the current one
                    in later Roman times. The site is now called Eski Stambul.</p>
                <p>Many classical sites of less note in the Troad have been identified with more or
                    less certainty. Neandria seems to be rightly fixed by Mr F. Calvert at Mount
                    Chigri, a hill not far from Alexandria Troas, remarkable for the fine view of
                    the whole Troad which it commands. Cebrene has been conjecturally placed in the
                    eastern part of the plain of Bairamitch, Palaescepsis being further east on the
                    slopes of Ida, while the new Scepsis was near the site of Bairamitch itself. The
                    evidence for this, however, is ambiguous. At the village of Kulaklee, a little
                    south of the mouth of the Touzla, some Corinthian columns and other fragments
                    mark the temple of Apollo Smintheus and (approximately) the site of the Homeric
                    Chryse. Colonae was also on the west coast, opposite Tenedos. Scamandria
                    occupied the site of Eneh, in the middle of the plain of Bairamitch, and
                    Cenchreae was probably some distance north of it. The shrine of Palamedes,
                    mentioned by ancient writers as existing at a town called Polymedium, has been
                    discovered by Mr J. T. Clarke on a site hitherto unvisited by any modern
                    traveller, between Assus and Cape Lectum. It proves to have been a sacred
                    enclosure <hi rend="italic">(temenos)</hi> on the acropolis of the town; the
                    statue of Palamedes stood on a rock at the middle of its southern edge. Another
                    interesting discovery has been made by Mr Clarke,—viz., the existence of very
                    ancient town walls on Gargarus, the highest peak of Ida.</p>
                <p>The modern discussion as to the site of Homeric Troy may be considered as dating
                    from Lechevalier’s visits to the Troad in 1785-86. Homer describes Troy as “a
                    great town,” “with broad streets,” and with a high acropolis, or “Pergamus,”
                    rising above it, from which precipitous rocks descend abruptly to the plain
                    beneath. These are the precipices over which the Trojans proposed to hurl the
                    wooden horse, “when they had dragged it to the summit.” Homer marks the
                    character of the acropolis by the epithets “lofty,” “windy,” and more forcibly
                    still by “beetling.” One site in the Trojan plain, and one only, satisfies this
                    most essential condition. It is the hill at its southern edge called the Bali
                    Dagh, above the village of Bunár-bashi. It has a height of about 400 feet, with
                    sheer precipices descending on the south and south-west to the valley of the
                    Scamander (Mendere). Remains found upon it—though it has never yet been
                    thoroughly explored— show it to have been the site of an ancient city. Homer
                    describes two natural springs as rising a little to the north-west of Homeric
                    Troy. A little to the north-west of Bunárbashi these springs still exist. “This
                    pair of rivulets are the immutable mark of nature by which the height towering
                    above is recognized as the citadel of Ilium” (E. Curtius).</p>
                <p>The low mound of Hissarlik—the site of the Greek Ilium—stands only 112 feet above
                    the level of the open plain in which it is situated. To call it “beetling” (ὸ
                        <hi rend="italic">ϕ</hi> ρυόεσσα) would have been a travesty of poetical
                    licence on which no poet could have ventured, and to describe it as “lofty” or
                    “windy” would have been not less strange. There are no natural springs near it,
                    such as Homer mentions. The Aeolic settlers, having called the place Ilion,
                    naturally persisted in maintaining its identity with Troy. Polemon, a native of
                    the Greek Ilium, who lived about 200 B.C., declared that his fellowtownsmen
                    could show the very stone on which Palamedes <pb break="no"

                    The only other ancient writer who is known to have admitted the Ilian claim is
                    Hellanicus of Lesbos (c. 482-397 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> who, as Strabo
                    remarks, wished “to gratify the Ilians, as is his wont.” Like the Ilians,
                    Hellanicus was of Aeolian origin; and in compiling the local legends of various
                    places he is known to have been wholly uncritical, merely repeating what was
                    told to him as he had heard it. On the other hand, the claim of the Greek Ilium
                    to stand on the site of Troy was decisively rejected by the general consent of
                    those ancient writers who had any claim to critical authority. The orator
                    Lycurgus (c. 332 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> speaks of the site of Troy as
                    desolate, and this at a moment when the recent visit of Alexander the Great to
                    the Greek Ilium (334 B.c.) had drawn attention to the claim made by its
                    inhabitants. Demetrius, a native of Scepsis in the Troad, who flourished about
                    160 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> wrote a book entitled Τρωϊκός Διάκοσμος
                    (“The Marshalling of the Trojans ”), an exhaustive commentary on the catalogue
                    of the Trojan forces in the second book of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi>
                    Demetrius knew the topography of the Troad as thoroughly as he knew the text of
                    Homer. The extant notices of his work, which had a great reputation in
                    antiquity, warrant the belief that he was not only learned but acute. In the <hi
                        rend="italic">Diacosmus,</hi> which was the chief work of his life, he must
                    have bestowed much thought on the question as to the site of Homeric Troy,—the
                    central point of his subject. He pronounced decidedly, as we know from Strabo,
                    against the claim of the Greek Ilium. It has been suggested that Demetrius
                    rejected the Ilian claim because, as a native of Scepsis, he was jealous of
                    Ilium,—a suggestion which is not only absurd in itself, since it assumes that
                    such a motive would have induced Demetrius to mar his life’s work, but also
                    betrays ignorance of Strabo’s text. Scepsis was not a possible claimant of the
                    contested honour, since it was not in the plain of Troy but in the plain of
                    Bairamitch; and further, Demetrius had already provided in another manner for
                    the Homeric dignity of Scepsis by making it the royal seat of Aeneas on the
                    strength of its position relatively to Lyrnessus. The verdict of Demetrius
                    against the Ilian claim was also the general verdict of the other ancient
                    writers consulted by Strabo, as the latter’s language shows. From the passage in
                    which Strabo notices the various definitions of the Troad (xiii. § 4) it appears
                    that among such writers were the following historians and geographers :—Charon
                    of Lampsacus (flor. 500 B.c.), Damastes of Sigeum (400 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.),</hi> Scylax of Caryanda (350 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi>
                    Ephorus of Cyme (340 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> Eudoxus of Cyzicus (130
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> It is to such writers as these that Strabo
                    refers when he indicates the general consent of his authorities. In favour of
                    the claim of the Greek Ilium, on the other hand, there are only two literary
                    witnesses, and these, as we have seen, are alike worthless. Equally valueless
                    from a critical point of view is the fact that the Ilian claim was sometimes
                    allowed by soldiers or statesmen who wished to utilize Trojan memories. They
                    required an official Troy, and they cared not where they found it. Nothing could
                    more curiously illustrate the extreme poverty of the case for the Greek Ilium
                    than the fact that some of its advocates have been reduced to arguing as if
                    Alexander and Lucius Scipio, when they led their armies through the Troad, had
                    been conducting archaeological excursions, and as if their acquiescence in a
                    convenient local myth had the weight of independent critical testimonies.</p>
                <p>In negativing the Ilian claim the conclusion of ancient criticism has been
                    confirmed by a great preponderance of modern opinion. Since Lechevalier visited
                    the Troad in 1785-86 an overwhelming majority of competent judges have favoured
                    his belief that the Bali Dagh above Bunár-bashi was the Pergamus of the Homeric
                    poet’s conception. Before Leake’s visit this opinion had been expressed by
                    Choiseul-Gouffier, Morritt, Hawkins, Gell, and Hamilton. Leake spoke with a
                    decision which derives additional weight from the habitual sobriety of his acute
                    judgment, and from the care with which, in this case, he had examined the
                    alleged objections to the view which he finally adopted. He remarks that no one
                    accustomed to observe the sites of ancient Greek towns could fail to fix on
                    Bunár-bashi “for the site of the chief place of the surrounding country.” So Mr
                    Tozer, in his <hi rend="italic">Highlands of Turkey,</hi> says: “A person
                    accustomed to observe the situation of Hellenic cities would at once fix on this
                    as far more likely to have recommended itself to the old inhabitants of the
                    country than any other in the neighbourhood.” Count von Moltke has expressed the
                    same opinion, that “he knew no other site in the Trojan plain for a chief town
                    of ancient time.” Another supporter of Bunárbashi is Forchhammer. Another is
                    Kiepert. The opinion of Ernst Curtius has been already cited. But space
                    precludes more names; it is enough to say that the correspondence of the Bali
                    Dagh with the Homeric Pergamus—a correspondence absolutely unique in the Trojan
                    plain—has been recognized with virtual unanimity by modem travellers who have
                    patiently inspected the scenery of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> having
                    competent knowledge, and being free from bias in favour of a theory formed
                    before their visit. Partial excavations on the summit of the Bali Dagh have been
                    more than once undertaken, with the result of discovering ancient walls.
                    Pottery, too, has been found there, part of which is allowed on all hands to be
                    probably as old, at least, as 900 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But the Bali
                    Dagh has never yet been explored with any approach to thoroughness.</p>
                <p>The result of the excavations conducted by Dr Schliemann on the mound of
                    Hissarlik has been to lay bare the remains of the Greek Ilium, and also, below
                    these, some prehistoric remains of a rude and poor kind. In <hi rend="italic"
                        >Troy,</hi> his first book on the subject, the explorer held that the
                    remains of the Greek Ilium ceased at a depth of 6 feet below the surface, and
                    that all the other remains, down to 52½ feet, were prehistoric. He distinguished
                    the latter into five groups, representing five prehistoric “cities” which had
                    succeeded each other on the site; and in his second work, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ilios,</hi> he added to these a sixth prehistoric city, on the strength of
                    some scanty vestiges of supposed Lydian workmanship, found at a depth of 6½
                    feet. In both books, Homeric Troy was identified with the third prehistoric city
                    from the bottom, which was supposed to have been destroyed, though not totally,
                    by fire. Professor Jebb was the first to show (1) that the lines of demarcation
                    between the alleged prehistoric strata, as drawn in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ilios,</hi> could not be accurate, and (2) that, if any part of the
                    prehistoric remains could be supposed to represent Homeric Troy, it must be that
                    part which Dr Schliemann had called the second city from the bottom, and the
                    destruction of which by fire appeared to have been total. In 1882 the architects
                    employed by Dr Schliemann proved that the stratification given in <hi
                        rend="italic">Ilios</hi> had in fact been incorrect. The errors, too,
                    affected precisely that region of the deposit which was most important to the
                    Trojan hypothesis, viz., the lower strata. In Dr Schliemann’s third volume, <hi
                        rend="italic">Troja,</hi> these errors were admitted; and Troy was now
                    identified, no longer with the third city, but with the second, of which the
                    supposed area was now enlarged. Another fact to which the English critic had
                    drawn attention was that the remains of the Greek Ilium must extend to a
                    considerably greater depth than 6 feet below the surface. Further examination
                    confirmed this view also. It showed that the remains on the mound at Hissarlik
                    belong to the following periods or groups. (1) At the top, the remains of the
                    Greek Ilium as it existed in the Roman age, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as
                    rebuilt <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n603/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0603-0582"/> after its destruction by Fimbria in 85 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (2) A city which, like the former, extended
                    beyond the mound of Hissarlik (its acropolis) over the adjacent plain. This
                    corresponds with the Greek Ilium of the Macedonian age, as embellished and
                    enlarged by Lysimachus, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 300 B.C. (3) A smaller city,
                    probably confined to the mound. Here we may recognize the Greek Ilium as it
                    existed before the Macedonian age. It was a small and poor place, as appears
                    from the known incidents of its history in the 5th and 4th centuries B.c., owing
                    its chief importance to the shrine of Athene Ilias. (4) A petty town or village,
                    confined to the mound, and poorly built. The evidence of architecture fails to
                    decide whether it was Hellenic or not; if Hellenic, it might represent the
                    primitive settlement of the Aeolic colonists, perhaps <hi rend="italic">c</hi>.
                    700 B.c. It was a small house in this village that Dr Schliemann at first
                    identified with Priam’s palace. The ground-plan shows four rooms, of which the
                    largest measured 24 feet 4 inches by 12 feet. (5) A large town, to which the
                    mound was only acropolis, and which extended to some distance south and
                    south-east over the plain. These remains are unquestionably prehistoric. (6) A
                    few remains of a small settlement which, if indeed distinct from No. 5, preceded
                    it. The reason for distinguishing 6 from 5 is that some of the acropolis
                    buildings of 5 are above those of 6, and seem to have been built on carefully
                    levelled ground. Apart from architectural evidence, objects found in the
                    excavations prove that the remains of the historical age extend much below 6
                    feet. One of these was a terra-cotta disk, stamped with the head of a warrior,
                    in an advanced style of workmanship, found at 26 feet 3 inches below the surface
                        (<hi rend="italic">Troy,</hi> p. 294). Another is a terracotta ball, found
                    at 26 feet, which cannot be older than <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 360 B.c. Then,
                    at 20 feet, was found another terra-cotta, marked with the Greek letter P. A
                    piece of ivory, belonging to a seven-stringed lyre, and therefore not older than
                        <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 660 B.c., was found at 26 feet. Thus we have at
                    Hissarlik the remains of the Greek Ilium in three successive phases,—Roman,
                    Macedonian, and Aeolic, and below these the remains of at least one prehistoric
                    settlement, the age and origin of which are unknown.</p>
                <p>We can no longer either prove or disprove that these prehistoric remains are
                    those of a town which was once taken after a siege, and which originally gave
                    rise to the legend of Troy. But most certainly it is not the “lofty” Troy of
                    which the Homeric poet was thinking when he embodied the legend in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> The conception of Troy which dominates the <hi
                        rend="italic">Iliad</hi> is based on the site at Bunárbashi, and suits no
                    other. The sole phrase in the epic which favours Hissarlik occurs in book xx.
                    (216 <hi rend="italic">sq</hi>.), where Dardania is said to have been built on
                    the spurs of Ida, when Ilios “had not yet been built in the plain and this
                    phrase occurs in a passage which, as the best recent critics agree, is one of
                    the latest interpolations in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> having been
                    composed after the Greek Ilium had actually arisen “in the plain.” Its purpose
                    was the same as that which appears in the Hymn to Aphrodite, viz., to glorify
                    reputed descendants of Aeneas, and it probably belongs to the same age, the 7th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The tactical data of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Iliad—</hi> those derived from the incidents of the war—cannot
                    be treated with such rigour as if the poem were a military history. But
                    Nikolaides has shown that they can at least be brought into general agreement
                    with the site at Bunárbashi, while they are hopelessly incompatible with
                    Hissarlik. The <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> makes it clear that the general
                    description of the Trojan plain was founded on accurate knowledge. At this day
                    all the essential Homeric features can be recognized. And it is probable that
                    the poet who created the Troy of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> knew,
                    personally or by description, a strong town on the Bali Dagh above Bunár-bashi.
                    The legend of the siege may or may not have arisen from an older town at
                    Hissarlik, which had then disappeared. The poet might naturally place his Troy
                    in a position like that of the existing strong city on the Bali Dagh, giving it
                    a “beetling” acropolis and handsome buildings, while he also reproduced the
                    general course of the rivers and that striking feature,—an indelible mark of the
                    locality,—the natural springs at the foot of the hill, just beyond the city
                    gates on the north-west. But, while he thus imagined his Troy in the general
                    likeness of the town on the Bali Dagh, he would retain the privilege of a poet
                    who was adorning an ancient legend, and whose theme was a city that had long ago
                    vanished. Instead of feeling bound to observe a rigorous accuracy of local
                    detail, he would rather feel impelled to avoid it; he would use his liberty to
                    introduce some traits borrowed from other scenes known to him, or even from
                    imagination. To this extent, and in this sense, his topography would be
                    eclectic. Such a consideration might suffice to explain the fact, well known to
                    those who have studied this question on the spot, that neither Bunárbashi nor
                    any other one site can be harmonized with every detail of the poem. The
                    recommendations of Bunárbashi are, first, that it satisfies the capital and
                    essential conditions, while no other site does so, and secondly, that the
                    particular difficulties which it leaves unsolved are relatively slight and few.
                    This character of Homeric topography becomes still easier to understand, if, as
                    most critics would now concede, our <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> contains work
                    of various hands and ages. Few questions, perhaps, of equal literary interest
                    have been so much confused by inattention to the firδt conditions of the
                    problem. The tale of Troy, as the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> gives it, is
                    essentially a poetical creation; and we have no evidence other than the <hi
                        rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> That is, our sole data are (1) of the mythical
                    class, (2) of inadequate precision, and (3) of uncertain origin. But they show a
                    general knowledge of the ground; and the question is how far particular features
                    of the ground can be recognized in the poem. It may be doubted whether the case
                    admits of any solution more definite than that which has been indicated
                    above.</p>

                <p>According to Greek legend, the oldest town in the Troad was that founded by
                    Teucer, who was a son of the river Scamander and the nymph Idaea. Tzetzes says
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n604/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0604-0583"/> that the Scamander in question was the
                    Scamander in Crete, and that Teucer was told by an oracle to settle wherever the
                    “earth-born ones” attacked him. So when he and his company were attacked in the
                    Troad by mice, which gnawed their bow-strings and the handles of their shields,
                    he settled on the spot, thinking that the oracle was fulfilled. He called the
                    town Sminthium and built a temple to Apollo Sminthius, the Cretan word for a
                    mouse being <hi rend="italic">sminthius.</hi> In his reign Dardanus, son of Zeus
                    and the nymph Electra, daughter of Atlas, in consequence of a deluge, drifted
                    from the island of Samothrace on a raft or a skin bag to the coast of the Troad,
                    where, having received a portion of land from Teucer and married his daughter
                    Batea, he founded the city of Dardania or Dardanus on high ground at the foot of
                    Mount Ida. On the death of Teucer, Dardanus succeeded to the kingdom and called
                    the whole land Dardania after himself. He begat Erichthonius, who begat a son
                    Tros by Astyoche, daughter of Simois. On succeeding to the throne, Tros called
                    the country Troy and the people Trojans. By Callirrhoe, daughter of Scamander,
                    he had three sons,—Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede. From Ilus and Assaracus sprang
                    two separate lines of the royal house,—the one being Ilus, Laomedon, Priam,
                    Hector; the other Assaracus, Capys, Anchises, Aeneas. Ilus went to Phrygia,
                    where, being victorious in wrestling, he received as a prize from the king of
                    Phrygia a spotted cow, with an injunction to follow her and found a city
                    wherever she lay down. The cow lay down on the hill of the Phrygian Até; and
                    here accordingly Ilus founded the city of Ilios. It is stated that Dardania,
                    Troy, and Ilios became one city. Desiring a sign at the foundation of Ilios, Hus
                    prayed to Zeus and as an answer he found lying before his tent the Palladium, a
                    wooden statue of Pallas, three cubits high, with her feet joined, a spear in her
                    right hand, and a distaff and spindle in her left. Ilus built a temple for the
                    image and worshipped it. By Eurydice, daughter of Adrastus, he had a son
                    Laomedon. Laomedon married Strymo, daughter of Scamander, or Placia, daughter of
                    Atreus or of Leucippus. It was in his reign that Poseidon and Apollo, or
                    Poseidon alone, built the walls of Troy. In his reign also Hercules besieged and
                    took the city, slaying Laomedon and his children, except one daughter Hesione
                    and one son Pod-arces. The life of Podarces was granted at the request of
                    Hesione; but Hercules stipulated that Podarces must first be a slave and then be
                    redeemed by Hesione; she gave her veil for him; hence his name of Priam (from
                        <hi rend="italic">pτiasthai</hi> to buy). Priam married first Arisbe and
                    afterwards Hecuba and had fifty sons and twelve daughters. Among the sons were
                    Hector and Paris, and among the daughters Polyxena and Cassandra. To recover
                    Helen, whom Paris carried off from Sparta, the Greeks under Agamemnon besieged
                    Troy for ten years. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Achilles, Agamemnon, Ajax, Hector,
                        Helen, Paris.)</hi> At last they contrived a wooden horse, in whose hollow
                    belly many of the Greek heroes hid themselves. Their army and fleet then
                    withdrew to Tenedos, feigning to have raised the siege. The Trojans conveyed the
                    wooden horse into Troy; in the night the Greeks stole out, opened the gates to
                    their returning friends, and Troy was taken.</p>
