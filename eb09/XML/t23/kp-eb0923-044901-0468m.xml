                    American Civil War of 1861-64. The word “submarine mine” is generally
                    substituted for “torpedo” when speaking of defensive or stationary mines, the
                    latter term being reserved for locomotive torpedoes, or others used in offensive
                    operations.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Submarine Mines.—</hi> Submarine mines are divided into
                    three classes:—(1) observation mines, fired by an electric current when the
                    enemy is observed to be within the destructive area of the mine; (2)
                    electro-contact mines, which, when struck, fire by automatically completing the
                    electric circuit from the battery ashore; (3) mechanical mines, which, when
                    struck, fire through the action of some contrivance within themselves, and are
                    not connected with the shore. Mines of the first class are used in places where
                    a channel has to be kept clear for screw steamers to pass, the second class in
                    those parts of the channel where there is little traffic, and the third class in
                    channels which it is intended to bar equally against friend or foe.</p>
                <p>Electrical mines have the advantage over mechanical that by the removal of the
                    firing battery the passage of a ship is rendered perfectly safe, and that the
                    condition of the mine can be ascertained by electrical tests, but the electric
                    cables are liable to damage, and add greatly to the expense of the defence.</p>
                <p>Gun-cotton and dynamite are the explosives generally used in mines, the charges
                    varying from 30 lb to 500 ft, according to the description of mine. In all mines
                    the charge is exploded by means of a detonator containing fulminate of mercury.
                    In mines loaded with gun-cotton the detonator is inserted in a priming charge of
                    dry gun-cotton, this priming charge being in a metal case, closely surrounded by
                    the wet gun-cotton comprising the remainder of the charge. Where dynamite is
                    employed the priming charge is not necessary. Experiments made to determine the
                    horizontal distance at which an ironclad will be vitally injured by different
                    charges have yielded the following general results :—</p>

                <p>The explosion of 500 ft of gun-cotton at a horizontal distance of 30 feet would
                    seriously injure a vessel, and 30 ft in contact with the bottom below the armour
                    would probably blow a hole through the outer and inner skin. The depths given
                    above are approximately the best depths to get the fullest effect out of the
                    charges mentioned. When the water is so deep that if the mine were placed on the
                    bottom it could not exert its full destructive effect on the bottom of a ship,
                    it is given enough buoyancy to allow it to float above its moorings,—a mine on
                    the bottom being termed a “ground mine,” and a mine floating above its moorings
                    a “buoyant mine.”</p>
                <p>If mines are placed too close together the explosion of one will damage those
                    near it, the interval which must be left between them being—for a 100 ft mine,
                    100 feet; for a 250 ft mine, 250 feet; and for a 500 ft mine, 300 feet. There is
                    therefore always a possibility of a ship passing through a single line of mines
                    without coming within the destructive area of any. Mines are therefore generally
                    arranged in two or more lines, the mines of one line covering the spaces left
                    between the mines of the next, or several mines may be laid close together, and
                    the whole exploded simultaneously.</p>
                <p>The electric circuit of all electrical mines is very similar. A voltaic battery
                    ashore has one pole put permanently to earth and the other pole joined to the
                    electric cable leading to the mine. This cable passes into the mine case through
                    a water-tight joint, and is connected up to one pole of the electric detonator,
                    the other pole of the detonator being connected to the mouth-piece of the mine
                    and consequently to earth. To prevent the mine being fired until the proper
                    moment has arrived, this circuit must be broken somewhere, and means provided
                    for completing it when the mine is to be fired. In the case of observation mines
                    this is done by inserting a firing key in the electric cable near the battery,
                    and in electro-contact mines by a circuit closer in the mine.</p>
                <p>The right moment to fire an observation mine is determined by two observers
                    ashore, who have each adjusted two sights in 1ine with the mine, as it was
                    lowered into position,—the stations for these observers being chosen so that
                    their lines of sight may be as nearly as possible at right angles to each other.
                    The electric cable from the mine is led past both observers and connected to a
                    firing battery, one pole of which is put permanently to earth. A firing key
                    inserted in the circuit at the station of each observer renders the simultaneous
                    pressure of both keys necessary to explode the mine. If each observer depresses
                    his firing key as the centre of the enemy crosses his own line of sight, both
                    keys can only be pressed simultaneously if the enemy arrives at the intersection
                    of the two lines of sight, and consequently over the mine. When many mines are
                    placed in one channel, it is usual to moor them in three lines, the prolongation
                    of each line converging to an observing station, where the direction of each
                    line is marked by sights. The electric cables from all the mines come to another
                    observing station, and are there connected to separate firing keys, each of
                    which has one pole joined up to a firing battery. The observer at this station
                    is also provided with a separate sight marking the direction of each mine in all
                    the lines. The former station is termed the “converging” and the latter the
                    “firing” station. The observer at the converging station telegraphs to the
                    firing station the instant at which the centre of the enemy is on one of the
                    lines of mines, the observer at the firing station determining by means of his
                    sights which individual mine the enemy is over, and he can fire it by pressing
                    the corresponding key.</p>
                <p>Instead of separate sights for each mine, observing arcs may be used. These
                    instruments are furnished with a telescope, which can be constantly directed on
                    the enemy, a bar attachment automatically closing the circuit when the direction
                    of the enemy corresponds to a mine. The camera obscura has also been used for
                    determining the position of an enemy in the mine field.</p>
                <p>Electro-contact mines are buoyant mines moored about 10 feet below the surface,
                    and' are in connexion with an electric battery ashore. They are arranged to
                    explode on being struck by a passing ship, by means of an apparatus contained in
                    the mine itself, called a circuit closer. Many different kinds of circuit
                    closers are in use, but they all depend upon there being a break in the electric
                    circuit while the circuit closer is at rest, the circuit closer completing the
                    circuit when the mine receives a blow. That most commonly used <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n469/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0469-0450"/> (fig. 1) consists of a steel spindle <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> carrying a weight <hi rend="italic">b</hi> on its upper
                    end. This steel spindle carries an insulated brass ring c, to which the wire
                    from the detônator <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is attached, the other pole of the
                    detonator being connected to the cable <hi rend="italic">e</hi> leading to the
                    electric battery. On the mine being struck the inertia of the weight causes the
                    steel rod to vibrate sufficiently to bring the insulated ring in contact with
                    brass springs in connexion with the earth, thus completing tlιe circuit of the
                    electric battery through the detonators. Another form of circuit closer is a
                    tube of mercury, which by splashing up when the mine is struck completes the
                    electric circuit between two previously insulated points.</p>
                <p>A single main cable from the battery may have several electro-contact mines
                    attached to it; the expense of leading a separate wire from each mine to the
                    battery is therefore avoided. If one mine was fired the broken end of its branch
                    wire from the main cable would be left in the water, and on another mine being
                    struck it would only receive a portion of the current, as the battery would be
                    connected to earth through the broken branch. Each branch wire must therefore
                    have a disconnector in circuit, clear of the explosion. The disconnector
                    consists of a platinum wire fuse contained in a strong iron case, and the same
                    current which fires the detonator in the mine fuses the platinum wire bridge of
                    the disconnector, and the circuit to the broken branch remains insulated.</p>
                <p>Mechanical mines, of which there are many different patterns, contain the means
                    of ignition within themselves, and are unconnected with any apparatus ashore.
                    They may be ignited by percussion, friction, chemical action, and
                    electricity.</p>
                <p>A simple form of mechanical mine has a heavy top, which, on being pushed off by a
                    passing ship, either pulls out a pin and releases a plunger, which is then
                    forced by a powerful spring into a detonator, or a friction tube is fired when
                    the weight falls on a line attached to it. Another form, known as Abel’s
                    mechanical exploder, consists of a glass tube containing sulphuric acid, and
                    surrounded by chlorate of potash and sugar. The whole is contained in an
                    india-rubber tube, which projects from the top of the mine, the lower end being
                    in communication with the charge. When struck, the india-rubber tube bends, and,
                    the glass tube breaking, the sulphuric acid mixes with the chlorate of potash
                    and sugar and inflames the charge.</p>
                <p>Electro-mechanical mines can be made by placing a voltaic battery inside the mine
                    itself and joining it up to a fuse and circuit closer, the circuit closer
                    completing the circuit when the mine is struck. Another form of
                    electro-mechanical mine (fig. 2) has several projecting horns (a, <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> a) of lead tubing. Inside each horn is a glass tube
                    containing bichromate of potash, and immediately under it a row of small zinc
                    and carbon plates, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> in a containing cell. On any one of
                    the lead horns being bent, the glass tube is broken, and the bichromate of
                    potash drops into the cell, converting the arrangement into a voltaic battery,
                    which, being already connected to the electric fuse <hi rend="italic">c,</hi>
                    fires the mine.</p>
                <p>All mechanical and electro-mechanical mines are provided with some contrivance to
                    guard against accidental explosion during the process of laying. In mechanical
                    mines a safety pin can be withdrawn after the mine is in position, or, in the
                    case of ABeΓs exploder, the projecting tube is surrounded by iron segments which
                    fall off when the mine is in position. In electro-mechanical mines two of the
                    wires forming part of the circuit inside the mine may be brought through to the
                    outside and kept apart till the mine is in position, these wires being long
                    enough to allow of the operator retiring clear of the explosion before joining
                    them up and rendering the mine dangerous.</p>
                <p>Mechanical mines have the advantage over electrical that they require fewer
                    trained men for their manipulation, are cheaper, andean be placed in position
                    very rapidly. But no really efficient method has yet been devised that will
                    ensure a mechanical mine, after it has been placed in position, being safely
                    taken up again for examination or removal, nor can any tests be applied to
                    ascertain if it remains in an efficient condition.</p>
                <p>All mines, especially those with electric cables attached, must be protected by
                    gun fire or guard boats, as, if the mine field is unprotected, they can be
                    easily destroyed by countermining or creeping. Countermining is carried out by
                    exploding a succession of charges in an enemy’s mine field. Mines containing
                    heavy charges would be used for the purpose, several of these mines being
                    dropped in succession from a boat towed by a fast steamer, the whole line being
                    exploded together as soon as the last mine had been dropped. Numerous
                    experiments have proved that the explosion of a 500 ïb mine will effectually
                    destroy any mine within a radius of 100 feet; the countermines would therefore
                    be dropped at double this distance apart, and the channel so cleared marked by
                    buoys. Electric cables can also be caught and raised to the surface’ by
                    grapnels; or the grapnel may have a case of explosive between its arms, so that,
                    instead of raising the wire, it may be cut by firing the charge.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Locomotive Torpedoes.—</hi> Locomotive torpedoes are a
                    numerous class, the principal being the Whitehead, Lay, Sims, Brennan, and
                    Ericsson. The Whitehead is the only one which can be considered a well-developed
                    naval weapon.</p>
                <p>This torpedo (fig. 3) is made in different sizes, varying from 12 feet to 19 feet
                    in length and from 12 to 15 inches in diameter; the cross section is circular,
                    tapering to a point at each end. It is capable of being so adjusted that on
                    being discharged it will travel at any depth between 5 and 15 feet below the
                    surface, and it will maintain this depth for its entire run. The torpedo travels
                    at a uniform speed for the whole of its range, the speed and range varying for
                    different patterns; the latest type has a speed of 24 knots for 600 yards. The
                    torpedo can be set so that, in the event of its not striking the ship aimed at,
                    it will stop at the end of its range and sink. For exercise it can be set to
                    stop at any distance within the limits of its range, rise to the surface, and
                    float. The torpedo is divided into several compartments. The foremost A contains
                    a charge of from 30 to 100 lb of gun-cotton, according to the size of the
                    torpedo. This charge is fired on the torpedo striking a ship by a pistol which
                    screws into the nose of the torpedo. On impact the point of the pistol is driven
                    inwards and forces the point of a steel striker into a detonator. By means of
                    powerful air-pumps air is compressed into the air-chamber B to a pressure of
                    1000 lb on the square inch, and actuates a three-cylinder engine, which drives
                    two propellors revolving in opposite directions in the tail. The mechanism in
                    the balance-chamber C works two exterior rudders on each side of the tail, which
                    keep the torpedo at a uniform depth during its run. This device has never been
                    patented, but is a secret; the details of it, however, have been purchased by
                    all prominent maritime nations.</p>
                <p>The tail F is fitted with four broad fins, which tend to keep the torpedo on a
                    straight course and prevent it rolling. The horizontal tail fins carry four
                    rudders, two horizontal and two vertical. The horizontal rudders worked from the
                    balance-chamber keep the torpedo at its set depth; the vertical rudders are
                    permanently adjusted so as to cause the torpedo to travel in a straight
                    line.</p>
                <p>The air-chamber of a torpedo is usually made of fluid compressed steel, the
                    remaining compartments of thin steel plate, and the interior mechanism of
                    phosphor-bronze. In Germany torpedoes are now made entirely of
                    phosphor-bronze.</p>
                <p>The torpedo can be discharged from above or below water. From above water it is
                    shot out of an air-gun (fig. 3) mounted on the deck of a ship and pointing
                    through the side. The air-gun consists of a metal tube <hi rend="italic">a, a,
                    a,</hi> of the same length as the torpedo, the rear end being closed by an
                    air-tight door. The gun carries a reservoir <hi rend="italic">c</hi> of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n470/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0470-0451"/> compressed air, the contents of which, by means
                    of a suitable firing valve <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> can be instantaneously
                    admitted into the gun. When the torpedo is to be discharged this firing valve is
                    opened, and the compressed air in the reservoir forces the torpedo out at a high
                    velocity, a tripper δ projecting through the top of the gun throwing back the
                    starting lever of the torpedo on its way out. From below water the torpedo is
                    discharged through a tube, the muzzle of which forms part of the stem of the
                    ship, the tube being fitted with an outside valve which prevents the water from
                    entering while the torpedo is placed in the tube. Latterly powder has been used
                    instead of compressed air for the ejecting force.</p>
                <p>The Lay torpedo is a boat of cylindrica1 form, the fore part being charged with
                    an explosive. The motive power is carbonic acid gas generated in the usual way.
                    As only a very small portion of the boat is visible on the surface, two guide
                    rods, one on each end of the vessel, mark its position at any part of its run.
                    The boat can be started, stopped, and steered by means of an electric cable,
                    containing several insulated wires, which is paid out from the boat as it
                    travels.</p>
                <p>The Sims torpedo is cigar-shaped, and is suspended to a boatshaped float. The
                    torpedo is propelled by screws driven by an electric motor situated in the body,
                    the current for which is supplied from a dynamo ashore. The electric cable is
                    coiled on a drum in the torpedo, and pays out as the torpedo advances. The
                    torpedo is also steered from the shore by an electric current. Its speed is
                    about 12 knots.</p>
                <p>The principle of the Brennan torpedo is as follows. The torpedo contains two
                    drums upon which a large amount of pianoforte wire is wound. One end of the wire
                    from each drum is taken to large drums ashore, which are revolved by a
                    steam-engine. By winding up on the large drums ashore a rotatory motion is
                    imparted to the drums in the torpedo, which by means of gearing revolve two
                    screw propellers, and these drive the torpedo through the water. The torpedo can
                    be steered from the shore in any direction, by winding on one drum faster than
                    the other, which alteration in motion moves a vertical rudder on the
                    torpedo.</p>
                <p>The Ericsson torpedo is a long fish-shaped weapon, made of wood, and weighted so
                    as to have little or no buoyancy. The charge is contained in a metal case at the
                    fore end. It is propelled by a charge of gunpowder, out of a submarine gun fixed
                    in the bows of a ship. Its range is about 300 feet, and it fires on impact.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Outrigger, Drifting, and Towing Torpedoes.—</hi> Before the
                    introduction of the Whitehead, vessels armed with torpedoes were principally
                    supplied with the outrigger torpedo. The explosive is contained in a metal case
                    secured to the end of a steel or wooden pole, which lies fore and aft in the
                    vessel carrying it. The pole can be rigged out until the torpedo is submerged a
                    short distance ahead of the vessel, and is fired on contact with the enemy’s
                    side, either by an operator in the boat completing the electric circuit, or by
                    the circuit being completed by a circuit closer in the torpedo. In rivers, or
                    places with a current, drifting torpedoes can be used. They should be suspended
                    from floats, and arranged in groups or pairs connected together by a rope, so
                    that they may catch across the bows of a vessel at anchor. They can be fired
                    after a given lapse of time by clockwork and other devices, or can be so
                    arranged that the firing arrangement is released on a catch being withdrawn by
                    the action of a propeller wheel, which remains stationary as long as the torpedo
                    drifts with the current, but is revolved by the force of the current when the
                    torpedo is stopped. Towing torpedoes are constructed to diverge from either side
                    of a ship when towed, which is effected by shaping the torpedo like an otter.
                    The torpedo tows on the surface, and, on striking a ship’s side, the head
                    containing the charge drops off, and fires as its weight tautens a line
                    connecting it to the body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Torpedo Boats.</hi> —The great improvements made of late years
                    in machine guns have rendered the outrigger and towing torpedo of little value
                    for torpedo boats, as it would be almost impossible to approach a vessel near
                    enough to use them before the boat would be destroyed by the storm of missiles
                    which would be fired at her. All torpedo boats under construction, and most of
                    those already completed, are therefore armed with the Whitehead torpedo. A modem
                    torpedo boat is built entirely of steel, the plates often not exceeding <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ inch in thickness, as, in order to get the necessary
                    high speed, the minimum of weight consistent with the necessary strength is of
                    the first importance. There are three classes of boats, known as first, second,
                    and third. The first are capable of keeping the sea on their own account; the
                    second are for harbour defence; and the third can be carried on board a
                    ship.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Torpedo Nets.—</hi> The introduction of the modern torpedo boat
                    has caused great attention to be paid to any means which will protect a ship
                    from the torpedo. Most nations are adopting steel-wire netting, suspended from
                    booms attached to the ship’s side, the booms keeping the nets sufficiently far
                    off to prevent any damage being done to the bottom by the explosion of the
                    largest charge carried by a Whitehead. This netting, besides being cumbersome
                    and heavy, cannot be used unless the ship is stationary or nearly so, so that in
                    many cases it would be useless, but for ships at anchor it is of great value.
                    Increased cellular subdivisionis also being given to ships under construction,
                    and special vessels, called “torpedo catchers,” are being built by most nations.
                    A torpedo catcher is a vessel of superior size and strength, but with the same
                    high speed as a torpedo boat, the principal arm of the torpedo catcher being
                    machine guns. (E. P. G.)</p>
