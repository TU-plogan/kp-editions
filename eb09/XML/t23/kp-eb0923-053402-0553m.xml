                <p><label type="entry">TREE-CREEPER</label>, one of the smallest of British birds,
                    and, regard being had to its requirements, one very generally distributed. It is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Certhia familiaris</hi> of ornithology, and remarkable for
                    the stiffened shafts of its long and pointed tail-feathers, aided by which, and
                    by its comparatively large feet, it climbs nimbly, in a succession of jerks, the
                    trunks or branches of trees, invariably proceeding upwards or outwards and
                    generally in a spiral direction, as it seeks the small insects that are hidden
                    in the bark and form its chief food. When in the course of its search it nears
                    the end of a branch or the top of a trunk, it flits to another, always alighting
                    lower down than the place it has left, and so continues its work.</p>
                <p>Inconspicuous in colour, for its upper plumage is mostly of various shades of
                    brown mottled with white, buff, and tawny, and beneath it is of a silvery white,
                    the Tree-Creeper is far more common than the incurious suppose; but, attention
                    once drawn to it, it can be frequently seen and at times heard, for though a shy
                    singer its song is loud and sweet. The nest is neat, generally placed in a chink
                    formed by a half-detached piece of bark, which secures it from observation, and
                    a considerable mass of material is commonly used to partly stuff up the opening
                    and give a sure foundation for the tiny cup, in which are laid from six to nine
                    eggs of a translucent white, spotted or blotched with rust-colour. The
                    Tree-Creeper inhabits almost the whole of Europe as well as Algeria, and has
                    been traced across Asia to Japan. It is now recognized as an inhabitant of the
                    greater part of North America, though for a time examples from that part of the
                    world, which differed slightly in the tinge of the plumage, were accounted a
                    distinct species (<hi rend="italic">C. americana),</hi> and even those from
                    Mexico and Guatemala (<hi rend="italic">C</hi>. <hi rend="italic">mexicana)</hi>
                    have lately been referred to the same. It therefore occupies an area not
                    exceeded in extent by that of many Passerine birds, and is one of the strongest
                    witnesses to the close alliance of the so-called Nearctic and Palaearctic
                    Regions.</p>
                <p>Allied to the Tree-Creeper, but wanting its lengthened and stiff tail-feathers,
                    is the genus <hi rend="italic">Tichodroma,</hi> the single member of which is
                    the Wall-Creeper (<hi rend="italic">T</hi>. <hi rend="italic">muraria)</hi> of
                    the Alps and some other mountainous parts of Europe and Asia, and occasionally
                    seen by the fortunate visitor to Switzerland fluttering like a big butterfly
                    against the face of a rock, conspicuous from the scarlet-crimson of its
                    wing-coverts and its white spotted primaries. Its bright hue is hardly visible
                    when the bird is at rest, and it then presents a dingy appearance of grey and
                    black. It is a species of wide range, extending from Spain to China; and, though
                    but seldom leaving its cliffs, it has wandered even so far as England. Merrett
                    (<hi rend="italic">Pinax,</hi> p. 177) in 1667 included it as a British bird,
                    and the correspondence between Marsham and Gilbert White (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Proc. Norf. and Norw. Nat. Society,</hi> ii. p. 180) proves that an example was
                    shot in Norfolk, 30th October 1792; while another is reported (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoologist,</hi> ser. 2, p. 4839) to have been killed in Lancashire, 8th May
                    1872.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Certhia</hi> as founded by Linnaeus contained 25
                    species, all of which, except the two above mentioned, have now been shewn to
                    belong elsewhere; and for a long while so many others were referred to it that
                    it became a most heterogeneous company. At present, so few are the forms left in
                    the Family <hi rend="italic">Certhiidae</hi> that systematists are not wanting
                    to unite it with the <hi rend="italic">Sittidae (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Nuthatch),</hi> for the two groups, however much their extreme members may
                    differ, are linked by so many forms which still exist that little violence is
                    done to the imagination by drawing upon the past for others to complete the
                    series of descendants from a common and not very remote ancestor, one that was
                    possibly the ancestor of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Wrens</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.)</hi> as well. One thing, however, has especially to be noticed here. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Certhiidae</hi> have not the least affinity to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Picidae (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Woodpecker,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">infra),</hi> but are strictly Passerine, though the Australian
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Climacteris</hi> may possibly not belong to them. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
