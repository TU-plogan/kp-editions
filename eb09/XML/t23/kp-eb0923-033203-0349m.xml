                    Norfolk, in 1732. His father was a clergyman, and held successively the livings
                    of Little Ashfield in Suffolk and of Stratton St Mary’s in Norfolk. His mother
                    Elizabeth was the daughter of Robert Smith of Ashfield. Thurlow received his
                    early education at home. He was next placed under the care of Mr Brett at
                    Scarning, where he remained for four years, and was then sent to the grammar
                    school of Canterbury, where he was considered a bold refractory clever boy. In
                    October 1748 Thurlow entered Caius College, Cambridge, and speedily justified
                    his school reputation. The dean of the college, upon the extent and accuracy of
                    whose classical acquirements grave suspicion rested, had directed him, as a
                    punishment for some act of insubordination, to translate a chapter of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Spectator</hi> into Greek. Thurlow executed his task with care,
                    and then gave it for révisai, not to the dean, but to the tutor of the college.
                    When reprimanded for having thus infringed the college rules, Thurlow retorted
                    that he had carried his exercise to one who could inform the dean whether or not
                    he had obeyed his orders. The insult was too grave for rustication, and yet too
                    slight to justify expulsion. Thurlow was therefore permitted to withdraw his
                    name from the college books, and he left Cambridge without a degree (1751). He
                    now took chambers, and began regularly to keep terms in the Inner Temple, which
                    he had joined while still an undergraduate. He was for some time a pupil along
                    with the poet Cowper in the office of Mr Chapman, an eminent solicitor in
                    Lincoln’s Inn. On 22d November 1754 Thurlow was called to the bar, and
                    subsequently went on the western circuit—at first with little success. But the
                    tide turned. In the case of Luke Robinson <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> the Earl of
                    Winchelsea (1758) Thurlow came into collision with Sir Fletcher Norton, then the
                    terror of solicitors and the tyrant of the bar, and put down his arrogance with
                    dignity and success. From this time his practice increased rapidly. In December
                    1761 he was made a king’s counsel, through the influence of the duchess of
                    Queensberry. In January 1762 he was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple. It
                    now became necessary for him to take his side in politics, and, after repeated
                    oscillations, and with some hesitancy, Thurlow threw himself into the ranks of
                    the Tory party. In May 1768 he became member for Tamworth. In 1769 the Douglas
                    Peerage case came on for hearing in the House of Lords, and Thurlow, who had
                    drawn the pleadings some years before <hi rend="italic">(Notes and Queries,</hi>
                    3d ser., iii. 122), led for the appellant in a speech of great ability and
                    analytic power. In March 1770, as a recognition of his defence in the previous
                    January of the expulsion of Wilkes, Thurlow was made solicitor-general on the
                    resignation of Dunning, and in the following year (23d January 1771), after he
                    had enhanced his reputation with the Government by attacking the rights of
                    juries in cases of libel (Rex <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Miller, 20 <hi
                    rend="italic">State Trials,</hi> 870-896) and the liberty of the press (16 <hi
                    rend="italic">Parly. Hist.,</hi> 1144), was raised to the attorney -
                    generalship. Thurlow’s public life was as factious as his youth had been daring.
                    His violent hatred of the American colonists, and his extreme and imprudent
                    assertion <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n350/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0350-0333"/> that as attorney-general he might set aside by
                    <hi rend="italic">scire facias</hi> as forfeited every charter in America
                    (debate on the American Prohibitory Bill, 18 Τ’. <hi rend="italic">H.,</hi>
                    999); his speech in aggravation of punishment in the case of Horne Tooke (20 <hi
                    rend="italic">St. Tr.,</hi> 777-783), when he argued that the prisoner ought to
                    be pilloried, because imprisonment was no penalty to a man of sedentary habits
                    and a fine would be paid by seditious subscription; and his consistent
                    opposition to all interference with the slave trade,—are characteristic of the
                    man. In 1778 Thurlow became lord chancellor and Baron Thurlow of Ashfield
                    (June), and took his seat in the House of Lords, where he soon acquired an
                    almost dictatorial power. He resolutely opposed the economical and
                    constitutional reforms proposed by Burke and Dunning. Under Rockingham he still
                    clung to the chancellorship, while conducting himself like a leader of the
                    opposition. To the short-lived ministry of Shelburne he gave a consistent
                    support. Under the coalition of Fox and North (April to December 1783) the great
                    seal was placed in commission, and Lord Loughborough was made first
                    commissioner. But Thurlow, acting as the king’s adviser, and in accordance with
                    his wishes, harassed the new ministry, and ultimately secured the rejection of
                    Fox’s India Bill (24 <hi rend="italic">P. H.,</hi> 226). The coalition was at
                    once dissolved. Pitt accepted office, and Thurlow again became lord chancellor
                    (December 23, 1783). At first he supported the Government heartily, but soon his
                    overbearing temper asserted itself. Imprudently relying on the friendship of the
                    king, and actuated by scarcely disguised enmity to Pitt, Thurlow passed rapidly
                    from occasional acts of hostility to secret disaffection, and finally to open
                    revolt. He delivered himself strongly against a bill, introduced without his
                    privity, for the restoration to the heirs of attainted owners of estates
                    forfeited in the Jacobite rebellion of 1745. Partly to please the king and
                    queen, partly from dislike to Burke, and partly perhaps from a real belief in
                    the groundlessness of the accusation, he supported Warren Hastings on every
                    occasion “with indecorous violence.” His negotiations with the Whigs during the
                    discussion of the Regency Bill (1788-19th February 1789) went beyond the limits
                    of mere perverse coquetry, and were designed to secure his seat on the woolsack
                    in the event of Fox being called to power. The climax was reached in 1792, when
                    he virulently attacked Pitt’s bill “to establish a sinking fund for the
                    redemption of the national debt,” not on account of the economic objections to
                    which it was justly liable, but on the trivial ground that it was an
                    unconstitutional attempt to bind future parliaments. The bill was carried, but
                    only by a narrow majority, and Pitt, feeling that co-operation with such a
                    colleague was impossible, insisted successfully on his dismissal (June 15,
                    1792). The ex-chancellor, who had a few days before (June 12) been created Baron
                    Thurlow of Thurlow, with remainder to his brothers and their male descendants,
                    now retired into private life, and, with the exception of a futile intrigue,
                    under the auspices of the prince of Wales, for the formation of a ministry from
                    which Pitt and Fox should be excluded, and in which the earl of Moira should be
                    premier and Thurlow chancellor (1797), finally abandoned the hopes of office and
                    the dictatorship which he had so long exercised in the House of Lords. In 1795
                    he opposed the Treason and Sedition Bills without success. In 1801 he spoke on
                    behalf of Horne Tooke—now his friend—when a bill was introduced to render a
                    priest in orders ineligible for a seat in the House of Commons. His last
                    recorded appearance in the House of Lords was on May 4,1802. He now spent his
                    time between his villa at Dulwich and Brighton, Bognor, Scarborough, and Bath.
                    He died at Brighton on 12th September 1806, and was buried in the Temple church.
                    Thurlow was never married, but left three natural daughters, for whom he made a
                    handsome provision. The title descended to his nephew, son of the bishop of
                    Durham.</p>
                <p>Lord Thurlow was a master of a coarse caustic wit, which habitually in his
                    private and too frequently in his public life displayed itself in profanity. He
                    was a good classical scholar and made occasional translations in verse from
                    Homer and Euripides. His judicial and his ecclesiastical patronage was wisely
                    exercised; he was the patron of Dr Johnson and of Crabbe, and was the first to
                    detect the great legal merits of Eldon. Thurlow’s personal appearance was
                    striking. His dark complexion, harsh but regular features, severe and dignified
                    demeanour, piercing black eyes and bushy eyebrows, doubtless contributed to his
                    professional and political eminence and provoked the sarcasm of Fox that he <hi
                    rend="italic">looked</hi> wiser than any man ever <hi rend="italic">was.</hi>
                    Yet he was far from being an impostor. By intense though irregular application
                    he had acquired a wide if not a profound knowledge of law. Clear-headed,
                    self-confident, and fluent, able at once to reason temperately and to assert
                    strongly, capable of grasping, rapidly assimilating, and forcibly reproducing
                    minute and complicated details, he possessed all the qualities which command
                    success. His speeches in the trial of the duchess of Kingston for bigamy (20 <hi
                    rend="italic">S'. T.,</hi> 355-6õl) are singularly vigorous and effective, while
                    his famous opening in the Douglas Peerage case and his argument for the crown in
                    Campbell u Hall (20 Ä <hi rend="italic">T.,</hi> 312-316) show that he might
                    have rendered high service to the judicial literature of his country had he
                    relied more upon his own industry and less upon the learning of Hargrave and
                    Kenyon</p>
