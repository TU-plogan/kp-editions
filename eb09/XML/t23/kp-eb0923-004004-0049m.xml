                    deposits, thickly covered by boulder-clay and loess, are widely spread over its
                    surface, concealing the underlying Devonian and Carboniferous deposits. These
                    last appear only in the deeper ravines, and seams of coal have been noticed at
                    several places. Iron ore (in the north-west), limestone, clay, and gypsum are
                    obtained for building and manufacturing purposes; traces of naphtha have been
                    discovered at Tamboff. The mineral waters of Lipetsk, similar to those of
                    Franzensbad in their alkaline elements, and chalybeate like those of Pyrmont and
                    Spa, are well known in Russia. Tamboff is watered by the tributaries of the Oka
                    and the Don. The Oka itself only touches the north-west corner of the
                    government, but its tributaries, the Moksha and the Tsna, are important channels
                    of traffic. The Don also only touches Tamboff, and of its affluents only the
                    Voronezh and the Khoper and its tributary the Vorona are at all navigable. As a
                    whole, it is only in the north that Tamboff is well watered; in its southern
                    part, which is exposed to the influence of the dry south-eastern winds, the want
                    of moisture is much felt, especially in the district of Borisoglyebsk, which
                    belongs to the dry steppes of the lower Volga.</p>
                <p>The climate is continental, and, although the average temperature at Tamboff is
                    42° F., the winter is comparatively cold (January, 13°; July, 68°). The rivers
                    remain frozen for four months and a half. Forests occupy less than one-sixth of
                    the total area, and occur chiefly in the west; in the south-east wood is scarce,
                    and straw is resorted to for fuel. The soil is fertile throughout; in the north,
                    indeed, it is clayey and sometimes sandy, but the rest of the government is
                    covered with a sheet, 2 to 3 feet in thickness, of the most fertile <hi
                    rend="italic">tchernozem,</hi> of such richness, indeed, that in Borisoglyebsk
                    corn-fields which have not been manured for eighty years still yield good
                    crops.</p>
                <p>Tamboff is one of the densely peopled provinces of Russia. Its population in 1883
                    reached 2,519,660, and in several districts (Kozloff, Lebedyan, Lipetsk) there
                    are from 110 to 130 inhabitants per square mile. It is Great Russian in the
                    central portion, but has a notable admixture of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mordvinians</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.)</hi> and Mescheriaks in the west and
                    north-west, as also of Tartars: the Mordvinians (who are rapidly becoming
                    Russified) constitute 4 per cent, of the aggregate population of Tamboff; the
                    Tartars number about 20,000, and the Mescheriaks about 4000. Nonconformity is
                    widely spread, although the official figures disclose only 14,300 Raskolniks.
                    Notwithstanding a high birth-rate (45 in the thousand), the annual increase of
                    population is but slow (0’5 per cent, annually).</p>
                <p>The prevailing occupation is agriculture, and in 1883 only 168,200 persons had
                    their residence in towns, which are mostly themselves nothing but large villages
                    of agriculturists living together, with a few merchants. More than two-thirds of
                    the area is arable, and of this proportion 53 per cent, belongs to peasant
                    communities, 36 per cent, to private individuals, and 11 per cent, to the crown.
                    The crops of the years 1883 to 1885 yielded on the average 8,885,000 quarters of
                    grain (half being rye, and one-third oats). Corn is exported to a considerable
                    extent from the south, although it is deficient in the north. Hemp and. linseed
                    are also cultivated for exportation. The cultivation of tobacco is yearly
                    increasing: 5220 acres were under this crop in 1885, and yielded nearly 50,000
                    cwts. In the same year 15,950 acres were under beetroot, and yielded 1,660,000
                    cwts. Cattle-breeding, though less extensively carried on than formerly, is
                    still important (656,300 horses, 399,500 horned cattle, and 1,326,600 sheep in
                    1883). Excellent breeds of horses are met with, not only on the larger estates,
                    but also in the hands of the wealthier peasants, those of the Bityug river being
                    most esteemed. Manufactures are represented chiefly by distilleries,
                    tallow-melting Λvorks, sugar-works, and a few woollencloth mills. The petty
                    trades are not very extensively carried on in the villages. Commerce is very
                    brisk, owing to the large amounts of corn exported,—Kozloff, Morshansk, Tamboff,
                    and Borisoglyebsk being the chief centres for this traffic, and Lebedyan for the
                    trade in horses and cattle. Tamboff is rather backward educationally: in 1883
                    there were only 629 schools, attended by 34,739 boys and 5680 girls. The
                    government is divided into twelve districts, the chief towns of which, with
                    their populations in 1884, are Tamboff (34,000 inhabitants), Borisoglyebsk
                    (13,000), Elatma (7560), Kirsanoff (7770), Kozloff (27,900), Lebedyan (6250),
                    Lipetsk (15,860), Morshansk (21,200), Shatsk (7260), Spassk (5010), Temnikoff
                    (13,700), and Usman (8110 in 1880). A distinctive feature of Tamboff is its very
                    large villages of crown-peasants, a dozen of which have from 5000 to 7000
                    inhabitants each. Several of them—like Raskazovo (a great centre of
                    Nonconformity), Atabukhi, Sasovo, Izberdei, and Arkhangelskoye—are important
                    commercial centres.</p>
                <p>The region now included in the north of the government was settled by Russians
                    during the earliest centuries of the principality of Moscow, but until the end
                    of the 17 th century the fertile tracts to the south remained too insecure for
                    settlers. In the following century a few immigrants began to come in from the
                    steppe, and landowners who had received large grants of land as gifts of the
                    czars began to bring their serfs from central Russia. The population has very
                    rapidly increased within the present century.</p>
