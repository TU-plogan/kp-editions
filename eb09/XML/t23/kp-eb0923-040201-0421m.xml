                    distinct genus. The “Tinamou” of Barrere has been identified with the
                    “Macucagua” described and figured By Marcgrave in 1648, and is the <hi

                <p>Buffon and his successors saw that the Tinamous, though passing among the
                    European colonists of South America as “Partridges,” could not be associated
                    with those birds, and Latham’s step, above mentioned, was generally approved.
                    The genus he had founded was usually placed among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gallinae,</hi> and by many writers was held to be allied to the Bustards,
                    which, it must be remembered, were then thought to be “Struthious.” Indeed the
                    likeness of the Tinamou’s bili to that of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rhea</hi>
                    (vol. xx. p. 506) was remarked in 1811 by liliger. On the other hand L’
                    Herminier in 1827 saw features in the Tinamou’s sternum that in his judgment
                    linked the bird to the <hi rend="italic">Rallidae.</hi> In 1830 Wagler <hi
                    rend="italic">{Nat. Syst.</hi><hi rend="italic">Amphibien,</hi> &amp;c., p. 127)
                    placed the Tinamous in the same Order as the Ostrich and its allies; and, though
                    he did this on very insufficient grounds, his assignment has turned out to be
                    not far from the mark, as in 1862 the great affinity of these groups was shown
                    by Prof. Parker’s researches, which were afterwards printed in the Zoological
                    <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> (v. pp. 205-232, 236-238, pls. xxxix.-xli.),
                    and was further substantiated by him in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi> (1866, pp. 174-178, pl. xv.). Shortly after this Prof. Huxley

                    light, urging that the Tinamous formed a very distinct group of birds which,
                    though not to be removed from the <hi rend="italic">Carinatae,</hi> presented so
                    much resemblance to the <hi rend="italic">Ratitae</hi> as to indicate them to be

                <p>The Tinamous thus—by whatever name we call them, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dromaeognathae, Tinami,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Crypturi—</hi> will be seen
                    to be of great importance from a taxonomer’s point of view, though in regard to
                    numbers they are comparatively insignificant. In 1873 Messrs. Sclater and Salvin
                    in their <hi rend="italic">Nomenclator</hi> (pp. 152, 153) recognized nine
                    genera and thirty-nine species, since which time about half a dozen other
                    species may have been described; but in 1880 Schlegel <hi rend="italic">(Mus.
                    Pays-Bas,</hi> viii., Monogr. 41, pp. 1-51) would only admit five genera and
                    thirty-one species—the latter because it was the number possessed by the Leyden
                    museum. They are peculiar to the Neotropical Region—four species only finding
                    their way into southern Mexico and none beyond. Some of them inhabit forests and
                    others the more open country; but setting aside size (which in this group varies
                    from that of a Quail to that of a large common Fowl) there is an unmistakable
                    uniformity of appearance among them as a whole, so that almost anybody having
                    seen one species of the group would always recognize another. Yet in minor
                    characters there is considerable difference among them; and first of all the
                    group may be divided into two sub-families, the first, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tinaminae,</hi> having four toes, and the second, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tinamotidinae,</hi> having but three—the latter containing, so far as is known,
                    but two genera, <hi rend="italic">Calopezus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tiηamotis,</hi> each consisting of a single species, while the former,
                    according to Messrs. Sclater and Salvin <hi rend="italic">(ui supra),</hi> may
                    be separated into seven genera, two being <hi rend="italic">Tinarnus</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Nothoceτcus,</hi> characterized by the roughness of their
                    posterior tarsal scales, the others, <hi rend="italic">Cryplwrus, Rhynchotus,
                    Nothoρrocta, Nothura,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Taoηiscus,</hi> having smooth
                    legs.</p>
                <p>To the ordinary spectator Tinamous have much the look of Partridges, but the more
                    attentive observer will notice that their elongated bill, their small head and
                    slender neck, clothed with very short feathers, give them a different air. The
                    plumage is generally inconspicuous: some tint of brown, ranging from rufous to
                    slaty, and often more or less closely barred with a darker shade or black, is
                    the usual style of coloration; but some species are characterized by a white
                    throat or a bay breast. The wings are short and rounded, and in some forms the
                    feathers of the tail, which in all are hidden by their coverts, are soft. In
                    bearing and gait the birds show some resemblance to their distant relatives the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ratitae,</hi> and Mr</p>
                <p>Bartlett shows <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1868, p. 115, pl.
                    xii.) that this is especially seen in the newly-hatched young. He also notices
                    the still stronger Ratite character, that the male takes on himself the duty of
                    incubation. The eggs are very remarkable objects, curiously unlike those of
                    other birds; and, as before stated <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol. iii.

                    porcelain, presenting also various colours, which seem to be constant in the
                    particular species, from pale primrose to sage-green or light indigo, or from
                    chocolatebrown to* pinkish orange. All who have eaten it declare the flesh of
                    the Tinamou to have a most delicate taste, as it has a most inviting appearance,
                    the pectoral muscles being semi-opaque. Of their habits not much has been told.
                    Darwin <hi rend="italic">(Journal,</hi> chap, iii.) has remarked upon the
                    silliness they show in allowing themselves to be taken, and this is wholly in
                    accordance with what Prof. Parker observes of their brain capacity, and is an
                    additional testimony to their low morphological rank. At least one species of
                    Tinamou has bred not unfrequently in confinement, and an interesting account of
                    what would have been a successful attempt by Mr John Bateman to naturalize this
                    species, <hi rend="italic">Rhynchotus</hi><hi rend="italic">rufescens,</hi> in
                    England, at Brightlingsea in Essex, appeared in <hi rend="italic">The Field</hi>
                    (23d Feb. 1884 and 12th Sept. 1885). The experiment unfortunately failed owing
                    to the destruction of the birds by foxes. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
