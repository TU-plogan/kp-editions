                <p><label type="entry">TRADE UNIONS</label> are combinations for regulating the
                    relations between workmen and masters, workmen and workmen, or masters and
                    masters, or for imposing restrictive conditions on the conduct of any industry
                    or business. By the common law all such combinations were, with certain rare and
                    unimportant exceptions, regarded as illegal. They were considered to be contrary
                    to public policy, and were treated as conspiracies in restraint of trade. Those
                    who were engaged or concerned in them were liable to be criminally prosecuted by
                    indictment or information, and to be punished on conviction by fine and
                    imprisonment. The offence was precisely the same whether it was committed by
                    masters or by workmen. But, although the provisions of the common law applied
                    <hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis</hi> to both of them alike, it was,
                    practically speaking, in reference rather to the latter than to the former that
                    their effects were developed and ascertained. While it was held to be perfectly
                    lawful for workmen, as individuals, to consent or to refuse to labour for any
                    remuneration or for any time they pleased, when two or more of them joined
                    together, and agreed to labour only on certain stipulated terms with respect
                    either to the payment or the duration of their labour, they were guilty <hi
                    rend="italic">ipso facto</hi> of a misdemeanour. It was immaterial whether the
                    end they had in view was to determine wages or to limit work; or whether the
                    means they adopted for promoting its attainment was a simultaneous withdrawal
                    from employment, an endeavour to prevent other workmen from resuming or taking
                    employment, or an attempt to control the masters in the management of their
                    trade, the engagement of journeymen or apprentices, or the use of machinery or
                    industrial processes; or whether in seeking to enforce their demands they relied
                    merely on advice and solicitation, or resorted to reproach and menace, or
                    proceeded to actual violence. In any event their combination in itself
                    constituted a criminal conspiracy, and rendered them amenable to prosecution and
                    punishment. From the reign of Edward I. to the reign of George IV. the operation
                    of the common law was enforced and enlarged by between thirty and forty Acts of
                    Parliament, all of which were more or less distinctly and explicitly designed to
                    prohibit and prevent what we have learned to describe and recognize as the
                    “organization of labour.” But the rise of the manufacturing system towards the
                    end of the last century, and the revolution which accompanied it in the
                    industrial arrangements of the country, were attended by a vast and unexpected
                    extension of the movement which the legislature had for so long and with so much
                    assiduity essayed to suppress. Among the multitudes of workmen who then began to
                    be employed in single factories or in neighbouring factories in the same towns,
                    trade unions in the form of secret societies speedily became numerous and
                    active, and to meet the novel requirements of the situation a more summary
                    method of procedure than that which had hitherto been available was provided by
                    the 40th Geo. III. cap. 106. By this statute, passed in 1800, it was enacted
                    that all persons combining with others to advance their wages or decrease the
                    quantity of their work, or in any way to affect or control those who carried on
                    any manufacture or trade in the conduct and management thereof, might be
                    convicted before one justice of the peace, and might be committed to the common
                    jail for any time not exceeding three calendar months, or be kept to hard labour
                    in the house of correction for a term of two calendar months. The discontent and
                    disorder of which, in conjunction with a state of commercial depression and
                    national distress, the introduction of steam and improved appliances generally
                    into British manufactures was productive in the first quarter of the current
                    century led to the nomination of a select committee by the House of Commons, to
                    inquire into the whole question of what were popularly and comprehensively
                    designated the “combination laws,” in the session of 1824. After taking
                    evidence, the committee reported to the House that “those laws had not only not
                    been efficient to prevent combinations either of masters or workmen, but on the
                    contrary had, in the opinion of many of both parties, had a tendency to produce
                    mutual irritation and distrust, and to give a violent character to the
                    combinations, and to render them highly dangerous to the peace of the
                    community.” They further reported that in their judgment “masters and workmen
                    should be freed from such restrictions as regards the rate of wages and the
                    hours of working, and be left at perfect liberty to make such agreements as they
                    mutually think proper.” They therefore recommended that “the statute laws which
                    interfered in these particulars between masters and workmen should be repealed,”
                    and also that “the common law under which a peaceable meeting of masters or
                    workmen might be prosecuted should be altered.” In pursuance of their report,
                    the 4th Geo. IV. cap. 95 was at once drafted, brought in, and passed. But the
                    immediate results of the change which it effected were regarded as so
                    inconvenient, formidable, and alarming that in the session of 1825 the House of
                    Commons appointed another select committee to re-examine the various problems,
                    and review and reconsider the evidence which had been submitted to their
                    predecessors in the previous year. They reported without delay in favour of the
                    total repeal of the 4th Geo. IV. cap. 95, and the restoration of those
                    provisions of the combination laws, whether statutory or customary, which it had
                    been more particularly intended to abrogate. The consequence was the enactment
                    of the 6th Geo. IV. cap. 129, of which the preamble declares that the 4th Geo.
                    IV. cap. 95 had not been found effectual, and that combinations such as it had
                    legalized were “injurious to trade and commerce, dangerous to the tranquillity
                    of the country, and especially prejudicial to the interests of all who were
                    concerned in them.” The effect of the 6th Geo. IV. cap. 129 was to leave the
                    common law of conspiracy <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n519/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0519-0500"/> in full force against all combinations in
                    restraint of trade, except such as it expressly exempted from its operation as
                    it had been before the 4th Geo. IV. cap. 95 was passed. It comprised, however,
                    within itself the whole of the statute law relating to the subject, and under it
                    no persons were liable to punishment for meeting together for the sole purpose
                    of consulting upon and determining the rate of wages or prices which they, being
                    present, would require for their work or pay to their workmen, or the hours for
                    which they would work or require work in any trade or business, or for entering
                    into any agreement, verbal or written, for the purpose of fixing the rate of
                    wages or prices which the parties to it should so receive or pay. But all
                    persons were subjected to a maximum punishment of three months’ imprisonment
                    with hard labour who should by violence, threats or intimidation, molestation,
                    or obstruction do, or endeavour to do, or aid, abet, or assist in doing or
                    endeavouring to do, any of a series of things inconsistent with freedom of
                    contract which the Act enumerated and defined. Afterwards, in order to remove
                    certain doubts which had arisen as to the true import and meaning of the words
                    “molestation” and “obstruction,” it was provided by the 22d Vict. cap. 34 that
                    “no person, by reason merely of his endeavouring peaceably and in a reasonable
                    manner, and without threat or intimidation direct or indirect, to persuade
                    others to cease or abstain from work, in order to obtain the rate of wages or
                    the altered hours of labour agreed to by him and others, should be deemed to
                    have been guilty of ‘ molestation ’ or ‘ obstruction.’” In spite of the partial
                    recognition which trade unions had thus received, they continued to be unlawful,
                    although not necessarily criminal, associations. In certain cases, they were by
                    statute exempted from penal consequences, and their members were empowered to
                    combine for specified purposes, and to collect funds by voluntary contributions
                    for carrying them into effect. But in the estimation of the common law the
                    special privileges which had been accorded to them under particular
                    circumstances did not confer any general character of legality upon them, and
                    where their rules were held to be in restraint of trade, as in the prohibition
                    of piece-work or the limitation of the number of apprentices, they were still
                    regarded as conspiracies. Hence they were practically excluded from the
                    advantages in regard to the security of their property and the settlement of
                    their disputes which, under the Friendly Societies Act, 18th and 19th Vict. cap.
                    63, had been granted to all associations established for any purposes which were
                    not illegal. In this condition the law was when what became notorious as the
                    “Sheffield and Manchester outrages” suggested the appointment of the royal
                    commission on trade unions, which investigated the subject from 1867 to 1869.
                    The outcome was, first, a temporary measure for the more effectual protection of
                    the funds of trade unions, passed in 1869, and, secondly, the two measures
                    which, as amended and amending, are cited together as the “Trade Union Acts 1871
                    and 1876”— the 34th and 35th Vict. cap. 22 and the 39th and 40th Vict. cap.
                    31.</p>
                <p>By these statutes, construed with the Conspiracy an Protection of Property Act,
                    1875, the 38 and 39 Vict. cap. 86, the law relating to combinations, whether of
                    workmen or of masters, assumed the shape in which it exists at the present time.
                    In connexion with trade disputes no person can now be prosecuted for conspiracy
                    to commit an act which would not be criminal if committed by him singly, and
                    consequently employers and employed alike may lawfully do in combination all
                    that they would be entitled to do as individuals. The purposes of a trade union
                    are not to be deemed illegal merely because they are in restraint of trade, and
                    the circumstance that they are in restraint of trade is not to render any member
                    of it liable to prosecution, nor is it to avoid or make voidable any agreement
                    or trust relating to it. No court, however, can entertain legal proceedings with
                    the object of directly enforcing or recovering damages for the breach of an
                    agreement between the members of a trade union as such, concerning the
                    conditions on which the members for the time being shall or shall not sell their
                    goods, transact their business, employ or be employed, or the payment by any
                    person of any subscription or penalty to a trade union, or for the application
                    of the funds of a trade union to provide benefits or to furnish contributions to
                    any employer or workman not a member of such trade union in consideration of
                    such employer or workman acting in conformity with the rules or resolutions of
                    such trade union, or to discharge any fine imposed upon any person by any court
                    of justice or any agreement made between one trade union and another, or any
                    bond to secure such agreements. But such incapacity to sue on such agreements is
                    not to be taken as constituting any of them illegal. Every person, however,
                    commits a misdemeanour, and on conviction is liable to a maximum fine of £20, or
                    to a maximum imprisonment of three months with hard labour, who wilfully and
                    maliciously breaks a contract of service or hiring, knowing, or having
                    reasonable cause to believe, that the probable consequence of his so doing,
                    either alone or in combination with others, will be to endanger human life or
                    cause serious bodily injury, or to expose valuable property, whether real or
                    personal, to destruction or serious injury; or who, being employed by a
                    municipal authority or by any company or contractor on whom is imposed by Act of
                    Parliament, or who have otherwise assumed, the duty of supplying any place with
                    gas or water, wilfully and maliciously breaks a contract of service or hiring,
                    knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the probable consequence of
                    his so doing, alone or in combination with others, will be to deprive the
                    inhabitants of that place, wholly or in part, of their supply of gas or water;
                    or who, with a view to compel any other person to do or to abstain from doing
                    any act which such other person has a right to abstain from doing or to do,
                    wrongfully and without legal authority uses violence to or intimidates such
                    other person or his wife or children, or injures his property; or who
                    persistently follows such person about from place to place; or who hides any
                    tools, clothes, or other property owned or used by such other person, or
                    deprives him of or hinders him in the use thereof; or who watches or besets the
                    house or other place where such person resides or works or carries on business
                    or happens to be, or the approach to such house or place; or who follows such
                    other person with two or more other persons in a disorderly manner in or through
                    any street or road. But attending at or near the house or place where a person
                    resides or works or carries on business in order merely to obtain or communicate
                    information is not watching or besetting within the statute. In regard to
                    registration, trade unions are placed on a similar footing with friendly and
                    provident and industrial societies, and they enjoy all the privileges,
                    advantages, and facilities which those associations possess and command. On
                    their side, however, they have to comply with the same conditions, are subject
                    to the same liabilities, and are compelled to make the same periodical
                    returns.</p>
                <p>Although there are several large and influential societies among the employers of
                    labour which come within the legal definition of trade unions, what are commonly
                    as well as more accurately meant by trade unions are societies exclusively
                    composed of the employed, —the suppliers of labour whether skilled or unskilled.
                    Of trade unions in this sense,—those of which the members are all artisans or
                    labourers,—the organization is everywhere pretty much the same, although the
                    rules and regulations of various associations differ in detail more or less
                    distinctly and widely from one another. Their ordinary constitution is that of a
                    society divided into districts, and again into smaller local bodies. The seat of
                    the governing authority —the general or executive council—is usually fixed at
                    some large centre of industry or commerce, as London, Manchester, or Birmingham,
                    and it is often changed at stated intervals by a vote of the society at large.
                    It is the policy of the trade unions, by this method of organization, to extend
                    the area of their influence, and so to increase their power in dealing with the
                    masters or in controlling their own members in any emergency. Each of the
                    branches has a separate government for special purposes. But for general
                    purposes all the branches are under the command of the executive council or
                    central committee, which is constituted of members or officers who are elected
                    by the whole society. The terms on which members are admitted are different in
                    different associations. But in all of them there are certain limits as to age
                    and the number of years during which the candidate has been apprenticed to or
                    has worked in the trade. The revenue and reserve of all the societies are
                    derived from admission fees and weekly or monthly subscriptions, together with
                    the amount of the fines which are imposed for neglect of duty and breaches of
                    the rules and regulations. These sources of income are sufficient for ordinary
                    purposes; and extraordinary charges, such as are entailed by a “strike” or a
                    “lock-out,” are nearly always, if not invariably, met by means of “levies” made
                    on the members by order of the executive council or central committee. The
                    following account of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers may be accepted as
                    furnishing a typical example of the organization and management of a large and
                    flourishing trade union.</p>

                <p>According to the thirty-third annual <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> of that
                    society, it appears that in 1883 the union consisted of 424 branches, chiefly in
                    towns in the British Isles, but with a fair sprinkling in Canada, the United
                    States, Australia, India, and other parts of the globe. The number of members
                    was 50,418. A branch must consist of not fewer than seven members or more than
                    three hundred. The constitution is pre-eminently democratic. Each branch is
                    itself a completely organized body. It selects and elects its own officers; it
                    collects, holds, and spends its own funds; and it manages the whole of the
                    business which affects itself alone. The officers of the branch are elected at
                    general meetings at which every member must be present under the penalty of a
                    fine. Members who refuse to be nominated for office, or who refuse to serve if
                    elected, are also subject to fines, and officers who neglect their business
                    either by coming late to meetings or absenting themselves altogether are
                    similarly punished. A meeting of the members of each branch is held every
                    fortnight for the transaction of ordinary business, such as receiving
                    subscriptions and deciding upon propositions for new members. These meetings
                    begin at half-past 7 in the evening, and close at half-past 9 or 10 o’clock, but
                    the hours are altered when it is convenient to alter them. The duties of the
                    secretary are onerous, and his responsibility is great. No one therefore is
                    eligible who has not been in the society two years successively, and “no member
                    shall be elected as secretary who keeps a public or beer house.” He has charge
                    of the accounts of his branch, and conducts its correspondence. He has to see to
                    the payment of members who are entitled to travelling relief donation, sick,
                    superannuation, or funeral benefit. He has to summon meetings, keep minutes,
                    report to the general secretary as to the state of trade in the district, the
                    number of men out of work, or on the other hand he has to state what men are
                    wanted, and he has also “to transact any other business that belongs to his
                    office.” The president, vice-president, and assistant secretary of a branch are
                    elected quarterly, while the secretary and referee are elected annually. Members
                    are exempt if they are fifty years of age, or if they reside more than 3 miles
                    from the club house; and they are disqualified if they are 10s. in arrear with
                    their contributions. There are also bookkeepers, money stewards, doorkeepers,
                    treasurers, and auditors, the nature of whose work is evident from their titles.
                    There are also sick stewards, whose duties are to visit the sick twice a week,
                    to report their visits to the meetings of the branch, and to carry the invalid
                    his sick benefit. None of the offices are honorary. In branches numbering fewer
                    than fifty members every officer is allowed 4d., and in branches numbering fifty
                    and upwards 6d., for his attendance on branch meeting nights. The secretary is
                    paid annually and according to the size of the branch. The lowest amount is £1,
                    5s. for a branch of ten members, the highest £10, 4s. for a branch of three
                    hundred. The auditors are paid at a lower rate, which varies from 9d. to 4s.
                    8d., while the treasurer is paid 10 per cent. on the sum set apart for use. Each
                    branch has also a committee, which has power to determine anything whereon the
                    society’s rules are silent. The books of the branch are open to their
                    inspection; they can summon meetings, and they have various other duties. Each
                    member of this committee receives 6d. for each meeting he attends, and is fined
                    6d. for each meeting from which he is absent. In any district in which there are
                    more branches than one, a local district committee must be formed, consisting of
                    seven members, each branch as nearly as practicable selecting an equal number.
                    Where there are seven branches, each one sends a representative. The duties of
                    this committee are to “watch over the interests of the trade, and transact such
                    business as affects the district generally.” It must not, however, interfere
                    with the business of any particular branch of the society. The central authority
                    is vested in a general or executive council, consisting of thirty-seven members,
                    of whom eleven represent metropolitan branches, the others being from the
                    provinces, including Scotland and Ireland. As the country councillors cannot
                    conveniently attend frequent meetings in London, the ordinary management is
                    entrusted to the eleven London members, who are called the local council, and
                    the council is also further broken up into various committees for managing the
                    details of the society. This council hears appeals from branches, advises,
                    forbids, initiates, and terminates strikes. The general secretary receives a
                    salary of £4 a week and lives rent free. He also receives 1s. 6d. each time he
                    attends a council meeting, and is paid for any special journeys undertaken or
                    extra work done. His assistants receive £2, 10s. a week each, and have to give
                    the whole of their time to the association. They have to compile and issue a
                    monthly report as well as quarterly and yearly reports. The last-named is quite
                    a formidable volume, consisting of nearly <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> 400
                    pages of large post octavo, and those of other societies are similar. The
                    general secretary’s hours of business are fixed from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. He has
                    power to authorize members who are on donation to be removed from one branch to
                    another where there is a probability of employment, and he has to keep a
                    register of all the members of the society, stating when and where admitted,
                    age, married or single, and whether a member has received any part of the
                    financial money. In the Amalgamated Society of Engineers the contribution of
                    each member is generally 1s. a week, and if a man be in arrears he is suspended
                    from the benefits of the society, unless indeed he is out of work or in
                    distressed circumstances. At the end of 1883 the union had a balance in hand of
                    £178,128, or upwards of £3, 10s. a man.</p>
                <p>In some trade unions—for example, those of the compositors— there is a special
                    body (“fathers of chapels”) whose business it is to see that the rules and
                    regulations of the societies they belong to are faithfully observed in the
                    establishments where they are employed. In others again—for instance, in the
                    National Agricultural Labourers Union, as distinguished from the Federal Union
                    of Agricultural Labourers—the system of management is completely centralized,
                    the secretary or the executive committee having entire control of the funds and
                    business of the whole association. In all large towns there are trade councils
                    formed of delegates from the different trade unions within their area, whose
                    function it is to discuss and supervise the general interests of the unionists
                    in the several trades of which they are representative. Moreover, an annual
                    trade unions congress is held in some great centre of industry and population in
                    one of the three kingdoms, at which delegates from almost all the trade unions
                    throughout the realm are present and take part in debating questions, whether
                    social or political, which are of special interest to the working classes. At
                    these assemblies, which have now been held for twenty consecutive years, a
                    parliamentary committee, which remains in existence for the ensuing twelvemonth,
                    is chosen, to whom the whole body of trade unionists looks for counsel and
                    assistance with respect to legislation intended or desired on their behalf. To
                    the action of the trade unions congress and their parliamentary committee much
                    of the legislation which has been recently effected on questions affecting the
                    welfare of the order of the community to which they belong is to be attributed,—
                    notably the Employers’ Liability Act and the amended Factory and Mines Acts.
                    (See <hi rend="italic">Trade Unions, &amp;c.,</hi> by William Trant.)</p>
                <p>The objects of trade unions are twofold,—first, those of a friendly or benefit
                    society, and, secondly, those of a trade society or guild. In the former
                    capacity they afford relief to their members when they are out of work from any
                    cause, including sickness or accident; they occasionally provide them with
                    superannuation allowances, and they almost always make burial allowances on
                    account of deceased members and their wives. In the latter capacity it is their
                    special business to promote what they conceive to be the interests of the trade
                    with which they are connected by placing the workmen, so far as combination will
                    fulfil that purpose, on a footing approaching to equality with the capitalists
                    by whom they are employed in the disposal of their labour. Of course this is the
                    great object for which the unions really exist. But, as the commissioners on
                    trade unions have pointed out, it is found desirable to conjoin the objects of a
                    friendly or benefit society with it, because by that means additional members
                    and funds are obtained, and the authority which the union as a trade society has
                    over its members is thus augmented. The leading aims of all trade unionism are
                    to increase wages and to diminish the labour by which it is needful to earn
                    them, and further to secure a more equal distribution of work among the workmen
                    in any given trade than would be the case under a regime of unrestricted
                    competition. Hence their rules prescribe a minimum amount of wages to be
                    accepted and a maximum amount of work to be done by their members, and prohibit
                    piece work or working overtime. The methods by which the unionists endeavour to
                    accomplish their end, which is in a sense the monopoly of the labour market, are
                    either direct or indirect. The direct method is a “strike,” or simultaneous
                    cessation of labour on the part of the workmen. It is the ultimate sanction as
                    between the employed and their employers of the demands made by the union. But,
                    where the unionists are strong, the mere threat of a strike is often sufficient
                    to fulfil the intended purpose, and arbitration is still more frequently found
                    effectual for bringing about a settlement or compromise. The indirect methods to
                    which the trade unionists resort for reaching their aims are by limiting the
                    number of workmen to be employed in any trade and by repressing or
                    discountenancing competition among those who are actually employed in it. Most
                    of them forbid the admission of more than a stipulated proportion of
                    apprentices, and some of them prohibit the engagement of women to do work which
                    can be done by men. Nearly all of them resist the common employment of unionists
                    and non-unionists, and do their best to exclude non-unionists from employment
                    altogether. But the amount expended by trade unions in the conduct of trade
                    disputes is very much less than is generally imagined. Mr George Howell, for
                    instance, showed conclusively in the <hi rend="italic">Contemporary Review</hi>
                    that such was the case three or four years ago, and Mr Murchie, the chairman of
                    the parliamentary committee, stated at the trade unions congress at Stockport in
                    the autumn of 1885 that Mr Howell’s contentions had been signally confirmed by
                    more recent experience. Taking the seven largest trade unions, those whose
                    statistics had been relied on by Mr Howell—namely, the Amalgamated Engineers,
                    the Ironfounders, the Boiler Makers <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n521/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0521-0502"/> and Iron Shipbuilders, the Steam-Engine Makers,
                    Ironmoulders of Scotland, Amalgamated Tailors, and Amalgamated Carpenters and
                    Joiners—he affirmed that, while in the nine years preceding 1884 their receipts
                    were £2,818,548, their expenditure was £2,963,186, of which amount £1,207,180
                    was spent in unemployed benefit, £592,273 in sick benefit, £975,052 in
                    compensation for loss of tools, superannuations, accidents, funerals, minor
                    grants and benefits, and expense of management, only £188,680 had been spent in
                    connexion with “trade movements,” or about 6½ per cent. of the whole sum
                    expended.</p>
                <p>There are no really trustworthy means of arriving at anything approaching to an
                    accurate estimate of the actual numerical strength of the trade unions in the
                    United Kingdom. According to the last <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> of the
                    registrar general of friendly societies, there were in the year 1883 registered
                    in his office 195 trade unions with 253,088 members and £431,495 funds, of which
                    12 returned over £10,000 funds, 9 over 10,000 members, and 6 over £10,000
                    income. But this of course conveys a very inadequate notion of the dimensions to
                    which trade unionism has attained, since many of the largest and most
                    influential societies are still unregistered.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the number of delegates and the aggregate membership of
                    the societies represented by them at the trade unions congresses in the years
                    from 1880 to 1886, both inclusive :—</p>
                <p>We shall not be far wrong, perhaps, if we set down the number of trade unionists
                    in all the three kingdoms at about 800,000. (F. DR.)</p>
