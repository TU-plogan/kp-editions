                    688).</p></note> The modern temperance movement may be said to date from the
                    publication at Philadelphia, in 1785, of Dr Benjamin Rush’s essay on “The
                    Effects of Ardent Spirits on the Human Body and Mind,” which was republished in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</hi> of 1786, and had a wide
                    circulation. The distinction which he draws between distilled and fermented
                    liquors has, however, no foundation in fact, the difference being one of degree
                    and not of kind.· In 1808 Dr Lyman Beecher and Dr B. J. Clark, both readers of
                    Rush, took action, and the result of the work of the latter was the formation of
                    λvhat is believed to be the first modern temperance society. It was formed in
                    Greenfield, Saratoga county, New York, as an anti-spirits association, and still
                    remains a teetotal society. This example was soon followed elsewhere, the early
                    societies all restricting their scope to advocacy of moderation in the use of
                    distilled liquors, and placing no inhibition upon fermented drinks. One society
                    had a <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n170/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0170-0159"/> byelaw’ requiring any member who became
                    intoxicated to treat all the other members. The work made further progress when
                    the American Temperance Society was founded in 1826. Three years later Prof.
                    John Edgar of Belfast called attention to the need for similar work in Ireland;
                    and John Dunlop nearly at the same time organized a temperance society in
                    Glasgow. In 1830 the first English temperance society was founded at Bradford.
                    The habitual use of fermented liquors in England was a prolific source of
                    drunkenness, and the evil was <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> greatly increased by
                    the passing of the Beer Act in October 1830. Hence some of the reformers began
                    to abstain from all forms of alcohol. This new departure found its leader in
                    Joseph Livesey of Preston, a man of singular zeal and benevolence, who with six
                    others signed a pledge of total abstinence on 1st September 1832. The reformers
                    were soon divided over the fierce “battle of the pledges.” Some were willing to
                    pledge themselves to abstain, but not to refrain from providing alcoholic drink
                    for their visitors. After the formation of the distinctive total abstinence
                    organizations, the moderation societies died of inanition. It should be
                    mentioned here that the Society of Bible Christians, founded at Salford in 1809,
                    adopted the rule of abstinence from flesh meat and intoxicants, and that a
                    number of the “radical reformers” were abstainers from a desire to diminish the
                    public revenue, λvhich they regarded as devoted to wrong purposes by the
                    Government of the day. In Ireland Father Theobald Mathew became president of the
                    Total Abstinence Society in Cork in 1838, and the “pledge” was taken from his
                    hands by crowds; before he died in 1856 between three and four million persons
                    are said to have received it from him in the course of his journeys. J. S.
                    Buckingham secured the appointment of a committee of the House of Commons, which
                    sat in June 1834, to inquire into drunkenness. The adjective “teetotal” was
                    first used in September 1833 by Richard Turner, a reformed drunkard, to express
                    the thoroughgoing principle of total abstinence, but whether he coined the word,
                    or whether it was merely a stuttering pronunciation of “total,” or an old
                    dialect word has been disputed; Prof. Skeat <hi rend="italic">(Etym. Dich,
                    s.v.</hi> “Teetotal”) believes it is an emphasized form of “total,” formed on
                    the principle of reduplication. The early teetotallers were earnest
                    missionaries. In consequence of their efforts societies and leagues multiplied,
                    periodicals were established, and, notwithstanding many failures and apparent
                    retrogressions, the temperance movement progressed. One of the chief forms of
                    thrift amongst the artisan class was that of the friendly society, the meetings
                    of which were usually held at the public-house, large sums being spent
                    (sometimes by rule) on liquor. In 1835 the Independent Order of Rechabites was
                    formed at Salford, and has since had a prosperous career as a workingclass
                    insurance company on temperance principles. The Sons of Temperance and the Total
                    Abstinent Sons of the Phoenix are similar organizations. The sickness and
                    death-rate among members of these bodies is much below that of the ordinary
                    friendly societies. The beneficial effect of abstinence upon health and
                    longevity is shown by the experience of the United Kingdom Temperance Provident
                    Institution, the example of which has led several large insurance companies to
                    add a special section for teetotallers. The statistics of these offices show
                    that the mortality of the ordinary insured is considerably heavier than that of
                    the abstainers. A vehement controversy arose at an early period as to the use of
                    sacramental wine, and the nature of the wines mentioned in Scripture was
                    discussed in innumerable pamphlets. The result has been that in a number of
                    cases the wine now used for sacramental purposes is understood to be
                    unfermented. The cosmopolitan character of the movement was shown by the meeting
                    of the World’s Temperance Convention at London in 1846. The Scotch United
                    Presbyterian Abstinence Society, originated in 1845, was one of the first of the
                    church societies; and there are now few, if any, religious denominations either
                    in England or America in which such organizations are wholly wanting. The Church
                    of England Temperance Society has two sections, one pledged to the temperate use
                    of intoxicants and the other to total abstinence. This method of organizing has
                    found imitators. The enactment of the Maine Liquor Law in America in 1851 (see
                    vol. xv. p. 299) led to the formation, in 1853, of the United Kingdom Alliance,
                    which has for its object the suppression of the liquor traffic by legislation,
                    and with a view to this suggests that a power of local veto should be placed in
                    the hands of the ratepayers. This proposal took parliamentary form in the
                    Permissive Bill of Sir Wilfrid Lawson, which was ultimately withdrawn and
                    replaced by a “local option” resolution, which has been thrice affirmed by the
                    House of Commons. Temperance hotels, temperance cafés, British workmen
                    public-houses, cocoa houses, coffee palaces, teetotal clubs, have arisen in many
                    places as social aids of the temperance movement.</p>
                <p>In 1868 the Good Templar order was introduced into England from the United
                    States, where it had come into existence several years earlier. In England it
                    made rapid progress, until it was seriously checked by a dispute arising out of
                    the Negro question; but the two sections have again reunited (1887). Good
                    Templary is the freemasonry of temperance, with ritual, passwords, grips, Ac.,
                    closely modelled on those of the old secret societies. It has had a remarkable
                    extension in Great Britain, the United States, the British colonies, and in
                    Scandinavia, its aggregate membership now reaching over 623,000. One of its
                    results has been the foundation of a temperance orphanage at Sunbury-on-Thames.
                    Side by side with the general movement there has been a special movement against
                    the use of alcohol as medicine, and the tendency of medical teaching now favours
                    at least restriction of its use as a therapeutic agent. The London Temperance
                    Hospital for the non-alcoholic treatment of disease was opened in October 1873.
                    The importance of training the young was early recognized by the leaders of
                    temperance reformation, and the labours of Dr R. B. Grindrod of Manchester and
                    Mrs Carlile of Dublin led to the formation of bands of hope, which are now found
                    in connexion with many places of worship. The juvenile temples of the Good
                    Templar order also work in the same direction. The Woman’s Christian Temperance
                    Union, founded in the United States in 1874, is one of the latest forms of
                    temperance activity. A branch was organized in Great Britain in 1876; and in
                    1883 the World’s Women’s Temperance Union came into existence.</p>
                <p>The temperance movement has now branched out into a multitude of organizations in
                    the United Kingdom, of which the Railway Temperance Union, the post-office
                    temperance societies, and associations connected with the army and navy are
                    types. The organizations of a more general character are the United Kingdom
                    Alliance, which is very active in the dissemination of teetotal doctrines
                    generally, the National Temperance League, the Scottish Temperance League, the
                    British Temperance League, the Scottish Permissive Bill Association, the Irish
                    Temperance League, and the Irish Association for the Prevention of Intemperance.
                    There are also large district and county societies. Next to these come the
                    secret orders, of which the Rechabites, Sons of Temperance, Sons of the Phoenix
                    are large benefit societies. The Independent Order of Good Templars is
                    non-beneficiary, and seeks in its “lodges” to provide social attractions, and at
                    the same time to train the members in temperance work; it is probably the
                    largest voluntary association in the world. There are societies in connexion
                    with the various religious bodies, of which the Church of England Temperance
                    Society, the Catholic League of the Cross, the Baptist Total Abstinence Society,
                    are prominent instances.</p>

                <p>The oldest organization in America is the Sons of Temperance (1842), now
                    numbering about 80,000 members. The Independent Order of Good Templars (1851) is
                    the largest, its membership approaching 100,000. Both these, as also the Royal
                    Templars of Temperance (1877) and the Templars of Honour and Temperance (1845),
                    are mutual benefit societies. The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, the
                    National Temperance Society and Publication House (New York), and the National
                    Prohibition Party are active in educational work. The Woman’s Christian
                    Temperance Union is the outgrowth of “the Women’s Crusade” (1872), a remarkable
                    uprising among the women of Ohio and Pennsylvania against the liquor traffic.
                    The organization was effected in 1874, and has since spread throughout the
                    United States, its membership now (1887) numbering 207,000. Its influence has
                    been widely felt in legislatures and in elections in which prohibitory laws have
                    been voted upon. With the exception of the Church Temperance Society of the
                    Protestant Episcopal Church, which has the “double basis,” all the temperance
                    societies of the United States are based on the doctrine of total abstinence;
                    and, with the additional exception of the Father Mathew Total Abstinence
                    Societies of the Roman Catholic Church, they all advocate the principle of
                    prohibition. Amendments embodying this idea have been inserted in the State
                    constitutions (by popular vote) of Maine, Kansas, and Rhode Island. In Vermont
                    and Iowa the legislature has enacted statutory prohibition, which is still in
                    force. In other States local prohibition prevails to a large extent, chiefly in
                    Georgia, Mississippi, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Arkansas.</p>
