                    >usus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fideicommissum.</hi> To <hi rend="italic"
                    >usus</hi> is perhaps due the name as well as the idea of that right over
                    property, coordinate with the right of the nominal owner, possessed by the
                    person having the use. To <hi rend="italic">fidei-commissum</hi> appears to be
                    due the name as well as the idea of that confidence reposed in another which is
                    the essence of the modern trust. <hi rend="italic">Usus</hi> was in Roman law a
                    personal servitude, or right of one person over the land of another, confined to
                    his personal wants and without the right to the produce and profits which <hi
                    rend="italic">ususfructus</hi> carried. It has little in common with the use of
                    English law but the name and the conception of a dual ownership. The <hi
                    rend="italic">fideicommissum</hi> is more important; see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Roman Law,</hi> vol. xx. p.</p>

                <p>707. By the legislation of Justinian the law of <hi rend="italic">legata</hi> was
                    practically assimilated to that of <hi rend="italic">fideicommissa.</hi> The
                    only thing that distinguished the one from the other was the mode in which the
                    gift was made: if by words of direct bequest, it was a <hi rend="italic"
                    >legatum,</hi> if by precatory words, a <hi rend="italic">fideicommissum.</hi>
                    It may be noticed, as an illustration of the course afterwards taken by the law
                    in England, that <hi rend="italic">fideicommissa</hi> in favour of the church
                    were so far favoured over others that if paid over by mistake they could not be
                    recovered. In addition to <hi rend="italic">usus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >fideicommissum,</hi> the Roman division of ownership into quiritary and
                    bonitary (to use words invented at a later time) may perhaps to some extent have
                    suggested the English division into legal and equitable estate. The two kinds of
                    ownership were amalgamated by Justinian. Legal and equitable estate are still
                    distinct in England, though attempts have been made in the direction of
                    amalgamation. The gradual manner in which the beneficiary became subject to the
                    burdens attaching to the property of which he enjoyed the benefit was a feature
                    common to both the Roman and the English system.</p>

                    employed. The Statute of Uses seems to regard use, trust, and confidence as

                    well acquainted with Roman law, the object being to escape the provisions of the
                    laws against <hi rend="smallcaps">Mortmain</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> by
                    obtaining the conveyance of an estate to a friend on the understanding that they
                    should retain the use, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the actual profit and
                    enjoyment of the estate. Uses were soon extended to other purposes. They were
                    found valuable for the defeat of creditors, the avoiding of attainder, and the
                    charging of portions. A use had also the advantage of being free from the
                    incidents of feudal tenure: it could be alienated <hi rend="italic">inter
                    vivos</hi> by secret conveyance, and could be devised by will. In many cases the
                    feoffee<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Feoffment,
                    though the usual, was not the only mode of conveyance to uses. The preamble of
                    the Statute of Uses mentions fines and recoveries, and other
                    assurances.</p></note> to uses, as he was called, or the person seised to the
                    use of another, seems to have been specially chosen on account of his rank and
                    station, which would enable him to defy the common law and protect the estate of
                    his <hi rend="italic">cestui que use,</hi> or the person entitled to the
                    beneficial enjoyment. The Act of 1 Ric. II. c. 9 was directed against the choice
                    of such persons. This alienation of land in use was looked upon with great
                    disfavour by the common law courts, in whose eyes the cestui que use was only a
                    tenant at will. Possibly the ground of their refusal to recognize uses was that
                    the assizes of the king’s court could only be granted to persons who stood in a
                    feudal relation to the king. The denial of the right followed the denial of the
                    remedy. The use was on the other hand supported by the Court of Chancery, and
                    execution of the confidence reposed in the feoffee to uses was enforced by the
                    court in virtue of the general jurisdiction which as a court of conscience it
                    claimed to exercise over breach of faith. Jurisdiction was no doubt the more
                    readily assumed by ecclesiastical judges in favour of a system by which the
                    church was generally the gainer. A double ownership of land thus gradually
                    arose, the nominal and ostensible ownership,—the only one acknowledged in the
                    courts of common law,—and the beneficial ownership protected by the Court of
                    Chancery. The reign of Henry V. to a great extent corresponds with that of
                    Augustus at Rome, as the point of time at which legal recognition was given to
                    what had previously been binding only in honour. The means of bringing the
                    feoffee to uses before the court was the writ of <hi rend="italic"
                    >subpoena,</hi> said to have been invented by John de Waltham, bishop of
                    Salisbury and master of the rolls in the reign of Richard II. By means of this
                    writ the feoffee to uses could be compelled to answer on oath the claim of his
                    cestui que use. The doctrine of the Court of Chancery as to the execution of a
                    use varied according as there was transmutation of possession or not. In the
                    former case it was unnecessary to prove consideration; in the latter, generally
                    a case of bargain and sale, the court would not enforce the use unless it was
                    executed in law,—that is, unless there was a valuable consideration, even of the
                    smallest amount. Where no consideration could be proved or implied, the use
                    resulted to the feoffor. This theory led to the insertion up to a recent date in
                    deeds (especially in the lease of the lease and release period of conveyancing)
                    of a nominal consideration, generally five shillings. Lands either in
                    possession, reversion, or remainder could be granted in use. Most persons could
                    be feoffees to uses. The king and corporations aggregate were, however,
                    exceptions, and were entitled to hold the lands discharged of the use. On the
                    accession of Richard III., who from his position of authority had been a
                    favourite feoffee, it was necessary to pass a special Act (1 Ric. III. c. 5),
                    vesting the lands of which he had been feoffee either in his co-feoffees or, in
                    the absence of cofeoffees, in the cestui que use. The practical convenience of
                    uses was so obvious that it is said that by the reign of Henry VII. most of the
                    land in the kingdom was held in use. The freedom of uses from liability to
                    forfeiture for treason must have led to their general adoption during the Wars
                    of the Roses.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The use,
                    as in later times the trust, was, however, forfeited to the crown on attainder
                    of the feoffee or trustee for treason.</p></note> The secrecy with which a use
                    could be transferred, contrary as it was to the publicity required for livery of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Seisin (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> at common law,
                    led to the interference of the legislature on several occasions between the
                    reigns of Richard II. and Henry VIII., the general tendency of the legislation
                    being to make the cestui que use more and more subject to the burdens incident
                    to the ownership of land. One of the most important statutes was the Statute of
                    Mortmain (15 Ric. II. c. 5), forbidding evasion of the Statute <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Religiosis</hi> of Edward I. by means of feoffments to uses. Other Acts
                    enabled the cestui que use to transfer the use without the concurrence of the
                    feoffee to uses (1 Ric. III. c. 1), made a writ of <hi rend="italic"
                    >formedon</hi> maintainable against him (1 Hen. VII. c. 1), rendered his heir
                    liable to wardship and relief (4 Hen. VII. c. 17), and his lands liable to
                    execution (19 Hen. VII. c. 15). At length in 1535 the famous Statute of Uses (27
                    Hen. VIII. c. 10) was passed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It was adopted in Ireland exactly a century later by 10 Car.
                    I. c. 1 (Ir.). The law of uses and trusts in Ireland is practically the same as
                    that in England, the main differences being in procedure rather than in
                    substantive law.</p></note> The preamble of the statute enumerates the mischiefs
                    which it was considered that the universal prevalence of uses had occasioned,
                    among others that by fraudulent feoffments, fines, recoveries, and other like
                    assurances to uses, confidences, and trusts lords lost their feudal aids, men
                    their tenancies by the curtesy, women their dower, manifest perjuries in trials
                    were committed, the king lost the profits of the lands of persons attainted or
                    enfeoffed to the use of aliens, and the king and lords their rights of year,
                    day, and waste, and of escheats of felons’ lands. To remedy this state of things
                    it was enacted, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> that, where any person was
                    seised of any hereditaments to the use, confidence, or trust of any other person
                    by any means, the person having such use, confidence, or trust should be seised,
                    deemed, and adjudged in lawful seisin, estate, and possession of such
                    hereditaments. Full legal remedies were given to the cestui que use by the
                    statute. He was enabled to distrain for a rent charge, to have action, entry,
                    condition, &amp;c. The effect of this enactment was to make the cestui que use
                    the owner at law as well as in equity (as had been done once before under the
                    exceptional circumstances which led to 1 Ric. III. c. 5), provided that the use
                    was one which before the statute would have been enforced by the Court of
                    Chancery. For some time after the passing of the statute an equitable as
                    distinct from a legal estate did not exist. But the somewhat narrow construction
                    of the statute by the common law courts in Tyrrel's case<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dyer’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi>
                    155a.</p></note> (1557) enabled estates cognizable only in equity to be again
                    created. In that case it was held that a use upon a use could not be executed;
                    therefore in a feoffment to A and his heirs to the use of B and his heirs to the
                    use of C and his heirs only the first use was executed by the statute. The use
                    of B being executed in him, that of C was not acknowledged by the common law
                    judges; but equity regarded C as beneficially entitled, and his interest as an
                    equitable estate held for him in trust, corresponding to that which B would have
                    had before the statute. The position taken by the Court of Chancery in trusts
                    may be compared with that taken in <hi rend="smallcaps">Mortgage</hi> (<hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.</hi>). The Judicature Act, 1873, while not going as far as
                    the Statute of Uses and combining the legal and equitable estates, makes
                    equitable rights cognizable in all courts. From the decision in Tyrrel's case
                    dates the whole modern law of uses and trusts. In modern legal language use is
                    restricted to the creation of legal estate under the Statute of Uses, trust is
                    confined to the equitable estate of the cestui que trust or beneficiary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Uses since 1535.—</hi> The Statute of Uses is still the basis
                    of conveyancing. A grant in a deed is still, after the alterations in the law
                    made by the Conveyancing Act, 1881, made “to and to the use of A.” The statute
                    does not, however, apply indiscriminately to all cases, as only certain uses are
                    executed by it. It does not apply to leaseholds or copyholds, or to cases where
                    the grantee to uses is anything more than a mere passive instrument, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.</hi>, where there is any direction to him to sell the
                    property. The seisin, too, to be executed by the statute, must be in another
                    than him who has the use, for where A is seised to the use of A it is a common
                    law giant. The difference is important as far as regards the doctrine of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Possession (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.).</hi> Constructive
                    possession is given by a deed operating under the statute even before entry, but
                    not by a common law grant (at any rate sufficient to entitle the grantee to be
                    registered as a voter), until actual receipt of rent by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n618/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0618-0597"/> grantee. The operation of the Statute of Uses was
                    supplemented by the Statute of Inrolments and that of Wills. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Will.)</hi> The Statute of Inrolments (27 Hem VIII. c. 16)
                    enacted that no bargain and sale should pass a freehold unless by deed indented
                    and inrolled within six months after its date in one of the courts at
                    Westminster or with the <hi rend="italic">custos rotulorum</hi> of the county.
                    As the statute referred only to freeholds, a bargain and sale of a leasehold
                    interest passed without inrolment. Conveyancers took advantage of this omission
                    (whether intentional or not) in the Act, and the practical effect of it was to
                    introduce a mode of secret alienation of real property, the lease and release,
                    which was the general form of conveyance up to 1845. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Real Estate, Sale.)</hi> Thus the publicity of transfer, which it was the
                    special object of the Statute of Uses to effect, was almost at once defeated. In
                    addition to the grant to uses there were other modes of conveyance under the
                    statute which are now obsolete in practice, viz., the covenant to stand seised
                    and the bargain and sale. Under the statute, as before it, the use has been
                    found a valuable means of limiting a remainder to the person creating the use
                    and of making an estate take effect in derogation of a former estate by means of
                    a shifting or springing use. At common law a freehold could not be made to
                    commence <hi rend="italic">in futuro</hi>; but this end may be attained by a
                    shifting use, such as a grant (common in marriage settlements) to A to the use
                    of B in fee simple until a marriage, and after the celebration of the marriage
                    to other uses. An example of a springing use would be a grant to A to such uses
                    as B should appoint and in default of and until appointment to C in fee simple.
                    The difficulty of deciding where the seisin was during the suspension of the use
                    led to the invention of the old theory of <hi rend="italic">scintilla
                    juris,</hi> or continued possibility of seisin in the grantee to uses. This
                    theory was abolished by 23 and 24 Vict. c. 38, which enacted that all uses
                    should take effect by force of the estate and seisin originally vested in the
                    person seised to the uses. The most frequent instances of a springing use are
                    powers of appointment, usual in wills and settlements. There has been much
                    legislation on the subject of powers, the main effect of which has been to give
                    greater facilities for their execution, release, or abandonment, to aid their
                    defective execution, and to abolish the old doctrine of illusory
                    appointments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trusts.—</hi> A trust in English law is defined by Mr Lewin,
                    adopting Coke’s definition of a use, as “a confidence reposed in some other, not
                    issuing out of the land, but as a thing collateral, annexed in privity to the
                    estate of the land, and to the person touching the land, for which <hi

                    rend="italic">trust estate</hi> is also used to denote the beneficial interest
                    of the cestui que trust. The term <hi rend="italic">truster</hi> is not used, as
                    it is in Scotland, to denote the creator of the trust. A trust has some features
                    in common with <hi rend="smallcaps">Contract</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi>;
                    but the great difference between them is that a contract can only be enforced by
                    a party or one in the position of a party to it, while a trust can be, and
                    generally is, enforced by one not a party to its creation. It has more
                    resemblance to <hi rend="italic">fideicommissum.</hi> But the latter could only
                    be created by a testamentary instrument, while a trust can be created either by
                    will or <hi rend="italic">inter vivos</hi>; nor was there any trace in Roman law
                    of that permanent legal relation which is suggested by the position of trustee
                    and cestui que trust. The heir, too, in Roman law was entitled, from 70 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> to the reign of Justinian, to one-fourth of a <hi
                    rend="italic">hereditas fideicommissaria</hi> as against the beneficiary, while
                    the very essence of the trust is its gratuitous character. Trusts may be divided
                    in more than one way, according to the ground taken as the basis of division.
                    One division, and perhaps the oldest, as it rests on the authority of Bacon, is
                    into <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> and <hi rend="italic">special,</hi> the first
                    being where the trust is simply vested in a trustee and the nature of the trust
                    left to construction of law, the second where there is an act to be performed by
                    the trustee. Another division is into <hi rend="italic">lawful</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">unlawful,</hi> and corresponds to Bacon’s division into intents or
                    confidences and frauds, covins, or collusions. A third division is into <hi
                    rend="italic">public</hi> and <hi rend="italic">private,</hi> the former being
                    synonymous with charitable trusts. A division often adopted in modern text-books
                    and recognized by parliament in the Trustee Act, 1850, is into <hi rend="italic"
                    >express, implied,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">constructive.</hi> An express
                    trust is determined by the person creating it. It may be either <hi
                    rend="italic">executed</hi> or <hi rend="italic">executory,</hi> the former
                    where the limitations of the equitable interest are complete and final, the
                    latter where such limitations are intended to serve merely as minutes for
                    perfecting the settlement at some future period, as in the case of marriage
                    articles drawn up as a basis of a marriage settlement to be in conformity with
                    them. An implied trust is founded upon the intention of the person creating it;
                    examples of it are a resulting trust, a precatory trust, and the trust held by
                    the vendor on behalf of the purchaser of an estate after contract and before
                    conveyance. In this case the vendor is sometimes called a trustee <hi
                    rend="italic">sub modo</hi> and the purchaser a cestui que trust <hi
                    rend="italic">sub modo.</hi> A constructive trust is judicially created from a
                    consideration of a person’s conduct in order to satisfy the demands of justice,
                    without reference to intention. The distinction between an implied and a
                    constructive trust is not always very consistently maintained. Thus the position
                    of a vendor towards a purchaser after contract is sometimes called a
                    constructive trust. The present law governing trusts rests upon the doctrines of
                    equity as altered by legislation. Its great importance has led to its becoming
                    one of the most highly developed departments of equity. The devolution of
                    successive interests in wills and settlements is almost wholly attained by means
                    of trusts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Who may be a Trustee or Cestui que Trust.—</hi> The modern
                    trust is considerably more extensive in its operation than the ancient use. Thus
                    the crown and corporations aggregate can be trustees, and personalty can be held
                    in trust Provision is made by the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, for the
                    administration of charitable and special trusts by municipal corporations. The
                    crown does not appear to be a trustee to as complete a degree as a subject may
                    be. Unsuccessful attempts have recently been made to impress the crown, or a
                    secretary of state as agent of the crown, with trusts of funds voted by
                    parliament for the public service, of booty of war granted by royal warrant, and
                    of money paid over by a foreign state in pursuance of a treaty. There are
                    certain persons who for obvious reasons, even if not legally disqualified, ought
                    not to be appointed trustees. Such are infants, lunatics, persons domiciled
                    abroad, felons, bankrupts, and <hi rend="italic">cestuis que trustent.</hi> The
                    appointment of any such person, or the falling of any existing trustee into such
                    a position, is generally ground for application to the court for appointment of
                    a new trustee in his place. Any one may be a cestui que trust except a
                    corporation aggregate, which cannot be a cestui que trust of real estate without
                    a licence from the crown.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Creation and Extinction of the Trust.—</hi> A trust may be
                    created either by act of a party or by operation of law. Where a trust is
                    created by act of a party, the creation at common law need not be in writing.
                    The Statute of Frauds (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fraud)</hi> altered the common
                    law by enacting that all declarations or creations of trusts or confidences of
                    any lands, tenements, or hereditaments shall be manifested and proved by some
                    writing, signed by the party who is by law enabled to declare such trust, or by
                    his last will in writing, or else they shall be utterly void and of none effect.
                    Trusts arising or resulting by implication or construction of law are excepted,
                    and it has been held that the statute applies only to real estate and chattels
                    real, so that a trust of personal chattels may still be declared by parol. The
                    declaration of a trust by the crown must be by letters patent. Trusts created by
                    will must conform to the requirements of the Wills Act (see W <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ill).</hi> Except in the case of charitable trusts, the cestui
                    que trust must be a definite person. A trust, for instance, merely for keeping
                    up family tombs is void. Alteration of the trust estate by appointment of a new
                    trustee could up to 1860 only be made where the instrument creating the trust
                    gave a power to so appoint, or by order of the Court of Chancery. But now by the
                    Conveyancing Act, 1881 (superseding Lord St Leonards’s Act of 1860), the
                    surviving or continuing trustee or trustees, or the personal representative of
                    the last surviving or continuing trustee, may nominate in writing a new trustee
                    or new trustees. On such appointment the number of trustees may be increased.
                    Existing trustees may by deed consent to the discharge of a trustee wishing to
                    retire. Trust property may be vested in new or continuing trustees by a simple
                    declaration to that effect. By the Conveyancing Act, 1882, a separate set of
                    trustees may be appointed for any part of the property held on distinct trusts.
                    Trusts created by operation of law are either those which are the effect of the
                    application of rules of equity or those which have been constituted by a
                    judicial authority. They include resulting and constructive trusts. A resulting
                    trust is a species of implied trust, and consists of so much of the equitable
                    interest as is undisposed of by the instrument creating the trust, which is said
                    to result to the creator and his representatives. An example is the purchase of
                    an estate in the. name of the purchaser and others, or of others only. Here the
                    beneficial interest is the purchaser’s. An example of a constructive trust is a
                    renewal of a lease by a trustee in his own name, where the trustee is held to be
                    constructively a trustee for those interested in the beneficial term. An
                    instance of a constructive trust upon which the courts have often been called
                    upon to decide is the fiduciary relation between the promoter of a proposed
                    joint-stock company and the members of the company when formed. The other trusts
                    falling under the head of trusts by operation of law would be those imposed upon
                    a trustee by order of a court, even though they are imposed in pursuance of
                    provisions contained in a trust created by a party. Such would be the trusts
                    which have come within the cognizance of the court by virtue of the Trustee Act,
                    1850, or in any other way. The powers of the court over trusts have been much
                    extended by legislation. The Act of 1850 (13 and 14 Vict. c. 60) enabled the
                    Court of Chancery to appoint new trustees where expedient, and to make vesting
                    orders in many cases where such orders could not previously have been made, as
                    where a trustee was a lunatic, or an infant, or refused to convey. This Act was
                    extended by the Trustee Extension Act, 1852 (15 and 16 Vict. c. 55). By the
                    Conveyancing Act, 1881, a trustee appointed by the Chancery Division is to have
                    the same powers as if he had been originally appointed a trustee by the
                    instrument creating the trust. The Bankruptcy Act, 1883, enables the court to
                    appoint a new trustee in the place of a bankrupt trustee. Besides<pb break="no"

                    validity of the trust that it should be a lawful one. An unlawful trust is one
                    which contravenes the policy of the law in any respect. Examples of such trusts
                    are trusts for a corporation without licence, for a perpetuity, and for purposes
                    subversive of morality, such as trusts for illegitimate children to be hereafter
                    born. Superstitious uses (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Roman Catholic Church,</hi>
                    vol. xx. p. 632) also fall under this head. There are also certain trusts which
                    are avoided by statute under particular circumstances, such as settlements in
                    fraud of creditors (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bankruptcy, Settlement).</hi> The
                    law cannot be evaded by attempting to constitute a secret trust for an unlawful
                    purpose. If an estate be devised by words <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi>
                    carrying the beneficial interest, with an understanding that the devisee will
                    hold the estate in trust for such a purpose, he may be compelled to answer as to
                    the secret trust, and on acknowledgment or proof of it there will be a resulting
                    trust to the heir-at-law. In the case of an advowson suspected to be held for
                    the benefit of a Roman Catholic patron, there is a special enactment to the same
                    effect (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Quare Impedit).</hi> The rales of equity in
                    charitable trusts (which include all those mentioned in the preamble to 43 Eliz.
                    c. 4)<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    full.</p></note> are less strict than those adopted in private trusts.
                    Charitable trusts must be lawful, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> they must not
                    contravene the Statutes of Mortmain; but a wider latitude of construction is
                    allowed in order to carry out the intentions of the founder, and they will not
                    be allowed to fail for want or uncertainty of objects to be benefited. The
                    court, applying the doctrine of <hi rend="italic">cy près,</hi> will, on failure
                    of the original ground of the charity, apply the funds as nearly as possible in
                    the same manner. On this principle gifts originally made for purely charitable
                    purposes have been extended to educational purposes. Further, trustees of a
                    charity may act by a majority, but ordinary trustees cannot by the act of a
                    majority (unless specially empowered so to do) bind a dissenting minority or the
                    trust property. A trust estate is subject as far as possible to the rales of law
                    applicable to a legal estate of a corresponding nature, in pursuance of the
                    maxim, “Equity follows the law.” Thus trust property is assets for payment of
                    debts, may be taken in execution, passes to creditors in bankruptcy, and is
                    subject to dower and curtesy, to the rules against perpetuities, and to the
                    Statutes of Limitation. This assimilation of the legal and equitable estates has
                    been produced partly by judicial decisions, partly by legislation. A trust is
                    extinguished, as it is created, either by act of a party or by operation of law.
                    An example of the former mode of extinction is a release by deed, the general
                    means of discharge of a trustee when the purposes of the trust have been
                    accomplished. Extinction by operation of law takes place when there is a failure
                    of the objects of the trust: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> if the cestui que
                    trust die intestate without heirs or next of kin, the trustee retains the
                    property discharged of the trust if it be real estate, if it be personalty it
                    falls to the crown. Equitable interests in real estate abroad are as a rule
                    subject to the <hi rend="italic">lex loci rei sitae,</hi> and an English court
                    has no jurisdiction to enforce a trust or settle a scheme for the administration
                    of a charity in a foreign country. An English court has, however, jurisdiction
                    to administer the trusts of a will as to the whole real and personal estate of a
                    testator, even though only a very small part of the estate, and that wholly
                    personal, is in England. This was decided by the House of Lords in a well-known
                    case in 1883.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ewing <hi

                    The principal general properties of the office of trustee, as given by Mr Lewin,
                    are these :—(1) A trustee having once accepted the trust cannot afterwards
                    renounce. (2) He cannot delegate it. (3) In the case of co-trustees the office
                    must be exercised by all the trustees jointly. (4) On the death of one trustee
                    there is survivorship: that is, the trust will pass to the survivors or
                    survivor. (5) One trustee shall not be liable for the acts of his co-trustee.
                    (6) A trustee shall derive no personal benefit from the trusteeship. The office
                    cannot be renounced or delegated, because it is one of personal confidence. It
                    can, however, be resigned, and recent legislation, as has been already stated,
                    lias given a retiring trustee large powers of appointing a successor. In the
                    case of the death of a single or last surviving trustee of real estate, the
                    trust estate by the Conveyancing Act, 1881, now devolves upon his personal
                    representative instead of upon his heir or devisee. The liability of one trustee
                    for the acts or defaults of another often raises very difficult questions. A
                    difference is made between trustees and executors. An executor is liable for
                    joining in a receipt <hi rend="italic">pro forma, as</hi> it is not necessary
                    for him to do so, one executor having authority to act without his co-executor;
                    a trustee can show that he only joined for conformity, and that another received
                    the money. A trustee’s receipt in writing is, under the Conveyancing Act, 1881
                    (superseding Lord St Leonards’s Act of 1860), a sufficient discharge, and
                    exonerates the person paying from seeing that the money paid is duly applied
                    according to the trast. If one trustee be cognizant of a breach of trust
                    committed by another, and conceal it or do not take active measures to protect
                    the cestui que trust’s interests, he will be liable for the breach of trust. An
                    indemnity clause is now implied by statute in every trust deed, but this does
                    not protect a trustee against liability which would attach at law. A trustee, if
                    he commit a breach of trust at the request of his cestui que trust, may secure
                    himself by an indemnity, provided that the cestui que trust has been fully
                    informed of the facts of the case, and is not under any disability to consent,
                    such as infancy. The rule that a trustee is not to benefit by his office is
                    subject to some exceptions. He may do so if the instrument creating him trustee
                    specially allows him remuneration, as is usually the case where a solicitor is
                    appointed. Where the trust entirely fails, as has been said above, the trustee
                    is indirectly remunerated by his right to retain the trust estate. The main
                    duties of trustees are to place the trust property in a proper state of
                    security, to keep it (if personalty) in safe custody, and to properly invest and
                    distribute it. A trustee must be careful not to place himself in a position
                    where his interest might clash with his duty. As a rule he cannot safely
                    purchase from his cestui que trust while the fiduciary relation exists between
                    them. In all purchases with trust money he is bound to obtain the best price,
                    unless where an Act of Parliament, like the Housing of the Working Classes Act,
                    1885, specially authorizes sale at an under value. Investments by trustees
                    demand special notice. The general rale is that a trustee must take as much care
                    of the trust property as of his own. He is, therefore, justified in following
                    the usual course of business adopted by prudent men in making investments, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> by employing a stock-broker in the ordinary way. At the
                    same time he has not an uncontrolled power of investment, for (unless authorized
                    by the instrument creating the trust) he cannot lend trust money on personal
                    security or invest in shares of a private company. A trustee of shares may be
                    liable as a beneficial owner, even though his name appears on the register of
                    the company as a trustee. By recent legislation trustees, where not expressly
                    forbidden by the instrument creating the trust, have either an absolute or
                    qualified right to invest in certain securities. They have an absolute right to
                    invest in real securities in the United Kingdom (but not on a second mortgage),
                    in charges or mortgages under the Improvement of Land Act, 1864, in consols,
                    exchequer bills, or any security the interest whereon is guaranteed by
                    parliament, in Bank of England, Bank of Ireland, East India, and Metropolitan
                    Board of Works stock. They have a qualified power of investment (that is, an
                    extension of powers already given in the instrument) in debentures or debenture
                    stock of railway and other companies, and of corporations and local authorities
                    under the Local Loans Act, 1875, in mortgage debentures under the Mortgage
                    Debenture Acts of 1865 and 1870, and in securities of the Isle of Man
                    Government. Trustees under the Settled Land Act, 1882, have somewhat larger
                    powers as to railway stock. In many cases there are restrictions on investment
                    in stock certificates payable to bearer, although in authorized securities. A
                    power of varying investments is generally implied, though not expressly given by
                    statute, as in Scotland. The duties of trustees in the distribution of trust
                    funds have been made less onerous by the Trustee Relief Acts of 1847 and 1849,
                    which enabled trustees or a majority of them to pay into the Bank of England to
                    the account of the particular trust any moneys belonging to the trust, thus
                    bringing the property within the jurisdiction of the court, from which it can
                    only be obtained on petition. Similar powers were conferred upon trustees of
                    charities by 18 and 19 Vict. c. 124. By more recent Acts (22 and 23 Vict. c. 35,
                    23 and 24 Vict. c. 38) application for advice may be made by a trustee to a
                    judge of the Chancery Division on a petition or summons. The liability of a
                    trustee to his cestui que trust on any claim for property held on an express
                    trust or in respect of breach of such trust is not barred by any statute of
                    limitations, 36 and 37 Vict. c. 66, s. 26 (2). The powers of trustees have
                    lately been considerably extended by the Conveyancing Act, 1881, and the Settled
                    Land Act, 1882, in other matters besides those that have been already noticed.
                    One of the most important of the new powers is that of compounding,
                    compromising, or abandoning claims relating to the trust. For the trustee in
                    bankruptcy, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bankruptcy.</hi> The trustee to preserve
                    contingent remainders, at one time common in conveyancing, has ceased to be
                    necessary (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Remainder, Term).</hi> A bare trustee is one
                    to whose office no duties were originally attached, or who, though such duties
                    were attached, would on the requisition of the cestui que trust be compellable
                    to convey the estate to him or by his direction. The term is used in some Acts
                    of Parliament, for instance the Vendor and Purchaser Act, 1874.<note

                    from what has been already said as to the correlative duties and rights of the

                    trust property, to proper accounts, and to enjoyment of the profits. He can as a
                    rule only act with the concurrence of the trustee, unless he seeks a remedy
                    against the trustee himself. Thus the trustee must be a party to an action
                    brought in respect of the trust estate, and must join in presenting a petition
                    in bankruptcy on account of a debt <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0620-0599"/> due to the estate, but the cestui que trust on
                    giving indemnity can require the trustee to lend his name as a party. He may
                    also require the trustee to execute conveyances of the legal estate according to
                    his directions. Trust property, if parted with by the trustee in fraud of the
                    trust may be followed by the cestui que trust, even into the hands of a
                    purchaser for value with notice of the trust. The cestui que trust may lose his
                    rights by fraud, by laches, and by concurrence or acquiescence in a breach of
                    trust. Though no lapse of time bars his remedy against the trustee personally,
                    he cannot, by the terms of the Real Property Limitation Act, 1874, recover land
                    or rent vested in a trustee upon an express trust after twelve years from the
                    time when the right accrued or six years after the cesser of any disability. The
                    equitable right of the cestui que trust has sometimes been recognized by statute
                    in cases where it would be manifestly unjust that he should suffer disability by
                    virtue of his having merely an equitable interest. The cestui que trust has the
                    right of voting for members of parliament, and is qualified to serve as a juror.
                    On bankruptcy of the trustee the trust estate is not affected. Nor was it
                    affected even before the Felony Act, 1870, by the conviction and attainder of
                    the trustee for felony. Attainder of the trustee for treason involved, however,
                    forfeiture of a trust estate of inheritance. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Treason.)</hi> The recognition of the cestui que trust as owner is still not
                    complete. Thus no notice of a trust is recognized in certain public documents,
                    as the books of the Bank of England and the registers kept under the Merchant
                    Shipping Act, 1854, the Companies Act, 1862, the Land Transfer Act, 1875, and
                    the Colonial Stock Act, 1877.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Procedure.—</hi> This is regulated almost entirely by
                    legislation. Proceedings relating to a trust may be brought in different courts
                    of first instance,—(1) the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice or the
                    Chancery Court of the County Palatine of Lancaster, (2) a court of bankruptcy,
                    (3) a county court, (4) a criminal court. (1) By the Judicature Act, 1873, § 34,
                    the execution of trusts, charitable or private, is assigned to the Chancery
                    Division. The rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, provide for special indorsement
                    in an action on a trust, for the parties to the action, for interrogatories and
                    pleading, and for proceeding by originating summons. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Summons. )</hi> Forms of pleading are given in the appendix to the rules. An
                    injunction rather than an action may sometimes be the proper remedy, as in the
                    case of threatened breach of trast. The Trustee Relief Acts, the Trustee Act,
                    and Lord St Leonards’s Act of 1859 provide for proceeding by petition or
                    summons. Applications under the Conveyancing Act must be in chambers in the
                    first instance, and so must applications under the Trustee Relief Acts where the
                    money or securities in court do not exceed £1000 or £1000 nominal value. The
                    procedure in charitable trusts differs to some extent from that in use in
                    private trusts. The most usual course of proceeding is by information in the
                    name of the attorney-general. Another mode is by petition under Sir Samuel
                    Romilly’s Act, 52 Geo. III. c. 101, superseding the cumbrous procedure by
                    commission which had been previously in use under 43 Eliz. c. 4. A third mode is
                    under the powers of the Charitable Trusts Acts, the first of which was passed in
                    1853. No proceeding under these Acts can be taken without the authority of the
                    charity commissioners. (2) The equitable debt due from the trustee to the cestui
                    que trust will support a petition in bankruptcy, and is a debt provable in
                    bankruptcy. An order of discharge in bankruptcy does not release the bankrupt
                    from any debt or liability incurred by means of fraudulent breach of trust, nor
                    does it release a co-trustee of the bankrupt. (3) The County Courts Equitable
                    Jurisdiction Act, 1865, confers on county courts the authority of the High Court
                    in the execution of trusts and proceedings under the Trustee Acts where the
                    trust estate does not exceed £500 in amount or value. By the County Courts Act,
                    1867, applications may be made at chambers for transfer to a county court of an
                    action pending in the High Court where the property does not exceed £500 in
                    amount or value. The same Act allows trust funds not exceeding that limit to be
                    paid into the post office savings bank in a county court town in the name of the
                    registrar. A county court has jurisdiction in charitable trusts where the income
                    of a charity does not exceed £50. The county court rules, 1886, contain orders
                    regulating the practice with respect to both private and charitable trusts.
                    Powers similar to those given to county courts in England have been conferred
                    upon the civil bill courts in Ireland. (4) At common law trustees committing a
                    fraudulent breach of trust could not be punished criminally. This was altered by
                    the Fraudulent Trustees Act of 1857, now superseded by the Larceny Act, 1861,
                    under which a trustee on an express trust, whether public or private, created by
                    deed, will, or instrument in writing, who with intent to defraud converts to his
                    own use or benefit or the use or benefit of any other person than the cestui que
                    trust, or for any purpose other than the public or charitable purpose, or
                    otherwise disposes of or destroys such property or any part thereof, is guilty
                    of misdemeanour and punishable with penal servitude for a term not exceeding
                    seven years. No prosecution is to be commenced without the sanction of the
                    attorneygeneral or—where civil proceedings have been already taken against the
                    trustee—without the sanction of the civil court. The offence cannot be
                    prosecuted at quarter sessions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    law differs considerably from that of England, though perhaps the position of
                    the Scotch trustee is now not very different from that of the trustee in
                    England. The Statute of Uses did not apply to Scotland, since neither that nor
                    any similar legislation was necessary in a system in which law and equity were
                    administered by the same tribunals. Trusts seem to have existed from time
                    immemorial, and have been frequently regulated by statute. The policy of the
                    English Statute of Frauds was no doubt intentionally imitated in the Act 1696,
                    c. 25, enacting that no action of declarator of trust should be sustained as to
                    any deed of trust made for thereafter, except upon a declaration or back-bond of
                    trust lawfully subscribed by the person alleged to be trustee and against whom
                    or his heirs or assignees the declarator should be intended, or unless the same
                    were referred to the oath of the party <hi rend="italic">simpliciter.</hi> The
                    Act does not apply to all cases, but only to those in which by the act of
                    parties documents of title are in the name of a trustee, but the beneficial
                    interest in another. The person creating the trust is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">truster,</hi> a term unknown in England. On the other hand the
                    term <hi rend="italic">cestui que trust</hi> is unknown in Scotland. The office
                    of trustee is <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> gratuitous, as in England, it
                    being considered to fall under the contract of mandate. Some of the main
                    differences between English and Scotch law are these. There is no presumption in
                    Scotland of a resulting trust in favour of a purchaser. A trust which lapses by
                    the failure of a beneficiary goes to the crown as <hi rend="italic">ultimus
                    heres,</hi> not to the trustee. The office of trustee is not a joint office,
                    therefore there is no right of survivorship, and on the death of a trustee the
                    survivors are incompetent to act, unless a certain number be declared or
                    presumed to be a <hi rend="italic">quorum,</hi> or the office be conferred on
                    trustees and the accedors and survivors of them. Sometimes the concurrence of
                    one trustee is rendered absolutely necessary by his being named <hi
                    rend="italic">sine quo non.</hi> The Court of Session may appoint new trustees,
                    but generally appoints a judicial factor. There has been a considerable amount
                    of recent legislation, chiefly in the direction of extending the powers of
                    trustees and of the court, in trust matters. By 24 and 25 Vict. c. 84 (amended
                    by 26 and 27 Vict. c. 115) an appointment of gratuitous trustees by deed or
                    local act was to be held to include certain provisions usually included in deeds
                    of appointment, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> powers of resignation and of
                    assumption of new trustees, and provisions that the majority of trustees
                    accepting and surviving should be a <hi rend="italic">quorum,</hi> and that each
                    trustee should only be liable for his own acts and intromissions and should not
                    be liable for omissions. The Trusts Act, 1867 (30 and 31 Vict. c. 97), added to
                    the common law powers of trustees by giving them authority to appoint factors
                    and law agents, to discharge trustees who have resigned, to grant leases for a
                    limited period, to uplift, discharge, or assign debts, to compromise claims, to
                    grant all necessary deeds, and to pay debts due by the truster or the trust
                    estate. It also gave the Court of Session power (exercisable by the lord
                    ordinary in the first instance) beyond what it possessed by its <hi
                    rend="italic">nobile officium,</hi> in cases of expediency, of selling the trust
                    estate, of granting feus or long leases, and of borrowing and excambion. Power
                    was given to trustees to appoint additional trustees by deed of assumption, and
                    where such assumption could not be made the court might appoint. Authority was
                    conferred upon the beneficiary of a lapsed trust to complete title on petition.
                    The powers of investment given to trustees have since been largely increased by
                    the Trusts Amendment Act, 1884. They are now much the same as those allowed in
                    England. The principal differences are that in Scotland there is a statutory
                    power to vary securities, and that statutory investment by a Scotch trustee is
                    not allowed in Bank of Ireland stock or on real security in Ireland. The Titles
                    to Land Consolidation Act, 1868 (31 and 32 Vict. c. 101), contained provisions
                    as to the mode of completing title by a judicial factor on a trust estate and by
                    trustees in sequestration and as to the vesting in trustees of heritable
                    property conveyed for religious or educational purposes. The Conveyancing Act,
                    1874 (37 and 38 Vict. c. 94), dealt with compositions payable by trustees on the
                    death of a vassal, and with completion of title by the heir of a sole or last
                    surviving trustee, by a successor of an <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi>
                    trustee, and by trustees where words of conveyance are not expressed to be in
                    favour of such trustees. Forms of documents relating to trust property will be
                    found in Juridical Styles and in the schedules to the Acts of 1867, 1868, and
                    1874. A conveyance in trust may be either absolute with a back-bond or in form a
                    conveyance in trast. A trustee is responsible for the due execution of the
                    trust, subject to the limitations contained in 24 and 25 Vict. c. 84. The
                    provision of the Companies Act, 1862, that no trust is to be entered on the <pb

                    a member of a joint-stock company, though entered on the register as a trust
                    disponee, may incur personal liability as a partner, unless the contrary be
                    expressed. Liability under such circumstances was established in the litigation
                    which followed the suspension of the City of Glasgow Bank in 1878.<note

                    £1000 in value (40 and 41 Vict. c. 50). A judicial factor may be appointed by
                    the sheriff court where the yearly value of the estate does not exceed £100 (43
                    and 44 Vict. c. 4). Fraudulent trustees are criminally liable at common law, not
                    by statutory enactment, as in England. Adjudication on a trust bond is a mode of
                    obtaining the decision of the Court of Session on a bond by a fictitious
                    creditor, for the purpose of giving title to the heir, by preventing his
                    liability to possible passive representation. It is regulated by 1695, c.
                    24.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See G. J. Bell, <hi

                    States.—</hi> In New York and some other States uses and trusts have been
                    abolished (with certain exceptions), and every estate, subject to those
                    exceptions, is deemed a legal right cognizable in courts of law. The exceptions
                    are in New York implied trusts and express trusts to sell land for the benefit
                    of creditors, to sell, mortgage, or lease lands for the benefit of legatees, or
                    for the purpose of satisfying any charge thereon, to receive the rents and
                    profits of lands and apply them to the use of any person during the life of such
                    person or any shorter term, or to receive such rents and profits, and accumulate
                    the same within the limits allowed by the law. Trusts of personalty for public
                    purposes are very generally allowed in States where private trusts do not exist.
                    Provisions similar to those of the English Statute of Frauds have been generally
                    adopted by the States which recognize private trusts. Some States go further
                    than the statute and allow the creation of trusts (other than those arising by
                    implication or operation of law) only by means of will or deed. Where the trust
                    is of real estate, the deed must generally be registered (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Registration).</hi> Forms of deeds of trust are given in the
                    Statutes of Virginia and other States. The English doctrine of <hi rend="italic"
                    >cy près</hi> seems to have been adopted only in Pennsylvania. Conveyances in
                    trust for the settlor are generally void against creditors by the policy of the
                    Acts of Elizabeth. By the legislation of some States a freehold may commence <hi
                    rend="italic">in futuro</hi> without the operation of the Statute of Uses.
                    Societies of professional trustees, receiving a percentage of the income of the
                    property as payment for their trouble and liability, are frequently recognized
                    by law. Such societies are generally under an obligation to make periodical
                    returns of their receipts and expenditure. A public trustee as a corporation
                    sole exists in some States. Trustee process in the New England States is what is
                    generally known as garnishee process in England, that is, a means of reaching
                    property and credits of a debtor in the hands of third persons for the benefit
                    of an attaching creditor.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
