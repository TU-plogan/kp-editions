                    served with Pompey in the war against Sertorius, and received through the
                    influence of that general the Roman citizenship; hence the name Pompeius, which
                    was adopted as a token of gratitude to the benefactor. The father of Trogus was
                    an officer of Caesar. Trogus himself seems to have been a man of encyclopaedic
                    knowledge. He wrote, after Aristotle and Theophrastus, books on the natural
                    history of animals and plants, used by the elder Pliny, who calls Trogus “one of
                    the most precise among authorities” <hi rend="italic">(auctor ipse e
                    severissimis).</hi> But the principal work of Trogus consisted of forty-four <hi
                    rend="italic">Libri Historiarum Philippicarum.</hi> This was a great history of
                    the world, or rather of those portions of it which came under the sway of
                    Alexander and his successors. The tale began with Ninus, the founder of Nineveh,
                    and ceased at about the same point as Livy’s great work, viz., 9 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The last event recorded by the epitomator <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Justin</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> is the recovery of the
                    Roman standards captured by the Parthians (20 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi>
                    The history of Rome was treated as merely subsidiary to that of Greece and the
                    East. The work was based upon the writings of Greek historians, such as
                    Theopompus, Ephorus, Timaeus, Polybius. It has been contended that Trogus did
                    not gather together the information from the leading Greek historians for
                    himself, but that it was already combined into a single book by some Greek, whom
                    Trogus followed closely with some superficial errors. But the assumption appears
                    improbable in itself, merely on a review of the remains of the historical
                    writings, and is moreover inconsistent with what we know of the works in natural
                    history, for which Trogus certainly went back to what were regarded in his time
                    as first-hand authorities. It is generally admitted that Trogus had genuine
                    qualifications for writing history, though he could not rid himself entirely of
                    the faults of his authorities. His idea of history was more severe and less
                    rhetorical than that followed by Sallust and Livy, whom he blamed for putting
                    elaborate speeches in the mouths of the characters of whom they wrote. Yet his
                    own Latin style had a vivid force which is still to be recognized in the
                    extracts made by Justin. For the ancient history of the East, Trogus, even in
                    the present mutilated state of his historical work, often proves to be an
                    authority of great importance.</p>

                    Perhaps the most important is that of A. V. Gutschmid on the sources of the
