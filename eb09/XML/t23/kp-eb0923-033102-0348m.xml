                    also, of course, includes the various “exclaves” of Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria,
                    and Bohemia which lie embedded among them.</p></note> The name is derived, with
                    great probability, from that of the Hermunduri, a branch of the great Suevic
                    family; and the ancient Thuringians, a heathen tribe first mentioned in the 5th
                    century by Vegetius Renatus, are believed to be the descendants of that Teutonic
                    people. The Thuringians seem at one time to have occupied territories stretching
                    from the Elbe not far from Hamburg to the Danube at Ratisbon; but about 531
                    their empire was overthrown by the united Franks and Saxons. The north part of
                    their lands fell to the Saxons, and was known for some time as the North
                    Thuringian gau; the district to the south of the Thuringian Forest was called
                    Franconia after its conquerors; and the name Thuringia was restricted almost to
                    the narrow limits to which it now properly applies. The advance of the Sorbs to
                    the east bank of the Saale about the middle of the 7 th century made the
                    limitation still more exact. Thuringia remained under Frankish dominion, and
                    various Frankish counts ruled in the different “gaus” into which it was divided.
                    Christianity, if not introduced, was confirmed in this district by the British
                    Boniface; a <pb break="no"

                    Charlemagne the Thuringian mark was the base of active operations against the
                    heathen Sorbs. In 839 the title of duke of Thuringia <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ducatus</hi><hi rend="italic">Toñngubae)</hi> appears; but that of landgrave
                    seems to have superseded it; neither dignity implied sovereignty over the whole
                    district. Otto the Illustrious, duke of Saxony (880), added Thuringia to his
                    duchy, but the union was not permanent. About the beginning of the 12th century
                    Louis the Springer, builder of the Wartburg, rose to eminence among the
                    Thuringian nobles; and about 1130 his son, also Louis, was appointed landgrave
                    by the emperor Lothair I. Thuringia now began to be a united land under one
                    prince; and the landgraves, who acquired the Saxon palatinate on the fall of
                    Henry the Lion of Saxony in 1180, rose to considerable power. The last landgrave
                    of this line was Henry Raspe (1242-1247), brother and successor of Louis the
                    Saint. His death was followed by a devastating war of succession between his
                    niece Sophia, duchess of Brabant, and Henry the Illustrions, margrave of Meissen
                    (1221-1288), whose mother Jutta was a Thuringian princess. Peace was finally
                    established in 1263: Sophia received Hesse, and Henry took the rest of
                    Thuringia, the general history of which thenceforth merged in that cf Meissen,
                    and later of Saxony, although it maintained its separate name. Thuringia was
                    included in the administrative circle of Upper Saxony (see vol. xxi. p. 352,
                    note 3). For its subsequent fate, and the rise of the present Thuringian states,

                <p>The most striking natural feature of Thuringia is the Thuringian Forest (<hi
                    rend="italic">ThüringerweM),</hi> a range or system of hills, extending in an
                    irregular line from the neighbourhood of Eisenach in the northwest to the
                    Lobensteiner Kulm on the Bavarian frontier on the south-east, and forming the
                    southern boundary of Thuringia, separating it from Franconia. On the south-east
                    it is continued directly by the Frankenwald Mountains to the Fichtelgebirge,
                    which is in immediate connexion with the Erzgebirge, while on the north-east it
                    approaches the Harz Mountains, and thus takes its place in the great Sudetic
                    chain of central Germany. The length of the Thuringian chain is 70 miles, and
                    its breadth varies from 8 to 25 miles. It nowhere rises into peaks, and only a
                    few of its rounded summits reach the height of 3000 feet; the successive hills
                    melt into each other in gentle undulations, forming a continuous and easily
                    traced comb, and only the north-west slopes are precipitous, and seamed with
                    winding gorges. This mountainrange encloses many charming and romantic valleys
                    and glens; the most prominent feature of its picturesque scenery is formed by
                    the fine forests, chiefly of pines and firs, which clothe most of the hills. The
                    north-west part of the system is the loftier and the more densely wooded, as
                    well as the more beautiful; the highest summits here are the Grosser Beerberg
                    (3225 feet), Schneekopf (3179), and the Inselberg (2957), all in the duchy of
                    Gotha. The southeast part of the Thuringian Forest is the more populous and
                    industrial; the chief summits are the Kieferle (2851 feet) at Stein-heid, the
                    Blessberg (2834 feet) near Schalkau, the Wurzelberg (2746 feet) near Oelze, and
                    the Wetzstein (2719) near Lehesten. The crest of the Thuringian Forest, from the
                    Werra to the Saale, is traversed by the Rennsteig or Rainsteig, a broad path of
                    unknown antiquity, though it is believed to be referred to in a letter of Pope
                    Gregory III. dated 738. The name means probably “frontierpath”; and the path
                    marks in fact the boundary between Thuringia and Franconia. It may be also
                    regarded as part of the boundaryline between North and South Germany, for
                    dialect, customs, local names and costume are different on the two sides.</p>
