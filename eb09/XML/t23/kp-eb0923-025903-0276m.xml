                    sixth book of his <hi rend="italic">⅜υνaγωγη,</hi> speaks of this collection,
                    the study of which is indispensable to any one who would master the science of
                    astronomy (τov <hi rend="italic">aστpονομουμeνον</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >τόπον).</hi> These writings, which were highly esteemed in the school of
                    Alexandria, were intermediate between the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> of
                    Euclid and the <hi rend="italic">Almagest</hi> of Ptolemy, for the understanding
                    of which, indeed, they formed an indispensable introduction. Of the life of
                    Theodosius nothing is known. As to the time when he lived different opinions
                    have been held, he being placed by some in the first century before and by
                    others in the second century after the Christian era. The latter opinion is
                    founded on an error of Suidas (s.v.), who on the one hand identifies the author
                    of the three works referred to above with a sceptical philosopher of the same
                    name who lived at the time of Trajan or later, and on the other hand
                    distinguishes him from a native of Tripolis who wrote a poem on spring. It is
                    now generally admitted that the subject of this article is the same as
                    Theodosius the mathematician, who is mentioned by Strabo amongst the natives of
                    Bithynia distinguished for their learning, and whose sons were also
                    mathematicians, the same, too, as the inventor of a universal sun-dial <hi
                    rend="italic">{forologium</hi><hi rend="italic">πρός παν κλίμα)</hi> of that
                    name who is praised by Vitruvius <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Architectura,</hi> ix. 9). His date, therefore, could not have been later than
                    the 1st century B.c.; he may, however, have lived in the preceding century,
                    inasmuch as the names mentioned by Strabo in the passage referred to above are,
                    as far as we know, arranged chronologically, and Theodosius immediately follows
                    Hipparchus, who made astronomical observations between 161 and 126 B.C., and
                    precedes Asclepiades the physician, who lived at Rome at the beginning of the
                    1st century B.c.</p>
                <p>The statement that he was “of Tripolis” is made, not on the authority of Suidas,
                    as has been erroneously said, but because he is so described in the title of his
                    principal work. ' It is probable, therefore, that he was a native of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n277/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0277-0260"/> Bithynia, and resided at Tripolis, -where he
                    wrote his work. Tripolis is generally taken to be the city of that name on the
                    Phoenician coast, but it may have been a town of the same name in Lydia, on the
                    Meander.</p>
                <p>His chief work— <hi rend="italic">Σφαιρικά,</hi> in three books—treats of the
                    properties of the sphere and its sections, with the object of establishing the
                    geometrical principles of spherical astronomy. This work, which is classical, is
                    distinguished for the order and clearness of the exposition as well as for the
                    rigour of its proofs, and has ever since formed the basis on which the subject
                    of spherical geometry has been treated. It does not contain any trace of
                    spherical trigonometry, which, on the other hand, was the special subject of the
                    work having the same title, and included in the same collection, of Menelaus of
                    Alexandria, who lived at the end of the 1st century.</p>
                <p>Montucla suspected that a great part of the three books of Theodosius must have
                    been known before his time, and that he merely did with respect to this branch
                    of geometry what Euclid had done with the elements, namely, he collected and
                    incorporated in his work the different propositions found before his time by
                    astronomers and geometers. This conjecture of Montucla has been confirmed by A.
                    Nokk <hi rend="italic">(Ueber die Sphärik des Theodosius,</hi> Karlsruhe, 1847),
                    by Heiberg <hi rend="italic">(Litterargeschichtliche</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Studien über Euklid,</hi> pp. 43 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> Leipsic, 1882),
                    and by Hultsch, from whose researches, and especially owing to the publication
                    by the last of the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of Autolycus, it is
                    now quite certain that as early as the middle of the 4th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> there existed a Greek text-book on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spherics</hi> which, in its essential contents, scarcely deviated from the
                    three books of Theodosius. He must therefore be regarded as merely the editor,
                    or at most the elaborator and expounder, of a doctrine which existed some
                    centuries before him.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Spherics of</hi> Theodosius was translated into Arabic at
                    the beginning of the 10th century, and from the Arabic into Latin in the 12th
                    century by Plato of Tivoli (Tiburtinus). This translation was published in 1518
                    at Venice, but was found so faulty by J. Voegelinus that he published a new
                    Latin version, together with additions from the Arabian commentators, Vienna,
                    1529, 4to; other Latin translations were published by F. Maurolycus, Messina,
                    1558, fol.; by C. Clavius, Rome, 1586, 4to; and by Barrow under the title,

                    rend="italic">Nova</hi><hi rend="italic">Illustrata</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    Succincte</hi><hi rend="italic">Demonstrata,</hi> London, 1675,4to. The Greek
                    text was first published, and with it a Latin translation, by J. Pena, Paris,
                    1558, 4to; it has been edited since by Joseph Hunt, oxford, 1707, and by E.
                    Nizze, Berlin, 1852, but these two editions are founded on that of Pena. There
                    is also a German translation by Nizze, Stralsund, 1826. His two editions are
                    accompanied with valuable notes and an appendix containing additions from
                    Voegelinus and others.</p>
                <p>The two other works of Theodosius which have come down to us have not as yet been
                    published in the original. The propositions, without demonstrations, in the work
                    <hi rend="italic">πepi ημepωv</hi> καi <hi rend="italic">νυκτών</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(On Days and Nights),</hi> in two books, were given by Dasypodius,
                    in Greek and Latin, in his <hi rend="italic">Sphaemcae Doctrinae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Propositiones,</hi> Strasburg, 1572, 8vo. A Latin version of the
                    complete work, with ancient <hi rend="italic">scholia</hi> and figures, was
                    given by Joseph Auria, Rome, 1591, 4to. Pappus has given a pretty full
                    commentary on the first book of this work of Theodosius. His work wepì <hi
                    rend="italic">olκησe&lt;ΛV (On Habitations)</hi> also was published by Auria,
                    Rome, 1588. It gives an account of how, for every inhabitant of the earth from
                    the equator.to the pole, the starry firmament presents itself in the course of a
                    year. The propositions in it were also given by Dasypodius in his work mentioned
                    above.</p>
