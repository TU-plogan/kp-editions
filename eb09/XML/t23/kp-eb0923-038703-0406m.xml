                    clay.</p></note><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In the most important temples of
                    ancient Greece the roof was covered with tiles of white marble, fitted together
                    in the most perfect way so as to exclude the rain. In most cases, as in the
                    Athenian Parthenon and the existing temple at Aegina, the tiles were large slabs
                    of marble, with a flange along each side, over which joint-tiles (<hi
                    rend="italic">ἁρμοἰ</hi>) were accurately fitted (see A in fig. 1). In the
                    temple of Apollo at Bassae, though the main building was of limestone, the roof
                    was covered with very beautiful tiles of Parian marble, which are specially
                    mentioned by Pausanias as being one of the chief beauties of the temple. Some of
                    these were found by Mr Cockerell during his excavations at Bassae early in the
                    19th century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    worked out of the same slab of marble as the adjacent tiles (see B in fig. 1),
                    at a great additional cost of both material and labour, in order to secure a
                    more perfect fit. Fig. 2</p>
                <p>shows the way in which they were set on the roof. Great splendour of effect must
                    have been gained by continuing the gleaming white of the columns and walls on to
                    the roof. All along the eaves each end of a row of joint-tiles was usually
                    covered by an <hi rend="italic">antefixa,</hi> an oval-topped piece of marble
                    with honeysuckle or some other conventional pattern carved in relief.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Marble tiles are said to have
                    been first made by Byzes of Naxos about 620 B.c.; see Pausanias, v. 10,
                    2.</p></note> In most cases the Greeks used terra-cotta roofing tiles, shaped
                    like the marble ones of fig. 1, A. Others were without a flange, being formed
                    with a concave upper surface to prevent the rain getting under the joint-tiles.
                    The lower edge of the tile, whether of marble or of clay, was usually
                    half-lapped and fitted into a corresponding rebate in the upper edge of the next
                    tile (see D in fig. 1). The <hi rend="italic">αρμοί</hi> also were half-lapped
                    at the joints (see E in fig. 1). All these were usually fastened with bronze
                    nails to the rafters of the roof. In some cases each joint-tile had a projecting
                    peg to fix it to the next <hi rend="italic">αρμός,</hi> as shown at F. In the
                    temples of imperial Rome marble roofing tiles were used like those shown at fig.
                    1. These were copied from the Greeks along with most other architectural
                    features. For domestic and other less important work clay tiles <hi
                    rend="italic">(tegulae)</hi> were employed, of the form shown in A, fig. 3.
                    These are narrower at the lower edge, so as to fit in to the upper edge of the
                    next tile, and the joints were covered with a semicircular joint-tile <hi
                    rend="italic">(imbrex).</hi> Rows of terra-cotta antefixae were set along the
                    eaves of the roof, and were often moulded with very beautiful reliefs. In
                    localities which supplied laminated stone, such as Gloucestershire and Hampshire
                    in</p>
                <p>Britain, the Romans often roofed their buildings with stone tiles, fastened with
                    iron nails. Fig. 3, B, shows an .example from a Roman villa at Fifehead Neville
                    in Dorset, England. Each slab had a lap of about 2 inches over the row of tiles
                    below it; many large iron nails were found with these stone tiles. In a few
                    cases, in the most magnificent temples of ancient Rome, as in those of
                    Capitoline Jupiter and of Venus and Rome, and also the small circular temple of
                    Vesta,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The dome of the

                    used, which must have had the most magnificent effect. Those of the last-named

                    7) as having been made of Syracusan bronze,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of a pointed oval form, something like the feathers of a bird. This kind of

                    The bronze tiles from the temples of Jupiter Capitolinus and of Venus and Rome
                    were taken by Pope Honorius I. (625-638) to cover the basilica of St Peter,
                    whence they were stolen by the Saracens during their invasion of the Leonine

                    of Europe; but in more ordinary work clay tiles of very simple form were
                    employed. One variety, still very common in Italy, is shown in C, fig. 3. In
                    this form of so-called “pan-tile” each tile has a double curve, forming a tegula
                    and imbrex both in one. Stone tiles were also very common throughout the Middle
                    Ages. Another kind of roofing tile, largely used in pre-Norman times and for
                    some centuries later for certain purposes, was made of thin pieces of split
                    wood, generally oak; these are called “shingles.” They stand the weather fairly
                    well, and many old examples still exist, especially on the wooden towers and
                    spires of East Anglia. At the present day, when slate is not used, tiles of
                    burnt clay are the ordinary roofing material, and many complicated forms have
                    been invented to exclude rain. Most of these are, however, costly and do not
                    answer better than a plain rectangular tile about 9 by 6 inches, fastened with
                    two copper or even stout zinc nails, and well bedded on mortar mixed with hair.
                    For additional security clay tiles are usually made with two small projections
                    at the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n408/mode/1up"

                    they are nailed. Broseley (Shropshire) is one of the chief places in England for
                    the manufacture of roofing tiles of the better sort. The common kinds are made
                    wherever good clay exists. In some places pan-tiles are still used and have a
                    very picturesque effect; but they are liable to let in the rain, as they cannot
                    be securely nailed or well bedded in mortar. In Gloucestershire, Yorkshire, and
                    other counties of England, stone tiles are still employed, but are rapidly going
                    out of use, as they require very strong roof-timbers to support them, and the
                    great extension of railways has made the common purple slates cheap in nearly
                    every district.</p>
                <p>Some of the mosques and palaces of Persia are roofed with the most magnificent
                    enamelled lustred tiles, decorated with elaborate painting, so that they shine
                    like gold in the sun. They were specially used from the 13th to the 15th
                    century. In style and method of manufacture the finest of them resemble the
                    frieze shown in fig. 5.</p>

                    most Oriental countries tiles were used in the most magnificent way throughout
                    the Middle Ages, especially in Damascus, Cairo, Moorish Spain, and in the chief
                    towns of Persia.</p>
                <p>Fig. 4 shows a fine example from a mosque in Damascus. From the 12 th to the 16th
                    century a special kind of lustred tile was largely employed for dadoes, friezes,
                    and other wall surfaces, being frequently made in large slabs and modelled
                    boldly in relief, with sentences from sacred books or the names and dates of
                    reigning caliphs. The whole was picked out in colour, usually dark or turquoise
                    blue, on a ground of cream-white enamel, and in the last firing minute ornaments
                    in copper lustre were added over the whole design, giving the utmost splendour
                    of effect (see fig. 5). Great skill and taste are shown by the way in which the
                    delicate painted enrichments are made to contrast with the bold decoration in
                    relief. These lustred tiles sometimes line the prayer-niche in houses and
                    mosques; in such cases the slabs usually have a conventional representation of
                    the kaaba at Mecca, with a lamp hanging in front of it and a border of sentences
                    from the Koran.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    specially rich in this method of decoration, magnificent examples existing at

                    rich examples still exist in Seville. These appear to be the work of Italian
                    potters who had settled in Spain. The <hi rend="italic">azulejos</hi> (wall

                    tiles in most northern countries of Europe were made by filling up with clay of
                    a different colour patterns sunk in slabs of clay (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Encaustic Tiles).</hi> In Italy, during the latter part of the 15th and the
                    first half of the 16th century, majolica tiles, rich both in pattern and in
                    colour, were used for pavements in many places. Comparatively few examples now
                    exist; the majolica enamel was too soft to stand the wear of feet. One of the
                    small south chapels in the church of S. Maria del Popolo in Rome has a very fine
                    pavement of these tiles, executed, probably at Forlì, about 1480 for Cardinal
                    della Rovere (Julius IL), whose arms—an oak tree—are repeated frequently among
                    the rich decorations. A still more magnificent tile floor in the uppermost of
                    Raphael’s Vatican loggie is mentioned under <hi rend="smallcaps">Robbia</hi>
                    (vol. xx. p. 591). The same article (p. 589) describes the exquisite majolica
                    tiles which Luca della</p>
                <p>Robbia made as a border for the tomb of Bishop Federighi at Florence. Fine
                    examples of tile paving of 1487 exist in the basilica of S. Petronio at Bologna,
                    and others of <pb break="no"

                    chapel of St Catherine at Siena and the church of S. Sebastiano at Venice have
                    majolica paving of about 1510. Fig. 6 shows an example of about this date from
                    the Petrucci Palace in Siena, now in the South Kensington Museum.<note

                    though much worn, a fine pavement of Spanish tiles dating from about 1520.
                    Others have been found in London, at Newington Butts, and in other places. At
                    the present time imitations of the unfortunately named “encaustic tiles” are
                    almost the only sort employed in England and other northern countries. Very
                    coarse and poorly designed majolica tiles are still made and used for paving in
