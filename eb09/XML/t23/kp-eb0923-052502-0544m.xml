                    most picturesque portions of southern India. Its most marked physical feature is
                    furnished by the Western Gháts, which rise to an elevation of 8000 feet and are
                    clothed with magnificent primeval forest; they throw out spurs towards the
                    coast, along which there is a belt of flat country of about 10 miles in width,
                    covered with an almost unbroken mass of cocoa-nut and areca palms, which to a
                    great extent constitute the wealth of the country. The whole surface is
                    undulating, and presents a series of hills and valleys traversed from east to
                    west by many rivers, the floods of which, arrested by the peculiar action of the
                    Arabian Sea on the coast, spread themselves out into lagoons or backwaters,
                    connected here and there by artificial canals, and forming an inland line of
                    smooth-water communication for nearly the whole length of the coast. The chief
                    river is the Periyár, which is navigable for 60 miles; other important rivers
                    are the Pámbai and its tributary the Achinkoil, the Kallada, and the Western
                    Tàmbraparni. Iron is abundant. Elephants are numerous, and tigers, leopards,
                    bears, bison, elk, and various kinds of deer abound in the forests. The state
                    possesses some good roads, and, on the whole, internal communication is
                    tolerably complete. Travancore has an abundant rainfall, with every variety of
                    climate and temperature.</p>
                <p>In 1881 the population of Travancore was found to number 2,401,158 (males
                    1,197,134, females 1,204,024), of whom 1,755,610 were Hindus, 146,909
                    Mohammedans, and 498,542 Christians. The chief towns are <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Trivandrum</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> the capital, Aleppi, the
                    commercial centre and chief seaport of the state, and Quilon, another seaport
                    and military headquarters. Among the principal articles which the state produces
                    are rice, cocoa-nut palm, pepper, areca-nut, cardamoms, tamarind, coffee,
                    timber, &amp;c. The manufactures comprise cocoa-nut, gingelly, lemon-grass, and
                    laurel oils, jaggery and molasses, salt, arrack, cotton cloths and yarns,
                    pottery, and coir yarn, rope, and matting. Its revenue in 1884-85 was estimated
                    at £640,548. Travancore state is in subsidiary alliance with the British
                    Government, to which it pays a tribute of £80,000 a year. It is one of the few
                    states which have never turned against the British. Under the enlightened rule
                    of the late maharajah the country made great progress, and it now stands very
                    high among native states. It is free from debt, and has a surplus of revenue
                    over expenditure. The sovereignty as well as the inheritance of property passes
                    in the female line.</p>
