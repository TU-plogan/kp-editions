                            published in 1883.</p></note> = 48 Ό8, 0=16), designates in chemistry a
                    relatively rare element, which is customarily classed with the metals, although
                    it comes nearer in its character to silicon than to any of the ordinary metals.
                    Its discovery as an element was due to William Gregor, who found in the mineral
                    menaccanite a new earth, which was regarded as the oxide of a new metal,
                    menachin. Independently of him Klaproth in 1793 discovered a new metal in rutile
                    and called it titanium; he subsequently found that it was identical with
                    Gregor’s element. The latter name was, however, retained. Titanium, although
                    pretty widely diffused throughout the mineral kingdom, is not found, in
                    abundance. The commonest titanium mineral is rutile (TiO <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi>); anatase and brookite, though mineralogically different from rutile
                    and each other, are forms of the same binoxide.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metallic titanium</hi> is little known. In 1822 Wollaston
                    examined a specimen of those beautiful copper-like crystals which are
                    occasionally met with in iron-furnace slags, and declared them to be metallic
                    titanium. This view had currency until 1849, when Wohler showed that the
                    crystals are a compound, Ti(NC) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> +3Ti <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, of a cyanide and a
                    nitride of the metal. Real titanium was made by Wohler and Deville in 1857 by
                    heating to redness fluo-titanate of potassium (see below) in vapour of sodium in
                    an atmosphere of dry hydrogen, and extracting the alkaline fluoride formed by
                    water. The metal thus produced had the appearance of iron as obtained by the
                    reduction of its oxide in hydrogen. When heated in air, it bums brilliantly,
                    with the formation of binoxide. Its most curi ous property is the readiness with
                    which it unites with nitrogen gas into a nitride. The exact composition of this
                    nitride is not known; but when heated in hydrogen it loses part of its nitrogen
                    as ammonia, and becomes Ti <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> N <hi rend="subscript">
                        6</hi>, a metallic-looking yellow solid, and this when heated in nitrogen
                    gas passes into higher nitrides, which are again available for the production of
                    ammonia. Tessié du Mothay in 1872 proposed to utilize these reactions for the
                    production of ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen. Of other titanium compounds the
                    most important are those formed on the type of TiX <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>,

                <p><hi rend="italic">The binoxide TiO2</hi> exists as rutile. One method of
                    preparing a; urer oxide from the mineral is to fuse it, very finely powdered,
                    with six times its weight of bisulphate of potash in platinum, then extract the
                    fuse with cold water, and boil the filtered solution for a long time. Titanic
                    oxide separates out as a white hydrate, which, however, is generally
                    contaminated with ferric hydrate and often with oxide of tin, SnO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, A better method is Wohler’s. He fuses the finely
                    powdered mineral with twice its weight of carbonate of potash in a platinum
                    crucible, pounds the fuse, and treats it in a platinum basin with aqueous
                    hydrofluoric acid. The alkaline titanate first produced is converted into
                    crystalline fluo-titanate, TiF <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> K <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which is with difficulty soluble, and is extracted
                    with hot water and filtered off. The filtrate, which may be collected in glass
                    vessels if an excess of hydrofluoric acid lias been avoided, deposits the
                    greater part of the salt on cooling. The crystals are collected, ivashed,
                    pressed, and recrystallized, whereby the impurities are easily removed. The pure
                    salt is dissolved in hot water and decomposed with ammonia to produce a slightly
                    ammoniacal hydrated oxide; this, when ignited in platinum, leaves pure TiO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> s</hi> in the form of brownish lumps, the specific gravity
                    of which varies from 3 ’ 9 to 4 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 25, according to
                    the temperature at which it was kept in igniting. The more intense the heat the
                    denser the product. The oxide is fusible only in the oxy-hydrogen flame. It is
                    insoluble in all acids, except in hot concentrated sulphuric, when finely
                    powdered. Supposing the excess of vitriol to have been boiled away, the residue,
                    after cooling, dissolves in cold water. The solution, if boiled, deposits its
                    titanic oxide as a hydrate called meta-titanic acid, because it differs in its
                    properties from ortho-titanic acid, obtained by decomposing a solution of the
                    chloride in cold water with alkalies. The ortho-body dissolves in cold dilute
                    acids; the meta-body does not. If titanic oxide is fused with excess of alkaline
                    carbonate it expels C0 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> parts of carbonic acid for
                    TiO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> parts of itself. The salt R <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> OTiO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is decomposed by
                    water with the formation of a solution of alkali free of titanium, and a residue
                    of an acid titanate, which is insoluble in water but soluble in cold aqueous
                    mineral acids.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The chloride TiCl</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> is
                    obtained as a distillate by heating to dull redness an intimate dry mixture of
                    the binoxide and ignited lampblack in dry chlorine. The reaction may be carried
                    out in a hard glass tube. For methods of purification we refer to the handbooks
                    of chemistry. The pure chloride is a colourless liquid of 1 <hi

                    mm. pressure (T. E. Thorpe). It fumes strongly in moist air. When dropped very
                    cautiously into cold water it dissolves into a clear solution, which, however,
                    when boiled, deposits most of its oxide in the meta-hydrate form. There are, at
                    least, two lower chlorides of titanium,—one of the composition Ti <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> and another of the
                    composition TiCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, both solids and both extremely
                    prone to pass into titanic compounds. A solution of the tetrachloride in water,
                    as well as of the soluble hydroxide in dilute acid generally, when kept in
                    contact with metallic zinc, is reduced to one of the lower chlorides with
                    development of a violet colour. With regard to the detection of titanium we need
                    not add much to what we have already given incidentally. Acid solutions of TiO
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> are not precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen;
                    but sulphide of ammonium acts on them as if it were ammonia, the H <hi

                    flame yields a bead which is yellowish in the heat but colourless after cooling.
                    In the reducing flame the bead becomes violet, more readily on the addition of
                    tin; in the presence of iron it becomes blood-red. Titanic oxides when fused on
                    charcoal, even with cyanide of potassium, yield no metal.</p>
