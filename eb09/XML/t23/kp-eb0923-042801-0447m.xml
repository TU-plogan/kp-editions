                    between the Kara Sea on the west and the Bay of the Ob; this last penetrates
                    into the continent for more than 550 miles, with a width of from 60 to 70 miles,
                    and receives another long and wide outlet—the bay of the Taz (Tazovskaya).
                    Another wide bay of the Kara Sea—the Baidaratsk, or Kara Bay—runs up into the
                    Yatmat peninsula from the north-west. The islands belonging to the government
                    are few; Byelyi, at the extremity of Yatmat, and a few small ones along the west
                    coast of the peninsula, as also in the Obi Bay, are for the most part ice-bound.
                    This extensive province occupies the greater part of the lowlands of
                    north-western Asia, which extend eastward from the Urals, and only in the far
                    north does it include the eastern slopes of these mountains. The Pai-ho
                    coast-ridge only touches Tobolsk with its southeastern extremity. The Urals
                    proper, which run southwest from the Kara Sea as far as to the Tell-pöss group
                    (5540 feet), and thence take a southerly direction, form the boundary between
                    Tobolsk and Vologda as far as the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0448-0429"/> sources of the Petchora (61° 30' N. lat.), but
                    farther south their eastern slopes are included in the Russian government of
                    Perm, and only their lowest spurs, 200 miles from the main ridge, belong to
                    Tobolsk. The average height of the northern Urals is about 3000 feet, and
                    several of their summits range from 3300 to 4000 and even 4370 feet (Net-yu, in
                    68° N. lat.). The remainder of the government is of lowland character, hardly at
                    any point rising above the sea by more than a few hundred feet, but these
                    lowlands vary greatly in their different parts. They assume the character of
                    grassy steppes or prairies in the south, of immense marshes sparsely covered
                    with forest in the north, and of treeless tundras as the shores of the Arctic
                    Ocean are approached. The southern steppes, in their turn, may be subdivided
                    into two distinct portions,—the Tobot and Ishim steppe in the west, and the
                    Baraba in the east. The former, nearly 43,000 square miles in area, is one of
                    the most fertile parts of the empire. One-third is under forest, and the
                    remainder has a soil of very fertile black earth, which has the further
                    advantage of being sufficiently watered. The climate, indeed, is very severe,
                    the mean annual temperature (30° to 34° F.) being such as is found only in the
                    north of Sweden and in Archangel; but the warm summer (65° to 68° in July) and
                    the amount of light received from a bright sky combine to make vegetation
                    develop with a rapidity quite unknown to western Europe. This region now has a
                    population of more than 800,000, almost all Russians (only 14,000 aborigines),
                    so that it may be said to be more thoroughly Russian than the Volga provinces.
                    The area under crops every year is 31 million acres, and the region promises to
                    become a regular granary for Siberia and north-eastern Russia. The second
                    portion of the southern plains, which might be called the Baraba region, being
                    mostly occupied by the Baraba steppe, covers about 55,000 square miles. Only its
                    western borders belong to Tobolsk. It also is perfectly flat, and covered with
                    recent deposits; but, as there is no definite slope, the surface waters move
                    slowly, and accumulate into a very large number of lakes and marshes. The
                    climate is moister and the summer still shorter and less hot than in the
                    preceding region. Forests, consisting chiefly of birch, are spread in clusters
                    over its surface. The soil of this region also is very productive, but the
                    fertile patches are separated by marshy grounds, and the dense clouds of
                    mosquitoes which float over it in summer are a positive plague to both man and
                    beast. The population numbers only 250,000, also almost all Russians (only 4000
                    aborigines), and the area annually under crops is about 1,350,000 acres. To the
                    north of the regions just specified is that occupied by the administrative
                    districts of Tura, Tobolsk, and Tara, with an area of about 110,000 square
                    miles; this may be described as the <hi rend="italic">taiga</hi> region. It is
                    covered throughout with impenetrable forests and quivering marshes—the dreadful
                    <hi rend="italic">urmans,</hi> which are penetrated by man only for some 20 to
                    50 miles around the widely separated settlements. Immense cedartrees, larches,
                    firs, pines, birches, and maples grow very densely, and the underwood is so
                    thick that a passage can be forced only with the aid of the hatchet, the
                    difficulties being further increased by the layers of decayed wood and by the
                    marshes. To cross these, which are treacherously concealed under a swaying layer
                    of grassy vegetation, a kind of snow-shoe must be used even in the summer, and
                    many can be crossed only in winter. Immense areas of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >urτnans,</hi> especially on the Vasyugan, have never been visited by man; but
                    still, from time to time a Russian settlement arises in the forests, mostly
                    founded by Nonconformists in hiding, who freely receive all sorts of fugitives.
                    The south-western parts of this region are crossed by the Siberian highway, and
                    to this circumstance alone is it indebted for its population of nearly 450,000
                    (32,000 aborigines). Only 2 per cent, of this area is under culture. Farther
                    north extend the tundras, where the average temperature rapidly decreases from
                    the 25° F. found in the preceding region to 15°, 10°, and 7°. The frozen soil
                    during the hottest part of the summer thaws only for a few inches beneath the
                    surface. The frost sets in early, and a thick envelope of snow lowers the spring
                    temperature. Forests cover the southern parts, but the trees become poorer,
                    shorter, and thinner, and huddle into impenetrable thickets; while, farther
                    north, only the creeping variety of birch and the dwarf varieties of willow hold
                    their ground. Within the Arctic Circle the last traces of arboreal vegetation
                    disappear, their northern limit being pushed south by the double bay of the Ob
                    and the Taz, and by the proximity of the Kara Sea.</p>
                <p>Apart from the Urals, there are no traces of hard rock anywhere in Tobolsk. Down
                    to its southern borders it is covered with Post-Pliocene deposits, which are met
                    with as far as the waterparting between the Irtish and the Aral-Caspian
                    depression. This range of flat hills rises a few hundred feet above the
                    sea-level, and it seems to mark the limit of extension of the Post-Glacial gulf
                    of the Arctic Ocean which covered western Tobolsk during the Glacial period.
                    Contrary to Humboldt’s hypothesis, it remains, however, doubtful whether it was
                    connected in Post-Glacial times with the Aral-Caspian Sea otherwise than by
                    means of narrow straits, which disappeared at any rate at an early stage in that
                    geological period.</p>
                <p>The climate of Tobolsk is one of great extremes, the differences between the
                    averages for the hottest and coldest months reaching as much as 70° F. The
                    average temperatures at Berezoff, Narym, Tobolsk, and Ishim respectively are
                    24°, 28°, 31° ’ 8, and 32° (January, -8°'3, -8°, -2°, and -4°; July from 62° to
                    67°). Only 194 days at Ishim and 153 at Berezoff have a temperature above 32°;
                    and the Ob at Obdorsk continues ice-bound for 219 days (the Irtish 176 days at
                    Tobolsk).</p>
                <p>The government is watered by the Ob, which traverses it for more than 1300 miles,
                    and is navigable throughout. It receives many tributaries, some of which are 200
                    to 350 miles long, but flow through quite uninhabited regions. The Irtish, a
                    left-hand tributary of the Ob, covers all the southern part of Tobolsk with its
                    numerous tributaries. It waters Tobolsk for 760 miles, and is navigable for the
                    whole of its length; it receives the great Tobot, about 420 miles long, also
                    navigable, the Ishim, and a number of less important streams; while the Tura, a
                    tributary of the Tobot, is also a channel for navigation. The navigation lasts
                    for nearly six months in the south. The first steamer on the Ob system was
                    launched in 1845 and the second in 1860; since the latter date steam navigation
                    has steadily developed.</p>
                <p>Lakes, some of them salt, occur in great numbers on the waterparting between the
                    Irtish and the Aral-Caspian, and everywhere in South Tobolsk. Lake Tchany, the
                    largest, covers 1265 square miles. All are being rapidly dried up, and even
                    within the last hundred years they have undergone great changes. Thus, in the
                    group of lakes of Tchany, in the Baraba steppe, whole villages have arisen on
                    ground that was under water in the earlier years of this century.<note

                    tundras of the Arctic shores.</p>
                <p>The population reached 1,283,000 in 1882. Although recent immigrants, the
                    Russians already constitute 94 per cent, of the aggregate population, and their
                    numbers are steadily increasing by immigration, and partly also by the arrival
                    of exiles. No fewer than 43,750 immigrants from Russia settled at Tobolsk
                    between 1846 and 1878, but of late this figure has greatly increased. In 1879 as
                    many as 59,134 exiles were on the registers, but of these more than 20,000 had
                    left their abodes and disappeared. As a rule the exiles belong to the poorest
                    class of population. According to Μ. Yadrintseff,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Siberia as a Colony</hi>
                    (Russian).</p></note> the native population of Tobolsk was represented in 1879
                    by 29,150 Tartars and 8730 other Turkish inhabitants, chiefly in the south,
                    22,350 Ostiaks, chiefly on the Ob, 6920 Samoyedes in the north, and 6100 Voguls
                    in the north-west; the total amounted to 74,220,—that is, 6Ί per cent, of the
                    aggregate population (1,206,000 in 1879). The <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ostiaks</hi><hi rend="italic">{η-v.}</hi> are in a very miserable condition,
                    having come under heavy obligations to the Russian merchants, and being
                    compelled to hand over to them nearly all the produce of their hunting and
                    fishing. The Tartar settlements in the south are prosperous, but not in the
                    Tobolsk district, where their lands have been appropriated for the Russian <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n449/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0449-0430"/> settlers. Of the Russians nearly 35,000 are
                    Nonconformists, according to official figures, but the number is greatly
                    understated. Many of the Samoyedes, Ostiaks, and Voguls are nominally
                    Christians. The Russians and the Tartars, who chiefly inhabit South Tobolsk,
                    mostly live by agriculture. Of the total area of land regarded as suitable for
                    cultivation (28,400,000 acres), 15,600,000 are owned by the peasant communities.
                    Summer wheat, rye, oats, barley, and some buckwheat are raised. Flax and hemp
                    and tobacco are cultivated in the south, where cattle-breeding also is
                    extensively carried on. The ravages of anthrax, however (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Murrain,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 58), are very severe, especially in
                    the marshy parts of the province. The indigenous inhabitants of the north had,
                    in the same year, more than 100,000 reindeer. Dogs are used in sledges in the
                    far north. In the forest region the chief means of existence are found in the
                    forests. The pursuit of bears, wolves, foxes, squirrels, ermines, stags, elks,
                    as also of sables and beavers (rapidly disappearing), is a regular occupation
                    with the Russian peasants as well as with the indigenous inhabitants; sledges
                    and cars, mats, sieves, wooden vessels, and pitch and tar are also manufactured
                    to a considerable extent in the villages (valued at about £150,000). Cedar-nuts
                    (from 5000 to 8000 cwts. every year) are gathered, partly for the sake of their
                    oil. The fisheries of the Ob and the southern lakes are important; no fewer than
                    1700 Ostiaks are engaged in them on the Ob. No less than 200,000 cwts. of fish
                    are annually caught in the district of Tara alone, and Surgut exports it to the
                    value of £10,000, while in the Narym region 10,000 cwts. of salt are used for
                    preserving the fish.</p>
                <p>The industries are insignificant (chiefly tanning, distilling, and
                    tal1ow-melting); iron-works and woollen-cloth mills are still in their infancy.
                    The export of cattle, hides, tallow, corn, flour, fish, and furs to Russia, both
                    from Tobolsk and from the Kirghiz steppe, is of some importance. Spirits are
                    sent farther east, to Tomsk; while all kinds of manufactured wares are imported
                    from Russia. The fairs of Irbit and Ishim are the chief centres for trade.</p>
                <p>The educational institutions are few. It is worthy of remark that of “secondary
                    schools” (gymnasia and pro-gymnasia) there were in 1883 eight for girls, with
                    1065 scholars, and only four for boys, with 711 scholars; of primary schools
                    there were 250, with 5844 boys and 1403 girls.</p>
                <p>Tobolsk is divided into ten districts <hi rend="italic">(okrugs),</hi> the chief
                    towns (with populations in 1883) being Tobolsk (20,130), Berezoff (1990), Ishim
                    (7100), Kurgan (8570), Surgut (1460), Tara (8640), Turinsk (4650), Tyukaiinsk
                    (3900), Tyumefi (14,300), and Yalutorovsk (4500). Of these towns, only <hi

                    rend="italic">(q. v.</hi>) are really entitled to the designation, the others
                    being mere villages, of less importance than many others on the great Siberian
                    highway which crosses the government from Tyumen to Tomsk. (P. A. K.)</p>
