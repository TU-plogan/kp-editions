                    story of her having been betrayed by a young <hi rend="italic">seigneur,</hi>
                    and having in consequence devoted her life to avenge her wrongs upon
                    aristocrats, a story which is told by Lamartine and others, is unfounded, the
                    truth being that she left her home on account of a quarrel with her stepmother.
                    She went to Paris, and, on the outbreak of the Revolution, she was surrounded by
                    a coterie of well-known men, chief of whom were Pétion and Desmoulins. She
                    belonged to their party to the last,— became in fact the “Fury of the Gironde.”
                    On 14th July 1789 she came prominently into notice at the fall of the Bastille,
                    and for about four years thereafter she was seen in many of the stormiest scenes
                    of the Revolution, being known as “la belle Liégoise,” and singularly attired in
                    a riding habit, a plume in her hat, pistols in her belt, and a sword dangling by
                    her side. Early in October she took a leading part in the march to Versailles,
                    and the return journey with the king and queen to the capital. No horror
                    appalled her, and the violence of her language and her power with the mob were
                    no less remarkable than the influence which she was able, by combining cajolery,
                    threats, and money, successfully to exert on the royalist soldiers, so winning
                    them over to the Revolution. Being justly accused of dangerous conduct, her
                    arrest was ordered in the following year (1790), and she left Paris for
                    Mar-court, whence after a short stay she proceeded to Liège, in which town she
                    was seized by warrant of the Austrian Government, and conveyed first to Tyrol
                    and thereafter to Vienna, accused of having been engaged in a plot against the
                    life of the queen of France. After an interview, however, with Leopold IL, she
                    was released; and she returned to Paris, crowned of course with fresh laurels
                    because of her captivity, and resumed her influence. In the clubs of Paris her
                    voice was often heard, and even in the National Assembly she would violently
                    interrupt the expression of any moderatist views. She commanded in person the 3d
                    corps of the so-called army of the faubourgs on 20th June 1792, and again won
                    the gratitude of the people. She shares a heavy responsibility for her connexion
                    with the riots of the 10th of August. A certain contributor to Desmoulins’s
                    journal, the <hi rend="italic">Acts of the Apostles,</hi> Suleau by name, earned
                    her savage hatred by associating her name, for the sake of the play upon the
                    word, with a deputy named Populus, whom she had never seen. On the 10th of
                    August, just after she had watched approvingly the massacre of certain of the
                    national guard in the Place Vendome, Suleau was pointed out to her. She sprang
                    at him, dragged him among the infuriated mob, and he was stabbed to death in an
                    instant. But the time came when her party was in peril at the hands of one more
                    extreme, and she now wildly urged the mob to more moderate courses. Then the
                    furies of the “Mountain” seized the fury of the Gironde, and they stripped her
                    naked, and flogged her in the public garden of the Tuileries. The infamous
                    affront drove her mad. She was removed to a private house, thence in 1800 to La
                    Salpetrière for a month, and thence to a place of confinement called the Petites
                    Maisons, where she remained—a raving maniac—till 1807. She was then again
                    removed to La Salpetrière, where she died, never having recovered her reason, on
                    9th June 1817.</p>
