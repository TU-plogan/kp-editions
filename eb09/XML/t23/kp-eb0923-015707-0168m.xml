                    which solid pigments are employed, mixed with a water medium<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hence it used to be called
                    “water-work”; see Shakespeare, <hi rend="italic">Hen. IV.</hi>, part ii., act

                    dissolved to prevent the colours from scaling off. Tempera is called in Italy
                    “fresco a secco,” as distinguished from “fresco buono,” or true fresco, painted
                    on freshly laid patches of stucco. The peculiarities of true fresco are
                    described in vol. ix. p. 769 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> The disadvantages of
                    tempera painting are that it will not bear exposure to the weather; the pigments
                    merely lie on the surface and do not sink into the stucco, as is the case with
                    true fresco pigments; moreover, the medium used, being soluble in water, will
                    not stand the rain. Its advantages are that the painter can work at leisure, and
                    can also transfer or sketch his whole design on the dry finished surface; while
                    in fresco work each portion of the design is hidden piecemeal as each new patch
                    of stucco is applied (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Raphael,</hi> vol. XX. p. 279).
                    Another important point is that a far greater variety of pigments can be used in
                    tempera painting, as they are not subjected to the caustic action of wet lime.
                    Lastly, tempera painting can be applied to any substance, such as dry plaster,
                    wood, stone, terracotta, vellum, and paper.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Miniatures and illuminated letters in mediaeval MSS. were
                    painted with very finely ground colours mixed with a tempera medium.</p></note>
                    Various media have been used for tempera work, such as the glutinous sap of the
                    fig and other trees, various gums which are soluble in water, and size made by
                    boiling down fish-bones, parchment, and animals’ hoofs. In more recent times a
                    mixture of egg and vinegar has been found to make a good medium, especially when
                    it is desirable to apply the colours in considerable body or <hi rend="italic"
                    >impasto.</hi> Painting in tempera is probably the oldest method of all, and was
                    used in ancient Egypt very largely, as can be seen by an examination of the many
                    existing examples on papyrus or w ood and stone thinly coated with a skin of
                    fine plaster <hi rend="italic">(gesso).</hi> Other ancient examples have been
                    found in Babylon and Nineveh, and for internal work it appears to have been much
                    employed by the Greeks. To some extent tempera was used by the Romans, though in
                    most cases a combination of fresco and encaustic (hot wax) was employed for
                    their mural decoration (see vol. xvii. p. 42).</p>

                <p>In mediaeval times, from the 6th century in the Byzantium of Justinian down to
                    the 14th century, most painting, whether on walls or panels, was executed in
                    tempera, though in many cases it appears to have been the custom to put in the
                    coloured ground in true fresco, and, when that was dry, paint on it the complete
                    picture with a tempera medium. This was the method used in the Byzantine
                    wall-paintings in the churches of Thessalonica, Mount Athos, and elsewhere. A
                    similar practice existed in England and other northern countries,<note

                    of the chancel of Kempley church, Gloucestershire, dating from about 1100. Most
                    commonly, however, in England as in France and Germany the whole painting was
                    done in tempera, the finished surface of the plaster being first covered with a
                    wash of old slaked lime or whitening. As a rule every inch of stone, whether
                    carved, moulded, or plain, in the cathedrals and other churches of mediaeval
                    France, England, and other countries was covered with this thin coating of
                    white, and then elaborately decorated with tempera painting. In those rare cases
                    where want of money prevented the application of colour the stone-work of the
                    interior received the coat of white, so that at any future time the colouring
                    might be added, and also because the feeling of the Middle Ages evidently was
                    that bare stone inside a building had an unfinished and uncomfortable look,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Nothing could be more opposed
                    to the spirit of the Middle Ages than the modern rage for cutting off plaster

                    honesty.</p></note> and was quite as unsuitable in a richly decorated and
                    furnished cathedral as it would now be considered in a lady’s drawing-room. The
                    additional splendour gained by the use of minute patterns stamped in gesso,
                    thinly laid over the surface of the stone, is described in <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Tempera in Italy.—</hi> For panel and canvas paintings tempera
                    continued in use till nearly the end of the 15th century, when the Flemish
                    method of oil painting gradually took its place. In many cases with panel
                    pictures of the latter part of the 15th century it is now difficult, if not
                    impossible, to be sure whether they were painted in tempera or in oil, either
                    because both methods were combined—the picture being begun in tempera and
                    finished with oil glazings—or because an oil varnish has been laid over the
                    tempera pictures, and so the pigments have absorbed oil out of the varnish and
                    have thus practically become associated with an oil medium. In some cases slight
                    peculiarities of brush-work bear witness to one medium or the other; but these
                    appearances are often deceptive, and any real certainty on the point is
                    unattainable. The round panel of the Madonna and St Joseph by Michelangelo may
                    be mentioned as an example of these doubtful cases.</p>
                <p>In the main the earlier tempera easel pictures were painted on wood, —pear,
                    poplar, or walnut being commonly used; but a few painters preferred in some
                    cases to use canvas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In
                    order to ensure an even surface some painters prepared their panels by covering
                    them with linen or vellum, over which the gesso priming was laid.</p></note> The
                    National Gallery of London possesses a very beautiful example of this,—the
                    Entombment, attributed to Van der Weyden (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Schools of
                    Painting,</hi> vol. xxi. p. 438, fig. 29), which is most delicately and yet
                    powerfully painted on linen without any priming. Usually both panels and canvas
                    were prepared for tempera by being covered with a fine priming or coating of
                    gesso (plaster). Some later painters used marble dust; others unfortunately used
                    white lead, which has since blackened through the absorption of gases from the
                    air.</p>
                <p>In the case of wall paintings, both tempera and fresco<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Fresco” here means “fresco buono,” or true
                    fresco.</p></note> were used together,—the proportion of fresco work being
                    gradually increased. In the 13th and most of the 14th century little more than
                    the groundwork of the picture was painted in fresco, though this varied
                    according to the custom of each painter. In the 15th century increased technical
                    skill and rapidity of execution allowed much more complete work to be done in
                    fresco, till at last nothing but a few finishing touches were done in tempera.
                    For this, exceptional certainty of touch and speed of execution were required,
                    and some weaker painters never attained to a very complete mastery over the
                    fresco process. The brilliant series of wall paintings by Pinturicchio in the
                    cathedral library at Siena contain a very large proportion of tempera work, in
                    spite of which they are still in a wonderful state of preservation. Raphael’s
                    rapid advance in the mastery of fresco-work is clearly shown in his paintings in
                    the Vatican stanze, each one of which is carried to a further stage in true
                    fresco than the preceding. Thus the earliest painting of the series (the
                    Disputa) is very largely executed in tempera, while some of the later ones are
                    nearly completed in fresco, and show the most perfect skill in that difficult
                    process. Michelangelo was specially remarkable for his great power in fresco,
                    and carried his Sistine paintings to a very advanced stage before touching them
                    with tempera. Sad to say, what tempera finishing touches he did apply have
                    mostly been scraped off during the many cleanings and repairs that these works
                    have undergone; and the same misfortune has happened to a large number of other
                    important pictures. Tempera was specially used for paintings on canvas which
                    were intended to be hung like tapestry, as, for example, the fine 15th-century
                    series at Rheims and Mantegna’s Triumph of Julius Caesar at Hampton Court.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See vol. xvii. p.
                    38.</p></note> It was also much used for large cartoons, such as Raphael’s
                    tapestry designs, now in the South Kensington Museum. After the first half of
                    the 16th century the increasing use of oil painting, assisted by the artistic
                    decadence of the age, caused the gradual disuse of both fresco and tempera.</p>
                <p>A third process, often used during the earlier Middle Ages, was a sort of
                    compromise between tempera and fresco. A finished stucco surface was prepared as
                    for ordinary tempera, but before each day’s painting the plaster was soaked with
                    water, so that the pigments, laid on to the wet plaster, to some extent sank
                    below the surface, though without penetrating as deeply as they would on newly
                    mixed stucco. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> H. Μ.)</p>
