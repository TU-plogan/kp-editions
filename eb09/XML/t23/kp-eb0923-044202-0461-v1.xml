                <p><label type="entry">TONNAGE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Register Tonnage</hi>, or <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">International Register Tonnage</hi></label>, is the
                    unit on which the assessment of dues and charges on shipping is based. The
                    system at present in force is known as the Moorsom system. A register ton is 100
                    cubic feet of internal volume. Thus a vessel of 100,000 cubic feet of internal
                    space within the points of measurements prescribed by the law is 1000 tons
                    register. Vessels are sometimes bought and sold under this unit. The tonnage
                    rules, which are very full and elaborate, are contained in part ii. of the
                    Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, sections 20 to 29 inclusive, and in section 9 of
                    the Merchant Shipping Act, 1867, the latter being a special section in reference
                    to a deduction from the gross tonnage in respect of crew space, which space must
                    be fit for the proper accommodation of the men who are to occupy it to entitle
                    to such deduction. This enactment has led to great improvement in seamen’s
                    quarters.</p>
                <p>Section 60 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1862, provides on the point of
                    international tonnage as follows :— “Ships belonging to foreign countries which
                    have adopted the British system of tonnage need not be remeasured in this
                    country.” The British system has been adopted by the following countries at the
                    dates named :—United States, 1865; Denmark, 1867; Austria-Hungary, 1871;
                    Germany, 1873; France, 1873; Italy, 1873; Spain, 1874; Sweden, 1875;
                    Netherlands, 1876; Norway, 1876; Greece, 1878; Russia, 1879; Finland, 1877;
                    Hayti, 1882; Belgium, 1884; Japan, 1884. It is also under consideration by
                    China.</p>
                <p>There are slight differences in the rules for deduction for engine room in some
                    of the countries, but owners or masters of foreign steamships, where this
                    difference exists, may have the engine-rooms remeasured in the United Kingdom if
                    they desire; in other words, their net tonnage may be reduced to exact English
                    measure.</p>
                <p>The British system was also mainly adopted by the International Tonnage
                    Commission assembled at Constantinople in 1873, the rules of such commission
                    forming the basis of dues levied on the ships of all countries passing through
                    the Suez Canal. A special certificate is issued in the respective countries for
                    this purpose. The main point of difference from the British system is with
                    respect to the deduction for engine room.</p>
                <p>There are three terms used in respect of the tonnage of ships,—namely, tonnage
                    under decks, gross tonnage, and register tonnage.</p>
                <p>In obtaining the gross measurement the space under the tonnage deck is first
                    measured—sections 20 and 21 (1), (2), and (3); then the space or spaces, if any,
                    between the tonnage deck (the tonnage deck is the second deck from below in all
                    vessels of more than two decks and the upper deck in all other vessels) and the
                    upper deck— section 21 (5) of Act; and finally the permanent closed-in spaces
                    above the upper deck available for cargo, stores, passengers, or crew—section 21
                    (4) of Act.</p>
                <p>The allowance for engine room is governed by the percentage the net engine
                    room—that is, the space exclusive of the coal bunkers—bears to the gross
                    tonnage, and varies in paddle-and screw-steamers as laid down in section 23 of
                    the Act.</p>
                <p>In obtaining the tonnage under tonnage deck, ships are divided in respect of
                    their length into five classes as follows :—·</p>

                <p>The following is an epitome of the rule for tonnage under the tonnage deck :—</p>
                <p>Length is taken inside on tonnage deck, from inside of plank at stern to inside
                    of midship stern timber or plank; the length so taken, allowing for rake of bow
                    and of stern in the thickness of the deck, and one-third of the round of beam,
                    is to be divided into the prescribed number of equal parts (which determines the
                    stations of the areas), according to the length of vessel, as above.</p>
                <p>Area 1 is at the extreme limit of the bow. Area 2 is at the first point of
                    division of the length. The rest are numbered in succession, the last being at
                    the extreme limit of the stern.</p>
                <p>Depths are taken at each point of division of the length, or station <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n462/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0462-0443"/> of each area, from the underside of the
                    tonnage deck to ceiling at inner edge of timber strake, deducting therefrom
                    one-third of the round of the beam. The depths so taken are to be divided into
                    four equal parts, if midship depth should not exceed 16 feet; otherwise into six
                    equal parts.</p>
                <p>Breadths are taken at each point of division of the depths and also at the upper
                    and lower points of the depths. The upper breadth of each area is to be set down
                    in its respective column in a line with No. 1 (left-hand numerals), and the rest
                    in succession.</p>
                <p>The number of columns for areas will vary according to the length, as in the
                    several classes, and will be equal to the number of parts into which the length
                    is divided plus one.</p>
                <p>This formula is also applicable for finding displacement tonnage of ships, that
                    is, the external displacement measured by taking transverse areas to the height
                    of the load water-line to find the cubic content, which content divided by 35
                    gives the displacement in tons weight, the difference between the light and load
                    displacement representing the carrying powers of a vessel in tons.</p>
                <p>“The rule,” says Mr Moorsom, “is founded on the purest mathematical principles.
                    It was first published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi>
                    of the Royal Society of 1798 by Attwood, in his ‘Disquisition on the Stability
                    of Ships,’ who there describes it as one of those formulae invented by Sterling
                    for measuring spaces bounded by irregular curves, founded on Sir Isaac Newton’s
                    discovery of a theorem—a discovery which the immortal author himself considered
                    amongst his happiest inventions—by which the areas of all curvilinear spaces not
                    geometrically quadrible nor discoverable by any known rules of direct
                    investigation are so closely approximated as to amount to geometrical
                    exactness.”</p>
                <p>Mr Allan Gilmour at the middle of the present century expressed his opinion,
                    after a careful consideration of the tonnage question, which was receiving much
                    attention at that time owing to the law 8 and 9 Vict. cap. 89, which had been
                    adopted in place of the old tonnage law 13 Geo. III. cap. 74, not giving
                    satisfaction, that the “system framed by Mr Moorsom will as it were compel every
                    one to build strong, fast-sailing, and good seagoing ships, and that, in fact,
                    it will stand as long as the world remains.” It will be admitted that great
                    progress has been made in every way in British shipping of late years, and for
                    this due praise must be given to the influence of the present tonnage laws. (W.
