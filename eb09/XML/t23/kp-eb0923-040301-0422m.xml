                    (1656-1733), one of the ablest and most popular of the English deists, the son
                    of a clergyman, was born at Beer Ferris, Devonshire, in 1656. He studied law at
                    Lincoln College, Oxford, where he came under the influence of the High Churchman
                    George Hickes, dean of Worcester; and in his twenty-second year he was elected
                    fellow of All Souls College, and held his fellowship till his death. About 1685
                    he saw “that upon his High Church notions a separation from the Church of Rome
                    could not be justified,” and accordingly he joined the latter. But, discerning
                    the baselessness and absurdity of Rome’s claims, he returned to the Church of
                    England at Easter 1688. In 1694 he published an <hi rend="italic">Essay of
                    Obedience to the Supreme Powers,</hi> in which he justified the Revolution
                    against notions of passive obedience and <hi rend="italic">jus</hi><hi

                    1707; 4th, 1709). The book was regarded in its day as an extremely forcible
                    defence of the Erastian theory of the supremacy of the state over the church,
                    and at once provoked a storm of counter-argument and abuse on the part of those
                    who maintained the independent rights and authority of the church. The law also
                    was invoked against it, and, after several attempts to proscribe the work had
                    failed, one against the author, publisher, and printer succeeded on 12th
                    December 1707, and another against a bookseller for selling a copy the next day.
                    The prosecution did not prevent the issue of a fourth edition and gave the
                    author the opportunity of issuing <hi rend="italic">A Defence of the Rights of
                    the Christian Church,</hi> in two parts (2d ed., 1709). The book continued to be
                    the subject of denunciation for years, and Tindal believed he was charged by Dr
                    Gibson, bishop of London, in a <hi rend="italic">Pastoral Letter,</hi> with

                    1731; 3d, 1732; 4th, 1733), which was regarded by friends and foes alike as the
                    “Bible” of deism. It w as really only the first part of the whole work, and the
                    second, though written and entrusted in manuscript to a friend, never saw the
                    light. It was said that Dr Gibson prevented its publication. The first part made
                    a great noise, and the answers to it were numerous, the most able being by Dr
                    James Foster (1730), Dr John Cony beare (1732), Dr John Leland (1733), and
                    Bishop Butler (1736). It was translated into German by J. Lorenz Schmidt (1741),
                    and from it dates the influence of English deism on German theology. It is by
                    this book that Tindal is now chiefly remembered; but he had probably adopted
                    substantially the principles it expounds before he wrote his essay of 1697. He
                    objected to be called a simple deist, and claimed the name of “Christian deist,”
                    as he held that true Christianity is identical with the eternal religion of
                    nature. He died at Oxford on 16th August 1733.</p>
                <p>The religious system expounded in TindaΓs <hi rend="italic">Christianity as Old
                    as the Creation,</hi> unlike the earlier system of Lord Herbert of Cherbury, was
                    based on the empirical principles of Locke’s philosophy. It assumed the
                    traditional deistic antitheses of external and internal, positive and natural,
                    revelations and religions, and perpetuated at the same time the prevalent
                    misconceptions as tp the nature of religion and revelation. The system was,
                    moreover, worked out by the purely <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> method, with
                    all but a total disregard of the facts of religious history. It starts from the
                    tremendous assumptions that true religion must, both from the nature of God and
                    the nature of things, be eternal, universal, simple, and perfect; it maintains
                    that this religion can consist of nothing but the simple and universal duties
                    towards God and man, the first consisting in the fulfilment of the second,—in
                    other words, the practice of morality. The author’s moral system is somewhat
                    confused and inconsistent, but is essentially utilitarian. From such principles
                    it follows necessarily that the true revealed religion can be nothing more nor
                    less than a republication of the religion of nature or reason, and that, if
                    Christianity is the perfect religion, it can only be that republication, and
                    must be as old as the creation. The special mission of Christianity, therefore,
                    was simply to deliver men from the superstition which had in course of time got
                    mixed up with the religion of nature. True Christianity consequently must be a
                    perfectly “reasonable service”; arbitrary and positive precepts can form no true
                    part of it; revelation and reason can never disagree; reason must be supreme,
                    and the Scriptures as well as all religious doctrines must submit to its tests;
                    and only such writings can be regarded as Divine Scripture which tend to the
                    honour of God and the good of man. Thus tested, much in the Old and the New
                    Testaments must be rejected as defective in morality or erroneous in fact and
                    principle. The strength of TindaΓs position was the underlying conviction of the
                    essential harmony between man’s religious and rational nature, and consequently
                    of the rationality of Christianity. Its weakness was that, like the whole
                    religious philosophy of the time, it was founded on a total misconception of the
                    nature of religion and of revelation, and on as complete a disregard of the
                    course of man’s religious development. Weak points in it were ably exposed by
                    Foster, Conybeare, Butler, and others; but its radical errors needed for their
                    complete exposure the higher conceptions of religion and religious history which
                    were originated by Lessing, Schleiermacher, and Hegel.</p>
