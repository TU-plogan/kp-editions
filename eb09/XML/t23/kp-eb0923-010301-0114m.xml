                    and it is certain that in India teak has been known and used largely for
                    considerably more than 2000 years. In Persia teak was used nearly 2000 years
                    ago, and the town of Siraf on the Persian Gulf was entirely built of it. <hi

                    called the most valuable of all known timbers. For use in tropical countries it
                    has no equal, and for certain purposes it is preferable to other woods in
                    temperate climates also. Its price is higher than that of any other timber,
                    except mahogany.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    it <hi rend="italic">Tectona grandis.</hi> It is a large deciduous tree, of the
                    natural order <hi rend="italic">Verbenajce∂e∙&gt;</hi> with a tall straight
                    stem, a spreading crown, the branchlets four-sided, with large quadrangular
                    pith. It is a native of the two Indian peninsulas, and is also found in the
                    Philippine Islands, Java, and other islands of the Malay Archipelago. In India
                    proper its northern limit is 24° 40' on the west side of the Aravalli Hills, and
                    in the centre near Jhansi, in 25° 30' N. lat. In Burmah it extends to the
                    Mogoung district, in lat. 25° 10'. In Bengal or Assam it is not indigenous, but
                    plantations have been formed in Assam as far as the 27th parallel. In the Punjab
                    it is grown in gardens to the 32d.</p>
                <p>Teak requires a tropical climate, and the most important forests are found in the
                    moister districts of India, where during the summer months heavy rains are
                    brought by the south-west monsoon, the winter months being rainless. In the
                    interior of the Indian peninsula, where the mean annual rainfall is Jess than 30
                    inches, no teak is found, and it thrives best with a mean annual fall of more
                    than 50</p>
                <p>inches. The mean annual temperature which suits it best lies between 75° and 81°
                    Fahr. Near the coast the tree is absent, and the most valuable forests are on
                    low hills up to 3000 feet. It grows on a great variety of soils, but there is
                    one indispensable condition—perfect drainage or a dry subsoil. On level ground,
                    with deep alluvial soil, teak does not often form regularly shaped stems,
                    probably because the subsoil drainage is imperfect.</p>
                <p>During the dry season the tree is leafless; in hot localities the leaves fall in
                    January, but in moist places the tree remains green till March. At the end of
                    the dry season, when the first monsoon rains fall, the fresh foliage comes out.
                    The leaves, which stand opposite, are from 1 to 2 feet in length and from 6 to
                    12 inches in breadth. On coppice shoots the leaves are much larger, and not
                    rarely from 2 to 3 feet long. In shape they somewhat resemble those of the
                    tobacco plant, but their substance is hard and the surface rough. The small
                    white flowers are very numerous, on large erect cross-branched panicles, which
                    terminate the branches. They appear during the rains, generally in July and
                    August, and the seed ripens in January and February. On the east side of the
                    Indian peninsula, the teak flowers during the rains in October and November. In
                    Java the forests are leafless in September, while during March and April, after
                    the rains have commenced, they are clothed with foliage and the flowers open.
                    During the rainy season the tree is readily recognized at a considerable
                    distance by the whitish flower panicles, which overtop the green foliage, and
                    during the dry season the feathery seed-bearing panicles distinguish it from all
                    other trees. The small oily seeds are enclosed in a hard bony 1-4 celled nut,
                    which is surrounded by a thick covering, consisting of a dense felt of matted
                    hairs. The fruit is enclosed by the enlarged membranous calyx, in appearance
                    like an irregularly plaited or crumpled bladder. The tree seeds freely every
                    year, but its spread by means of selfsown seed is impeded by the forest fires of
                    the dry season, which in India generally occur in March and April, after the
                    seeds have ripened and have partly fallen. Of the seeds which escape, numbers
                    are washed down the hills by the first heavy rains of the monsoon. These collect
                    in the valleys, and it is here that groups of seedlings and young trees are
                    frequently found. A portion of the seed remains on the tree; this falls
                    gradually after the rains have commenced, and thus escapes the fires of the hot
                    season. The germination of the seed is slow and uncertain; a large amount of
                    moisture is needed to saturate the spongy covering; many seeds do not germinate
                    until the second or third year, and many do not come up at all.</p>
                <p>The bark of the stem is about half an inch thick, grey or brownish grey, the
                    sapwood white; the heartwood of the green tree has a pleasant and strong
                    aromatic fragrance and a beautiful golden-yellow colour, which on seasoning soon
                    darkens into brown, mottled with darker streaks. The timber retains its aromatic
                    fragrance to a great age. On a transverse section the wood is marked by large
                    pores, which are more numerous and larger in the spring wood, or the inner belt
                    of each annual ring, while they are less numerous and smaller in the autumn wood
                    or outer belt. In this manner the growth of each successive year is marked in
                    the wood, and the age of a tree may be determined by counting the annual
                    rings.</p>
                <p>The principal value of teak timber for use in warm countries is its extraordinary
                    durability. In India and in Burmah beams of the wood in good preservation are
                    often found in buildings several centuries old, and instances are known of teak
                    beams having lasted more than a thousand years.<note anchored="true"

                    thick. These planks were examined in 1881; they were in a good state of <pb

                    260). Tn the wall of a palace of the Persian kings near Baghdad, which was
                    pillaged in the 7th century, two Americans found in 1811 pieces of Indian teak
                    which were perfectly sound (Ouseley, <hi rend="italic">Travels in Various
                    Countries of the East,</hi> vol. ii. p. 280, note 67). In the old cave temples
                    of Salsette and elsewhere in western India pieces of teak have been found in
                    good preservation which must have been more than 2000 years old.</p></note>
                    Being one of the few Indian timbers <pb corresp="pbn9104"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0115-0104"/> which are really durable, teak has always been
                    used for buildings, particularly for temples, and in India it has been the chief
                    timber employed for shipbuilding. When iron commenced to be extensively used for
                    the last-named purpose, it was supposed that the demand for teak would decrease.
                    This, however, has not been the case, for the wood is still very largely used
                    for the backing of ironclads and for decks of large vessels. It is also used for
                    furniture, for door and window frames, for the construction of railway
                    carriages, and for many other purposes. White ants eat the sapwood, but rarely
                    attack the heartwood of teak. It is not, however, proof against the borings of
                    the teredo, from whose attacks the teak piles of the wharves in the Rangoon
                    river have to be protected by a sheathing of metal.</p>
                <p>Once seasoned, teak timber does not split, crack, shrink, or alter its shape. In
                    these qualities it is superior to most timbers. In contact with iron, neither
                    the iron nor the teak suffers, and in this respect it is far superior to oak. It
                    is not very hard, is easily worked, and takes a beautiful polish. It has great
                    elasticity and strength, and is not very heavy. The average weight of perfectly
                    seasoned wood fluctuates between 38 and 46 lb per cubic foot. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Its weight, therefore, is a little less than that of
                    English oak. Green teak timber, however, is heavier than water, and unless
                    thoroughly seasoned it cannot be floated. In Burmah, therefore, where the rivers
                    are used to float the timber to the seaports, a peculiar mode of seasoning teak
                    by girdling has been practised from time immemorial. Girdling consists in making
                    a deep circular cut through bark and sap into the heartwood, so as completely to
                    sever communication between bark and sapwood above and below the cut. In teak,
                    as in oak and other trees with well-marked heartwood, the circulation of the sap
                    only takes place in the sapwood, and the girdled tree therefore dies after a few
                    days if the operation has been effectually performed. But if even the smallest
                    band of sapwood is left connecting the outer layers of wood above and below the
                    girdle, the tree is not killed, and often recovers completely. The girdled tree
                    is allowed to stand one or two years, and longer if a very large-sized tree.
                    Being exposed to the wind and to the action of the sun, the timber of a girdled
                    tree seasons more rapidly and more completely than that of a tree felled green.
                    The teak produced in the presidencies of Madras and Bombay and in the Central
                    Provinces is as a rule felled green, and even when dry it generally is a little
                    heavier than the timber from Burmah.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>At 44·8 lb per cubic foot a load of 50 cubic feet weighs a
                    ton (2240 lb), hence in the Burmah ports a ton of teak timber is taken as
                    equivalent to a load of 50 cubic feet.</p></note> For a long time to come, the
                    rivers of Burmah and Siam will continue to afford the most convenient and most
                    economical routes for the transport of timber. Indeed the forests drained by the
                    Salwin and its feeders are not likely ever to be worked otherwise than on the
                    present plan, under which the logs are floated singly over the rapids and are
                    caught and rafted lower down, at the kyodan or rope station, 70 miles above
                    Maulmain.</p>
                <p>As already mentioned, teakwood contains an aromatic oil, which gives it a
                    peculiarly pleasant smell and an oily surface when fresh cut. To this oil may
                    probably with justice be ascribed its great durability. In Burmah oil is
                    extracted from the timber on a small scale, for medicinal purposes, by filling
                    an earthen pot, which is placed inverted upon another, with chips of wood, and
                    putting fire round it, upon which the oil runs down into the lower vessel.</p>
                <p>According to the colour and texture of the wood, several varieties of teak are
                    distinguished in India, Burmah, and Java; in the timber trade, however, these
                    distinctions are of no importance. Teak as well as other trees, when standing
                    isolated, forms side branches far down the stem, and the wood of such trees is
                    more knotty and wavy, and generally heavier and darker-coloured than the timber
                    of trees which have grown close together in a dense forest. Apart from the
                    manner in which the tree had grown up in the forest, soil, elevation, and
                    climate have a great influence upon the grain and the mechanical qualities of
                    teak as of other timbers. Most of the larger logs brought to market have an
                    irregular crack or hollow in the centre, which commences at the butt and often
                    runs up a long way. There is little doubt that this is generally due to the
                    action of the fires, which scorch and often destroy the bark of young trees.
                    Such external injuries are apt to induce decay in the wood. Moreover, most teak
                    seedlings which come up naturally are cut down to the ground by the fires of the
                    hot season; some are killed, but many sprout again during the rains, and this is
                    generally repeated year after year, until a sapling is produced strong enough to
                    outlive the fire. Such saplings have a very large pith, which dries up, causing
                    a hollow in the heart. Or a piece of the old shoot killed by the fire is
                    enclosed by the new wood, and this also is apt to give rise to a hollow.</p>
                <p>The leaves of the teak tree contain a red dye, which in Malabar was formerly used
                    to dye silk and cotton. Natives of Burmah use the leaves as plates, to wrap up
                    parcels, and for thatching.</p>
                <p>In its youth the tree grows with extreme rapidity. Two-year-old seedlings on good
                    soil are 5 to 10 feet high, and instances of more rapid growth are not uncommon.
                    In the plantations which have been made since 1856 in Burmah, the teak has on
                    good soil attained an average height of 60 feet in 15 years, with a girth,
                    breast high, of 19 inches. This is between 16° and 18° N. lat., with a mean
                    annual temperature of 78° F. and a rainfall of 100 inches. In the Burmah
                    plantations it is estimated that the tree will, under favourable circumstances,
                    attain a diameter of 24 inches (girth 72 inches) at the age of 80. Timber of
                    that size is marketable, but the timber of the natural forests which is at
                    present brought to market in Burmah has grown much more slowly, the chief reason
                    being the annual forest fires, which harden and impoverish the soil. In the
                    natural forests of Burmah and India teak timber with a diameter of 24 inches is
                    never less than 100 and often more than 200 years old. In future, the timber
                    grown in plantations and in forests under regular management may be expected to
                    grow much faster; and there is no ground for anticipating that rapidly grown
                    timber will be less valuable than that of slow growth, which is at present
                    brought to market.</p>
                <p>Like the other trees of the dry deciduous forest, teak does not attain any
                    extraordinary size. The trees are not generally more than 100 to 150 feet high,
                    even under the most favourable circumstances, and stems more than 100 feet to
                    the first branch are not often found. Exceptionally tall trees were measured in
                    1861 in the Gwaythay forest in Pegu, east of the Sitang river, on gneiss. The
                    stems had 106 to 114 feet to the first branch, with a girth, at 6 feet off the
                    ground, from 7 to 16 feet.' Larger girths, up to 25 feet, are not uncommon.</p>
                <p>The teak tree does not usually form pure forests. It is associated with bamboos
                    and a great variety of other trees, which have little market value, and, as a
                    rule, thrives best in such company. Hence in the plantations established in
                    Burmah, the object has been to raise forests of teak mixed with bamboos and
                    other trees.</p>
                <p>Most of the teak timber produced is consumed in India. The produce of the
                    magnificent forests of Travancore, Cochin, the Madras presidency, Coorg, Mysore,
                    Bombay, Berar<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It has
                    been erroneously stated that the tree in Burmah is tapped for its oil before
                    felling.</p></note> and the Central Provinces is all so consumed. Formerly there
                    was a considerable export from the ports of the western coast,—Malabar, Kanara,
                    Surat, and Broach,—but the country at present requires all the teak which its
                    forests can produce; indeed the demand is in excess of the supply, and large
                    quantities are imported from Burmah to Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, and other
                    Indian ports. Small quantities are still exported from the ports of the western
                    coast to Arabia and the coast of Africa. The chief export is from Burmah,
                    principally from Rangoon and Maulmain. Of the other teak-producing countries,
                    Java exports a little; there have also been exports from Saigon; and since 1882
                    Bankok has sent considerable quantities to Europe. But the Burmah coast is the
                    chief source of supply at present. Rangoon has for a very long time been an
                    important place for shipbuilding, teak being the chief timber used: between 1786
                    and 1825 111 European vessels were built at Rangoon, aggregating 35,000 tons. At
                    the same time timber was exported, and, when the place was taken by the British
                    in 1852, teak was the chief article of export. Maulmain became British territory
                    at the close of the first Burmese war in 1826. At that time the place was a
                    large fishing village, and it was mainly through the export of teak timber and
                    the shipbuilding trade that it attained its present importance. From 1829 to
                    1841 upwards of 50,000 loads of teak timber were exported, and, in addition, 68
                    vessels were built during that period, aggregating 15,680 tons, and estimated to
                    have required for their construction 24,000 loads of teak timber. The forests
                    from which Maulmain first derived its supplies are situated on the Attaran
                    river, a feeder of the Salwin. In 1836, however, timber began to come down from
                    more distant forests, and in 1841 one-fourth only of the supply was brought from
                    the Attaran forests.</p>
                <p>The increase in the export of timber from the Burmah ports was slow at first, but
                    has gone on rapidly since Rangoon became a British port. Since that time the
                    timber brought to the Burmah ports has come from the following sources:—(1) from
                    the forests in the British coast provinces, Pegu and Tenasserim; (2) from the
                    forests in the former kingdom of Burmah, floated to Rangoon down the Sitang and
                    Irrawaddy rivers; (3) from the forests in the Shan states formerly tributary to
                    Burmah, from the Karenni country, and from Siam, which is all floated to
                    Maulmain by the Salwin river. Since 1856 the increase of the supply derived from
                    these three sources has been large, as will be apparent from the following <pb

                    during this period, the balance having been sent to Calcutta, Bombay, and other
                    Indian ports. The quantities here stated do not include the timber consumed in
                    Upper Burmah, nor that brought from the forests drained by the Menam and Mekhong
                    rivers on the east side of the Indo-Chinese Peninsula, nor the teak produced in
                    Java and the other islands of the Malay Archipelago, and in the extensive
                    forests of the western peninsula of India. No data are yet available for a
                    precise estimate; but the total amount yielded by these forests, and consumed
                    locally or exported, appears to be not less than 500,000 loads or tons a
                    year.</p>
                <p>In British India a large portion of the teak-producing tracts have since 1856
                    been placed under conservancy management, and similar measures will doubtless be
                    extended to the forests in Upper Burmah, now annexed to the British empire, as
                    well as to the forests of the feudatory native states. In British India, the
                    area of state forests demarcated in order to be permanently conserved<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Not including 16,000 square
                    miles of second class reserves in the Central Provinces.</p></note> was in 1885
                    (in round figures) 33,000 square miles, and the teak-producing tracts included
                    in this area may be estimated to cover about 12,000 square miles, or 7,680,000
                    acres. Large additions will be made to this area, especially in Upper Burmah. Of
                    teak plantations, 12,000 acres have been formed in Burmah, 563 acres in Coorg,
                    3436 at Nilambur in Malabar, and about 2000 acres in other districts. There are
                    good grounds for estimating the future yield of plantations at the rate of 50
                    cubic feet (one ton) per acre annually. The natural forests will, in their
                    present impoverished condition, not furnish more than one cubic foot per acre
                    annually, but, as protection against fire is gradually extending, the proportion
                    of teak is everywhere being increased by cultural operations in the forests, and
                    the effect of these measures will eventually manifest itself by a considerablé
                    increase in the yield. In their present condition, the natural forests
                    demarcated in India up to 1887 may be expected to yield 150,000 tons a year,
                    while the produce of the plantations will eventually add 18,000 tons more. The
                    teak forests in Java were surveyed in 1871, and their area was found to be 2280
                    square miles, while the plantations in that island in 1880 amounted to 24,710
                    acres. These figures will serve to show that, if the system commenced in India
                    and Java is maintained, there is no reason to apprehend a diminution of the teak
                    supply. (D. BR.)</p>
