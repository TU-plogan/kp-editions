                <p><label type="entry">TERENCE</label>. P. Terentius Afer (185 7-159 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> holds a unique position among Roman writers. No
                    writer in any literature has gained so great a reputation who has contented
                    himself with so limited a function. He lays no claim to the position of an
                    original artist painting from life or commenting on the results of his own
                    observation. His art has no relation to his own time or to the country in which
                    he lived. The chief source of interest in the fragmentary remains of Naevius,
                    Ennius, Pacuvius, Accius, and Lucilius is their relation to the national and
                    moral spirit of the age in which they were written. Plautus, though, like
                    Terence, he takes the first sketch of his plots, scenes, and characters from the
                    Attic stage, is yet a true representative of his time, a genuine Italian,
                    writing before the genius of Italy had learned the restraints of Greek art. The
                    whole aim of Terence was to present a faithful copy of the life, manners, modes
                    of thought and expression which had been drawn from reality a century before his
                    time by the writers of the New Comedy of Athens. The nearest parallel to his
                    literary position may be found in the aim which Virgil puts before himself in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Bucolics.</hi> He does not seek in that poem to draw
                    Italian peasants from the life, but to bring back the shepherds of Theocritus on
                    Italian scenes. Yet the result obtained by Virgil is different. The charm of his
                    pastorals is the Italian sentiment which pervades them. His shepherds are not
                    the shepherds of Theocritus, nor are they in any sense true to life. The
                    extraordinary result obtained by Terence is that, while he has left no trace in
                    any of his comedies of one sketching from the life by which he was surrounded,
                    there is perhaps no more truthful, natural, and delicate delineator of human
                    nature, in its ordinary and more level moods, within the whole range of
                    classical literature. His permanent position in literature is due, no doubt, to
                    the art and genius of Menander, whose creations he has perpetuated, as a fine
                    engraver may perpetuate the spirit of a great painter whose works have perished.
                    But no mere copyist or verbal translator could have attained that result. Though
                    without claims to creative originality, Terence must have had not only critical
                    genius, to enable him fully to appreciate and identify himself with his
                    originals, but artistic genius of a high and pure type. The importance of his
                    position in Roman literature consists in this, that he was the first writer who
                    set before himself a high ideal of artistic perfection, and was the first to
                    realize that perfection in style, form, and consistency of conception and
                    execution. Living in the interval between Ennius and Lucilius, whose original
                    force and genius survive only in rude and inartistic fragments, he produced six
                    plays, which have not only reached our time in the form in which they were given
                    to the world, but have been read in the most critical and exacting literary
                    epochs, and still may be read without any feeling of the need of making
                    allowance for the rudeness of a new and undeveloped art.</p>
                <p>While his great gift to Roman literature is that he first made it artistic, that
                    he imparted to “rude Latium” the sense of elegance, consistency, and moderation,
                    his gift to the world is that through him it possesses a living image of the
                    Greek society in the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> presented in the
                    purest Latin idiom. Yet Terence had no affinity by birth either with the Greek
                    race or with the people of Latium. He was more distinctly a foreigner than any
                    of the great classical writers of Rome. He lived at the meeting-point of three
                    distinct civilizations,—the mature, or rather decaying, civilization of Greece,
                    of which Athens was still the centre; that of Carthage, which was so soon to
                    pass away and leave scarcely any vestige of itself; and the nascent civilization
                    of Italy, in which all other modes were soon to be absorbed. Terence was by
                    birth a Phoenician, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n200/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0200-0187"/> and was thus perhaps a fitter medium of connexion
                    between the genius of Greece and that of Italy than if he had been a pure Greek
                    or a pure Italian; just as in modern times the Jewish type of genius is
                    sometimes found more detached from national peculiarities, and thus more capable
                    of reproducing a cosmopolitan type of character than the genius of men belonging
                    to the other races of Europe.</p>
                <p>Our knowledge of the life of Terence is derived chiefly from a fragment of the
                    lost work of Suetonius, <hi rend="italic">De Vins Illustribus,</hi> preserved in
                    the commentary of Donatus. Confirmation of some of the statements contained in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> is obtained from later writers and speakers, and
                    also from the prologues to the different plays, which at the same time throw
                    light on the literary and personal relations of the poet. These prologues were
                    among the original sources of Suetonius; but he quotes or refers to the works of
                    various grammarians and antiquarians— Porcius Licinus, Volcatius Sedigitus,
                    Santra, Nepos, Fenestella, Q. Cosconius—as his authorities. The first two lived
                    within a generation or two of the death of Terence, and the first of them shows
                    a distinct animus against him and his patrons. But, notwithstanding the
                    abundance of authorities, there is uncertainty as to both the date of his birth
                    and the place and manner of his death. The doubt as to the former arises from
                    the discrepancy of the MSS. His last play, the <hi rend="italic">Adelphi,</hi>
                    was exhibited in 160 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Shortly after its production
                    he went to Greece, being then, according to the best MSS., in his twenty-fifth
                    (“nondum quintum atque vicesimum egressus<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Ritschl reads <hi rend="italic">ingressus,</hi> which would
                    make him a year younger.</p></note> annum ”), according to inferior MSS., in his
                    thirty-fifth year. This uncertainty is increased by a discrepancy between the
                    authorities quoted by Suetonius. Cornelius Nepos is quoted for the statement
                    that he was about the same age as Scipio (born 185 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> and Laelius, while Fenestella, an antiquarian of the later Augustan
                    period, represented him as older. As the authority of the MSS. coincides with
                    that of the older record, the year 185 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> may be
                    taken as the most probable date of his birth. In the case of an author drawing
                    originally from life, it might seem improbable that he should have written six
                    comedies, so true in their apprehension and delineation of various phases of
                    human nature, between the ages of nineteen and twenty-five. But the case of an
                    imitative artist, reproducing impressions derived from literature, is different;
                    and the circumstances of Terence’s origin and early life may well have developed
                    in him a precocity of talent. His acknowledged intimacy with Scipio and Laelius
                    and the general belief that they assisted him in the composition of his plays
                    are more in accordance with the statement that he was about their own age than
                    that he was ten years older. Terence, accordingly, more even than Catullus,
                    Tibullus, or Lucan, is to be ranked among those poets who are the “inheritors of
                    unfulfilled renown.” He is said to have been born at Carthage, brought to Rome
                    as a slave, and carefully educated in the house of M. Terentius Lucanus, by whom
                    he was soon emancipated. A difficulty was felt in ancient times as to how he
                    originally became a slave, as there was no war between Rome and Carthage between
                    the Second and Third Punic Wars, and no commercial relations between Africa and
                    Italy till after the destruction of Carthage. But there was no doubt as to his
                    Phoenician origin. He was admitted into the intimacy of young men of the best
                    families, such as Scipio, Laelius, and Furius Philus, and he enjoyed the favour
                    of older men of literary distinction and official position, such as C. Sulpicius
                    Gallus, Q. Fabius Labeo, and M. Popillius. He is said to have owed the favour of
                    the great as much to his personal gifts and graces as to his literary
                    distinction; and in one of his prologues he declares it to be his ambition,
                    while not offending the many, to please the “boni.”</p>
                <p>Terence’s earliest play was the <hi rend="italic">Andria,</hi> exhibited in 166
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when the poet could have been only about the age
                    of nineteen. A pretty, but probably apocryphal, story is told of his having read
                    the play, before its exhibition, to Caecilius (who, after the death of Plautus,
                    ranked as the foremost comic poet), and of the generous admiration of it
                    manifested by Caecilius. A similar instance of the recognition of rising genius
                    by a poet whose own day was past is found in the account given of the visit of
                    Accius, on his journey to Asia, to the veteran Pacuvius. The next play exhibited
                    by Terence was the <hi rend="italic">Hecyra,</hi> first produced in 165, but
                    withdrawn in consequence of the bad reception which it met with, and afterwards
                    reproduced in 160. The <hi rend="italic">Heauton-timoroumenos</hi> appeared in
                    163, the <hi rend="italic">Eunuchus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phormio</hi> in
                    161, and the <hi rend="italic">Adelphi</hi> in 160 at the funeral games of L.
                    Aemilius Paulus.</p>
                <p>After bringing out these plays Terence sailed for Greece, either to escape from
                    the suspicion of publishing the works of others as his own, or from the desire
                    to obtain a more intimate knowledge of that Greek life which had hitherto been
                    known to him only in literature, and which it was his professed aim to reproduce
                    in his comedies. The latter is the more probable motive, and we recognize in
                    this the first instance of that impulse to visit the scenes familiar to them
                    through literature which afterwards acted on many of the great writers of Rome.
                    From this voyage to Greece Terence never returned. According to one account he
                    was lost at sea, according to another he died at Stymphalus in Arcadia, and
                    according to a third at Leucadia, from grief at the loss by shipwreck of his
                    baggage, containing a number of new plays which he had translated from Menander.
                    The old grammarian quoted by Suetonius states that he was ruined in fortune
                    through his intimacy with his noble friends. Another account speaks of him as
                    having left behind him property consisting of gardens, to the extent of twenty
                    acres, close to the Appian Way. It is further stated that his daughter was so
                    well provided for that she married a Roman knight.</p>
                <p>The tone of the prologues to Terence’s plays is for the most part apologetic, and
                    indicates a great sensitiveness to criticism. He constantly speaks of the
                    malevolence and detraction of an older poet, whose name is said to have been
                    Luscius Lavinius or Lanuvinus. The chief charge which his detractor brings
                    against him is that of <hi rend="italic">contaminatio,</hi> the combining in one
                    play of scenes out of different Greek plays. Terence justifies his practice by
                    that of the older poets, Naevius, Plautus, Ennius, whose careless freedom he
                    follows in preference to the “obscura diligentia” of his detractor. He
                    recriminates upon his adversary as one who, by his literal adherence to his
                    original, had turned good Greek plays into bad Latin ones. He justifies himself
                    from the charge of plagiarizing from Plautus and Naevius. In another prologue he
                    contrasts his own treatment of his subjects with the sensational extravagance of
                    others. He meets the charge of receiving assistance in the composition of his
                    plays by claiming, as a great honour, the favour which he enjoyed with those who
                    were the favourites of the Roman people.</p>
                <p>We learn from these prologues that the best Roman literature was ceasing to be
                    popular, and had come to rely on the patronage of the great. A consequence of
                    this change of circumstances was that comedy was no longer national in character
                    and sentiment, but had become imitative and artistic. The life which Terence
                    represents is that of a well-to-do-citizen class whose interests are
                    commonplace, but whose modes of thought and speech are refined, humane, and
                    intelligent. His characters are finely delineated and discriminated rather than
                    boldly conceived, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n201/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0201-0188"/> as they are in Plautus. Delicate irony and
                    pointed epigram take the place of broad humour. Love, in the form of pathetic
                    sentiment rather than of irregular passion, is the chief motive of his pieces.
                    His great characteristics are humanity and urbanity, and to this may be
                    attributed the attraction which he had for the two chief representatives of
                    these qualities in Roman literature,—Cicero and Horace. It was through the
                    comedies of Terence that the finer influences of the Epicurean philosophy—the
                    friendliness, the tolerance, the consideration for the feelings of others,
                    inferiors as well as equals, inculcated by that philosophy—entered into Roman
                    life and literature. The dissolving influence of that school on the severer
                    personal morality of the older Roman republic also entered into Roman life
                    through the same medium. But it was a great gain to the strong but rude Roman
                    character to learn, as it could from every line of Terence, lessons not only of
                    courtesy and social amenity but of genuine sympathy and consideration.</p>
                <p>Terence’s pre-eminence in art was recognized by the critics of the Augustan
                    age:</p>
                <p>“vincere Caecilius gravitate, Terentius arte."</p>
                <p>The art of his comedies consists in the clearness and simplicity with which the
                    situation is presented and developed, and in the consistency and moderation with
                    which his various characters play their part. But his great attraction to both
                    ancient and modern writers has been the purity and charm of his style, whether
                    employed in narrative or dialogue. This charm he derived from his familiarity
                    with the purest Latin idiom, as it was habitually used in the intimate
                    intercourse of the best Roman families, and also with the purest Attic idiom, as
                    it had been written and spoken a century before his own time. The fine Attic
                    flavour is more perceptible in his Latin than in the Greek of his
                    contemporaries. He makes no claim to the creative exuberance of Plautus, but he
                    is entirely free from his extravagance and mannerisms. The superiority of his
                    style over that of Lucilius, who wrote his satires a generation later, is almost
                    immeasurable. The best judges and the greatest masters of style in the best
                    period of Roman literature were his chief admirers in ancient times. Cicero
                    frequently reproduces his expressions, applies passages in his plays to his own
                    circumstances, and refers to his personages as typical representations of
                    character.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="italic">Ep. ad Earn.,</hi> i. 9, 19, and <hi rend="italic">Phil.,</hi> ii.
                    15.</p></note> Julius Caesar characterizes him as “puri sermonis amator.”
                    Horace, so depreciatory in general of the older literature, shows his
                    appreciation of Terence by the frequent reproduction in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satires</hi> and in his <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> of his language and his
                    philosophy of life. Quintilian applies to his writings the epithet
                    “elegantissima,” and in that connexion refers to the belief that they were the
                    work of Scipio Africanus. His works were studied and learned by heart by the
                    great Latin writers of the Renaissance, such as Erasmus and Melanchthon; and
                    Casaubon, in his anxiety that his son should write a pure Latin style,
                    inculcates on him the constant study of Terence. Montaigne applies to him the
                    phrase of Horace:</p>
                <p>“Liquidus puroque simillimus amni.”</p>
                <p>He speaks of “his fine expression, elegancy, and quaintness,” and adds, “he does
                    so possess the soul with his graces that we forget those of his fable.”<note

                    have been most appreciated in modern times. Sainte-Beuve, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouveaux Lundis,</hi> devotes to him two papers of delicate and
                    admiring criticism. He quotes Fénelon and Addison, “deux esprits polis et doux,
                    de la même famille littéraire,” as expressing their admiration for the
                    inimitable beauty and naturalness of one of his scenes. Fénelon is said to have
                    preferred him even to Molière. Sainte-Beuve calls Terence the bond of union
                    between Roman urbanity and the Atticism of the Greeks, and adds that it was in
                    the 17th century, when French literature was most truly Attic, that he was most
                    appreciated. Μ. Joubert is quoted<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The most famous edition of Terence is that of Bentley, published in 1726. More
                    recent editions are those of Parry, in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                    Classica,</hi> and of W. Wagner. The text has been edited by A. Flickeisen in
                    the Teubner series of classics. A number of editions of the separate plays have
                    been published recently both in England and in Germany. (W. Y. S.)</p>
