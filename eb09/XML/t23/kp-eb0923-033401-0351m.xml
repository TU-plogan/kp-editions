                    and from Fezzan southwards nearly to Lake Tchad, 25° to 15° N. lat. Their
                    westernmost settlements are the oases of Agram, Kawar, and Jebádo, their
                    northernmost the district of Qatrún within the Fezzan frontier, while south and

                    concentrated in the central region of Tibesti or Tu, whence they take their

                <p>The Tιbbus, who are not expressly mentioned under this name by any ancient or

                    whom Ptolemy already spoke doubtfully as Ethiopians (Negroes ?): <hi

                    ethnologists as a Negro or at least a Negroid people. <hi rend="superscript">

                    inferences are somewhat vague, he supplies sufficient evidence for a solution of
                    this difficult ethnological problem. There can be no doubt that the Teda, or
                    true Tibbu, probably identical with the Tedamansii, a branch of the Garamantes,
                    placed by Ptolemy south of the Samamycii in Tripolitana,<note anchored="true"

                    resembling their western Tuareg neighbours. They are a pure homogeneous race,
                    who have for ages undergone no perceptible change in their rocky homes, and who
                    are still distinguished by the regular features, long black ringletty hair,
                    haughty bearing, and fierce expression common to so many of the Berber and other
                    Hamitic peoples. Mostly of middle size, they are finely proportioned in all
                    their limbs, except the somewhat too small hands and feet, with lighter
                    complexion than that of the southern Dasa, and no trace of the flat nose, thick
                    tumid lips, or other marked characteristics of the true Negro. "Their women are
                    charming while still in the bloom of youth, unrivalled amongst their sisters of
                    North Africa for their physical beauty, pliant and graceful figures” (Keane’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Reclus,</hi> xi. p. 429). But there has been a general
                    displacement of the race southwards; and, while only a few still linger in the
                    northern Qatrún and Kufara districts, large numbers have since mediaeval times
                    penetrated into the Kanem, Bornu, Wadai, and Dar-Fúr regions of central Sudan.
                    Here they have everywhere merged with the natives, so that in the Dasa, Kauembu,
                    Kanuri, Baele, and Zogháwa groups the Tibbu race presents all the shades of
                    transition between the true Negro and the true Hanιite that are also found to
                    prevail between the blacks of western Sudan and the Tuareg Berbers, and between
                    the Nubas and other eastern Sudan Negroes and the Hamitic Gallas, Somali, and
                    Bejas.</p>
                <p>The same transitional stages are observed in the Tibbu forms of speech, which
                    constitute a wide-spread linguistic family, whose most archaic and purest branch
                    is the Tedaga of Tibesti (Nachtigal). Through the southern Dasaga the Tedaga
                    merges in the more highly developed and more recent Kanem, Bornu (Kanuri),
                    Ennedi (Baele), and Dar-Fúr (Zogháwa) dialects, which, owing to the absence of
                    grammatical gender and some other structural features, are usually classed as
                    Negro languages. But a Negro tongue could not have arisen among the Hamites of
                    the Tibesti uplands, and the explanation of this linguistic difficulty is
                    obviously the same as that of the physical puzzle. The Negro affinities of the
                    southern members of the group have arisen through assimilation with the original
                    and now partly displaced Negro idioms of central Sudan. There remains the final
                    difficulty that Tedaga itself has absolutely nothing in common with the Berber
                    or any other Hamitic tongue. If therefore it is neither Hamitic nor Negro, the
                    only two stock languages recognized by Lepsius in Africa <hi rend="italic">(op.
                    cit., passim),</hi> how is it to be placed? First of all Lepsius’s hasty
                    generalization, wholly inconsistent as it is with the conditions occurring in
                    other parts of the continent, must be unhesitatingly rejected. Room having thus
                    been found for other linguistic families, the Tedaga of Tibesti may be readily
                    explained as an independent evolution from a primeval Tibbu-Berber germ,
                    analogous to other linguistic evolutions in other isolated or inaccessible
                    highland regions, such as the Caucasus, the Pyrenees, and the Anahuac tableland.
                    The common germ, essentially evanescent in its nature, has long since perished,
                    or can no longer be detected, and the Tibou and Berber languages stand side by
                    side as now fundamentally distinct, while the two races still remain physically
                    one. The Tibbus are therefore a Hamitic people, who in their secluded rocky
                    homes have had time to evolve an independent form of speech, which* southwards
                    has become largely assimilated to the Sudanese Negro dialects.</p>
                <p>Lying on the track of the great caravan route between Fezzan and Lake Tchad, the
                    Tibbus have always been a predatory race, levying blackmail on the convoys
                    passing through their territory, maintaining intertribal feuds, and carrying on
                    constant warfare with the surrounding Berber and Sudanese populations. This,
                    combined with the severe struggle for existence in their inhospitable upland
                    valleys, has rendered them harsh, greedy, and suspicious, —sentiments reflected
                    in their hard features and stern expression. Till comparatively recent times all
                    were pagans, whence the term Kufra (Kufara), “Land of the Unbeliever,” applied
                    by the Arabs to the southern oases of Tripolitana. But for two or three
                    centuries they have been zealous Mohammedans, and some have even lately been
                    brought within the influence of the political Senúsíya sect (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tripoli,</hi> below). They are a frugal race, living mostly on
                    goat’s milk, dates, berries, durrha, and the fruit of the dúm-palm; nevertheless
                    they are of robust constitution and remarkably agile. They are also intelligent,
                    crossing the wilderness by a sort of instinct quite unintelligible to the
                    stranger, and in all ordinary transactions they display surprising tact and
                    shrewdness. The tribal organization embraces <hi rend="italic">dardai</hi> or
                    headmen, <hi rend="italic">maina</hi> or nobles, and the common folk, while the
                    unwritten law of custom rules supreme over all classes. The women, who are
                    orderly and industrious, are well treated, and the polygamy allowed by the law
                    is little practised. But the vendetta is still a social institution. <hi
