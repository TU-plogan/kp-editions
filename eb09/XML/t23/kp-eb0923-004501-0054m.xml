                    country. From them it has since been extended to a great many others mostly
                    belonging to the southern portion of the New World, now recognized by
                    ornithologists as forming a distinct Family of <hi rend="italic">Oscines,</hi>
                    and usually considered to be allied to the <hi rend="italic">FringiUidae
                    (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Finch,</hi> vol. ix. p. 191); but, as may be
                    inferred from Prof. Parker’s remarks in the Zoological <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi> (x. pp. 252, 253, and 267), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tanagridae</hi> are a “feebler” form, and thereby bear out the opinion based on
                    the examination of many types both of Birds and Mammals as to the lower
                    morphological rank of the Neotropical Fauna as a whole <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 743).</p>
                <p>The Tanagers are a group in which Mr Sclater has for many years interested
                    himself, and his latest treatment of them is contained in the British Museum <hi
                    rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> (xi. pp. 49-307). Therein he admits the existence
                    of 375 species, which he arranges in 59 genera, forming six Subfamilies, <hi
                    rend="italic">Procniatinae, Euphoniinae, Tanagrinae, Lamprotinae,
                    Phoenicophilinae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pitylinae.</hi> These are of very
                    unequal extent, for, while the first of them consists of but a single species,
                    <hi rend="italic">Procnias tersa,—</hi> the position of which may be for several
                    reasons still open to doubt,—the third includes more than 200. Nearly all are
                    birds of small size, the largest barely exceeding a Song-Thrush. Most of them
                    are remarkable for their gaudy colouring, and this is especially the case in
                    those forming the genus called by Mr Sclater, as by most other authors, <hi
                    rend="italic">Calliste,</hi> a term inadmissible through preoccupation, to which
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Tanagra</hi> of right seems to belong, while that
                    which he names <hi rend="italic">Tanagra</hi> should probably be known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Thraupis.</hi> The whole Family is almost confined to the
                    Neotropical Region, and there are several forms peculiar to the Antilles; but
                    not a tenth of the species reach even southern Mexico, and not a dozen appear in
                    the northern part of that country. Of the genus <hi rend="italic">Pyranga,</hi>
                    which has the most northern range of all, three if not four species are common
                    summer immigrants to some part or other of the United States, and two of them,
                    <hi rend="italic">P. rubra</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P. aestiva,—</hi> there
                    known respectively as the Scarlet Tanager and the Summer Redbird, — reach even
                    the Dominion of Canada, visiting as well, though accidentally, Bermuda. <hi
                    rend="italic">P. aestiva</hi> has a western representative, <hi rend="italic">P.
                    cooperi,</hi> which by some authors is not recognized as a distinct species. The
                    males of all these are clad in glowing red, <hi rend="italic">P. rubra</hi>
                    having, however, the wings and tail black. The remaining species, <hi
                    rend="italic">P. ludoviciana,</hi> the males of which are mostly yellow and
                    black, with the head only red, does not appear eastward of the Missouri plains,
                    and has not so northerly a range. Another species, <hi rend="italic">P.
                    hepatica,</hi> has just shewn itself within the limits of the United States. In
                    all these the females are plainly attired; but generally among the Tanagers,
                    however bright may be their coloration, both sexes are nearly alike in plumage.
                    Little has been recorded of the habits of the species of Central or South
                    America, but those of the north have been as closely observed as the rather
                    retiring nature of the birds renders possible, and it is known that insects,
                    especially in the larval condition, and berries afford the greater part of their
                    food. They have a pleasing song, and build a shallow nest, in which the eggs,
                    generally 3 in number and of a greenish-blue marked with brown and purple, are
                    laid.</p>
                <p>On a whole the <hi rend="italic">Tanagridae,</hi> may perhaps be considered to
                    hold the same relation to the <hi rend="italic">FringiUidae</hi> as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Icteridae</hi> do to the <hi rend="italic">Sturnidae</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mniotiltidae</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Sylviidae</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Turdidae,</hi> in each case the purely New-World Family being
                    the “feebler” type. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
