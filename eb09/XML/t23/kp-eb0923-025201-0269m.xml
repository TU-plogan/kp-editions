                    commentator, he might have led a happy and enviable life, had not the vanity of
                    the literary idea led him into a false position. His <hi rend="italic">Persian
                    Princess</hi> (1711) and his <hi rend="italic">Electra</hi> (1714) gained no
                    distinction. In 1726 <hi rend="italic">The Double Falsehood</hi> had a certain
                    vogue, partly from Theobald’s pretence that the greater part of the play was by
                    Shakespeare. In 1717 he commenced a series of papers (not to “The Censor,” as
                    has sometimes been stated, but under that title) which appeared in Mist’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Weekly Journal;</hi> these do not seem to have been highly thought
                    of by his contemporaries, but they were successful in gaining for Theobald not a
                    few enemies, among whom Dennis may be named. Seven or eight years later
                    Theoba1d’s censorious tendencies had intensified rather than moderated, and in
                    1726 he ventured to attack the most eminent literary man of the day in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Shakespear Restored, or a Specimen of the many Errors as well
                    committed as unamended by Mr Pope in his edition of this Poet.</hi> Two years
                    later the censor was himself castigated severely, and, as the dedicatee of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Dunciad,</hi> he had long an unenviable notoriety; as readers
                    of the famous satire will remember, he occupied the place of chief victim until
                    replaced by Colley Cibber in 1743. In the matter of Shakespeare editing,
                    however, he had the advantage of his powerful rival. When in 1733 Theobald
                    published his edition of Shakespeare in seven volumes, that of Pope had to go to
                    the wall. Lewis Theobald wrote other dramas besides those already mentioned, and
                    translated plays from Sophocles and Aristophanes, besides a rendering of Plato’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> and a part translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey</hi>; but for none of these things is he now remembered. The student of
                    English history might find it worth while to glance through Theobald’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Raleigh</hi> (1719). He died in 1744.</p>
