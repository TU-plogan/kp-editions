                    The ground of the future stuff was formed by a number of parallel strings called
                    the <hi rend="italic">warp,</hi> having their upper ends attached to a
                    horizontal beam and drawn taut by weights hung from their lower ends. In the
                    early Greek loom each warp thread had a separate weight (see fig. 1). On the
                    number of the warp strings the fineness and width of the stuff depended. The
                    strings of the <hi rend="italic">weft</hi> were interlaced at right angles to
                    those of the warp, and the combination of the two formed the woven stuff or <hi
                        rend="italic">web.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">weft</hi> was so called from
                    its being “wafted” in and out of the warp; it is also often called the <hi
                        rend="italic">woof,</hi> though more correctly the woof is the same as the
                    web or finished stuff. The threads of the weft were wound round a sort of bobbin
                    on a pivot which was made to revolve inside a hollow boat-shaped piece of wood
                    pointed at both ends so as to pass easily between the threads of the warp. This
                    is called the <hi rend="italic">shuttle.</hi> The thread passed out through a
                    hole in the side of the shuttle, the inner pivot revolving as the thread was
                    delivered between the strings of the warp. In order to make the weft interlace
                    in the warp some of the upright strings were pulled forward out of the general
                    plane in which the warp hung; this was done in the simplest way by a reed, which
                    divided the threads into two sets called <hi rend="italic">leaves</hi> and thus
                    formed an opening called the <hi rend="italic">shred,</hi> through which the
                    shuttle could pass, as shown in fig. 1. Another way, applicable to more
                    complicated ornamental weaving, was to have a series of threads attached to the
                    warp at right angles, so that the weaver could pull any of the warp threads away
                    from the rest, thus allowing the shuttle to pass in front of or behind any
                    special warp strings. By a very simple mechanical contrivance these threads were
                    worked by a foot treadle, thus leaving the weaver’s hands free to manage the
                        shuttle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These
                            dividing sticks are called in French “batons à deux”; in the simplest
                            kind of weaving only one is required. The use of treadles and “spring
                            staves” is more applicable to the low loom, in which the warp is
                            strained in a horizontal position.</p></note> In the simplest sort of
                    weaving first one and then the other half of the warp threads were pulled
                    forward, and so a plain regularly interlaced stuff was woven. The next stage was
                    to make a cloth with coloured stripes, by using successively two shuttles
                    containing different-coloured threads. In a chequered cloth the warp was made of
                    two-coloured threads stretched in successive bands, and the cross stripes of the
                    weft were woven in by the two shuttles. To form a more complicated pattern the
                    weft must not cross the warp alternately: the design is formed by either the
                    warp or the weft predominating on the surface in certain places. In all cases
                    each thread of the weft must be driven home to its place after each stroke of
                    the shuttle. In the earliest times this was done by beating the weft with a
                    wooden sword-shaped implement<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Lat. <hi rend="italic">spαthα.</hi></p></note>
                    introduced between the strings of the warp; but later a heavy comb-shaped tool

                    which passed between the warp and drove home at one blow a longer length of the
                    weft. An upright loom such as has been described is shown clearly in some of the
                    wall paintings from Thebes, dating about 1600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and
                    in other earlier ones from Beni-Hasan. A very similar loom is represented on a

                    Penelope and the never-finished piece of stuff (see fig. 1). In this interesting
                    painting the upper band has simple geometrical ornaments, such as occur on
                    archaic Greek vases; the next has figures of winged men and gryphons. This sort
                    of loom is still used in Scandinavian countries for tapestry.<note

                    strings of the warp; this method must have been very inconvenient, as the whole
                    warp could swing to and fro. A very obvious improvement, introduced in some
                    countries at an early date, was to have a second beam, round which the lower
                    ends of the warp could be wound. In Scandinavian countries the use of weights
                    continued till modern times. In the fateloom of the sagas these weights are
                    heroes’ skulls, while the shuttle is a sword.</p>
                <p>Some simple form of weaving seems to have been practised by prehistoric man at a
                    very early stage of development. Fig. 3 shows an example of coarse flaxen stuff
                    from the lake-dwellings of Switzerland, dating from the Stone Age. Wool appears
                    to have been the first substance used, as no skill is required to prepare it for
                    spinning. Weaving was specially the duty of women, and even in the Middle Ages
                    in Europe it was, in some countries, considered a specially feminine
                        employment.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the

                <p>The Egyptians were famed for the beauty of their woven stuffs, and almost
                    incredible stories are related of the fineness of their linen, such as a pallium
                    sent by King Amasis to the Spartans, which, Herodotus (iii. 47) says, was made
                    of yarn containing no less than 360 threads; the figures woven on this were
                    partly of cotton and partly of gold thread. Herodotus also mentions a wonderful
                    pallium sent by the same king to the shrine of Athene at Lindus. Few examples of
                    the fine and richly ornamented sorts of Egyptian stuffs now exist, though we
                    have immense quantities of the coarse linen in which mummies were wrapped. This,
                    though coarse, is closely woven, and usually has in every inch many more threads
                    to the warp than to the weft.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>(7.v.). In Egypt linen was specially employed for religious purposes, such as
                    priestly and royal vestments, because it harbours dirt less than wool or cotton,
                    which were also worn by the Egyptians, and it was used to bandage mummies,
                    because it was thought not to engender worms. Though priests were allowed to
                    wear outer garments of wool, they were obliged to put them off before entering a
                    sacred place.</p>
                <p>The Phoenicians were celebrated for their weaving, as for their skill in other
                    arts. Their purple linen, dyed with the murex, was specially valued; Tyre and
                    Sidon were the chief places where this was made. Babylon, Carthage, Sardis,
                    Miletus, and Alexandria were all famous seats of textile manufacture in the time
                    of Herodotus.</p>
                <p>Though no specimens of Assyrian textiles remain, some notion of their richness of

                    treated with great decorative skill. A large marble slab from the same palace is
                    covered with an elaborate textile pattern in low relief, and is evidently a

                    classical authors. One indication of the patterns commonly used at an early
                    period is given by the designs on much of the archaic Greek pottery, which
                    clearly has ornament derived from textile sources. Vol. xix. p. 607, fig. 16,
                    shows examples of these; simple bands, chequers, and zigzags would naturally be
                    the first steps towards more elaborate patterns. Again, recent excavations at
                    Orchomenus and Tiryns have brought to light examples of ceiling and wall
                    decoration the motives of which are obviously derived from textile patterns. A
                    stone ceiling at Orchomenus has in relief a carpet-like pattern, and the painted
                    wall-stucco of the Tiryns palace has many varieties of coarse but effective

                        rend="italic">(Ion,</hi> 1141-1162) gives a glowing description of a peplos
                    which belonged to the temple of Apollo at Delphi, on which was depicted the
                    firmament of heaven, with Apollo Helios in his chariot, surrounded by the chief
                    stars and constellations. At Athens a new peplos, ornamented with the battle of
                    the gods and the giants, was woven for the gold and ivory statue of Athene in
                    the Parthenon every fifth year, and was solemnly carried in procession at the
                    greater Panathenaea. Similarly at Olympia a new peplos was woven by sixteen
                    women, and displayed every fifth year at the Olympian games in honour of Hera.
                    It appears probable that these magnificent peploi were not used as garments,
                    which would have partly concealed the splendour of Phidias’s gold and ivory
                    statues, but were suspended over them like a mediaeval baldacchino. Very
                    possibly, however, most of the elaborate work on them was embroidery done by the
                    needle, and not loom or textile work.</p>
                <p>The Romans under the late republic and the empire possessed immense stores of the
                    most magnificent textiles of every description, such as the splendid collection

                    II. of Pergamum (2d cent, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> A very costly cloth
                    of gold was called by the Romans “attalica,” after Attalus. The C. Cestius who
                    died about the middle of the 1st century B.c., and who is buried in the existing
                    pyramid in Rome, left orders in his will that his body was to be wrapped in
                    certain attalica; but, as this was forbidden by a sumptuary law, his heirs sold
                    the gold stuff and with the proceeds had two colossal bronze statues made, which
                    were set outside the tomb. The feet of one of these have been found with an
                    inscribed pedestal recording the above-mentioned facts. The size of the statue
                    shows that the attalica must have been worth a very great sum. Examples of large
                    prices given by Romans for woven stuffs are recorded by Pliny <hi rend="italic"
                        >(H.N.,</hi> viii. 48): Metellus Scipio bought some hangings from Babylon
                    for 800,000 sesterces, and other similar stuffs were bought by Nero for four
                    millions of sesterces (about £3360). Costly tapestry from Babylon is mentioned
                    by Plautus <hi rend="italic">(Stich.,</hi> IL, ii. 54), Silius Italicus (xiv.

                    mentions woven tapestries with figures of Britons being used at theatrical
                    shows: “Purpurea intexti tollant aulaea Britanni.” Other tapestries with scenes
                    from the story of Theseus and Ariadne are mentioned by Catullus <hi

                    More than 300 pieces have been bought for the South Kensington Museum. They are
                    of various dates, apparently ranging from the 4th to the 6th or 7th century <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The earliest are of purely classical style: some
                    have badly designed but very decorative figures of pagan deities, with their
                    names in Greek <hi rend="italic">—e.g.</hi> Hermes and Apollo; others have
                    figures driving chariots drawn by two centaurs, or marine gods, or long bands of
                    animals—bears, lions, stags, ducks, and many others. These are used to decorate
                    linen tunics or pieces of stuff about 2 feet square. The later examples appear
                    to be Coptic vestments of various shapes, and are decor ated with rude figures
                    of St George and other Oriental saints, each with a nimbus. These ornaments are
                    done by true tapestry weaving, the weft pattern being in brilliantly coloured
                    wools on a flaxen warp. Tn some cases the colours, especially the magnificent
                    reds and blues, are as bright as if they were new. Though in all cases the
                    figure drawing is rude, the decorative value is very great.</p>
                <p>From the 6th to the 13th century Byzantium became the capital of all the
                    industrial arts, and in none is its influence more obvious than in that of
                    weaving. There the arts of ancient Greece and of old Rome met and were fused
                    with the artistic notions of ancient Egypt, Assyria, Persia, and Asia Minor, and
                    this combination produced a fresh and very active art spirit, which for many
                    centuries dominated the whole civilized world. As regards weaving, this new
                    development was strengthened by the introduction of silk into Europe in the
                    reign of Justinian, and many specimens of early silk fabrics have lasted down to
                    the present time, partly through their being safe against moths. The silken
                    stuffs found in the tombs of Charlemagne and other kings, though perhaps not
                    themselves as early as the 6th century, show one class of design used in
                    Byzantium in the time of Justinian. Some of these combine the figure-subjects of
                    ancient Rome with the stronger decorative beauty of the East. Chariot races in
                    the circus, consuls and emperors enthroned in state, gladiatorial fights with
                    lions, and other classical subjects occur, arranged in medallions or wreaths,
                    set in close rows, so as to fill up the ground. Again, mixed with these
                    classical scenes are designs of purely Assyrian origin, such as the sacred tree
                    between two guardian beasts, closely resembling the designs of 2000 B.c. The
                    manufacture of these rich fabrics was carried on, not only in Byzantium, but
                    also in many towns of Greece proper, such as Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, all of
                    which were specially famed for their silk textiles. During the same time, the
                    6th to the 12th century, Baghdad, Damascus, Ispahan, and many other towns in
                    Persia and Syria were producing woven stuffs of the richest materials and
                    designs; names of reigning caliphs are sometimes mingled with Ar-abicsentences
                    from the Koran and other sacred books, which are introduced freely among the
                    intricate patterns with the most richly decorative effect. By this means some
                    existing specimens of the 8th to the 10th century can be dated. Fig. 4 shows a
                    16th-century example of the finest Persian damask in silk and gold,—a
                    masterpiece of textile design.</p>
                <p>According to the usual story, Roger of Sicily, who in 1147 made a successful raid
                    on the shores of Attica and took Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, carried off as
                    prisoners a number of Greek weavers, whom he settled at Palermo and made the
                    founders of the royal factory for silk weaving. This story is doubtful, for the
                    Saracenic inhabitants of Sicily had apparently been producing fine silken stuffs
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n226/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0226-0209"/> long before the 12th century. In part,
                    however, the story may be true; certainly an impetus was given to the weaving
                    industry of Palermo in the 12th century, and for about two centuries Sicily
                    became the chief seat in Europe for the production of the finest woven stuffs. A
                    large number of examples of these beautiful fabrics still exist, showing an
                    immense variety of designs, all of which are imagined with the highest
                    decorative skill,—perfect masterpieces of textile art, combining freedom of
                    invention and grace of drawing with that slight amount of mechanical stiffness
                    which is specially suited to the requirements of the loom. One of the earliest
                    existing specimens, which shows the existence of the fabrique before the time of
                    Roger I., is a piece of silk stuff in which the body of St Cuthbert at Durham
                    was wrapped when his relics were translated in 1104; this was found at the
                    opening of his grave in 1827, and is now preserved in Durham cathedral library.
                    The figures woven on it show an interesting combination of Western and Oriental
                    art. Birds and conventional ornaments of purely Eastern style are mingled with
                    designs taken from late Roman mosaics,—the whole being blended with great skill
                    into a highly decorative pattern.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Sicilian silks of the 12th to the 14th century were mostly used for
                    ecclesiastical vestments, altar frontals, and the like; and the fact that
                    examples have survived in almost all countries of Europe shows how important and
                    far-reaching a trade in them must once have been carried on. The favourite
                    designs were the sun breaking through a cloud from whence rays of light are
                    issuing, or conventionally treated ships, fountains, islands, castles, and an
                    immense variety of birds and beasts, such as swans, mallards, eagles, lions,
                    cheetahs, hounds, giraffes, antelopes, and others. Some specimens have
                    siren-like female forms, with floating hair, casting nets, leaning down from
                    palm trees, or issuing from shells. Others, rather later in style, have winged
                    angel-like figures. In many cases the Assyrian sacred tree and its guardian
                    beasts occur, and very frequently borders with sham Arabic letters are
                    introduced,—a survival of the time when real sentences were woven into the
                    fabrics of Persia and Egypt, probably intended as a visible sign that the stuff
                    was the genuine product of Saracenic looms. All these are perfect masterpieces
                    of textile art, and have never since been rivalled either in beauty of design or
                    in skilful use of gold and colours. Fig. 5 shows a characteristic example;

                <p>In the 14th century the chief centre of fine silk weaving was transferred from
                    Palermo to Lucca, Florence, Milan, Venice, and other towns in northern Italy,
                    and a different class of design, less rich in fancy, but scarcely less beautiful
                    in effect, came into vogue. The designs of these 14th and</p>
                <p>15th century textiles were chiefly conventional adaptations of natural foliage
                    and flowers, arranged with great beautv of line and wealth of decorative effect;
                    among the most beautiful is scroll-work of vines with graceful curving lines of
                    leaf and tendril. An extremely rich design, largely employed throughout the 15th
                    century, was made from the artichoke plant,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>This is usually called the pine-apple pattern; but it

                    the industrial arts, and very beautiful stuffs were woven there with designs of
                    mingled Oriental and Italian style,—probably the work of Mohammedan weavers (see
                    fig. 7).</p>
                <p>In all these Oriental, Sicilian, and early Italian stuffs gold thread is used in
                    a very lavish and effective way. It was made very skilfully, the richest effect
                    being produced with little metal by thickly gilding fine vellum skins with gold
                    leaf; the vellum was then cut into very thin strips <pb break="no"

                    closely as to look like a solid gold wire. In and since the 15th century gold
                    thread has been made by twisting a thin ribbon of gilt silver round a silken
                    core. In this way much less gold is required, as the silver ribbon is gilded
                    before being drawn out to its final thinness, and it is thus liable to tarnish,
                    oλving to the partial exposure of the silver surface. In classical times
                    attalica and other gold stuffs were made of solid gold wire beaten out with the

                    opened and 36 lb of gold thread taken out of it and melted.</p>
                <p>Throughout the Middle Ages cloth of gold was largely employed for ecclesiastical
                    and royal purposes. In some cases the whole of the visible surface was formed of
                    gold thread, producing the utmost splendour of effect. Westminster Abbey still
                    possesses a magnificent gold cope of the 15th century, in almost perfect
                    brilliance of preservation. In the 13th and 14th centuries Cyprus and Lucca were
                    specially famed for their gold stuffs, and the royal inventories of France and
                    England show that the kings possessed stores of this to an immense value. The
                    enormous sum of £11 a yard<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>Equal to quite £50 of modern money.</p></note> is recorded to have
                    been given for a “cloth of estate” in the private accounts of Henry VII. This
                    was a cloth to hang over the royal throne, and must have been unusually wide, as
                    other cloth of gold at the same time was bought for 38s. the yard. Various names
                    were at different times given to textiles which were wholly or in part woven in

                    many of which were of great beauty. In the use of the needle the women of
                    England were especially skilful, and rich English embroideries were much

                    example of 13th-century design. Pictures in English MSS. show that the low loom
                    was mainly used,— this being the most convenient for ordinary weaving.<note

                    England was specially celebrated for its wool and woollen stuffs, and even at
                    the present day English wool is used for the Gobelin tapestries; in the 15th and
                    16th centuries it was largely imported into Flanders. In the 14th century Bath
                    produced the finest woollen cloth, and that of Worcester was equally celebrated;
                    in the 15th century the production of woollen stuff was a great source of wealth
                    to Norwich and other towns in the eastern counties. A special sort of woollen
                    yarn took its name from Worstead in Norfolk, where it was made; it had a closer
                    and harder twist than most woollen thread, and thus could be made up into cloth
                    of special fineness, which was used for chasubles and other vestments, as is
                    recorded in the inventories of York, Exeter, and other cathedrals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Old English Fames for Textiles.—</hi> A large number of names

                    silk. Phrases such as “silk of brydges” (Bruges), “silk dornex,” from Dorneck in
                    Flanders, and “sheets of raynes” (Rheims) often occur. A large number of other
                    similar names are to be met with in mediaeval writings.<note anchored="true"

                            similar blunders.</p></note></p>
                <p>Space will not allow a description of the textile work in each separate country.
                    That of Italy and the East was by far the most important throughout the Middle
                    Ages. Even Chinese textiles of gold and silk were imported into the west of
                    Europe, and were sometimes used for ecclesiastical purposes. Mediaeval vestments
                    of Chinese stuff still exist, the shape and added borders of which show that
                    they date from as early as the 14th century. These fabrics exactly resemble in
                    design and workmanship some which are woven in China at the present day. A very
                    interesting survival of the mediaeval style of weaving exists in Sweden and
                    other Scandinavian countries. Articles of dress, counterpanes, table-covers, and
                    the like are woven by the peasantry in a simple, highly decorative way, with
                    patterns which have altered little during the last three or four centuries.
                    Though coarse in texture, many of these are of great artistic beauty: nothing
                    but an occasional use <pb break="no"

                    of style. Strong marks of Oriental influence are visible in these fine patterns,
                    but the method of weaving is purely native, —probably very like what the edicts
                    of Louis IX. call “tapisserie nostrez.” Very beautiful fabrics are still
                    produced in India, old designs being followed, and woven in the simplest form of
                    loom. Fig. 8 shows an example of a modern Indian loom used by the hill weavers.
                    In such looms the richest materials, such as gold and silk, and the most
                    elaborate patterns are woven, often by travelling weavers who can set up their
                    -whole apparatus in a very short time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Carpets.</hi></p>
                <p>Carpet weaving was essentially an Oriental art, and was the natural product of a
                    dry mudless country, where little furniture was used and the shoes were removed
                    on entering a building. Till the 16 th century carpets were almost unknown in
                    France and England, except for royal personages and for the sanctuaries of
                    cathedrals and important churches. In the latter case they were usually laid in
                    front of the high altar, and thus carried on to the floor the richness of colour
                    which ornamented the walls and vault. Oriental carpets frequently occur in
                    cathedral inventories among the other rich treasures of foreign or native make
                    which adorned the building. They were first employed in England for domestic
                    purposes by Queen Eleanor of Castile and her suite, in the latter part of the
                    13th century. In the palaces of Spain they were introduced much earlier, owing
                    to the presence of the Moors in southern Spain. In many cases they were used for
                    wall hangings, and the smaller ones to cover tables and other furniture, as is
                    represented in many 15th-century Italian pictures. Though few examples of
                    Oriental carpets exist earlier in date than the 15th century, yet the
                    manufacture was carried on in the highest state of perfection centuries before.
                    An example of the 14th century is preserved in a private collection at Vienna;
                    it was originally made as a hanging for the Kaaba at Mecca.<note anchored="true"

                    most perfect productions of the weaver’s art, and till the 16th century were
                    masterpieces of design and splendour of colour. Usually they were woven of wool
                    or of camels’ or goats’ hair, with a separate warp and weft of flax; but many
                    magnificent carpets were also made of silk mixed with gold thread. This
                    extravagance of luxury produced an effect, at least as regards the use of silk,
                    but little superior to that of fine wool or camel’s hair, as the special beauty
                    of the silken gloss is seen on the sides, not on the ends of the silk thread.
                    Pile carpets are woven in a very different way from ordinary textiles: short
                    tufts of wool or silk are knotted on the warp so that the ends of the threads
                    which form the pattern project, and these are cut down by shears to a uniform
                    surface, thus forming a sort of textile mosaic. Each row is firmly fixed by a
                    shoot of linen weft-thread thrown across the web, and then carefully beaten down
                    -with the batten.</p>
                <p>Various classes of ornament occur in these magnificent Oriental carpets; one
                    variety has stiff geometrical patterns, the motives of which appear to be taken
                    from mosaics or tiles. Another and still more beautiful sort, manufactured
                    especially at Ispahan (see fig. 9), has elaborate flowing designs of flower
                    forms, sometimes mixed with figures of cheetahs, lions, antelopes, and birds, in
                    a few cases combined with human figures. Mr W. Morris, in his valuable lecture
                    on textile fabrics (London, 1884), traces three stages of design,—first, a pure
                    flowing style, closely resembling the early stucco mural reliefs of Cairo;
                    secondly, a similar style blended with animal forms; and thirdly, a purely
                    floral style, flowing in its lines and very fantastic and ingenious in its
                    patterns; this last he thinks belongs to about the time of Shah Abbas, and
                    lasted from about 1550 to 1650,—the culminating period of Oriental art.<note

                            establishing the dates of carpet patterns is given by many mediaeval
                            Italian pictures, in which Oriental carpets are often represented with
                            wonderful minuteness and appreciation.</p></note> Since then there has
                    been a distinct degradation of style, though in many cases older patterns have
                    been worked from and very perfect work produced. At the present day the
                    influence of European taste is rapidly destroying this survival of the best
                    class of design, and especially is introducing the most harsh and discordant
                    colouring in place of the glorious rich hues of the earlier Oriental
                    weavers.</p>
                <p>Though no existing specimens can be pointed out, it appears probable that the
                    “tapisserie Saracenois” of Louis IX.’s edicts (1226-1270) refers to pile carpets
                    made by French weavers after the Oriental fashion.<note anchored="true"

                    across the warp with a wooden needle called a <hi rend="italic">broach.</hi> It
                    is a sort of link between textile work and embroidery, from which it differs in
                    having its stitches applied, not to a finished web, but to the stretched strings
                    of a warp.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In tapestry
                            the weft stitches are put in loosely and carefully pressed home, so that

                    loom, and the whole process, though requiring much skill, is mechanically of the
                    simplest kind. It is very probable that many of the woven hangings used in
                    ancient Egypt, Greece, and other countries were true tapestry; but little is
                    known on this point. Till after the 12th century, in northern Europe, embroidery
                    seems to have served the place of tapestry, as, for example, in the wrongly
                    named Bayeux tapestry (see vol. viii. p. 162); while in the south of Europe and
                    in Oriental countries its place was supplied by the rich silken textiles and
                    pile carpets mentioned above.</p>
                <p>In the 14th century tapestry began to be largely made, especially in Flanders,
                    where the craft of weaving became very important at an early time. The designs
                    on the very few existing samples of 14th-century tapestry closely resemble those
                    of contemporary wall painting. A characteristic early specimen in the Louvre has
                    rows of medallions, each containing a scene from the life of St Martin, with two
                    or three figures treated in a very simply decorative way. The spaces between the
                    circles are filled up with a stiff geometrical ornament. To the end of the 14th
                    century belongs the magnificent tapestry in Angers cathedral, on which are
                    represented scenes from the Apocalypse; these were made at Arras, the chief seat
                    of the tapestry manufacture, both for quantity and quality. Hence the name <hi
                        rend="italic">arras</hi> (Italian <hi rend="italic">arazzι)</hi> came to
                    mean any sort of tapestry, wherever it was made. Another magnificent series of
                    arras work is preserved in Rheims cathedral, with designs from the history of
                    Clovis; these date from the middle of the 15th century. In the 14th century
                    Flanders produced enormous quantities of woven stuffs. At that time twentyseven
                    streets were occupied by the weavers of Ghent; in 1382 there were 50,000 weavers
                    in Louvain; and at Ypres there is said to have been a still larger number. From
                    about 1450 to 1500 was the golden age for tapestry, especially in Bruges and
                    Arras, where large quantities of the most magnificent historical pieces were
                    woven from designs supplied by painters of the Van Eyck school. The Flemish
                    tapestries of that time are perfect models of textile art, rich in colour,
                    strong in decorative effect, graceful in drawing and composition, and arranged
                    with consummate skill to suit the exigencies of the loom and the aesthetic
                    requirements of wall decoration. A very beautiful example of this class exists
                    at Hampton Court, hung in the dark under the gallery in the great hall,—a
                    striking contrast to the clever but artistically degraded tapestries of half a
                    century later, which hang round the main walls of the hall. Other fine examples
                    exist in the Cluny, Bern, and other museums, and especially in Madrid<note

                            of all countries Spain is the richest in tapestry of the 15th and 16th
                            centuries. The royal collection contains 2000 large pieces. Rich stores
                            also belong to the principal cathedrals, such as Toledo, which on the
                            feast of Corpus Christi is completely hung round with tapestry outside
                            as well as inside. In the 17th century tapestry looms were worked in
                            Spain under royal patronage. One of Velazquez’s finest pictures in the
                            Madrid Gallery (Las Hilanderas) represents the visit of some court
                            ladies to a tapestry fabrique, in which women are working the
                        looms.</p></note> —in the royal collection and in that of the duke of
                    Alva—and elsewhere in Spain. Though very rich and varied in effect, the tapestry
                    of the best period usually is woven with not more than twenty different tints of
                    wool,—half tints and gradations being got by hatching one colour into another.
                    In the 16th century about sixty colours were principally employed in the still
                    fine but rapidly deteriorating tapestry of that period; and in the laborious but
                    artistically worthless productions of the Gobelin factory more than 14,000
                    differently tinted wools are now used.</p>

                    textile art, of the richest decorative effect. These were worked very soon after
                    1500 (see fig. 10). The influence of Raphael and his school succeeded that of
                    the 15th-century Flemish painters, and was utterly destructive of true art value
                    in tapestry. Raphael’s cartoons, fine as they are in composition, are designed
                    without the least reference to textile requirements, and are merely large
                    pictures, which the weavers had to copy as best they might. This new style,
                    which reduced the art to a feeble copyism of painting, gave the death-blow to
                    the production of really fine tapestry. Brussels became the chief place for the
                    manufacture after the taking of Arras by Louis XI. in 1477, and its weavers with
                    wonderful skill imitated any sort of painting that was put before them. Cartoons
                    were drawn by several of Raphael’s pupils, such as Giulio Romano and Giovanni da
                    Udine, and by Mabuse, Michiel Coxcie, Bernard van Orley, and other Italianized
                    Flemish painters.</p>
                <p>In 1539 Francis I. founded a factory for tapestry at Fontainebleau, and soon
                    after other high looms were set up in Paris, examples from which still exist and
                    show a rapid degradation of style. In 1603 a new factory was started in Paris
                    under royal patronage, in the workshop of a family of dyers named Gobelin, after
                    whom the new factory was named (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gobelin).</hi> The
                    Gobelin looms were first worked by weavers from Flanders, who soon taught the
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n230/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0230-0213"/> mysteries of the craft to a number of French
                    workmen. Cartoons were supplied by Simon Vouet and other distinguished French
                    painters. In the reign of Louis XIV. a great impulse was given to the factory,
                    and from 1667 the whole establishment became the property of the crown. Louis
                    XIV.’s minister, Colbert, did much to encourage this and other industries.
                    Charles Le Brun the painter was made director of the works, and a number of
                    artists prepared the cartoons under his supervision. In the 18th century Coypel,
                    Jouvenet, Boucher, Watteau, and many other popular painters made designs, often
                    of great size and elaboration, for the Gobelin looms, but all in the very worst
                    possible taste; these include large series of sacred, mythological, and
                    historical subjects, landscapes, sea-pieces, and even portraits,—the last being
                    perhaps the most ridiculous misuse of the textile art that could possibly be
                    invented. Other tapestry looms were worked in the 18th century at Aubusson,
                    Felletin, and other places in France.</p>
                <p>High-warp looms appear to have been worked in England in the 15th century, though
                    by far the greater part of the rich stores of tapestry in this country came from
                    Flanders. One very beautiful example of English work of this time exists in St
                    Mary’s Hall at Coventry; it represents the marriage of Henry VI. Part of another
                    series with the marriage of Henry VII. is preserved in a house in Cornwall. In
                    the latter part of the 15th and the first half of the 16th century enormous sums
                    were spent by the rich in England on Flemish tapestry. Cardinal Wolsey’s private
                    accounts and inventories, which still exist,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>See Law, <hi rend="italic">Hampton Court Palace,</hi>
                            London, 1885.</p></note> give an astonishing picture of the wealth which
                    he lavished on the adornment of his palace at Hampton Court. In 1522 he bought
                    132 large pieces of Brussels tapestry, woven w <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi>
                    ith Scriptural subjects, and mostly made to order, so as to fit exactly the
                    various wall spaces. He also bought large quantities of costly Oriental carpets.
                    In the inventories are enumerated “foot carpets,” “table carpets,” and “window
                    carpets,” “hanging peces,” “borders with arms,” and “window peces,” the last
                    being strips of tapestry woven in narrow lengths to fit the sills and jambs of
                    windows. Among the “wall peces,” in addition to the numerous sacred subjects,
                    are mentioned mythological scenes, romances, historical pieces, and “hangings of
                    verdures,” the last being decorative work in which trees and foliage formed the
                    main design, with accessory figures of hunting, hawking, and the like. The
                    catalogue of Wolsey’s linen napery is no less sumptuous and abundant; he
                    possessed an immense quantity of finest linen for sheets and “board-cloths”
                    (table-cloths), mostly patterned with “damaske diaper” or “paned losinge-wise.”
                    This example of the wealth of textile work possessed by one rich prelate will
                    give some notion of what England and other countries possessed in the 16th
                    century.</p>
                <p>In the reign of James I. tapestry looms were set up at Mortlake, and the industry
                    was carried on during the following reign under the direction of the painter
                    Francis Crane. Charles I. introduced skilled weavers from Oudenarde in Belgium,
                    and the whole existing series of cartoons by Raphael were copied on the Mortlake
                        looms.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Raphael,</hi> vol. xx. p. 280.</p></note> Most of
                    the Mortlake tapestry has distinct marks, such as the shield of St George with
                    F. C. (F. Crane). Some pieces are inscribed “Car. Re. Reg. Mortl.” (Carolus rex
                    regnans). Though closed during the Commonwealth, the Mortlake fabrique was again
                    worked after the Restoration until the death of Crane in 1703. In the 18th
                    century tapestry was woven on a small scale in Soho and at Fulham, and within
                    recent years a new royal fabrique has been established at Windsor, where very
                    costly and skilful weaving in the pictorial Gobelin style is carried on. The
                    only modern tapestry which has any of the merits of the best old productions is
                    that made on a small scale by Mr William Morris at Merton Abbey (Surrey), where
                    work of the highest beauty has been produced. Unfortunately, however, the modern
                    taste for feeble imitations of oil paintings has as yet shown little
                    appreciation of this revival of the true textile art.</p>
                <p>As in England, by far the greater part of the tapestry used in Italy was a
                    Flemish import. But in the 16th century, undeι∙ the patronage of the dukes of
                    Ferrara, tapestry looms were set up in Ferrara; these were, however, worked by
                    Flemish weavers, and closely resemble contemporary tapestry woven at Brussels.
                    Other fabriques were established in Florence by the Medici princes, and
                    continued to be worked till the end of the 17th century. Factories for tapestry
                    existed also at Venice, Turin, and other northern cities, but the industry was
                    purely an exotic, and never attained to any great importance. Since the
                    pontificate of Clement XL, in 1702,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>An earlier fabrique was started in 1630 by Urban VIII.,
                            but it soon ceased to be worked.</p></note> a papal factory for tapestry
                    has existed in Rome, and is still carried on in the Vatican. The papal looms
                    have produced a large number of most costly and elaborate copies of celebrated
                    paintings, executed with wonderful skill, but utterly worthless as works of
                    art.</p>
                <p>The South Kensington Museum possesses the best and most illustrative collection
                    of woven fabrics of various dates. The church of St Mary at Dantzic has a
                    magnificent collection of early textiles, mostly used for vestments; these are
                    well illustrated by Hinz, <hi rend="italic">Die Schatzkammer der Marien∙Kirche
                        zu Dantzig,</hi> 1870. Fine examples of early tapestry exist in the
                    cathedrals of Rheims, Bruges, Tournay, Angers, Beauvais, Aix, Sens, and in the
                    church of St Rémy at Rheims. Other fine collections are preserved in the Louvre,
                    the Cluny Museum, at Chartres, Amiens, Dijon, Orleans, Auxerre, Nancy, Bern,
                    Brussels, Munich, Berlin, Dresden, Vienna, and Nuremberg.<note anchored="true"

                    (mostly of later tapestry) are those of the Vatican, the Pitti, the Bargello,
                    Palazzo del Tè at Mantua, Turin (royal palace), Milan (royal palace), Como
                    (cathedral), and the museum of Naples. The Spanish collections have been already
                    mentioned. In England, besides the South Kensington Museum, fine tapestries
                    exist in the palaces of Windsor and Hampton Court. Those formerly in the House
                    of Lords were destroyed in the fire of 1834. St Mary’s Hall at Coventry contains
                    the finest examples of the 15th century.</p>
