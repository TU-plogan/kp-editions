                <p><label type="entry">TALBOT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Family of</hi></label>. Apart
                    from its achievements, this is one of the few families in the English
                    aristocracy which traces alike its descent and its surname from the Norman
                    conquerors of England; and it may really be said that there has hardly been a
                    time during the last eight hundred years in which the Talbots have not been of
                    considerable account in public life. Yet in some periods they appear rather as a
                    potential influence, while at certain marked epochs they stand out among the
                    most prominent actors in English history. The name of Richard Talbot occurs in
                    Domesday Book as the holder of nine hides of land in Bedfordshire under Walter
                    Giffard, earl of Buckingham. There is no evidence that he came over to England
                    with the Conqueror himself; and, as he did not hold of the king <hi
                        rend="italic">in capite,</hi> it is clear that he was not a leader. His son
                    Geoffrey Talbot took part with the empress Maud against King Stephen. But
                    apparently it was another son Hugh who continued the line; of whom it is
                    recorded that he held the castle of Plessi against Henry I. for Hugh de Gournay,
                    and afterwards became a monk at Beaubec in Normandy. His son Richard obtained
                    from Henry II. the lordship of Linton in Herefordshire, and from Richard I. the
                    custody of Ludlow castle; and his descendants for some generations appear to
                    have been wardens of various castles on the borders of Wales. Under Edward II. a
                    Gilbert Talbot was head of the house, and invaded Scotland in the king’s
                    company, but afterwards took part with Thomas of Lancaster against the king. He,
                    however, was pardoned, and obtained from Edward III. a confirmation of the grant
                    of the manor of Linton and other lands to himself and his heirs.</p>
                <p>His son Richard, who had married a daughter of John Cornyn of Badenoch, laid
                    claim to certain lands in Scotland in her right, and, when restrained from
                    entering that country by land (Edward III. having then made an alliance with
                    King David), he joined in a successful expedition which invaded it by sea in the
                    interests of Edward Baliol. Three years later he was taken prisoner in Scotland,
                    and redeemed for 2000 marks, after which the king made him governor of Berwick.
                    He took part also in Edward’s wars against France, as did likewise his son
                    Gilbert, who succeeded him. At this time the family possessed lands in the
                    counties of Oxford, Gloucester, Hereford, and Kent, and a little later in
                    Berkshire, Wilts, Salop, and Essex. Another Gilbert Talbot, grandson of the
                    last, claimed to carry the great spurs at the coronation of Henry V., and had a
                    commission to receive the submission of Owen Glendower and his adherents. He
                    also distinguished himself in the invasion of Normandy. He was twice married,
                    his second wife being a Portuguese lady, but he left no male issue, and was
                    succeeded by his brother John, the special hero of the family.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the head of the house had borne the name of Lord Talbot; but this John,
                    after obtaining by marriage the title of Lord Furnivall, was for his
                    distinguished actions created earl of Shrewsbury. He made his name so terrible
                    in France that for several generations afterwards French mothers used to
                    threaten refractory children that the Talbots would come if they were not quiet
                    (Brown’s <hi rend="italic">Venetian Calendar,</hi> ii. 75). Pie rescued Maine

                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0035-0026"/> French and took Pontoise; but his own capture
                    by the Maid of Orleans was what probably discouraged the English most of all in
                    their disasters beyond sea. He was exchanged for an eminent French prisoner and
                    a heavy ransom besides. He served also several times as lieutenant of Ireland,
                    and in 1446 was created earl of Wexford and of Waterford, in addition to the
                    title of Shrewsbury, which had been conferred upon him in 1442. He died in 1453,
                    in an unsuccessful expedition for the recovery of Guienne, which had lately
                    submitted to the French. His son John, Viscount Lisle, was slain along with him
                    in the same fatal battle.</p>
                <p>But, besides his martial exploits which live in history, this John claims some
                    attention for his family alliances. His first wife Maud, a granddaughter of
                    Thomas, Lord Furnivall, brought him the castle of Sheffield as part of her
                    inheritance, and he was accordingly summoned to parliament in the days of Henry
                    IV. as John Talbot of Hallamshire, otherwise Lord Furnivall, more than thirty
                    years before he was made earl of Shrewsbury. The property remained in the hands
                    of his descendants, and became a favourite residence of the family during the
                    whole of the Tudor era; and, but for the death in 1616 of Gilbert, seventh earl
                    of Shrewsbury, without male issue, it has been remarked by Hunter that Sheffield
                    might have remained much longer a centre of feudal magnificence rather than of
                    commerce and manufactures. The second wife of John, earl of Shrewsbury, was
                    Margaret, the eldest of three daughters of Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick,
                    by <hi rend="italic">his</hi> second wife, a daughter of Thomas, Lord Berkeley.
                    By her he obtained a third part of the Berkeley property; and, though she did
                    not become the mother of a line of earls, her eldest son, John Talbot, was
                    created Viscount Lisle, and it was he who fell along with his father at the
                    disastrous battle of Chatillon in Gascony. His son Thomas, who inherited the
                    title of Viscount Lisle, was also slain at the early age of twenty-two in a
                    feudal contest with Lord Berkeley, arising out of a dispute as to the possession
                    of Berkeley castle, at Nibley Green, near Wotton-under-Edge, March 20, 1470; and
                    the title was afterwards conferred on Edward Grey, the husband of one of his two
                    sisters.</p>
                <p>John, the second earl of Shrewsbury, was the first earl’s son by his first wife.
                    He had been knighted at Leicester in 1426 along with the infant king Henry VI.,
                    had served in the wars of France, and been made chancellor of Ireland during his
                    father’s lifetime, when he was only Lord Talbot. Aftenvards he was made lord
                    high treasurer of England, and in 1459 was rewarded for his services to the
                    house of Lancaster with a grant of 100 marks a year out of the lordship of
                    Wakefield, forfeited by Richard, duke of York. But next year he and his brother
                    Christopher were slain at the battle of Northampton, fighting in the cause of
                    Henry VI. His son John succeeded him, and then his grandson George, who fought
                    for Henry VII. at Stoke, and whom King Henry VIII. sent as his lieutenant
                    against the rebels in that most formidable insurrection, the Pilgrimage of
                    Grace. But perhaps the thing which most redounds to his credit is the humanity
                    with which (as related by Cavendish) he received the fallen Cardinal Wolsey into
                    his house at Sheffield when he was on his way up to London as a state prisoner,
                    and endeavoured to remove those gloomy anticipations of his fate which in fact
                    brought on his last illness.</p>
                <p>Francis, the fifth earl, took a leading part in the invasions of Scotland under
                    Henry VIII. and Edward VI., and was one of the two peers who alone opposed the
                    bill for abolishing the pope’s jurisdiction under Elizabeth. His son George, who
                    succeeded, was the earl to whom the custody of Mary Stuart was committed, his
                    delicate and onerous task being rendered all the more difficult for him by the
                    intrigues of his bold, ambitious second wife, Bess of Hardwick, the builder of
                    Chatsworth, who had married three husbands before her union with him. Two sons
                    of this last earl succeeded one another, and the title then devolved, for want
                    of male issue, on the lineal descendants of Sir Gilbert Talbot of Grafton in
                    Worcestershire, third son of John, the second earl. This Sir Gilbert had fought
                    for Henry VII. at Bosworth, where he was severely wounded, was knighted on the
                    field, and was throughout one of the first Tudor’s most trusted councillors. He
                    fought also at Stoke against the insurgents with Lambert Simnel, was made a
                    knight banneret, governor of Calais, and lord chamberlain.</p>
                <p>The ninth earl, George, descended from this Gilbert, is not distinguished by any
                    prominent actions. He died unmarried, and his brother, who followed next, was
                    succeeded by his grandson Francis, chiefly memorable for his unhappy fate. His
                    second wife, a daughter of the earl of Cardigan, was seduced by the duke of
                    Buckingham, whom the outraged husband challenged to a duel. The countess, it is
                    said, was present at the scene, and held Buckingham’s horse in the disguise of a
                    page, saw her husband killed, and then clasped her lover in her arms, receiving
                    blood-stains upon her dress from the embrace. Charles, the twelfth earl, son of
                    this unfortunate nobleman, was raised by William III, to the dignity of a duke
                    for his important diplomatic services. His position in those slippery times was
                    altogether exceptional. Abandoning the religion of his ancestors he became a
                    Protestant, was one of the seven who signed the invitation to William of Orange
                    to come over, and was continually consulted by him on state affairs after he
                    became king. Yet, being apparently of a very sensitive disposition, he seems to
                    have at times repented what he had done, and even corresponded with James at St
                    Germain; yet again, in times of danger, he was as ready as ever to stake his
                    life and fortunes in the service of his country to preserve the new settlement.
                    It was apparently his extreme sensitiveness that caused him to be spoken of as
                    “the king of hearts.” In 1694 he was created marquis of Alton and duke of
                    Shrewsbury, but as he left no son these titles died along with him, and the
                    earldom of Shrewsbury devolved on his cousin Gilbert, a Roman Catholic
                    priest.</p>
                <p>From this time the direct line of Sir Gilbert Talbot of Grafton began to fail. A
                    nephew three times succeeded to an uncle, and then the title devolved upon a
                    cousin, who died unmarried in 1856. On the death of this cousin the descent of
                    the title was for a short time in dispute, and the lands were claimed for the
                    infant son of the duke of Norfolk under the will of the last earl; but the
                    courts decided that, under a private Act obtained by the duke of Shrewsbury in
                    the sixth year of George I., the title and estates must go together, and the
                    true successor to the earldom was found in Earl Talbot, the head of another line
                    of the descendants of Sir Gilbert Talbot of Grafton, sprung from a second
                    marriage of Sir Gilbert’s son, Sir John Talbot of Albrighton. The head of this
                    family in the beginning of the last century was a divine of some mark, who died
                    bishop of Durham in 1730. His son Charles, who filled the office of lord
                    chancellor, was created Baron Talbot of Hensol in Glamorganshire in 1733; and
                    his son again was advanced to the dignity of Earl Talbot in 1761, to which was
                    added that of Baron Dyne vor in 1780. Then succeeded a nephew, who was also
                    created Viscount Ingestre, and assumed by royal licence the surname of Chetwynd
                    before Talbot, from his mother.</p>
                <p>The Earl Talbot who successfully claimed the Shrewsbury title (as the eighteenth
                    earl) was the present earl’s <pb break="no"
