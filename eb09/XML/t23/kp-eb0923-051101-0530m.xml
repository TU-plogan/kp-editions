                <p><label type="entry">TRANSCASPIAN REGION</label><hi rend="italic">(Zakaspiyskaya
                    Oblast),</hi> an extensive territory to the east of the Caspian, annexed by
                    Russia within the last fifteen years, is bounded on the S. by the highlands of
                    Khorasan and Afghanistan, on the N. by Uralsk (from which it is divided by a
                    line drawn from the Mortvyi Kuɫtuk Bay of the Caspian to the south extremity of
                    Lake Aral), on the N.E. by Khiva and Bokhara, and on the S.E. (where it
                    penetrates towards Herat on the slopes of the Paropamisus, and includes the
                    Badhyz plateau) by Afghan Turkestan. So defined, it has an area of 220,000
                    square miles.</p>
                <p>Although nine-tenths of this territory consists of uninhabitable desert, an
                    interest attaches to it on account of the great physical changes it has
                    undergone during the Post-Glacial period. Since Pallas visited its borders, and
                    still more since Humboldt discussed its history, it has never ceased to attract
                    the attention of geographers. In fact, some of the most interesting problems of
                    geography, such as those relating to the changes in the course of the Jaxartes
                    and the Oxus, the bifurcation and the oscillation of a great river, and the
                    supposed periodical disappearance of Lake Aral, are connected with the
                    Transcaspian deserts; and it is here that we must look for a clue to the great
                    physical changes which transformed the Mediterranean of Western Asia—the
                    Aral-Caspian and Pontic basin—into a series of separate seas, and desiccated
                    them, powerfully influencing the distribution of floras and faunas, and
                    compelling the inhabitants of Western and Central Asia to enter upon their great
                    migrations. But down to a very recent date the dry and barren deserts, peopled
                    only by wandering Turcoman bands, remained almost a <hi rend="italic">terra
                    incognita,</hi> and only now are we beginning to make the very first steps
                    towards their really scientific exploration.</p>
                <p>A mountain chain, in length comparable to the Alps, separates the deserts of the
                    Transcaspian from the highlands of Khorasan. It runs from north-west to
                    south-east, and appears as a continuation of the Caucasus. It begins in the
                    Krasnodovsk peninsula of the Caspian, under the names of Kuryanin-kara and Great
                    Balkans, whose masses of granite and other crystalline rock reach a height of
                    more than 5000 feet. Farther to the south-east these are continued in the much
                    lower Little Balkans and Kyuren-dagh (2000 feet), the Kopepet-dagh, Kosty-dagh,
                    Asilma, and Zaryn-kul,—the name of Kopepet-dagh or Kopet-dagh being often now
                    used to designate the whole chain which rises steep and wild above the flat
                    deserts from the Caspian to the river Murghab,—a stretch of 600 miles. In
                    structure it is homologous with the Caucasus chain; it appears as an outer wall
                    of the Khorasan plateau, and is separated from it by a broad valley, which, like
                    the Rion and Kura valley of Transcaucasia, is watered by two rivers flowing in
                    opposite directions,—the Atrek, which flows north-west into the Caspian, and the
                    Keshefrud, which flows to the south-east, and is a tributary of the Murghab. On
                    the other side of this valley the Allah-dagh and the Binalund border-ridges
                    (9000 to 11,000 feet) fringe the edge of the Khorasan plateau. At its
                    south-eastern extremity this outer wall loses its regularity where it meets with
                    the spurs of the Hindu-kush. Descending towards the steppe with steep stony
                    slopes, it rises to heights of 6000 and 9000 feet to the east of Kizil-arvat,
                    while the passes which lead from the Turcoman deserts to the valleys of Khorasan
                    are seldom as low as 3500, usually rising to 5000, 6000, and even 8500 feet, and
                    in most cases being very difficult. This wall is pierced by but one wide
                    opening, that between the Great and Little Balkans, through which the sea which
                    once covered the steppe maintained connexion with the Caspian.</p>
                <p>While the Allah-dagh and Binalund border-ridges are chiefly composed of
                    crystalline rocks and metamorphic slates covered with Devonian deposits, a
                    series of more recent formations—Upper and Lower Cretaceous, and Miocene—are
                    shown in the outer wall of the Kopet-dagh. Here again we find that the mountains
                    of Asia which stretch towards the north-west continued to be uplifted at a
                    geologically recent epoch. Quaternary deposits have an extensive development on
                    its slopes, and its hillfoots are bordered by a girdle of loess.</p>
                <p>The loess terrace, called “Atok" (“mountain base”), is but narrow, ranging in
                    width from 10 to 20 miles; still its chain of settlements have rendered it
                    possible to lay down a railway which now connects the Caspian with Sarakhs. It
                    is very fertile, but could produce nothing without irrigation, and the streams
                    flowing from the Kopet-dagh are few and meagre. The winds which reach the
                    northern slope of the mountains have been deprived of all their moisture in
                    crossing the Kara-kum—the Black Sands of the Turcoman desert; and even such rain
                    as falls on the Kopet-dagh (10½ inches at Kizil-arvat) too often reaches the
                    soil in the shape of showers which do not saturate it, so that the average
                    relative humidity is but 56 and the average nebulosity only 3∙9, as against 62
                    and 4∙l at even so dry a place as Krasnovodsk. Still, at those places where the
                    mountain streams are closer to one another, as at Geok-tepe, Askabad, Lutfabad,
                    and Kahka, the villages are more populous, and the houses are surrounded by
                    gardens, every square yard and every tree of which is fed by irrigation.</p>
                <p>Beyond this narrow strip of irrigated land begins the desert,— the
                    Kara-kum,—which extends from the mountains of Khorasan to Lake Aral and the
                    Ust-Urt, and from the Caspian to the Amu, interrupted only by the oases of Merv
                    and Tejen. It appears, however, that the terrible shifting sands blown into <hi
                    rend="italic">barkhans,</hi> or elongated hills, sometimes 50 and 60 feet in
                    height, are grouped chiefly in the west, where the country has more recently
                    emerged from the sea. Farther to the east the <hi rend="italic">barkhans</hi>
                    are more stable, their slopes being covered with bushes (for the most part
                    leafless); the caravans sometimes follow their crests, and the shifting sands
                    occupy restricted spaces. Large areas amidst the sands are occupied by <hi
                    rend="italic">takyrs,</hi> or flat surfaces covered with clay which is hard as a
                    rule, but becomes almost impassable after heavy rains. In these <hi
                    rend="italic">takyrs</hi> the Turcomans dig ditches, draining into a kind of
                    cistern—the <hi rend="italic">kak—</hi> where the water of the spring rains
                    keeps for a few months. Wells are sunk also along the routes of the caravans,
                    and water is found in them at depths of 10 to 50 or occasionally 100 feet and
                    more. All is not desert in the strict sense; in spring there is for the most
                    part a covering of grass, which allows of journeys across the desert. There are
                    footpaths in several directions, especially from the irrigated and cultivated
                    Atok towards Khiva.</p>
                <p>The vegetation of the Kara-kum cannot be described as poor; the typical
                    representative of the sand deserts of Asia, the saksaul (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Anabasis Ammodendron),</hi> has been almost destroyed within the last hundred
                    years, and never appears in forests, but the borders of the spaces covered with
                    salted clay are brightened by forests of tamarisk, which are inhabited by great
                    numbers of the desert warbler (<hi rend="italic">Atraphornis aralensis)—</hi> a
                    typical inhabitant of the sands,—sparrows, and ground-choughs (<hi rend="italic"

                    especially in spring. As a whole, the fauna is richer than might be supposed,

                    They are obviously the remains of brackish lakes, and, like the lakes of the
                    Kirghiz steppes, they often follow one another in close succession, thus closely
                    resembling river-beds. As the direction of these <hi rend="italic">shors</hi> is
                    generally from the higher terraces watered by the Amu-Daria towards the lowlands
                    of the Caspian, they were usually regarded as old beds of the Amu-Daria, and
                    were held to support the idea of its once having flowed across the Turcoman
                    desert towards what is now the Caspian Sea. A few years ago it seemed almost
                    settled, not only that that river (see Oxus) flowed into the Caspian during
                    historical times, but that, after having ceased to do so in the 7th century, its
                    waters were again diverted to the Caspian about 1221. A succession of elongated
                    depressions, having a faint resemblance to old river-beds, was traced from
                    Urgenj to the gap between the Great and the Little Balkans, marked on the maps
                    as the Uzboi, or old bed of the Oxus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    set afloat, and expeditions were sent out for explorations with this view. The

                    at all, and that no river has ever discharged its waters in that direction. The
                    existence of an extensive lacustrine depression, where the small Sary-kamysh
                    lakes are now the only remains of a wide basin, was proved, and it became
                    evident that this depression, having a length of more than 130 miles, a width of
                    70 miles, and a depth of 280 feet below the present level of Lake Aral, would
                    have to be filled by the Amu, before its waters could advance farther to the
                    south-west. The sill of this basin being only 28 feet below the present level of
                    Lake Aral, this latter could not be made to disappear, nor even be notably
                    reduced in size by the Amu flowing from Urgenj to the south-west. A more careful
                    exploration of the Uzboi has shown moreover that, while the deposits in the
                    Sary-kamysh depression, and the Aral shells they contain, bear unmistakable
                    testimony as to the fact of the basin having once been fed by the Amu-Daria, no
                    such traces are found along the Uzboi below the Sary-kamysh depression;<note

                    on the contrary, shells of molluscs still inhabiting the Caspian are found in
                    numbers all along it, and the supposed old bed has all the characters of a
                    series of lakes which continued to subsist at the hillfoots of the Ust-Urt
                    plateau, while the Caspian was slowly receding westwards during the
                    Post-Pliocene period. On rare occasions only did the waters of the Sary-kamysh,
                    when raised by inundations above the sill just mentioned, send their surplus
                    into the Uzboi. It appears most probable that in the 16th century the
                    Sary-kamysh was confounded with a gulf of the Caspian;<note anchored="true"

                    gulf of the Caspian within six days’ march from Khwarezm, by which gulf he could

                    plausibility to Konshin’s supposition that the changes in the lower course of
                    the Amu (which no geologist would venture to ascribe to man, if they were to
                    mean the alternative discharge of the Amu into the Caspian and Lake Aral) merely
                    meant that by means of appropriate dams the Amu was made to flow, in the 13th,
                    14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, alternately into Lake Aral and into the
                    Sary-kamysh.</p>
                <p>As for the ancient texts with regard to the Jaxartes and Oxus, it becomes more
                    and more probable that their interpretation, if possible at all, is only so when
                    it is admitted that, since the epoch to which these relate, the outlines of the
                    Caspian Sea and Lake Aral have undergone notable changes, commensurate with
                    those which are supposed to have occurred in the courses of the Central Asian
                    rivers. The desiccation of the Aral-Caspian basin proceeded with such rapidity
                    that the shores of the Caspian could not possibly maintain for some twenty
                    centuries the outlines which they have at present. When studied in detail, the
                    general configuration of the Transcaspian region leaves no doubt that both the
                    Jaxartes and the Oxus, with its former tributaries, the Murghab and the Tejeñ,
                    once flowed towards the west; but the Caspian of that time was not the sea of
                    our days; its gulfs penetrated the Turcoman steppe, and washed the base of the
                    Ust-Urt plateau, as is shown by the deposits of its shells described by the
                    Russian engineers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Kelif-Uzboi.—</hi> There is also no doubt that, instead of

                    with this southern “old bed,” it is worthy of notice that the Ersari-Turcomans
                    call it Unghyuz or Onguz (“dry old bed”), and there can be no doubt that when
                    the Bolshoi Tchertezh of the 16th century (speaking from anterior information)
                    mentions a river, Ughyuz or Ugus, flowing to the west from the Amu towards the
                    Caspian, it is merely describing as a river what its very name shows to have
                    been a dry bed, only supposed to have been once occupied by a river. The
                    similarity of the names Ongus and Ugus with the Ogus and Ochus is so striking
                    that one is inclined to see in the Ogus or Ochus nothing but the mention of a

                    making when studying a map of the Transcaspian region; but the date at which the
                    Oxus followed such a course, and the extension which the Caspian basin then had
                    towards the east, remain unsettled. Much, however, has still to be done before
                    we can fully reconstruct the geological history of that region since the
                    Pliocene epoch, or show how far the data of Pliny, Strabo, and Ptolemy were
                    descriptions of actual facts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    rend="italic">Population.—</hi> With the exception of some 35,000 Kirghiz
                    encamped with their herds on the Ust-Urt plateau (a swelling some 600 to 1000
                    feet in height and nearly 92,000 square miles in extent, which, owing to its
                    dryness and cold winter, can be inhabited only by nomad cattle-breeders) and a
                    few Persians in the Lutfabad and Shilghyan villages of the Atok, the whole of
                    the population of the Transcaspian region consists of Turcomans. Until a very
                    recent date their chief occupation was cattle-rearing and robbery. Even those
                    Turcomans who had settled abodes on the oases of the Atok, Tejeñ, and Merv were
                    in the habit of encamping during spring in the steppes, and there practising
                    robbery. Robber bands were easily formed, and on their powerful horses they
                    extended their excursions to distances of 200 and 300 miles from their abodes.
                    They infested the Astrabad province; and the villages of the khanates of Afghan
                    Turkestan, from Balkh to Meshhed, were periodically devastated by them. The
                    aspect of the steppe has, however, greatly changed since the Russian advance,
                    the fall of the Turcoman stronghold of Geok-tepe, and the massacres which
                    ensued; the Persians are already beginning to avenge themselves on the
                    inhabitants of the Atok by disputing with them the supplies of water coming from
                    the Kopet-dagh.</p>
                <p>The chief oasis of the Turcoman desert is the Atok, which extends along the base
                    of the Kopet-dagh, and is now traversed by the Transcaspian railway. The Akhal
                    and the Arakadj oases, collectively called Atok, now have a population of about
                    42,000 Tekke-Turcomans, who have recently settled there, and live for the most
                    part in miserable clay huts or in felt tents (<hi rend="italic">kibitkas</hi>)

                    have excellent gardens. Some cotton is also grown, and the culture of the

                    and Geok-tepe.</p>
                <p>The oasis of Merv (<hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> is inhabited by Akhal-tekkes
                    (about 160,000), mostly poor. In January 1887 they submitted to Russia.</p>
                <p>The oasis of Tejeñ has recently sprung up where the river Tejeñ (Heri-rud)
                    terminates in the desert. Formerly it was only temporarily visited by the Tekkes
                    who came to cultivate the fields in summer. In 1883 it was estimated to have
                    7500 inhabitants.</p>

                    the name of Badhyz, and by the Russians as South-West Turcomania, has of late
                    attracted a good deal of attention since the Russian occupation of Sarakhs on
                    the Tejeñ (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Afghanistan</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    reaching about 2000 feet above the sea, with hills 500 and 600 feet high covered
                    with sand, the spaces between being filled with loess. The Borkhut Mountains
                    which connect the Kopet-dagh with the Sefid-kuh, reach 3000 to 4000 feet, and
                    are crossed in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> gorge by the Heri-rud. Thickets of
                    poplar and willow follow the courses of both the Murghab and Heri-rud, and the
                    trees reach a considerable size. Pistachio and mulberry trees grow in isolated
                    groups on the hills; but there are few places available for culture, and the
                    Saryks (some 60,000 in number) congregate in only two oases at Yoɫ-otan and
                    Penjdeh. Cattle-breeding is their chief occupation, and enables them to live in
                    a certain degree of affluence. Brigandage, formerly a notable source of income,
                    is now being suppressed. The Sarakhs oasis is now occupied by the Salors,
                    hereditary enemies of the Tekkes, who number about 3000 tents at Old Sarakhs,
                    and 1700 more on the Murghab, at Tchardjui, at Maimene, and close to Herat.</p>
