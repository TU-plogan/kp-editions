                    “county,” lies between 10° 10' and 13° E. long. and 45° 40' and 47° 45' N. lat.,
                    and is conterminous on the north-west with the Austrian province of Vorarlberg,
                    on the north with Bavaria, on the east with Salzburg and Carinthia, on the
                    south-east and south-west with Italy, and on the west with Switzerland. The
                    last-named country forms in the lower Engadine an angle penetrating deeply into
                    Tyrol. The country is entirely mountainous, being traversed by the main chain of
                    the Alps. It may be roughly divided into the valley systems of the Lech and the
                    Inn to the north of the chain and of the Etsch or Adige (Vintschgau) and the
                    upper Drave (Puster valley) to the south (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Alps).</hi>
                    Its area is 10,316 square miles; its population in 1880 was 805,176, inclusive
                    of military, showing an increase of nearly 4 per cent. since 1869. Of these
                    432,062 spoke German, 360,975 Italian or some Romance dialect, and the remainder
                    some form of Slavonic; 565,468 persons were able to read and write, 56,728 to
                    read only, leaving about 22⅔ per cent. of the total population, including
                    children, wholly illiterate. Education is strictly compulsory; but the schools
                    are for the most part closed during the summer months, when all available hands
                    are required in the fields and on the mountain pastures. Agriculture and
                    forestry occupy about two-thirds of the entire population. Every householder
                    owns a piece of cultivable land in the valley, while his goats, sheep, or cattle
                    are driven with those of his neighbours to the mountain pastures <hi
                    rend="italic">(Alpen, Almen)</hi> which belong to the commune. Each commune has
                    a president chosen by an elected committee of householders. The man selected
                    cannot decline, but is bound to serve his term of office. The tenure of property
                    is for the most part of the nature of absolute ownership. In 1880 100,393
                    persons of both sexes were returned as proprietors, 10,283 as tenants. The chief
                    products are milk, butter, and cheese. Of grain-crops maize, which is largely
                    grown in the Inn valley and Vintschgau, holds the first place. Wheat is grown in
                    the lower valleys, barley and rye in the higher, the latter in favourable spots
                    to a height of over 5000 feet. Potatoes are found above 6000 feet. In the Etsch
                    valley, or district about Meran and Botzen, red and white wine of excellent
                    quality is produced (in 1884 about 6,500,000 gallons). Of late years the
                    cultivation of fruit has much developed, especially in south Tyrol. Silk is also
                    produced (in 1885 1268 tons of cocoons). Game is still plentiful in the remoter
                    valleys. In every district there are a certain number of licensed hunters, the
                    principal game being red deer, chamois, hares, blackcock, ptarmigan, &amp;c.
                    Mining occupies about one-fifth of the population. At Hall near Innsbruck are
                    important salt works, and at Brixlegg in the same valley copper and lead are
                    smelted. Iron is worked at Fulpmes in the Stubai valley and at Prad in the
                    Vintschgau. Zinc is found at the head of the Passeir valley. In the Middle Ages
                    gold and silver were found in sufficient quantities to make it worth while to
                    extract them. About 4340 square miles of the country are covered with forest,
                    chiefly pine, fir, and larch, which, however, is felled in a recklessly wasteful
                    way. The capital of the county is <hi rend="smallcaps">Innsbruck</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi></p>
                <p>The general average of comfort in Tyrol is high, and the cost of living is very
                    moderate. The peasant and his family are clothed in stuffs spun and woven at
                    home, from the wool and flax produced in their own neighbourhood. The people are
                    for the most part somewhat reserved in manner, but courteous and hospitable. The
                    savage fights which used to be a favourite pastime among the younger men are now
                    almost, or quite, a thing of the past. In some valleys there is a good deal of
                    musical talent; and companies of Tyrolese singers, particularly from the Ziller
                    valley, travel about all over Germany. The zither is a favourite instrument,
                    especially in the southern valleys; in the northern the guitar is more frequent.
                    The religion is almost exclusively Roman Catholic; but in Innsbruck there are
                    some hundreds of Protestants. The priests belong chiefly to the peasant class,
                    and receive their education at Brixen and the university of Innsbruck. This
                    contains about 600 students in the various faculties and possesses a library of
                    some 60,000 volumes. There is a diet, or landtag, with its seat at Innsbruck,
                    consisting of thirty-four representatives of the peasants, thirteen of the
                    citizens, four of the prelates, ten of the nobles, three of the chambers of
                    commerce at Innsbruck, Botzen, and Roveredo, and one of the university of
                    Innsbruck. To the imperial reichsrath Tyrol sends eighteen members. Tyrol is
                    garrisoned by troops recruited exclusively in Tyrol and Vorarlberg, and never,
                    except in time of war, employed outside these provinces. Besides this there are
                    the landwehr and the landsturm or militia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The country corresponding to modern Tyrol first
                    appears in history when the Rhaetians were subdued by Drusus and Tiberius. This
                    nation, by some held to have been cognate with the Etruscans, occupied the
                    valleys from the source of the Rhine to that of the Drave. To the north of them
                    were the Vindelici, and to the east the Norici; the former were apparently
                    separated <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n737/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0737-0712"/> from them by the ridges north of the Inn, the
                    latter by the watershed between the Etsch and the Drave. Pliny (<hi
                    rend="italic">N</hi>. <hi rend="italic">H.,</hi> iii. 24) gives the names of all
                    the tribes. After their subjection by Rome these races became Romanized and
                    shared the fortunes of the empire. Their position ou and about the roads by
                    which the central Alps are most easily crossed laid them especially open to
                    inroads, and before the end of the 3d century the Alemanni had traversed the
                    country. In the course of the next three centuries this people settled in the
                    north-western valleys. But the peopling of the greater part of the province by
                    Teutons was effected by the Baiu-varii, who were by the year 600 established
                    throughout nearly the entire remainder of German Tyrol, some of the Romanized
                    Rhaetians probably being left, mixed with a few Alemannic stragglers, in the
                    upper Vintschgau, while the Lombards pressed up from the southward and took
                    possession of the district around Trent. The Alemanni and Baiuvarii, governed
                    immediately by their own dukes, owned a kind of allegiance to the kings of the
                    Franks, and ultimately became in the time of Pippin and Charles incorporated in
                    the Frankish monarchy. The country was then divided for administrative purposes
                    into counties (<hi rend="italic">comitatus, Grafschaften),</hi> under counts,
                    whose rank, at first merely official, in course of time became, with their
                    office, hereditary. The most powerful among them appear to have been those of
                    the Vintschgau, where a fertile soil and a climate less rigorous than that of
                    the northern valleys allowed more development of wealth. In the 12th century the
                    counts of Tirol begin to be conspicuous. This was a small district near Meran,
                    taking its name from the ancient castle of Tirol, known in the later Roman time
                    as Teriolis. These, in the course of the next century, acquired the lordship
                    over nearly all the territory now contained in the province of Tyrol south of
                    the main chain of the Alps, besides the advocacy (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Schirmvogtei)</hi> of the wealthy sees of Brixen and Trent. Meantime the valley
                    of the Inn and those adjoining it had come under the dominion of the counts of
                    Andechs, a Bavarian fami. . who were also titular counts of Meran. The last of
                    these died without issue in 1248. His wife’s sister, Adelaide, married to
                    Meinhard, count of Görz, was left in sole possession of nearly the whole of the
                    province. Their son Meinhard II. (1257-1295) was connected with some of the most
                    powerful houses in Germany; and, being a man of great ability and equal
                    unscrupulousness, he succeeded in acquiring the few outlying portions of
                    territory and castles still belonging to the smaller nobles, and thus
                    consolidated Tyrol within the limits by which it has ever since been bounded.
                    Carinthia and Styria also formed part of his domains; but their connexion with
                    Tyrol has never been other than a personal one. Meinhard II. was succeeded in
                    turn by his sons Otho and Henry. The latter (1310-1335), a weak and extravagant
                    prince, seems to have done much towards organizing the government of the
                    country. His elder daughter Margaret, known in Tyrolese history and legend as
                    <hi rend="italic">Die Maultasche,</hi> “the Pocket-mouth,” the heiress of his
                    territories, took as her second husband (in 1342) Louis of Brandenburg. Their
                    son Meinhard III., who succeeded to the county on his father’s death in 1361,
                    died in 1363. Margaret thereupon made over all her possessions to the house of
                    Hapsburg, and since that time Tyrol has formed part of the hereditary dominions
                    of the archdukes of Austria (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Austria).</hi> The
                    fidelity of the Tyrolese to their counts has for many centuries been proverbial.
                    The Brenner has more than once offered them a secure line of retreat and the
                    mountains a rampart of defence. Maximilian I. (1493-1519) had an especial
                    affection for Tyrol. He conferred on the province its present title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Die gefürstete Grafschaft</hi>; he profited on more than one
                    occasion by the refuge it afforded; he spent much of his time within it; and at
                    his death he directed that a sumptuous monument to himself should be erected in
                    the Franciscans’ church at Innsbruck. Tyrol has more than once been the scene of
                    sharp fighting. In 1499 the men of Graubünden or the Grisons (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Switzerland)</hi> invaded the country and defeated the Tyrolese
                    in the neighbourhood of Mals. In 1703 Max Emmanuel, elector of Bavaria,
                    penetrated the upper Inn valley, but was driven back. During the wars of the
                    French Revolution French and Austrian armies met more than once within the
                    limits of the province. By the treaty of Pressburg, 1805, the province was
                    transferred to Bavaria. On the renewal of war between Bonaparte and Austria in
                    1809 the people rose and expelled the Bavarians, and afterwards, under the
                    leadership of Andrew Hofer, an innkeeper of the Passeir valley, repeatedly
                    defeated the French, Bavarian, and Saxon forces. Innsbruck was more than once
                    taken and retaken; and on 12th August Hofer, after defeating Marshal Lefebvre,
                    was installed in the capital as commandant. But the ill-success of the Austrian
                    arms elsewhere prevented any support from being sent, and by the treaty of
                    Schönbrunn in October the Tyrolese were again given up to their new rulers.
                    Hofer, being captured through treachery, was shot at Mantua, 20th February 1810.
                    On the fall of Bonaparte, Tyrol reverted to the house of Hapsburg.</p>
