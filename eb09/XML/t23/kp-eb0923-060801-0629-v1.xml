                <p><label type="entry">TUNGUSES</label>, a wide-spread Asiatic people, forming a
                    main branch of the Mongol division of the Mongol-Tatar family. They are the <hi
                        rend="italic">Tung-hu</hi> of the Chinese, probably a corrupt form of <hi
                        rend="italic">tonki</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dοnki,</hi> that is, “men” or
                    “people.” The Russian form <hi rend="italic">Tungus,</hi> wrongly supposed to
                    mean “lake people,” appears to occur first in the Dutch writer Massa (1612); but
                    the race has been known to the Russians ever since they reached the Yenisei. The
                    Tungus domain, covering many hundred thousand square miles in central and east
                    Siberia and in the Amur basin, stretches from the Yenisei eastwards to the
                    Pacific, where it occupies most of the seaboard between Corea and Kamchatka. It
                    also reaches the Arctic Ocean at two points, in the Nisovaya tundra, west of the
                    Khatanga river, and in a comparatively small enclosure in the Yana basin over
                    against the Liakhoff (New Siberia) Archipelago. But the Tunguses proper are
                    chiefly centred in the region watered by the three large eastern tributaries of
                    the Yenisei, which from them take their names of the Upper, Middle or Stony, and
                    Lower Tunguska. Here the Tunguses are known to the Samoyedes by the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">Aiya</hi> or “younger brothers,” implying a comparatively
                    recent immigration (confirmed by other indications) from the Amur basin, which
                    appears to be the original home both of the Tunguses and of the closely-allied
                    Manchus. The Amur is still mainly a Tungus river almost from its source to its
                    mouth: the Oroches (Orochus), Daurians, Birars, Golds, Manegrs, Sanagirs,
                    Ngatkons, Nigidals, and some other aboriginal tribes scattered along the main
                    stream and its affluents,—the Shilka, Sungari, and Usuri,—are all of Tungus
                    stock and speech. On the Pacific the chief subdivisions of the race are the
                    Lamuts, or “sea people,” grouped in small isolated hunting communities round the
                    west coast of the Sea of Okhotsk, and further south the Yu-pi-ta-tze (“fish
                    clad”), the Tazi of the Russians, between the Amur delta and Corea. The whole
                    race, exclusive of Manchus, numbers probably about 80,000, of whom 15,000 are in
                    the Amur basin, the rest in Siberia.</p>
                <p>The Tungus type is essentially Mongolie, being characterized by broad flat
                    features, small nose, wide mouth, thin lips, small black and somewhat oblique
                    eyes, black lank hair, dark olive or bronze complexion, low stature, averaging
                    not more than five feet four inches; they are distinguished from other Mongolic
                    peoples by the square shape of the skull and the slim, wiry, well-proportioned
                    figure. This description applies more especially to the Tunguska tribes, who may
                    be regarded as typical Tunguses, and who, unlike most other Mongols, betray no
                    tendency to obesity. They are classed by the Russians, according to their
                    various pursuits, as Reindeer, Horse, Cattle, Dog, Steppe, and Forest Tunguses.
                    A few have become settled agriculturists; but the great bulk of the race are
                    still essentially forest hunters, using the reindeer both as mounts and as pack
                    animals. Nearly all lead nomad lives, in pursuit of fur-bearing animals, whose
                    skins they supply to Russian and Yakut traders, in exchange for provisions,
                    clothing, and other necessaries of life. The picturesque and even elegant
                    national costume shows in its ornamentation and general style decided Japanese
                    influence, due no doubt to long-continued intercourse with that nation at some
                    period previous to the spread of the race from the Amur valley to Siberia. Many
                    of the Tungus tribes have been baptized, and are, therefore, reckoned as “Greek
                    Christians’’; but Russian orthodoxy has not penetrated far below the surface,
                    and most of them are still at heart Shamanists and nature-worshippers, secretly
                    keeping the teeth and claws of wild animals as idols or amulets, and observing
                    Christian rites only under compulsion. But, whether Christians or pagans, all
                    alike are distinguished above other Asiatics, perhaps above all other peoples,
                    for their truly noble moral qualities. All observers describe them as "cheerful
                    under the most depressing circumstances, persevering, open-hearted, trustworthy,
                    modest yet self-reliant, a fearless race of hunters, boni amidst the gloom of
                    their dense pine-forests, exposed from the cradle to every danger from wild
                    beasts, cold, and hunger. Want and hardships of every kind they endure with
                    surprising fortitude, and nothing can induce them to take service under the
                    Russians or quit their solitary woodlands” (Keane’s <hi rend="italic">Asia,</hi>
                    p. 479). Their numbers are steadily decreasing owing to the ravages of
                    small-pox, scarlet fever, and especially famine, their most dreaded enemy. Their
                    domain is also being continually encroached upon by the aggressive Yakuts from
                    the north and east, and from the south by the Slavs, now settled in compact
                    bodies in the province of Irkutsk about the upper course of the Yenisei. It is
                    remarkable that, while the Russians often show a tendency to become assimilated
                    to the Yakuts, the most vigorous and expansive of all the Siberian peoples, the
                    Tunguses everywhere yield before the advance of their more civilized neighbours
                    or become absorbed in the surrounding Slav communities. In the Amur valley the
                    same fate is overtaking the kindred tribes, who are disappearing before the
                    great waves of Chinese migration from the south and Russian encroachments both
                    from the east and west. In 1880 the Oroches were already reduced to about 260,
                    and the Tazi to a little over 200. For the philological relations of the
                    Tunguses, see vol. xviii. p. 779.</p>
