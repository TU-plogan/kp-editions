                <p><label type="entry">THEOCRITUS</label>, of Syracuse, the foremost Greek pastoral
                    poet, lived a life of which nothing is known except from allusions in his own
                    works. The epigram appended to his poems makes him say, “I am a Syracusan, a man
                    of the people, a son of Praxagoras and Philinna.” He must have been born early
                    in the 3d century, among a Dorian people, whose Dorian speech survives in his
                    rural idyls. These “little pictures” chiefly represent the life of shepherds,
                    neat-herds, and fishermen in the woods and on the shores of Sicily. They are
                    doubtless inspired by the popular poetry of his time, and have much in common
                    with the Romaic chants of the modern Greek shepherds. The first idyl is a song
                    on Daphnis, the ideal <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0270-0253"/> herdsman, sung by the shepherd Thyrsis to a
                    goatherd. The second is the magical chant which Simaetha pours forth to the
                    magic moon, in the hope of recovering her lover. In the third a goatherd sings
                    to his love, Amaryllis. The fourth is an interchange of rude banter between two
                    country fellows; and the fifth is of the same kind. The scenes are in southern
                    Italy. The sixth is a Sicilian singing match between two ideal herdsmen,—not
                    contemporary rustics, but poets of nobler themes. The scene of the seventh is in
                    Cos, where the poet introduces himself at a singing match. He may have been
                    attached to the Asclepian medical school in Cos; his friend Nicias was a
                    physician. Sicily and rival minstrels occupy the ninth idyl. The tenth contains
                    probably some real popular ditties, chanted by the reapers. The eleventh,
                    addressed to Nicias, is a piece of artificial mythological <hi rend="italic"
                    >genre,</hi> “The Cyclops in Love.” The twelfth is a lyric, almost of passionate
                    affection. The thirteenth is another idyl on a mythical topic, the adventures of
                    Hercules and Hylas. The fourteenth and fifteenth are sketches of military and
                    urban life, the mercenary soldier in love, and the gathering at the Adonis feast
                    in Alexandria. Theocritus had wandered to the court of Ptolemy, and joined the
                    literary society of his court. The sixteenth is a patriotic piece: the poet
                    urges Hiero to assail the Carthaginians in Sicily. The seventeenth is a
                    conventional hymn to Ptolemy Philadelphus on his marriage with his sister. The
                    eighteenth is an epithalamium; the nineteenth a tiny picture of Eros stung by a
                    bee; the twentieth is the complaint of a herdsman rejected by a girl of the
                    town; the twenty-first an idyl of fisher life: two poor old fishermen recount
                    their dreams. The twenty-second idyl is a piece of heroic myth, the adventures
                    of Castor and Polydeuces; and the twenty-fourth is a tiny epic on the infancy of
                    Hercules. The twenty-third is an amorous complaint. The twenty-fifth describes
                    the slaughter by Hercules of the Nemean lion. The twentysixth justifies, in the
                    interests of the ritual of Dionysus, the murder of the curious Pentheus. The
                    twenty-seventh is the “Wooing of Daphnis,” or “Oaristys,” an amorous discourse
                    between a girl and a swain. The twenty-eighth is a graceful piece of <hi
                    rend="italic">vers de société,</hi> sent to a lady with the gift of an ivory
                    distaff. The twenty-ninth is amorous; and there remain an imperfect and a
                    spurious piece, and a set of twenty-three epigrams.</p>
                <p>On a general view, Theocritus’s surviving poems turn out to be—(1) rural idyls,
                    the patterns of Virgil’s eclogues, and of all later pastoral poetry; (2) minute
                    epics, or cabinet pictures from mythology; (3) sketches of contemporary 1ife in
                    verse; (4) courtly compositions; and (5) expressions of personal kindliness and
                    attachment. The first category and the third are those on which the fame of
                    Theocritus depends. His verse has a wonderful Doric melody; his shepherds are
                    natural Southern people: it is not his fault that what he wrote truly of them
                    has become a false commonplace in the pastoral poetry of the North.</p>
                <p>Of Theocritus’s own life we only know what has been recorded, that he lived in
                    Syracuse, Cos, and Alexandria, and that he was acquainted with Nicias, with
                    Aratus, the astronomical writer, and with Philinus, head of a school or sect of
                    physicians. The rest is silence or conjecture. Suidas says that, in addition to
                    the surviving poems, the <hi rend="italic">Praetidae,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hopes, Hymns,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Heroines, Dirges, Elegies,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Iambics</hi> were attributed to him.</p>
                <p>The charm of Theocritus can only be tasted in his original Doric, but the best
                    English version is by Mr C. S. Calverley. Μ. Couat’s book on the Alexandrine
                    school of poetry may be recommended. J. Hauler, <hi rend="italic">De Theοc.
                    Vita</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Carminibus</hi> (Freiburg,
                    1855), Hempel, <hi rend="italic">Quaest. Theοc.</hi> (Kiel, 1881), and Rannow,
                    <hi rend="italic">Studia</hi><hi rend="italic">Theοcritea</hi> (Berlin, 1886),
                    may also be found useful. The best English edition of the poems is that of
                    Bishop Wordsworth. (A. L.)</p>
