                    termed the “arguments.” À table is said to be of single or double entry
                    according as there are one or two arguments. For example, a table of logarithms
                    is a table of single entry, the numbers being the arguments and the logarithms
                    the tabular results; an ordinary multiplication table is a table of double
                    entry, giving <hi rend="italic">xy</hi> as tabular result for <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> as arguments. The intrinsic value of a
                    table may be estimated by the actual amount of time saved by consulting it; for
                    example, a table of square roots to ten decimals is more valuable than a table
                    of squares, as the extraction of the root would occupy more time than the
                    multiplication of the number by itself. The value of a table does not depend
                    upon the difficulty of calculating it; for, once made, it is made for ever, and
                    as far as the user is concerned the amount of labour devoted to its original
                    construction is immaterial. In some tables the labour required in the
                    construction is the same as if all the tabular results had been calculated
                    separately; but in the majority of instances a table can be formed by
                    expeditious methods which are inapplicable to the calculation of an individual
                    result. This is the case with tables of a continuous quantity, which may
                    frequently be constructed by differences. The most striking instance perhaps is
                    afforded by a factor table or a table of primes; for, if it is required to
                    determine whether a given number is prime or not, the only available method (in
                    the absence of tables) is to divide it by every prime less than its square root
                    or until one is found that divides it without remainder. But to form a table of
                    prime numbers the process is theoretically simple and rapid, for we have only to
                    range all the numbers in a line and strike out every second beginning from two,
                    every third beginning from three, and so on, those that remain being primes.
                    Even when the tabular results are constructed separately, the method of
                    differences or other methods connecting together different tabular results may
                    afford valuable verifications. By having recourse to tables not only does the
                    computer save time and labour but he also obtains the certainty of accuracy; in
                    fact, even when the tabular results are so easy to calculate that no time or
                    mental effort would be saved by the use of a table, the certainty of accuracy
                    might make it advantageous to employ it.</p>
                <p>The invention of logarithms in 1614, followed immediately by the calculation of
                    logarithmic tables, revolutionized all the methods of calculation; and the
                    original work performed by Briggs and Vlacq in calculating logarithms 260 years
                    ago has in effect formed a portion of every arithmetical operation that has
                    since been carried out by means of logarithms. And not only has an incredible
                    amount of labour been saved<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Referring to factor tables, Lambert wrote <hi rend="italic">(Supplementa
                    Tabularum,</hi> 1798, p. XV.): “Universalis finis talium tabularum est ut semel
                    pro semper computetur quod saepius de novo computandum foret, et ut pro omni
                    casu computetur quod in futurum pro quovis casu computatum desiderabitur.” This
                    applies to all tables.</p></note> but a vast number of calculations and
                    researches have been rendered practicable which otherwise would have been quite
                    beyond human reach. The mathematical process that underlies the tabular method
                    of obtaining a result may be indirect and complicated; for example, the
                    logarithmic method would be quite unsuitable for the multiplication of two
                    numbers if the logarithms had to be calculated specially for the purpose and
                    were not already tabulated for use. The arrangement of a table on the page and
                    all typographical details—such as the shape of the figures, their spacing, the
                    thickness and placing of the rides, the colour and quality of the paper, Ac.—are
                    of the highest importance, as the computer has to spend hours with his eyes
                    fixed upon the book; and the efforts of eye and brain required in finding the
                    right numbers amidst a mass of figures on a page and in taking them out
                    accurately, when the computer is tired as well as when he is fresh, are far more
                    trying than the mechanical action of simple reading. Moreover, the trouble
                    required by the computer to <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> the use of a table need
                    scarcely be considered; the important matter is the time and labour saved by it
                    after he has learned its use. Tables are, as a rule, intended for professional
                    and not amateur use; and it is of little moment whether the user who is
                    unfamiliar with a table has to spend ten seconds or a minute in obtaining an
                    isolated result, provided it can be used rapidly and without risk of error by a
                    skilled computer.</p>
                <p>In the following descriptions of tables an attempt is made to give an account of
                    all those that a computer of the present day is likely to use in carrying out
                    arithmetical calculations. Tables of merely bibliographical or historical
                    interest are not regarded as coming within the scope of this article, although
                    for special reasons such tables are briefly noticed in some cases. Tables
                    relating to ordinary arithmetical operations are first described, and afterwards
                    an account is given of the most useful and least technical of the more strictly
                    mathematical tables, such as factorials, gamma functions, integrals, Bessel’s
                    functions, Ac. It is difficult to classify the tables described in a perfectly
                    satisfactory manner without prolixity, as many collections contain valuable sets
                    belonging to a variety of classes. Nearly all modern tables are stereotyped, and
                    in giving their titles the accompanying date is either that of the original
                    stereotyping or of the <hi rend="italic">tirage</hi> in question. In tables that
                    have passed through many editions the date given is that of the edition
                    described. A much fuller account of general tables published previously to 1872,
                    by the present writer, is contained in the British Association <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deport</hi> for 1873, pp. 1-175; and to this the reader is referred.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tables of Divisors (Factor Tables) and Tables of Primes.—</hi>
                    The existing factor tables extend to 9,000,000. In 1811 Chenιac published at
                    Deventer his <hi rend="italic">Cribrum Arithmeticum,</hi> which gives all the
                    prime divisors of every number not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 up to 1,020,000. In
                    1814-17 Burckhardt published at Paris his <hi rend="italic">Tables des
                    Diviseurs,</hi> giving the least divisor of every number not divisible by 2, 3,
                    or 5 up to 3,036,000. The second million was issued in 1814, the third in 1816,
                    and the first in 1817. The corresponding tables for the seventh (in 1862),
                    eighth (1863), and ninth (1865) millions were calculated by Dase and issued at
                    Hamburg. Dase died suddenly during the progress of the work, and it was
                    completed by Rosenberg. Dase's calculation was performed at the instigation of
                    Gauss, and he began at 6,000,000 because the Berlin Academy was in possession of
                    a manuscript presented by Crelle extending Burckhardt’s tables from 3,000,000 to
                    6,000,000. This manuscript, not having been published by 1877, was found on
                    examination to be so inaccurate that the publication was not desirable, and
                    accordingly the three intervening millions were calculated and published by
                    James Glaisher, the <hi rend="italic">Factor Table for the Fourth Million</hi>
                    appearing at London in 1879, and those for the fifth and sixth millions in 1880
                    and 1883 respectively (all three millions stereotyped). The tenth million,
                    though calculated by Dase and Rosenberg, has not been published. It is in the
                    possession of the Berlin Academy, having been presented in 1878. The nine quarto
                    volumes <hi rend="italic">(Tables des Diviseurs,</hi> Paris, 1814-17; <hi
                    rend="italic">Factor Tables,</hi> London, 1879-83; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Facioren-Tafcln,</hi> Hamburg, 1862-65) thus form one uniform table, giving the
                    least divisor of every number not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, from unity to nine
                    millions. The arrangement of the results on the page, which is due to
                    Burckhardt, is admirable for its clearness and condensation, the least factors
                    for 9000 numbers being given on each page. The tabular portion of each million
                    occupies 112 pages. The first three millions were issued separately, and also
                    bound in one volume, but the other six millions are all separate. Burckhardt
                    began with the second million instead of the first, as Chernac’s factor table
                    for the first million was already in existence. Burckhardt’s first million does
                    not supersede Chernac’s, as the latter gives all the prime divisors of numbers
                    not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 up to 1,020,000. It occupies 1020 pages, and
                    Burckhardt found it very accurate; he detected only thirty-eight errors, of
                    which nine were due to the author, the remaining twenty-nine having been caused
                    by the slipping of type <pb break="no"

                    given in the first million. Burckhardt gives but a very brief account of the
                    method by which he constructed his table; and the introduction to Dase’s
                    millions merely consists of Gauss’s letter suggesting their construction. The
                    Introduction to the <hi rend="italic">Fourth Million</hi> (pp. 52) contains a
                    full account of the method of construction and a history of factor tables, with
                    a bibliography of writings on the subject. The Introduction (pp. 103) to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sixth Million</hi> contains an enumeration of primes and a great
                    number of tables relating to the distribution of primes in the whole nine
                    millions, portions of which had been published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cambridge Philosophical Proceedings</hi> and elsewhere. The factor tables which
                    have been described greatly exceed in both extent and accuracy any others of the
                    same kind, the largest of which only reaches 408,000. This is the limit of

                    to 102,00β, followed by a list of primes from 102,000 to 400,313. In the earlier
                    editions of this work there are several errors in the list, but these are no
                    doubt corrected in Hiilsse’s edition (1840). These are the largest and most
                    convenient tables after those of Chernac. Salomon (1827) gives a factor table to
                    102,011, Kohler <hi rend="italic">{Handbuch,</hi> 1848) all divisors up to
                    21,524, and Houël (<hi rend="italic">Tables de Logarithmes,</hi> 1871) least
                    divisors up to 10,841. Barlow <hi rend="italic">{Tables,</hi> 1814) gives the
                    complete resolution of every number up to 10,000 into its factors; for example,
                    corresponding to 4932 we have given 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.3 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.137. This table is unique so far as we know. The work
                    also contains a list of primes up to 100,103. Both these tables are omitted in
                    the stereotyped reprint of 1840. In <hi rend="italic">Rees's Cyclopaedia</hi>
                    (1819), article “Prime Numbers,” there is a list of primes to 217,219 arranged
                    in decades. The <hi rend="italic">Fourth Million</hi> (1879) contains a list of
                    primes up to 30,341. On the first page of the <hi rend="italic">Second
                    Million</hi> Burckhardt gives the first nine multiples of the primes to 1423;
                    and a smaller table of the same kind, extending only to 313, occurs in Lambert’s

                    multiplications, and Von Hohenburg’s work never became generally known. The
                    three following tables are for the multiplication of a number by a single digit.
                    (1) Crelle, <hi rend="italic">Brleichterungs-Tafel fur jeden, der zu rechnen
                    hat</hi> (Berlin, 1836), a work extending to 1000 pages, gives the product of a
                    number of seven figures by a single digit, by means of a double operation of
                    entry. Each page is divided into two tables: for example, to multiply 9382477 by
                    7 we turn to page 825, and enter the righthand table at line 77, column 7, where
                    we find 77339; we then enter the left-hand table on the same page at line 93,
                    column 7, and find 656, so that the product required is 65677339. (2)</p>
                <p>Bretschneider, <hi rend="italic">Produktentafel</hi> (Hamburg and Gotha, 1841),
                    is somewhat similar to Crelle’s table, but smaller, the number of figures in the
                    multiplicand being five instead of seven. (3) In Laundy, <hi rend="italic">A
                    Table of Products</hi> (London, 1865), the product of any five-figure number by
                    a single digit is given by a double arrangement. The extent of the table is the
                    same as that of Bretschneider’s, as also is the principle, but the arrangement
                    is different, Laundy’s table occupying only 10 pages and Bretschneider’s 99
                    pages. Among earlier works may be noticed Gruson, <hi rend="italic">Grosses
                    Einmaleins von Eins bis Hunderttausend</hi> (Berlin, 1799),—a table of products
                    up to 9 × 10,000. The author’s intention was to extend it to 100,000, but we
                    believe only the first part was published. In this book there is no condensation
                    or double arrangement; the pages are very large, each containing 125 lines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Quarter-Squares.—</hi> Multiplication may be performed by means
                    of a table of single entry in the manner indicated by the formula— α⅛ = ⅛(α + δ)
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>-i(α-δ) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Thus with a table of quarter-squares we can multiply together any two numbers by
                    subtracting the quarter-square of their difference from the quarter-square of
                    their sum. The largest table of quartersquares is Laundy, <hi rend="italic"

                    used to effect multiplications by means of the above formula; but the earliest

                <p><hi rend="italic">Trigonometrical Tables {Natural).—</hi> Peter Apian published
                    in 1533 a table of sines with the radius divided decimally. The first complete
                    canon giving all the six ratios of the sides of a right-angled triangle is due
                    to Rheticus (1551), who also introduced the semi-quadrantal arrangement.
                    Rheticus’s canon was calculated for every ten minutes to 7 places, and Vieta
                    extended it to every minute (1579). In 1554 Reinhold published a table of
                    tangents to every minute. The first complete canon published in England was by
                    Blunedvile (1594), although a table of sines had appeared four years earlier.
                    Regiomontanus called his table of tangents (or rather cotangents) <hi
                    rend="italic">tabula foecunda</hi> on account of its great use; and till the

                    Besides “tangent,” Finck also introduced the word “secant,” the table of secants
                    having previously been called <hi rend="italic">tabula benefica</hi> by

                <p>By far the greatest computer of pure trigonometrical tables is George Joachim
                    Rheticus, whose work has never been superseded. His celebrated ten-decimal
                    canon, the <hi rend="italic">Opus Palatinum,</hi> was published by Valentine
                    Otho at Neustadt in 1596, and in 1613 his fifteen-decimal table of sines by
                    Pitiscus at Frankfort under the title <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus
                    Mathematicus.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Opus Palatinum</hi> contains a complete
                    ten-decimal trigonometrical canon for every ten seconds of the quadrant,
                    semiquadrantally arranged, with differences for all the tabular results
                    throughout. Sines, cosines, and secants are given on the left-hand pages in
                    columns headed respectively “Perpendiculum,” “Basis,” “Hypotenusa,” and on the
                    right-hand appear tangents, cosecants, and cotangents in columns headed
                    respectively “Perpendiculum,” “Hypotenusa,” “Basis.” At his death Rheticus left
                    the canon nearly complete, and the trigonometry was finished and the whole
                    edited by Valentine Otho; it was named in honour of the elector palatine
                    Frederick IV., who bore the expense of publication. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thesaurus</hi> of 1613 gives natural sines for every ten seconds throughout the
                    quadrant, to 15 places, semiquadrantally arranged, with first, second, and third
                    differences. Natural sines are also given for every second from 0° to 1° and
                    from 89° to 90°, to 15 places, with first and second differences. The rescue of
                    the manuscript of this work by Pitiscus forms a striking episode in the history
                    of mathematical tables. The alterations and emendations in the earlier part of
                    the corrected edition of the <hi rend="italic">Opus Palatinum</hi> were made by
                    Pitiscus, who had his suspicions that Rheticus had himself calculated a
                    ten-second table of sines to 15 decimal places; but it could not be found.
                    Eventually the lost canon was discovered amongst the papers of Rheticus, which
                    had passed from Otho to James Christmann on the death of the former. Amongst
                    these Pitiscus found (1) the ten-second table of sines to 15 places, with first,
                    second, and third differences (printed in the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus)</hi>;
                    (2) sines for every second of the first and last degrees of the quadrant, also
                    to 15 places, with first and second differences; (3) the commencement of a canon
                    of tangents and secants, to the same number of decimal places, for every ten
                    seconds, with first and second differences; (4) a complete minute canon of
                    sines, tangents, and secants, also to 15 decimal places. These tables taken in
                    connexion with the <hi rend="italic">Opus Palatinum</hi> give an idea of the
                    enormous labours undertaken by Rheticus; his tables not only remain to this day
                    the ultimate authorities but formed the data whereby Vlacq calculated his
                    logarithmic canon. Pitiscus says that for twelve years Rheticus constantly had
                    computers at work.</p>

                    The invention of logarithms the year after the publication of Rheticus’s volume
                    by Pitiscus changed all the methods of calculation; and it is worthy of note
                    that Napier’s original table of 1614 was a logarithmic canon of sines and not a
                    table of the logarithms of numbers. The logarithmic canon at once superseded the
                    natural canon; and since Pitiscus’s time no really extensive table of pure
                    trigonometrical functions has appeared. In recent years the employment of the
                    arithmometer of Thomas de Colmar has revived the use of tables of natural
                    trigonometrical functions, it being found convenient for some purposes to employ
                    an arithmometer and a natural canon instead of a logarithmic canon. Junge’s <hi

                    >Tables pour le Calcul des Coordonnées Goniométrigues</hi> (Mainz, n.d.), gives
                    natural sines and cosines (to 6 places) and their first nine multiples (to 4
                    places) for every centesimal minute of the quadrant. Tables of natural functions
                    occur in many collections, the natural and logarithmic values being sometimes
                    given on opposite pages, sometimes side by side on the same page.</p>
                <p>The following works contain tables of trigonometrical functions other than sines,
                    cosines, and tangents. Pasquich, <hi rend="italic">Tabulae
                    Log-arithmico-Trigonometrical</hi> (Leipsic, 1817), contains a table of sin <hi

                    45° at intervals of 1' to 5 places. Andrew, <hi rend="italic">Astronomical and
                    Nautical Tables</hi> (London, 1805), contains a table of “squares of natural
                    semichords,” i.e., of βin <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ⅜z from «=0° to 120° at
                    intervals of 10" to 7 places. This table has recently been greatly extended by
                    Major-General Hannyngton in his <hi rend="italic">Haversines, Natural and
                    Logarithmic, used in computing Lunar Distances for the Nautical Almanac</hi>
                    (London, 1876). The name “haversine,” now frequently used in works upon
                    navigation, is an abbreviation of “half versed sine”; viz., the haversine of <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> is equal to ∣(l-cosz), that is, to sin <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ⅜.τ∙. The table gives logarithmic haversines for
                    every 15" from 0° to 180°, and natural haversines for every 10" from 0° to 180°,
                    to 7 places, except near the beginning, where the logarithms are given to only 5
                    or 6 places. Tne work itself occupies 327 folio pages, and was suggested by
                    Andrew’s, a copy of which by chance fell into Hannyngton’s hands. Hannyngton
                    recomputed the whole of it by a partly mechanical method, a combination of two
                    arithmometers being employed. A table of haversines is useful for the solution
                    of spherical triangles when two sides and the included angle are given, and in
                    many other problems in spherical trigonometry. Andrew’s original table seems to
                    have attracted very little notice. Hannyngton’s was printed, on the
                    recommendation of the superintendent of the <hi rend="italic">Nautical
                    Almanac</hi> office, at the public cost. Before the calculation of Hannyngton’s
                    table Farley’s <hi rend="italic">Natural Versed Sines</hi> (London, 1856) was
                    used in the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac</hi> office in computing lunar
                    distances. This fine table contains natural versed sines from 0° to 125° at
                    intervals of 10" to 7 places, with proportional parts, and log versed sines from
                    0° to 135° at intervals of 15" to 7 places. The arguments are also given in
                    time. The manuscript was used in the office for twenty-five years before it was
                    printed. Traverse tables, which occur in most collections of navigation tables,
                    contain multiples of sines and cosines.</p>

                    compendious than in Vlacq, being similar to that of an ordinary seven-figure
                    table, but it is not so convenient, as mistakes in taking out the differences
                    are more liable to occur. The trigonometrical canon gives log sines, cosines,
                    tangents, and cotangents, from 0° to 2° at intervals of one second, to 10
                    places, without differences, and for the rest of the quadrant at intervals of
                    ten seconds. The trigonometrical canon is not wholly reprinted from the <hi

                    second of the first two degrees, which do not occur in Vlacq, were calculated
                    for the work by Lieutenant Dorfmund. Vega devoted great attention to the
                    detection of errors in Vlacq’s logarithms of numbers, and has given several

                    errors at from 31,983 to 47,746, most of them only amounting to a unit, but some
                    to as much as 3 or 4. As these errors in the <hi rend="italic">Trigonometria
                    Artificialis</hi> still remain uncorrected, it cannot be said that a reliable
                    ten-place logarithmic trigonometrical canon exists. The calculator who has
                    occasion to perform work requiring ten-figure logarithms of numbers should use
                    Vlacq’s <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica Logarithmica</hi> of 1628, after carefully
                    correcting the errors pointed out by Vega and Lefort. After Vlacq, Vega’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi> is the next best table; and Pineto’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Tables de Logarithmes Vulgaires à Dix Décimales, construites
                    d'après un nouveau mode</hi> (St Petersburg, 1871), though a tract of only 80
                    pages, may be usefully employed when Vlacq and Vega are unprocurable. Pineto’s
                    work consists of three tables: the first, or auxiliary table, contains a series
                    of factors by which the numbers whose logarithms are required are to be
                    multiplied to bring them within the range of table 2; it also gives the
                    logarithms of the reciprocals of these factors to 12 places. Table 1 merely
                    gives logarithms to 1000 to 10 places. Table 2 gives logarithms from 1,000,000
                    to 1,011,000, with proportional parts to hundredths. The mode of using these
                    tables is as follows. If the logarithm cannot be taken out directly from table
                    2, a factor <hi rend="italic">M</hi> is found from the auxiliary table by which
                    the number must be multiplied to bring it within the range of table 2. Then the
                    logarithm can be taken out, and, to neutralize the effect of the multiplication,
                    so far as the result is concerned, log (-^,) must be added; this quantity is
                    therefore given in an adjoining column to <hi rend="italic">M</hi> in the
                    auxiliary table. A similar procedure gives the number answering to any
                    logarithm, another factor (approximately the reciprocal of <hi rend="italic"
                    >M)</hi> being given, so that in both cases multiplication is used. The
                    laborious part of the work is the multiplication by <hi rend="italic">M</hi>;
                    but this is somewhat compensated for by the ease with which, by means of the
                    proportional parts, the logarithm is taken out. The factors are 300 in number,
                    and are chosen so as to minimize the labour, only 25 of the 300 consisting of
                    three figures all different and not involving 0 or 1. The principle of
                    multiplying by a factor which is subsequently cancelled by subtracting its
                    logarithm is used also in a tract, containing only ten pages, published by MM.
                    Namur and Mansion at Brussels in 1877 under the title <hi rend="italic">Tables
                    de Logarithmes à 12 décimales jusqu'à J</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    f</hi><hi rend="italic">31f milliards.</hi> Here a table is given of logarithms
                    of numbers near to 434,294, and other numbers are brought within the range of
                    the table by multiplication by one or two factors. The logarithms of the numbers
                    near to 434,294 are selected for tabulation because their differences commence
                    with the figures 100 ... and the presence of the zeros in the difference renders
                    the interpolation easy.</p>
                <p>If seven-figure logarithms do not give sufficiently accurate results, it is usual
                    to have recourse to ten-figure tables; with one exception, there exist no tables
                    giving 8 or 9 figures. The exception is John Newton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trigonometria Britannica</hi> (London, 1658), which gives logarithms of numbers
                    to 100,000 to 8 places, and also log sines and tangents for every centesimal
                    minute (i.e., the nine-thousandth part of a right angle), and also log sines and
                    tangents for the first three degrees of the quadrant to 5 places, the interval
                    being the one-thousandth part of a degree. This table is also unique in that it
                    gives the logarithms of the differences instead of the actual differences. The
                    arrangement of the page now universal in sevenfigure tables—with the fifth
                    figures running horizontally along the top line of the page—is due to John
                    Newton.</p>
                <p>As a rule seven-figure logarithms of numbers are not published separately, most
                    tables of logarithms containing both the logarithms of numbers and a
                    trigonometrical canon. Babbage’s and Sang’s logarithms are exceptional and give
                    logarithms of numbers only. Babbage, <hi rend="italic">Table of the Logarithms
                    of the Natural Numbers from 1 to 108,000</hi> (London, stereotyped in 1827;
                    there are several tirages of later dates), is the best for ordinary use. Great
                    pains were taken to get the maximum of clearness. The change of figure in the
                    middle of the block of numbers is marked by a change of type in the fourth
                    figure, which (with the sole exception of the asterisk) is the best method that
                    has been used. Copies of the book were printed on paper of different
                    colours—yellow, brown, green, &amp;c.—as it was considered that black on a white
                    ground was a fatiguing combination for the eye. The tables were also issued with
                    title-pages and introductions in other languages. The book is not very easy to
                    procure now. In 1871 Mr Sang published <hi rend="italic">A New Table of
                    Seven-place Logarithms of all Numbers from 20000 to 200000</hi> (London). In an
                    ordinary table extending from 10,000 to 100,000 the differences near the
                    beginning are so numerous that the proportional parts are either very crowded or
                    some of them omitted; by making the table extend from 20,000 to 200,000 instead
                    of from 10,000 to 100,000 the differences are halved in magnitude, while there
                    are only one-fourth as many in a page. There is also greater accuracy. A further
                    peculiarity of this table is that multiples of the differences, instead of
                    proportional parts, are given at the side of the page. Typographically the table
                    is exceptional, as there are no rules, the numbers being separated from the
                    logarithms by reversed commas. This work was to a great extent the result of an
                    original calculation; see <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Transactions,</hi> vol.
                    xxvi. (1871). Mr Sang proposed to publish a nine-figure table from 1 to
                    1,000,000, but the requisite support was not obtained. Various papers of Mr
                    Sang’s relating to his logarithmic calculations will be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Proceedings</hi> subsequent to 1872. In this connexion
                    reference should be made to Abraham Sharp’s table of logarithms of numbers from
                    1 to 100 and of primes from 100 to 1100 to 61 places, also of numbers from
                    999,990 to 1,000,010 to 63 places. These first appeared in <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">T</hi> = log——, while the Us are the variations of each for 10".
                    To find, for example, log l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 52'12"∙7, or log sin
                    6732"∙7, we have S=4 ’ 6854980 and log 6732 ’ 7-3 ’ 8281893, whence, by
                    addition, we obtain 8’5136873; but <hi rend="italic">V</hi> for 10" is - 2 ’ 29,
                    whence the variation for 12" ’ 7 is - 3, and the log sine required is 8 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5136870. Tables of <hi rend="italic">S</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">T</hi> are frequently called, after their inventor, “Delambre’s
                    tables.” Some seven-figure tables extend to 100,000, and others to 108,000, the
                    last 8000 logarithms, to 8 places, being given to ensure greater accuracy, as
                    near the beginning of the numbers the differences are large and the
                    interpolations more laborious and less exact than in the rest of the table. The
                    eight-figure logarithms, however, at the end of a seven-figure table are liable
                    to occasion error; for the computer who is accustomed to three leading figures,
                    common to the block of figures, may fail to notice that in this part of the
                    table there are four, and so a figure (the fourth) is sometimes omitted in
                    taking out the logarithm. In the ordinary method of arranging a seven-figure
                    table the change in the fourth figure, when it occurs in the course of the line,
                    is a source of frequent error unless it is very clearly indicated. In the
                    earlier tables the change was not marked at all, and the computer had to decide
                    for himself, each time he took out a logarithm, whether the third figure had to
                    be increased. In some tables the line is broken where the change occurs; but the
                    dislocation of the figures and the corresponding irregularity in the lines are
                    very awkward. Babbage printed the fourth figure in small type after a change.
                    The best method seems to be that of prefixing an asterisk to the fourth figure
                    of each logarithm after the change, as is done in Schron’s and many other modern
                    tables. This is beautifully clear and the asterisk at once catches the eye.
                    Shortrede and Sang replace 0 after a change by a <hi rend="italic">nokta</hi>
                    (resembling a diamond in a pack of cards). This is very clear in the case of the
                    0’s, but leaves unmarked the cases in which the fourth figure is 1 or 2. Babbage
                    printed a subscript point under the last figure of each logarithm that had been
                    increased. Schron used a bar subscript, which, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n20/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0020-0011"/> being more obtrusive, is not so satisfactory. In
                    some tables the increase of the last figure is only marked when the figure is
                    increased to a 5, and then a Roman five (v) is used in place of the Arabic
                    figure. Hereditary errors in logarithmic tables are considered in two papers “On
                    the Progress to Accuracy of Logarithmic Tables” and “On Logarithmic Tables,” in
                    <hi rend="italic">Monthly Notices of Roy. Ash Soc.</hi> for 1873. See also the
                    <hi rend="italic">Monthly Notices</hi> for 1874, p. 248; and a paper by

                <p>Passing now to the logarithmic trigonometrical canon, the first great advance
                    after the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Trigonometria Artificialis</hi>
                    in 1633 was made by Michael Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Tables of Logarithms</hi>
                    (London, 1792), which gives log sines and tangents to every second of the
                    quadrant to 7 places. This table contains about 450 pages with an average number
                    of 7750 figures to the page, so that there are altogether nearly three millions
                    and a half of figures. The change in the leading figures, when it occurs in a
                    column, is not marked at all; and the table must be used with very great
                    caution. In fact it is advisable to go through the whole of it, and fill in with
                    ink the first 0 after the change, as well as make some mark that will catch the
                    eye at the head of every column containing a change. The table was calculated by
                    interpolation from the <hi rend="italic">Trigonometria Artificialis</hi> to 10
                    places and then reduced to 7, so that the last figure should always be correct.
                    Partly on account of the absence of a mark to denote the change of figure in the
                    column and partly on account of the size of the table and a somewhat
                    inconvenient arrangement, the work seems neveι ’ to have come into very general
                    use. Computers have always preferred Bagay’s <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles Tables
                    Astronomiques et Hydrographiques</hi> (Paris, 1829), which also contains a
                    complete logarithmic canon to every second. The change in the column is very
                    clearly marked by a large black nucleus, surrounded by a circle, printed instead
                    of zero. Bagay’s work has now become very rare. The only other canon to every
                    second that has been published is contained in Shortrede’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Logarithmic Tables</hi> (Edinburgh). This work was originally issued in 1844 in
                    one volume, but being dissatisfied with it Shortrede issued a new edition in
                    1849 in two volumes. The first volume contains logarithms of numbers,
                    antilogarithms, &amp;c., and the second the trigonometrical canon to every
                    second. The volumes are sold separately, and may be regarded as independent
                    works; they are not even described on their title-pages as vol. i. and vol. ii.
                    The trigonometrical canon is very complete in every respect, the arguments being
                    given in time as well as in arc, full proportional parts being added, &amp;c.
                    The change of figure in the column is denoted by a nokta, printed instead of 0
                    where the change occurs.</p>
                <p>Of tables in which the quadrant is divided centesimally, the principal are Hobert
                    and Ideler, <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles Tables Trigonométriqucs</hi> (Berlin,
                    1799), and Borda and Delambre, <hi rend="italic">Tables Trigonométriqucs
                    Décimales</hi> (Paris, 1801). The former give, among other tables, natural and
                    log sines, cosines, tangents, and cotangents, to 7 places, the arguments
                    proceeding to 3° at intervals of 10" and thence to 50° at intervals of 1'
                    (centesimal), and also natural sines and tangents for the first hundred
                    ten-thousandths of a right angle to 10 places. The latter gives log sines,
                    cosines, tangents, cotangents, secants, and cosecants from 0° to 3° at intervals
                    of 10" (with full proportional parts for every second), and thence to 50° at
                    intervals of 1' (centesimal) to 7 places. There is also a table of log sines,
                    cosines, tangents, and cotangents from 0' to 10' at intervals of 10" and from 0°
                    to 50° at intervals of 10' (centesimal) to 11 places. Hobert and Ideler give a
                    natural as well as a logarithmic canon; but Borda and Delambre give only the
                    latter. Borda and Delambre give sevenfigure logarithms of numbers to 10,000, the
                    line being broken when a change of figure takes place in it.</p>
                <p>In Briggs’s <hi rend="italic">Trigonometria Britannica</hi> of 1633 the degree is
                    divided centesimally, and but for the appearance in the same year of Vlacq’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Trigonometria Artificialis,</hi> in which the degree is divided
                    sexagesimally, this reform might have been effected. It is clear that the most
                    suitable time for effecting such a change was when the natural canon was
                    replaced by the logarithmic canon, and Briggs took advantage of this
                    opportunity. He left the degree unaltered, but divided it centesimally instead
                    of sexagesimally, thus ensuring the advantages of decimal division (a saving of
                    work in interpolations, multiplications, &amp;c.) with the minimum of change.
                    The French mathematicians at the end of the 18th century divided the right angle
                    centesimally, completely changing the whole system, with no appreciable
                    advantages over Briggs’s system. In fact the centesimal degree is as arbitrary a
                    unit as the nonagesimal, and it is only the non-centesimal subdivision of the
                    degree that gives rise to inconvenience. Briggs’s example was followed by Roe,
                    Oughtred, and other 17th-century writers; but the centesimal division of the
                    degree seems to have entirely passed out of use, till it was recently revived by
                    Bremiker in his <hi rend="italic">Logarithmisch-trigonometrische Tafeln mit fünf
                    Decimalstellen</hi> (Berlin, 1872). This little book of 158 pages gives a
                    five-figure canon to every hundredth of a degree with proportional parts,
                    besides logarithms of numbers, addition and subtraction logarithms, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Collections of Tables.—</hi> For a computer who requires in one
                    volume logarithms of numbers and a ten-second logarithmic canon, perhaps the two
                    best books are Schrein, <hi rend="italic">Seven-Figure Logarithms</hi> (London,
                    1865, stereotyped, an English edition of the German work published at
                    Brunswick), anil Bruhns, <hi rend="italic">A New Manual of Logarithms to Seven
                    Places of Decimals</hi> (Leipsic, 1870). Both give logarithms of numbers and a
                    complete ten-second canon to 7 places; Bruhns also gives log sines, cosines,
                    tangents, and cotangents to every second up to 6° with proportional parts.
                    Schron contains an interpolation table, of 75 pages, giving the first 100
                    multiples of all numbers from 40 to 420. The logarithms of numbers extend to
                    108,000 in Schron and to 100,000 in Bruhns. Almost equally convenient is
                    Bremiker’s edition of Vega’s <hi rend="italic">Logarithmic Tables</hi> (Berlin,
                    stereotyped; the English edition was translated from the fortieth edition of Dr
                    Bremiker’s by W. L. F. Fischer). This book gives a canon to every ten seconds,
                    and for the first five degrees to every second, with logarithms of numbers to
                    100,000. All these works give the proportional parts for all the differences in
                    the logarithms of numbers. In Babbage’s, Callet’s, and many other tables only
                    every other table of proportional parts is given near the beginning for want of
                    space. Schron, Bruhns, and most modern tables published in Germany have
                    title-pages and introductions in different languages. Dupuis, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tables de Logarithmes à sept Décimales</hi> (stereotyped, third tirage, 1868,
                    Paris), is also very convenient, containing a ten-second canon, besides
                    logarithms of numbers to 100,000, hyperbolic logarithms of numbers to 1000, to 7
                    places, &amp;c. In this work negative characteristics are printed throughout in
                    the tables of circular functions, the minus sign being placed above the figure;
                    these are preferable to the ordinary characteristics that are increased by 10.
                    This is the only work we know in which negative characteristics are used. The
                    edges of the pages containing the circular functions are red, the rest being
                    grey. Dupuis also edited Callet’s logarithms in 1862, with which this work must
                    not be confounded. Salomon, <hi rend="italic">Logarithmische Tafeln</hi>
                    (Vienna, 1827), contains a ten-second canon (the intervals being one second for
                    the first two degrees), logarithms of numbers to 108,000, squares, cubes, square
                    roots, and cube roots to 1000, a factor table to 102,011, ten-place Briggian and
                    hyperbolic logarithms of numbers to 1000 and of primes to 10,333, and many other
                    useful tables. The work, which is scarce, is a weil-printed small quarto
                    volume.</p>
                <p>Of collections of general tables the most useful and accessible arc Hutton,
                    Callet, Vega, and Kohler. Hutton’s well-known <hi rend="italic">Mathematical
                    Tables</hi> (London) was first issued in 1785, but considerable additions were
                    made in the fifth edition (1811). The tables contain seven-figure logarithms to
                    108,000, and to 1200 to 20 places, some antilogarithms to 20 places, hyperbolic
                    logarithms from 1 to 10 at intervals of Ό1 and to 1200 at intervals of unity to
                    7 places, logistic logarithms, log sines and tangents to every second of the
                    first two degrees, and natural and log sines, tangents, secants, and versed
                    sines for every minute of the quadrant to 7 places. The natural functions occupy
                    the left-hand pages and the logarithmic the righthand. The first six editions,
                    published in Hutton’s lifetime (d. 1823), contain Abraham Sharp’s 61-figure
                    logarithms of numbers. Olinthus Gregory, who brought out the 1830 and succeeding
                    editions, omitted these tables and Hutton’s introduction, which contains a
                    history of logarithms, the methods of constructing them, &amp;c. Callet’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Tables Portatives de Logarithmes</hi> (stereotyped, Paris) seems
                    to have been first issued in 1783, and has since passed through a great many
                    editions. In that of 1853 the contents are seven-figure logarithms to 108,000,
                    Briggian and hyperbolic logarithms to 48 places of numbers to 100 and of primes
                    to 1097, log sines and tangents for minutes (centesimal) throughout the quadrant
                    to 7 places, natural and log sines to 15 places for every ten minutes
                    (centesimal) of the quadrant, log sines and tangents for every second of the
                    first five degrees (sexagesimal) and for every ten seconds of the quadrant
                    (sexagesimal) to 7 places, besides logistic logarithms, the first hundred
                    multiples of the modulus to 24 places and the first ten to 70 places, and other
                    tables. This is one of the most complete and practically useful collections of
                    logarithms that have been published, and it is peculiar in giving a centesimally
                    divided canon. The size of the page in the editions published in the 19th
                    century is larger than that of the earlier editions, the type having been reset.
                    Vega’s <hi rend="italic">Tabïdae Logarithrno-trigonometricae</hi> was first
                    published in 1797 in two volumes. The first contains sevenfigure logarithms to

                    to 1° 30', for every 10" to 6° 3', and thence at intervals of a minute, also
                    natural sines and tangents to every minute, all to 7 places. The second volume
                    gives simple divisors of all numbers up to 102,000, a list of primes from

                    logarithms is added. Vega differs from Hutton and Callet in giving so many
                    useful non-logarithmic tables, and his collection is in many respects
                    complementary to theirs. Schulze, <hi rend="italic">Neue und erweiterte Sammlung
                    logarithmischer, trigonometrischer, und anderer Tafeln</hi> (Berlin, 1778, 2
                    vols.), is a valuable collection, and contains seven-figure logarithms to
                    101,000, log sines and tangents to 2° at intervals of a second, and natural
                    sines, tangents, and secants to 7 places, log sines and tangents and Napierian
                    log sines and tangents to 8 plaøes, all for every ten seconds to 4° and thence
                    for every minute to 45°, besides squares, cubes, square roots, and cube roots to
                    1000, binomial theorem coefficients, powers of <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and
                    other· small tables. Wolfram’s hyperbolic logarithms of numbers below 10,000 to
                    48 places first appeared in this work. Lambert, <hi rend="italic">Supplementa
                    Tabularum Logarithmicanιm el Trigonometricarum</hi> (Lisbon, 1798), contains a
                    number of useful and curious non-logarithmic tables; it bears a general
                    resemblance to the second volume of Vega, but contains numerous other small
                    tables of a more strictly mathematical character. A very useful collection of
                    non-logarithmic tables is printed in Barlow’s <hi rend="italic">New Mathematical
                    Tables</hi> (London, 1814). It gives squares, cubes, square roots, and cube
                    roots (to 7 places), reciprocals to 9 or 10 places, and resolutions into their
                    prime factors of all numbers from 1 to 10,000, the first ten powers of numbers
                    to 100, fourth and fifth powers of numbers from 100 to 1000, prime numbers from
                    1 to 100,103, eight-place hyperbolic logarithms to 10,000, tables for the
                    solution of the irreducible case in cubic equations, &amp;c. In the stereotyped
                    reprint of 1840 only the squares, cubes, square roots, cube roots, and
                    reciprocals are retained. The first volume of Shortrede’s tables, in addition to
                    the trigonometrical canon to every second, contains antilogarithms and Gaussian
                    logarithms. Hassler, <hi rend="italic">Tabulae Logarithmicae et
                    Trigono-metricae</hi> (New York, 1830, stereotyped), gives seven-figure
                    logarithms to 100,000, log sines and tangents for every second to l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi>, and log sines, cosines, tangents, and cotangents
                    from l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> to 3° at intervals of 10" and thence to
                    45° at intervals of 30". Every effort has been made to reduce the size of the
                    tables without loss of distinctness, the page being only about 3 by 5 inches.
                    Copies of the work were published with the introduction and title-page in
                    different languages. Stanley, <hi rend="italic">Tables of Logarithms</hi> (New
                    Haven, U.S., 1860), gives seven-figure logarithms to 100,000, and log sines,
                    cosines, tangents, cotangents, secants, and cosecants at intervals of ten
                    seconds to 15° and thence at intervals of a minute to 45° to 7 places, besides
                    natural sines and cosines, antilogarithms, and other tables. This collection
                    owed its origin to the fact that Hassler’s tables were found to be inconvenient
                    owing to the smallness of the type. Luvini, <hi rend="italic">Tables of
                    Logarithms</hi> (London, 1866, stereotyped, printed at Turin), gives
                    seven-figure logarithms to 20,040, Briggian and hyperbolic logarithms of primes
                    to 1200 to 20 places, log sines ami tangents for each second to 9', at intervals
                    of 10" to 2°, of 30" to 9°, of 1' to 45° to 7 places, besides square and cube
                    roots up to 625. The book, which is intended for schools, engineers, &amp;c.,
                    has a peculiar arrangement of the logarithms and proportional parts on the
                    pages. Chambers’s <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Tables</hi> (Edinburgh),
                    containing logarithms of numbers to 100,000, and a canon to every minute of log
                    sines, tangents, and secants and of natural sines to 7 places, besides
                    proportional logarithms and other small tables, is cheap and suitable for
                    schools, though not to be compared as regards matter or typography to the best
                    tables described above. Of six-figure tables Bremiker’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Logarιthmonιm VI. Decimalium Nova Tabula Bero-linensis</hi> (Berlin, 1852) is
                    probably one of the best. It gives logarithms of numbers to 100,000, with
                    proportional parts, and log sines and tangents for every second to 5°, and
                    beyond this point for every ten seconds, with proportional parts. Hantschl, <hi
                    rend="italic">Logarithmisch-trigonometrisches Handbuch</hi> (Vienna, 1827),
                    gives five-figure logarithms to 10,000, log sines and tangents for every ten
                    seconds to 6 places, natural sines, tangents, secants, and versed sines for
                    every minute to 7 places, logarithms of primes to 15,391, hyperbolic logarithms
                    of numbers to 11,273 to 8 places, least divisors of numbers to 18,277, binomial
                    theorem coefficients, &amp;c. Farley’s <hi rend="italic">Six-Figure
                    Logarithms</hi> (London, stereotyped, 1840) gives six-figure logarithms to
                    10,000 and log sines and tangents for every minute to 6 places. Of five-figure
                    tables the most convenient is <hi rend="italic">Tables of Logarithms</hi>
                    (Useful Knowledge Society, London, from the stereotyped plates of 1839), which
                    were prepared by De Morgan, though they have no name on the title-page. They
                    contain five-figure logarithms to 10,000, log sines and tangents to every minute
                    to 5 places, besides a few smaller tables. Lalande’s <hi rend="italic">Tables de
                    Logarithmes</hi> is a five-figure table with nearly the same contents as De
                    Morgan’s, first published in 1805. It has since passed through many editions,
                    and, after being extended from 5 to 7 places, passed through several more.

                    (London, 1860), give five-figure logarithms to 10,000 and log sines and tangents
                    for every minute, also a small table of Gaussian logarithms. Houël, <hi
                    rend="italic">Tables de Logarithmes à Cinq Décimales</hi> (Paris, 1871), is a
                    very convenient collection of five-figure tables; besides logarithms of numbers

                    to 10,841, antilogarithms, &amp;c. The work contains 118 pages of tables. The

                    parts, arranged as in an ordinary seven-figure table. By adding log 10 to the
                    results the range is from 10,000 to 105,000 at intervals of unity. The table
                    formed part of the <hi rend="italic">Annals of the Vienna Observatory</hi> for
                    1851, but separate copies were printed. The most elaborate table of hyperbolic
                    logarithms is due to Wolfram, who calculated to 48 places the logarithms of all
                    numbers up to 2200, and of all primes (also of a great many composite numbers)
                    between this limit and 10,009. Wolfram’s results first appeared in Schulze’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Sammlung</hi> (1778). Six logarithms which Wolfram had been
                    prevented from computing by a serious illness were supplied in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Berliner Jahrbuch,</hi> 1783, p. 191. The complete table was
                    reproduced in Vega’s <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi> (1794), when several
                    errors were corrected. Tables of hyperbolic logarithms are contained in the
