                    art; for practical information as to modern processes, see <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    are woven in a loom, of whatever material they may be made, and whether the
                    woven stuff be plain or figured. The simplest and earliest process of weaving
                    was managed thus. The ground of the future stuff was formed by a number of
                    parallel strings called the <hi rend="italic">warp,</hi> having their upper ends
                    attached to a horizontal beam and drawn taut by weights hung from their lower
                    ends. In the early Greek loom each warp thread had a separate weight (see fig.
                    1). On the number of the warp strings the fineness and width of the stuff
                    depended. The strings of the <hi rend="italic">weft</hi> were interlaced at
                    right angles to those of the warp, and the combination of the two formed the
                    woven stuff or <hi rend="italic">web.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">weft</hi> was
                    so called from its being “wafted” in and out of the warp; it is also often
                    called the <hi rend="italic">woof,</hi> though more correctly the woof is the
                    same as the web or finished stuff. The threads of the weft were wound round a
                    sort of bobbin on a pivot which was made to revolve inside a hollow boat-shaped
                    piece of wood pointed at both ends so as to pass easily between the threads of
                    the warp. This is called the <hi rend="italic">shuttle.</hi> The thread passed
                    out through a hole in the side of the shuttle, the inner pivot revolving as the
                    thread was delivered between the strings of the warp. In order to make the weft
                    interlace in the warp some of the upright strings were pulled forward out of the
                    general plane in which the warp hung; this was done in the simplest way by a
                    reed, which divided the threads into two sets called <hi rend="italic"
                    >leaves</hi> and thus formed an opening called the <hi rend="italic">shred,</hi>
                    through which the shuttle could pass, as shown in fig. 1. Another way,
                    applicable to more complicated ornamental weaving, was to have a series of
                    threads attached to the warp at right angles, so that the weaver could pull any
                    of the warp threads away from the rest, thus allowing the shuttle to pass in
                    front of or behind any special warp strings. By a very simple mechanical
                    contrivance these threads were worked by a foot treadle, thus leaving the
                    weaver’s hands free to manage the shuttle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>These dividing sticks are called in French “batons à deux”;
                    in the simplest kind of weaving only one is required. The use of treadles and
                    “spring staves” is more applicable to the low loom, in which the warp is
                    strained in a horizontal position.</p></note> In the simplest sort of weaving
                    first one and then the other half of the warp threads were pulled forward, and
                    so a plain regularly interlaced stuff was woven. The next stage was to make a
                    cloth with coloured stripes, by using successively two shuttles containing
                    different-coloured threads. In a chequered cloth the warp was made of
                    two-coloured threads stretched in successive bands, and the cross stripes of the
                    weft were woven in by the two shuttles. To form a more complicated pattern the
                    weft must not cross the warp alternately: the design is formed by either the
                    warp or the weft predominating on the surface in certain places. In all cases
                    each thread of the weft must be driven home to its place after each stroke of
                    the shuttle. In the earliest times this was done by beating the weft with a
                    wooden sword-shaped implement<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Lat. <hi rend="italic">spαthα.</hi></p></note> introduced
                    between the strings of the warp; but later a heavy comb-shaped tool was
                    used,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lat. <hi
                    rend="italic">pecten</hi>; modem English <hi rend="italic">batten</hi> or <hi

                    and drove home at one blow a longer length of the weft. An upright loom such as
                    has been described is shown clearly in some of the wall paintings from Thebes,
                    dating about 1600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and in other earlier ones from
                    Beni-Hasan. A very similar loom is represented on a Greek vase of the 5th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> with a picture of Penelope and the
                    never-finished piece of stuff (see fig. 1). In this interesting painting the
                    upper band has simple geometrical ornaments, such as occur on archaic Greek
                    vases; the next has figures of winged men and gryphons. This sort of loom is
                    still used in Scandinavian countries for tapestry.<note anchored="true"

                    threads stretched, not upright, but horizontally,—an arrangement which is more
                    convenient for working treadles. These two forms are called in French “la haute
                    lisse’’and “la basse lisse,”—the high and the low loom. The general principle is
                    the same in both. Fig. 2 shows a simple form of the “basse lisse,” such as was
                    used throughout the Middle Ages, except in Iceland and in Scandinavia.<note

                    cities, were probably used to strain the thread as it was being spun on the
                    distaff.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Schliemann

                    of the warp; this method must have been very inconvenient, as the whole warp
                    could swing to and fro. A very obvious improvement, introduced in some countries
                    at an early date, was to have a second beam, round which the lower ends of the
                    warp could be wound. In Scandinavian countries the use of weights continued till
                    modern times. In the fateloom of the sagas these weights are heroes’ skulls,
                    while the shuttle is a sword.</p>
                <p>Some simple form of weaving seems to have been practised by prehistoric man at a
                    very early stage of development. Fig. 3 shows an example of coarse flaxen stuff
                    from the lake-dwellings of Switzerland, dating from the Stone Age. Wool appears
                    to have been the first substance used, as no skill is required to prepare it for
                    spinning. Weaving was specially the duty of women, and even in the Middle Ages
                    in Europe it was, in some countries, considered a specially feminine
                    employment.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the time
                    of St Louis (13th century) in France some sorts of weaving, such as “tapisserie
                    Saracenois,” were done only by men.</p></note> An early Christian sarcophagus in
                    the Lateran has a symbolical relief representing God condemning the future world
                    to labour,—tillage for the man and weaving for the woman :—He gives ears of corn
                    to Adam and a sheep to Eve.</p>
                <p>The Egyptians were famed for the beauty of their woven stuffs, and almost
                    incredible stories are related of the fineness of their linen, such as a pallium
                    sent by King Amasis to the Spartans, which, Herodotus (iii. 47) says, was made
                    of yarn containing no less than 360 threads; the figures woven on this were
                    partly of cotton and partly of gold thread. Herodotus also mentions a wonderful
                    pallium sent by the same king to the shrine of Athene at Lindus. Few examples of
                    the fine and richly ornamented sorts of Egyptian stuffs now exist, though we
                    have immense quantities of the coarse linen in which mummies were wrapped. This,
                    though coarse, is closely woven, and usually has in every inch many more threads
                    to the warp than to the weft.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Some existing specimens have in each inch 152 threads in the
                    warp and 70 in the weft; in modern stuffs the proportion is the other way. A
                    coarsely woven piece of Egyptian stuff in the British Museum has a border with a
                    man swimming, supported by a float.</p></note> A few fragments of Egyptian cloth
                    of the XVIIIth Dynasty have been found with a border of coloured bands, the blue
                    of which is indigo and the red extract of <hi rend="smallcaps">Kermes</hi></p>
                <p>(7.v.). In Egypt linen was specially employed for religious purposes, such as
                    priestly and royal vestments, because it harbours dirt less than wool or cotton,
                    which were also worn by the Egyptians, and it was used to bandage mummies,
                    because it was thought not to engender worms. Though priests were allowed to
                    wear outer garments of wool, they were obliged to put them off before entering a
                    sacred place.</p>
                <p>The Phoenicians were celebrated for their weaving, as for their skill in other
                    arts. Their purple linen, dyed with the murex, was specially valued; Tyre and
                    Sidon were the chief places where this was made. Babylon, Carthage, Sardis,
                    Miletus, and Alexandria were all famous seats of textile manufacture in the time
                    of Herodotus.</p>
                <p>Though no specimens of Assyrian textiles remain, some notion of their richness of
                    ornament and the styles of their patterns may be gained from the minute
                    representations of rich dresses worn by kings and other important personages in
                    the sculptured Avail-reliefs from Nineveh which are now in the British
                    Museum.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A very
                    magnificent royal dress, with woven patterns of deities, kings, animals, and the
                    sacred tree, much resembling those on the metal bowls of Assyria, is figured by
                    Layard, <hi rend="italic">Monuments of Assyria,</hi> series i., pl.
                    ix.</p></note> The stuffs worn by Asur-banipal are most elaborate in design,
                    being covered with delicate geometrical patterns and diapers, with borders of
                    lotus and other flowers treated with great decorative skill. A large marble slab
                    from the same palace is covered with an elaborate textile pattern in low relief,
                    and is evidently a faithful copy of an Assyrian carpet. Still more magnificent
                    stuffs are represented as being worn by Assyrian captives on the enamelled
                    wall-tiles from Rameses II.’s palace (14th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> at Tel al-Yâhùdiya (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pottery,</hi> vol. xix.
                    p. 603); the woven patterns are most minutely reproduced in their different
                    colours, and the design, special to Assyria, of the sacred tree between two
                    guardian beasts, is clearly represented, though on the most minute scale.</p>
                <p>Our knowledge of Greek textiles, in the almost complete absence of any existing
                    specimens,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>One
                    remarkable example of tapestry from a tomb in the Crimea is supposed by Stephani

                    chiefly derived from the descriptions of various classical authors. One
                    indication of the patterns commonly used at an early period is given by the
                    designs on much of the archaic Greek pottery, which clearly has ornament derived
                    from textile sources. Vol. xix. p. 607, fig. 16, shows examples of these; simple
                    bands, chequers, and zigzags would naturally be the first steps towards more
                    elaborate patterns. Again, recent excavations at Orchomenus and Tiryns have
                    brought to light examples of ceiling and wall decoration the motives of which
                    are obviously derived from textile patterns. A stone ceiling at Orchomenus has
                    in relief a carpet-like pattern, and the painted wall-stucco of the Tiryns
                    palace has many varieties of coarse but effective textile ornament. The poems of
                    Homer are full of descriptions of woven stuffs of the most magnificent materials
                    and design, used both for dresses<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    treasuries of most Greek temples appear to have contained large stores of rich
                    woven stuffs.</p></note> Euripides <hi rend="italic">(Ion,</hi> 1141-1162) gives
                    a glowing description of a peplos which belonged to the temple of Apollo at
                    Delphi, on which was depicted the firmament of heaven, with Apollo Helios in his
                    chariot, surrounded by the chief stars and constellations. At Athens a new
                    peplos, ornamented with the battle of the gods and the giants, was woven for the
                    gold and ivory statue of Athene in the Parthenon every fifth year, and was
                    solemnly carried in procession at the greater Panathenaea. Similarly at Olympia
                    a new peplos was woven by sixteen women, and displayed every fifth year at the
                    Olympian games in honour of Hera. It appears probable that these magnificent
                    peploi were not used as garments, which would have partly concealed the
                    splendour of Phidias’s gold and ivory statues, but were suspended over them like
                    a mediaeval baldacchino. Very possibly, however, most of the elaborate work on

                <p>The Romans under the late republic and the empire possessed immense stores of the
                    most magnificent textiles of every description, such as the splendid collection
                    of tapestry which Rome inherited along with the other art treasures of Attalus
                    II. of Pergamum (2d cent, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> A very costly cloth
                    of gold was called by the Romans “attalica,” after Attalus. The C. Cestius who
                    died about the middle of the 1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and who
                    is buried in the existing pyramid in Rome, left orders in his will that his body
                    was to be wrapped in certain attalica; but, as this was forbidden by a sumptuary
                    law, his heirs sold the gold stuff and with the proceeds had two colossal bronze
                    statues made, which were set outside the tomb. The feet of one of these have
                    been found with an inscribed pedestal recording the above-mentioned facts. The
                    size of the statue shows that the attalica must have been worth a very great
                    sum. Examples of large prices given by Romans for woven stuffs are recorded by
                    Pliny <hi rend="italic">(H.N.,</hi> viii. 48): Metellus Scipio bought some
                    hangings from Babylon for 800,000 sesterces, and other similar stuffs were
                    bought by Nero for four millions of sesterces (about £3360). Costly tapestry
                    from Babylon is mentioned by Plautus <hi rend="italic">(Stich.,</hi> IL, ii.
                    54), Silius Italicus (xiv. 658), and Martial (xiv. 150). Virgil <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gear.,</hi> iii. 25) mentions woven tapestries with figures of
                    Britons being used at theatrical shows: “Purpurea intexti tollant aulaea
                    Britanni.” Other tapestries with scenes from the story of Theseus and Ariadne
                    are mentioned by Catullus <hi rend="italic">(Argon.,</hi> xlvi. 267).<note

                    various dates, apparently ranging from the 4th to the 6th or 7th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The earliest are of purely classical style: some have
                    badly designed but very decorative figures of pagan deities, with their names in
                    Greek <hi rend="italic">—e.g.</hi> Hermes and Apollo; others have figures
                    driving chariots drawn by two centaurs, or marine gods, or long bands of
                    animals—bears, lions, stags, ducks, and many others. These are used to decorate
                    linen tunics or pieces of stuff about 2 feet square. The later examples appear
                    to be Coptic vestments of various shapes, and are decor ated with rude figures
                    of St George and other Oriental saints, each with a nimbus. These ornaments are
                    done by true tapestry weaving, the weft pattern being in brilliantly coloured
                    wools on a flaxen warp. Tn some cases the colours, especially the magnificent
                    reds and blues, are as bright as if they were new. Though in all cases the
                    figure drawing is rude, the decorative value is very great.</p>
                <p>From the 6th to the 13th century Byzantium became the capital of all the
                    industrial arts, and in none is its influence more obvious than in that of
                    weaving. There the arts of ancient Greece and of old Rome met and were fused
                    with the artistic notions of ancient Egypt, Assyria, Persia, and Asia Minor, and
                    this combination produced a fresh and very active art spirit, which for many
                    centuries dominated the whole civilized world. As regards weaving, this new
                    development was strengthened by the introduction of silk into Europe in the
                    reign of Justinian, and many specimens of early silk fabrics have lasted down to
                    the present time, partly through their being safe against moths. The silken
                    stuffs found in the tombs of Charlemagne and other kings, though perhaps not
                    themselves as early as the 6th century, show one class of design used in
                    Byzantium in the time of Justinian. Some of these combine the figure-subjects of
                    ancient Rome with the stronger decorative beauty of the East. Chariot races in
                    the circus, consuls and emperors enthroned in state, gladiatorial fights with
                    lions, and other classical subjects occur, arranged in medallions or wreaths,
                    set in close rows, so as to fill up the ground. Again, mixed with these
                    classical scenes are designs of purely Assyrian origin, such as the sacred tree
                    between two guardian beasts, closely resembling the designs of 2000 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The manufacture of these rich fabrics was carried on,
                    not only in Byzantium, but also in many towns of Greece proper, such as Athens,
                    Thebes, and Corinth, all of which were specially famed for their silk textiles.
                    During the same time, the 6th to the 12th century, Baghdad, Damascus, Ispahan,
                    and many other towns in Persia and Syria were producing woven stuffs of the
                    richest materials and designs; names of reigning caliphs are sometimes mingled
                    with Ar-abicsentences from the Koran and other sacred books, which are
                    introduced freely among the intricate patterns with the most richly decorative
                    effect. By this means some existing specimens of the 8th to the 10th century can
                    be dated. Fig. 4 shows a 16th-century example of the finest Persian damask in
                    silk and gold,—a masterpiece of textile design.</p>
                <p>According to the usual story, Roger of Sicily, who in 1147 made a successful raid
                    on the shores of Attica and took Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, carried off as
                    prisoners a number of Greek weavers, whom he settled at Palermo and made the
                    founders of the royal factory for silk weaving. This story is doubtful, for the
                    Saracenic inhabitants of Sicily had apparently been producing fine silken stuffs
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n226/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0226-0209"/> long before the 12th century. In part, however,
                    the story may be true; certainly an impetus was given to the weaving industry of
                    Palermo in the 12th century, and for about two centuries Sicily became the chief
                    seat in Europe for the production of the finest woven stuffs. A large number of
                    examples of these beautiful fabrics still exist, showing an immense variety of
                    designs, all of which are imagined with the highest decorative skill,—perfect
                    masterpieces of textile art, combining freedom of invention and grace of drawing
                    with that slight amount of mechanical stiffness which is specially suited to the
                    requirements of the loom. One of the earliest existing specimens, which shows
                    the existence of the fabrique before the time of Roger I., is a piece of silk
                    stuff in which the body of St Cuthbert at Durham was wrapped when his relics
                    were translated in 1104; this was found at the opening of his grave in 1827, and
                    is now preserved in Durham cathedral library. The figures woven on it show an
                    interesting combination of Western and Oriental art. Birds and conventional
                    ornaments of purely Eastern style are mingled with designs taken from late Roman
                    mosaics,—the whole being blended with great skill into a highly decorative
                    pattern.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Raine, <hi

                    stuffs.</p></note> The Sicilian silks of the 12th to the 14th century were
                    mostly used for ecclesiastical vestments, altar frontals, and the like; and the
                    fact that examples have survived in almost all countries of Europe shows how
                    important and far-reaching a trade in them must once have been carried on. The
                    favourite designs were the sun breaking through a cloud from whence rays of
                    light are issuing, or conventionally treated ships, fountains, islands, castles,
                    and an immense variety of birds and beasts, such as swans, mallards, eagles,
                    lions, cheetahs, hounds, giraffes, antelopes, and others. Some specimens have
                    siren-like female forms, with floating hair, casting nets, leaning down from
                    palm trees, or issuing from shells. Others, rather later in style, have winged
                    angel-like figures. In many cases the Assyrian sacred tree and its guardian
                    beasts occur, and very frequently borders with sham Arabic letters are
                    introduced,—a survival of the time when real sentences were woven into the
                    fabrics of Persia and Egypt, probably intended as a visible sign that the stuff
                    was the genuine product of Saracenic looms. All these are perfect masterpieces
                    of textile art, and have never since been rivalled either in beauty of design or
                    in skilful use of gold and colours. Fig. 5 shows a characteristic example;
                    another copied from a painting is given under <hi rend="smallcaps">Mural

                <p>In the 14th century the chief centre of fine silk weaving was transferred from
                    Palermo to Lucca, Florence, Milan, Venice, and other towns in northern Italy,
                    and a different class of design, less rich in fancy, but scarcely less beautiful
                    in effect, came into vogue. The designs of these 14th and</p>
                <p>15th century textiles were chiefly conventional adaptations of natural foliage
                    and flowers, arranged with great beautv of line and wealth of decorative effect;
                    among the most beautiful is scroll-work of vines with graceful curving lines of
                    leaf and tendril. An extremely rich design, largely employed throughout the 15th
                    century, was made from the artichoke plant,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This is usually called the pine-apple pattern; but it was

                <p>14). At this time Venice contained a large number of Oriental craftsmen in all
                    the industrial arts, and very beautiful stuffs were woven there with designs of
                    mingled Oriental and Italian style,—probably the work of Mohammedan weavers (see
                    fig. 7).</p>
                <p>In all these Oriental, Sicilian, and early Italian stuffs gold thread is used in
                    a very lavish and effective way. It was made very skilfully, the richest effect
                    being produced with little metal by thickly gilding fine vellum skins with gold
                    leaf; the vellum was then cut into very thin strips <pb break="no"

                    closely as to look like a solid gold wire. In and since the 15th century gold
                    thread has been made by twisting a thin ribbon of gilt silver round a silken
                    core. In this way much less gold is required, as the silver ribbon is gilded
                    before being drawn out to its final thinness, and it is thus liable to tarnish,
                    oλving to the partial exposure of the silver surface. In classical times
                    attalica and other gold stuffs were made of solid gold wire beaten out with the
                    hammer.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The process of

                    lasted long after all the rest of the stuff had crumbled into dust. In 1544 the
                    grave of the wife of Honorius was opened and 36 lb of gold thread taken out of
                    it and melted.</p>
                <p>Throughout the Middle Ages cloth of gold was largely employed for ecclesiastical
                    and royal purposes. In some cases the whole of the visible surface was formed of
                    gold thread, producing the utmost splendour of effect. Westminster Abbey still
                    possesses a magnificent gold cope of the 15th century, in almost perfect
                    brilliance of preservation. In the 13th and 14th centuries Cyprus and Lucca were
                    specially famed for their gold stuffs, and the royal inventories of France and
                    England show that the kings possessed stores of this to an immense value. The
                    enormous sum of £11 a yard<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Equal to quite £50 of modern money.</p></note> is recorded to have been
                    given for a “cloth of estate” in the private accounts of Henry VII. This was a
                    cloth to hang over the royal throne, and must have been unusually wide, as other
                    cloth of gold at the same time was bought for 38s. the yard. Various names were
                    at different times given to textiles which were wholly or in part woven in gold,

                    lying loosely over the intermediate part. Mediaeval samite was sometimes made of

                <p>Although throughout the Middle Ages the finer stuffs used in England were to a
                    great extent the product of foreign looms, there was no lack of native textiles,
                    many of which were of great beauty. In the use of the needle the women of
                    England were especially skilful, and rich English embroideries were much

                    preserved in the Durham library. Fridestan became bishop of Winchester in 905.
                    Other examples of native textiles have been found in the coffins of many
                    ecclesiastics in England. Some interesting fragments are preserved in the

                    conventional scroll foliage, is a characteristic example of 13th-century design.

                    tapestries; in the 15th and 16th centuries it was largely imported into
                    Flanders. In the 14th century Bath produced the finest woollen cloth, and that
                    of Worcester was equally celebrated; in the 15th century the production of
                    woollen stuff was a great source of wealth to Norwich and other towns in the
                    eastern counties. A special sort of woollen yarn took its name from Worstead in
                    Norfolk, where it was made; it had a closer and harder twist than most woollen
                    thread, and thus could be made up into cloth of special fineness, which was used
                    for chasubles and other vestments, as is recorded in the inventories of York,
                    Exeter, and other cathedrals.</p>

                    silk. Phrases such as “silk of brydges” (Bruges), “silk dornex,” from Dorneck in
                    Flanders, and “sheets of raynes” (Rheims) often occur. A large number of other
                    similar names are to be met with in mediaeval writings.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Space will not allow a description of the textile work in each separate country.
                    That of Italy and the East was by far the most important throughout the Middle
                    Ages. Even Chinese textiles of gold and silk were imported into the west of
                    Europe, and were sometimes used for ecclesiastical purposes. Mediaeval vestments
                    of Chinese stuff still exist, the shape and added borders of which show that
                    they date from as early as the 14th century. These fabrics exactly resemble in
                    design and workmanship some which are woven in China at the present day. A very
                    interesting survival of the mediaeval style of weaving exists in Sweden and
                    other Scandinavian countries. Articles of dress, counterpanes, table-covers, and
                    the like are woven by the peasantry in a simple, highly decorative way, with
                    patterns which have altered little during the last three or four centuries.
                    Though coarse in texture, many of these are of great artistic beauty: nothing

                    style. Strong marks of Oriental influence are visible in these fine patterns,
                    but the method of weaving is purely native, —probably very like what the edicts
                    of Louis IX. call “tapisserie nostrez.” Very beautiful fabrics are still
                    produced in India, old designs being followed, and woven in the simplest form of
                    loom. Fig. 8 shows an example of a modern Indian loom used by the hill weavers.
                    In such looms the richest materials, such as gold and silk, and the most
                    elaborate patterns are woven, often by travelling weavers who can set up their
                    -whole apparatus in a very short time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Carpets.</hi></p>
                <p>Carpet weaving was essentially an Oriental art, and was the natural product of a
                    dry mudless country, where little furniture was used and the shoes were removed
                    on entering a building. Till the 16 th century carpets were almost unknown in
                    France and England, except for royal personages and for the sanctuaries of
                    cathedrals and important churches. In the latter case they were usually laid in
                    front of the high altar, and thus carried on to the floor the richness of colour
                    which ornamented the walls and vault. Oriental carpets frequently occur in
                    cathedral inventories among the other rich treasures of foreign or native make
                    which adorned the building. They were first employed in England for domestic
                    purposes by Queen Eleanor of Castile and her suite, in the latter part of the
                    13th century. In the palaces of Spain they were introduced much earlier, owing
                    to the presence of the Moors in southern Spain. In many cases they were used for
                    wall hangings, and the smaller ones to cover tables and other furniture, as is
                    represented in many 15th-century Italian pictures. Though few examples of
                    Oriental carpets exist earlier in date than the 15th century, yet the
                    manufacture was carried on in the highest state of perfection centuries before.
                    An example of the 14th century is preserved in a private collection at Vienna;
                    it was originally made as a hanging for the Kaaba at Mecca.<note anchored="true"

                    beautiful Oriental pile carpets are among the most perfect productions of the
                    weaver’s art, and till the 16th century were masterpieces of design and
                    splendour of colour. Usually they were woven of wool or of camels’ or goats’
                    hair, with a separate warp and weft of flax; but many magnificent carpets were
                    also made of silk mixed with gold thread. This extravagance of luxury produced
                    an effect, at least as regards the use of silk, but little superior to that of
                    fine wool or camel’s hair, as the special beauty of the silken gloss is seen on
                    the sides, not on the ends of the silk thread. Pile carpets are woven in a very
                    different way from ordinary textiles: short tufts of wool or silk are knotted on
                    the warp so that the ends of the threads which form the pattern project, and
                    these are cut down by shears to a uniform surface, thus forming a sort of
                    textile mosaic. Each row is firmly fixed by a shoot of linen weft-thread thrown
                    across the web, and then carefully beaten down -with the batten.</p>
                <p>Various classes of ornament occur in these magnificent Oriental carpets; one
                    variety has stiff geometrical patterns, the motives of which appear to be taken
                    from mosaics or tiles. Another and still more beautiful sort, manufactured
                    especially at Ispahan (see fig. 9), has elaborate flowing designs of flower
                    forms, sometimes mixed with figures of cheetahs, lions, antelopes, and birds, in
                    a few cases combined with human figures. Mr W. Morris, in his valuable lecture
                    on textile fabrics (London, 1884), traces three stages of design,—first, a pure
                    flowing style, closely resembling the early stucco mural reliefs of Cairo;
                    secondly, a similar style blended with animal forms; and thirdly, a purely
                    floral style, flowing in its lines and very fantastic and ingenious in its
                    patterns; this last he thinks belongs to about the time of Shah Abbas, and
                    lasted from about 1550 to 1650,—the culminating period of Oriental art.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A valuable help towards
                    establishing the dates of carpet patterns is given by many mediaeval Italian
                    pictures, in which Oriental carpets are often represented with wonderful
                    minuteness and appreciation.</p></note> Since then there has been a distinct
                    degradation of style, though in many cases older patterns have been worked from
                    and very perfect work produced. At the present day the influence of European
                    taste is rapidly destroying this survival of the best class of design, and
                    especially is introducing the most harsh and discordant colouring in place of
                    the glorious rich hues of the earlier Oriental weavers.</p>
                <p>Though no existing specimens can be pointed out, it appears probable that the
                    “tapisserie Saracenois” of Louis IX.’s edicts (1226-1270) refers to pile carpets
                    made by French weavers after the Oriental fashion.<note anchored="true"

                    the warp with a wooden needle called a <hi rend="italic">broach.</hi> It is a
                    sort of link between textile work and embroidery, from which it differs in
                    having its stitches applied, not to a finished web, but to the stretched strings
                    of a warp.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In tapestry
                    the weft stitches are put in loosely and carefully pressed home, so that the
                    warp strings are completely hidden.</p></note> It is made on a high loom, and
                    the whole process, though requiring much skill, is mechanically of the simplest
                    kind. It is very probable that many of the woven hangings used in ancient Egypt,
                    Greece, and other countries were true tapestry; but little is known on this
                    point. Till after the 12th century, in northern Europe, embroidery seems to have
                    served the place of tapestry, as, for example, in the wrongly named Bayeux
                    tapestry (see vol. viii. p. 162); while in the south of Europe and in Oriental
                    countries its place was supplied by the rich silken textiles and pile carpets
                    mentioned above.</p>
                <p>In the 14th century tapestry began to be largely made, especially in Flanders,
                    where the craft of weaving became very important at an early time. The designs
                    on the very few existing samples of 14th-century tapestry closely resemble those
                    of contemporary wall painting. A characteristic early specimen in the Louvre has
                    rows of medallions, each containing a scene from the life of St Martin, with two
                    or three figures treated in a very simply decorative way. The spaces between the
                    circles are filled up with a stiff geometrical ornament. To the end of the 14th
                    century belongs the magnificent tapestry in Angers cathedral, on which are
                    represented scenes from the Apocalypse; these were made at Arras, the chief seat
                    of the tapestry manufacture, both for quantity and quality. Hence the name <hi
                    rend="italic">arras</hi> (Italian <hi rend="italic">arazzι)</hi> came to mean
                    any sort of tapestry, wherever it was made. Another magnificent series of arras
                    work is preserved in Rheims cathedral, with designs from the history of Clovis;
                    these date from the middle of the 15th century. In the 14th century Flanders
                    produced enormous quantities of woven stuffs. At that time twentyseven streets
                    were occupied by the weavers of Ghent; in 1382 there were 50,000 weavers in
                    Louvain; and at Ypres there is said to have been a still larger number. From
                    about 1450 to 1500 was the golden age for tapestry, especially in Bruges and
                    Arras, where large quantities of the most magnificent historical pieces were
                    woven from designs supplied by painters of the Van Eyck school. The Flemish
                    tapestries of that time are perfect models of textile art, rich in colour,
                    strong in decorative effect, graceful in drawing and composition, and arranged
                    with consummate skill to suit the exigencies of the loom and the aesthetic
                    requirements of wall decoration. A very beautiful example of this class exists
                    at Hampton Court, hung in the dark under the gallery in the great hall,—a
                    striking contrast to the clever but artistically degraded tapestries of half a
                    century later, which hang round the main walls of the hall. Other fine examples
                    exist in the Cluny, Bern, and other museums, and especially in Madrid<note

                    >Tapestry of the Palace at Madrid,</hi> London, 1875; of all countries Spain is
                    the richest in tapestry of the 15th and 16th centuries. The royal collection
                    contains 2000 large pieces. Rich stores also belong to the principal cathedrals,
                    such as Toledo, which on the feast of Corpus Christi is completely hung round
                    with tapestry outside as well as inside. In the 17th century tapestry looms were
                    worked in Spain under royal patronage. One of Velazquez’s finest pictures in the
                    Madrid Gallery (Las Hilanderas) represents the visit of some court ladies to a
                    tapestry fabrique, in which women are working the looms.</p></note> —in the
                    royal collection and in that of the duke of Alva—and elsewhere in Spain. Though
                    very rich and varied in effect, the tapestry of the best period usually is woven
                    with not more than twenty different tints of wool,—half tints and gradations
                    being got by hatching one colour into another. In the 16th century about sixty
                    colours were principally employed in the still fine but rapidly deteriorating
                    tapestry of that period; and in the laborious but artistically worthless
                    productions of the Gobelin factory more than 14,000 differently tinted wools are
                    now used.</p>
                <p>In the 16 th century the art began to decline; very slight symptoms of decadence
                    are visible in the beautiful tapestries with Petrarch’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Triumphs</hi> in the South Kensington Museum, —most gorgeous pieces of textile
                    art, of the richest decorative effect. These were worked very soon after 1500
                    (see fig. 10). The influence of Raphael and his school succeeded that of the
                    15th-century Flemish painters, and was utterly destructive of true art value in
                    tapestry. Raphael’s cartoons, fine as they are in composition, are designed
                    without the least reference to textile requirements, and are merely large
                    pictures, which the weavers had to copy as best they might. This new style,
                    which reduced the art to a feeble copyism of painting, gave the death-blow to
                    the production of really fine tapestry. Brussels became the chief place for the
                    manufacture after the taking of Arras by Louis XI. in 1477, and its weavers with
                    wonderful skill imitated any sort of painting that was put before them. Cartoons
                    were drawn by several of Raphael’s pupils, such as Giulio Romano and Giovanni da
                    Udine, and by Mabuse, Michiel Coxcie, Bernard van Orley, and other Italianized
                    Flemish painters.</p>
                <p>In 1539 Francis I. founded a factory for tapestry at Fontainebleau, and soon
                    after other high looms were set up in Paris, examples from which still exist and
                    show a rapid degradation of style. In 1603 a new factory was started in Paris
                    under royal patronage, in the workshop of a family of dyers named Gobelin, after
                    whom the new factory was named (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gobelin).</hi> The
                    Gobelin looms were first worked by weavers from Flanders, who soon taught the

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0230-0213"/> mysteries of the craft to a number of French
                    workmen. Cartoons were supplied by Simon Vouet and other distinguished French
                    painters. In the reign of Louis XIV. a great impulse was given to the factory,
                    and from 1667 the whole establishment became the property of the crown. Louis
                    XIV.’s minister, Colbert, did much to encourage this and other industries.
                    Charles Le Brun the painter was made director of the works, and a number of
                    artists prepared the cartoons under his supervision. In the 18th century Coypel,
                    Jouvenet, Boucher, Watteau, and many other popular painters made designs, often
                    of great size and elaboration, for the Gobelin looms, but all in the very worst
                    possible taste; these include large series of sacred, mythological, and
                    historical subjects, landscapes, sea-pieces, and even portraits,—the last being
                    perhaps the most ridiculous misuse of the textile art that could possibly be
                    invented. Other tapestry looms were worked in the 18th century at Aubusson,
                    Felletin, and other places in France.</p>
                <p>High-warp looms appear to have been worked in England in the 15th century, though
                    by far the greater part of the rich stores of tapestry in this country came from
                    Flanders. One very beautiful example of English work of this time exists in St
                    Mary’s Hall at Coventry; it represents the marriage of Henry VI. Part of another
                    series with the marriage of Henry VII. is preserved in a house in Cornwall. In
                    the latter part of the 15th and the first half of the 16th century enormous sums
                    were spent by the rich in England on Flemish tapestry. Cardinal Wolsey’s private
                    accounts and inventories, which still exist,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Law, <hi rend="italic">Hampton Court Palace,</hi>
                    London, 1885.</p></note> give an astonishing picture of the wealth which he
                    lavished on the adornment of his palace at Hampton Court. In 1522 he bought 132
                    large pieces of Brussels tapestry, woven w <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> ith
                    Scriptural subjects, and mostly made to order, so as to fit exactly the various
                    wall spaces. He also bought large quantities of costly Oriental carpets. In the
                    inventories are enumerated “foot carpets,” “table carpets,” and “window
                    carpets,” “hanging peces,” “borders with arms,” and “window peces,” the last
                    being strips of tapestry woven in narrow lengths to fit the sills and jambs of
                    windows. Among the “wall peces,” in addition to the numerous sacred subjects,
                    are mentioned mythological scenes, romances, historical pieces, and “hangings of
                    verdures,” the last being decorative work in which trees and foliage formed the
                    main design, with accessory figures of hunting, hawking, and the like. The
                    catalogue of Wolsey’s linen napery is no less sumptuous and abundant; he
                    possessed an immense quantity of finest linen for sheets and “board-cloths”
                    (table-cloths), mostly patterned with “damaske diaper” or “paned losinge-wise.”
                    This example of the wealth of textile work possessed by one rich prelate will
                    give some notion of what England and other countries possessed in the 16th
                    century.</p>
                <p>In the reign of James I. tapestry looms were set up at Mortlake, and the industry
                    was carried on during the following reign under the direction of the painter
                    Francis Crane. Charles I. introduced skilled weavers from Oudenarde in Belgium,
                    and the whole existing series of cartoons by Raphael were copied on the Mortlake
                    looms.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Raphael,</hi> vol. xx. p. 280.</p></note> Most of the Mortlake
                    tapestry has distinct marks, such as the shield of St George with F. C. (F.
                    Crane). Some pieces are inscribed “Car. Re. Reg. Mortl.” (Carolus rex regnans).
                    Though closed during the Commonwealth, the Mortlake fabrique was again worked
                    after the Restoration until the death of Crane in 1703. In the 18th century
                    tapestry was woven on a small scale in Soho and at Fulham, and within recent
                    years a new royal fabrique has been established at Windsor, where very costly
                    and skilful weaving in the pictorial Gobelin style is carried on. The only
                    modern tapestry which has any of the merits of the best old productions is that
                    made on a small scale by Mr William Morris at Merton Abbey (Surrey), where work
                    of the highest beauty has been produced. Unfortunately, however, the modern
                    taste for feeble imitations of oil paintings has as yet shown little
                    appreciation of this revival of the true textile art.</p>
                <p>As in England, by far the greater part of the tapestry used in Italy was a
                    Flemish import. But in the 16th century, undeι∙ the patronage of the dukes of
                    Ferrara, tapestry looms were set up in Ferrara; these were, however, worked by
                    Flemish weavers, and closely resemble contemporary tapestry woven at Brussels.
                    Other fabriques were established in Florence by the Medici princes, and
                    continued to be worked till the end of the 17th century. Factories for tapestry
                    existed also at Venice, Turin, and other northern cities, but the industry was
                    purely an exotic, and never attained to any great importance. Since the
                    pontificate of Clement XL, in 1702,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>An earlier fabrique was started in 1630 by Urban VIII., but
                    it soon ceased to be worked.</p></note> a papal factory for tapestry has existed
                    in Rome, and is still carried on in the Vatican. The papal looms have produced a
                    large number of most costly and elaborate copies of celebrated paintings,
                    executed with wonderful skill, but utterly worthless as works of art.</p>
                <p>The South Kensington Museum possesses the best and most illustrative collection
                    of woven fabrics of various dates. The church of St Mary at Dantzic has a
                    magnificent collection of early textiles, mostly used for vestments; these are
                    well illustrated by Hinz, <hi rend="italic">Die Schatzkammer der Marien∙Kirche
                    zu Dantzig,</hi> 1870. Fine examples of early tapestry exist in the cathedrals
                    of Rheims, Bruges, Tournay, Angers, Beauvais, Aix, Sens, and in the church of St
                    Rémy at Rheims. Other fine collections are preserved in the Louvre, the Cluny
                    Museum, at Chartres, Amiens, Dijon, Orleans, Auxerre, Nancy, Bern, Brussels,
                    Munich, Berlin, Dresden, Vienna, and Nuremberg.<note anchored="true"

                    was burnt in 1871.</p></note> In Italy the richest collections (mostly of later
                    tapestry) are those of the Vatican, the Pitti, the Bargello, Palazzo del Tè at
                    Mantua, Turin (royal palace), Milan (royal palace), Como (cathedral), and the
                    museum of Naples. The Spanish collections have been already mentioned. In
                    England, besides the South Kensington Museum, fine tapestries exist in the
                    palaces of Windsor and Hampton Court. Those formerly in the House of Lords were
                    destroyed in the fire of 1834. St Mary’s Hall at Coventry contains the finest
                    examples of the 15th century.</p>
