                    deserves to be accepted. According to Procopius, our chief, but by no means a
                    trustworthy authority for her life, she was the daughter of Acacius, a
                    bear-feeder of the amphitheatre at Constantinople to the Green Faction, and
                    while still a child was sent on to the stage to earn her living in the
                    performances called mimes. She had no gift for either music or dancing, but made
                    herself notorious by the spirit and impudence of her acting in the rough farces,
                    as one may call them, which delighted the crowd of the capital. Becoming a noted
                    courtesan, she accompanied a certain Hecebolus to Pentapolis (in North Africa),
                    of which he had been appointed governor, and, having quarrelled with him, betook
                    herself first to Alexandria, and then back to Constantinople through the cities
                    of Asia Minor. In Constantinople (where, according to a late but apparently not
                    quite groundless story, she now endeavoured to support herself by spinning, and
                    may therefore have been trying to reform her life) she attracted the notice of
                    Justinian, then patrician, and, as the all-powerful nephew of the emperor
                    Justin, practically ruler of the empire. He desired to marry her, but could not
                    overcome the opposition of his aunt, the empress Euphemia. After her death
                    (usually assigned to the year 523) the emperor yielded, and, as a law, dating
                    from the time of Constantine, forbade the marriage of women who had followed the
                    stage with senators, this law was repealed. Thereupon Justinian married
                    Theodora, whom he had already caused to be raised to the patriciate. They were
                    some time after (527) admitted by Justin to a share in the sovereignty; and, on
                    his death four months later, Justinian and Theodora became sole rulers of the
                    Roman world. He was then about forty-four years of age, and she some twenty
                    years younger. Procopius relates in his unpublished history (’Ανέκδοτα) many
                    repulsive tales regarding Theodora’s earlier life, but his evident hatred of
                    her, though she had been more than ten years dead when the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anecdota</hi> were written, and the extravagances which the book contains,
                    oblige us to regard him as a very doubtful witness. Some confirmation of the
                    reported opposition of the imperial family to the marriage has been found in the
                    story regarding the conduct of Justinian’s own mother Vigilantia, which Nicholas
                    Alemanni, the first editor of the <hi rend="italic">Anecdota,</hi> in his notes
                    to that book, quotes from a certain “Life of Justinian” by Theophilus, to which
                    he frequently refers, without saying where he found it. Since the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Justinian (ç.v.)</hi> was published, the present writer has
                    discovered in Rome what is believed to be the only MS. of this so-called life of
                    Justinian; and his examination of its contents, which he has lately published,
                    makes him think it worthless as an authority. See article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Theophilus.</hi></p>
                <p>Theodora speedily acquired unbounded influence over her husband. He consulted her
                    in everything, and allowed her to interfere directly, as and when she pleased,
                    in the government of the empire. She had a right to interfere, for she was not
                    merely his consort, but empress regnant, and as such entitled equally with
                    himself to the exercise of all prerogatives. In the most terrible crisis of
                    Justinian’s reign, the great Nika insurrection of 532, her courage and firmness
                    in refusing to fly when the rebels were attacking the palace saved her husband’s
                    crown, and no doubt strengthened her command over his mind. Officials took an
                    oath of allegiance to her as well as to the emperor (A <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi> ov., viii.). She even corresponded with foreign ambassadors, and
                    instructed Belisarius how to deal with the popes. Procopius<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n271/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0271-0254"/> describes her as acting with harshness, seizing
                    on trivial pretexts persons who had offended her, stripping some of their
                    property, throwing others into dungeons, where they were cruelly tortured or
                    kept for years without the knowledge of their friends. The city was full of her
                    spies, who reported to her everything said against herself or the
                    administration. She surrounded herself with ceremonious pomp, and required all
                    who approached to abase themselves in a manner new even to that half-Oriental
                    court. She was an incessant and tyrannical match-maker, forcing men to accept
                    wives and women to accept husbands at her caprice. She constituted herself the
                    protectress of faithless wives against outraged husbands, yet professed great
                    zeal for the moral reformation of the city, enforcing severely the laws against
                    vice, and immuring in a “house of repentance” on the Asiatic side of the
                    Bosphorus five hundred courtesans whom she had swept out of the streets of the
                    capital. How much of all this is true we have no means of determining, for it
                    rests on the sole word of Procopius. But there are slight indications in other
                    writers that she had a reputation for severity.</p>
                <p>In the religious strife which distracted the empire Theodora took part with the
                    Monophysites, and her coterie usually contained several leading prelates and
                    monks of that party. As Justinian was a warm upholder of the decrees of
                    Chalcedon, this difference of the royal pair excited much remark and indeed much
                    suspicion. Many saw in it a design to penetrate the secrets of both
                    ecelesiastical factions, and so to rule more securely. In other matters also the
                    wife spoke and acted very differently from the husband; but their differences do
                    not seem to have disturbed either his affection or his confidence. The maxim in
                    Constantinople was that the empress was a stronger and a safer friend than the
                    emperor; for, while he abandoned his favourites to her wrath, she stood by her
                    protégés, and never failed to punish any one whose heedless tongue had assailed
                    her character.</p>
                <p>Theodora bore to Justinian no son, but one daughter,— at least it would seem that
                    her grandson, who is twice mentioned, was the offspring of a legitimate
                    daughter, whose name, however, is not given. According to Procopius, she had
                    before her marriage become the mother of a son, who when grown up returned from
                    Arabia, revealed himself to her, and forthwith disappeared for ever; but this is
                    a story to be received with distrust. That her behaviour as a wife was
                    irreproachable may be gathered from the fact that Procopius mentions only one
                    scandal affecting it, the case of Areobindus. Even he does not seem to believe
                    this case, for, while referring to it as a mere rumour, the only proof he gives
                    is that, suspecting Areobindus of some offence, she had torture applied to this
                    supposed paramour. Her health was delicate, and, though she took all possible
                    care of it, frequently quitting the capital for the seclusion of her villas on
                    the Asiatic shore, she died comparatively young. Theodora was small in stature
                    and rather pale, but with a graceful figure, beautiful features, and a piercing
                    glance. There remains in the apse of the famous church of St Vitale at Ravenna a
                    contemporaneous mosaic portrait of her, to which the artist, notwithstanding the
                    stiffness of the material, has succeeded in giving some character.</p>
                <p>The above account is in substance that which historians of the last two centuries
                    and a half have accepted and repeated regarding this famous empress. But it must
                    be admitted to be open to serious doubts. Everything relating to the early
                    career of Theodora, the faults of her girlhood, the charges of cruelty and
                    insolence in her government of the empire, rest on the sole authority of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anecdota</hi> of Procopius,—a book whose credit is shaken by its
                    bitterness and extravagance. If we reject it, little is left against her, except
                    of course that action in ecclesiastical affairs which excited the wrath of
                    Baronius, who had denounced her before the <hi rend="italic">Anecdota</hi> were
                    published.</p>
                <p>In favour of the picture which Procopius gives of the empress it may be argued
                    (1) that she certainly did interfere constantly and arbitrarily in the
                    administration of public affairs, and showed herself therein the kind of person
                    who would be cruel and unscrupulous in her choice of means, and (2) that we
                    gather from other writers an impression that she was harsh and tyrannical, as,
                    for instance, from the references to her in the lives of the popes in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">Pontificalis</hi> (which used to pass
                    under the name of Anastasius, the papal librarian). Her threat to the person
                    whom she commanded to bring Vigilius to her was “nisi hoc feceris, per Viventem
                    in saecula excoriari te faciam.” Much of what we find in these lives is
                    legendary, but they are some evidence of Theodora’s reputation. Again (3) the
                    statute <hi rend="italic">(God.,</hi> v. 4, 23) which repeals the older law so
                    far as relates to <hi rend="italic">scenicae</hi><hi rend="italic">mulieres</hi>
                    is now generally attributed to Justin, and agrees with the statement of
                    Procopius that an alteration of the law was made to legalize her marriage. There
                    is therefore reason for holding that she was an actress, and, considering what
                    the Byzantine stage was (as appears even by the statute in question), her life
                    cannot have been irreproachable.</p>
                <p>Against the evidence of Procopius, with such confirmations as have been
                    indicated, there is to be set the silence of other writers, contemporaries like
                    Agathias and Evagrius, as well as such later historians as Theophanes, none of
                    whom repeat the charges as to Theodora’s life before her marriage. To this
                    consideration no great weight need be attached. It is difficult to establish any
                    view of the controversy without a long and minute examination of the
                    authorities, and in particular of the <hi rend="italic">Aìiecdota.</hi> But the
                    most probable conclusions seem to be—(1) that the odious details which Procopius
                    gives, and which Gibbon did not blush to copy, deserve no more weight than would
                    be given nowadays to the malignant scandal of disappointed courtiers under a
                    despotic government, where scandal is all the blacker because it is propagated
                    in secret (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Procopius)</hi>; (2) that apparently she was
                    an actress and a courtesan, and not improbably conspicuous in both those
                    characters; and (3) that it is impossible to determine how far the specific
                    charges of cruelty and oppression brought against her bÿ Procopius deserve
                    credence. We are not bound to accept them, for they are uncorroborated; yet the
                    accounts of Justinian’s government given in the <hi rend="italic">Anecdota</hi>
                    agree in too many respects with what we know <hi rend="italic">aliunde</hi> to
                    enable us to reject them altogether; and it must be admitted that there is a
                    certain internal consistency in the whole picture which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anecdota</hi> present of the empress. About the beauty, the intellectual gifts,
                    and the imperious will of Theodora there can be no doubt, for as to these all
                    our authorities agree. She was evidently an extraordinary person, born to shine
                    in any station of life.</p>
                <p>Her fortunes have employed many pens. Among the latest serious works dealing with
                    them may be mentioned Μ. Antonin Débidour’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >L'Impératrice</hi><hi rend="italic">Theodora: Étude Critique,</hi> Paris, 1885,
                    which endeavours to vindicate her from the aspersions of Procopius; and among
                    more imaginative writings are Sir Henry Pottinger’s interesting romance <hi
                    rend="italic">Blue and Green</hi> (London, Hurst and Blackett, 1879), Μ.
                    Rhangabé’s tragedy Θeoδωpα (Leipsic, 1884), and Μ. .Sardou’s play <hi
