                    rail) south-west of Paris, on the left bank of the Loire, a little above the
                    junction of the Loire and Cher. Many foreigners, especially English, live at
                    Tours, attracted by the town itself, its mild climate, its beautiful situation
                    in “the garden of France,” and the historic chateaus of the neighbourhood. The
                    Loire is crossed by two suspension bridges, by a railway bridge, and by a fine
                    stone bridge, but its waters too often either expose large stretches of sand, or
                    come down in devastating flood. Many of the inhabitants belong to the leisured
                    class, and the town possesses societies of science, art, and literature, of
                    agriculture, of horticulture, of archaeology, of medicine, and a library (50,000
                    volumes, and 1200 MSS., including a gospel of the 8th century, on which the
                    kings of France took oath as honorary canons of the church of St Martin). The
                    industrial establishments include four large silk mills, the printing and
                    publishing works of Marne (1200 workmen), manufactories of cloth, carpets,
                    files, white lead, stained glass, boots and shoes, and pottery. A considerable
                    trade is carried on in wine, brandy, and dried fruits, and the sausages and
                    confectionery of the town are well known. The population, 52,209 in 1881, was
                    59,585 in 1886.</p>
                <p>Tours, under the Gauls the capital of the Turones or Turons, originally stood on
                    the right bank of the Loire, a little above the present village of St
                    Symphorien. At first called <hi rend="italic">Altionos,</hi> the town was
                    afterwards officially known as <hi rend="italic">Caesarodunum.</hi> The Romans
                    removed the town from the hill where it originally stood to the plain on the
                    left bank of the river. Behind the present cathedral, remains of the
                    amphitheatre (443 feet in length by 394 in breadth) built towards the end of the
                    2d century might till lately be seen. Tours became Christian about 250 through
                    the preaching of Gatien, who founded the bishopric. The first cathedral was
                    built a hundred years later by St Litorius. The bishopric became an
                    archbishopric when Gratian made Tours the capital of Lugdunensis Tertia, and
                    about the same time the official name of Caesarodunum was changed for that of
                    <hi rend="italic">Civitas Turonorum.</hi> St Martin, the great apostle of the
                    Gauls, was bishop of Tours in the 4th century, and he was buried in a suburb
                    which soon became as important as the town itself from the number of pilgrims
                    who flocked to his tomb. Towards the end of the 4th century, apprehensive of
                    barbarian invasion, the inhabitants pulled down some of their earlier buildings
                    in order to raise a fortified wall, the course of which can still be traced in
                    places. Their advanced fort of Larcay still overlooks the valley of the Cher.
                    Affiliated to the Armorican confederation in 435, the town did not fall to the
                    Visigoths till 473, and the new masters were always hated. It became part of the
                    Frankish dominions under Clovis, who, in consideration of the help afforded by
                    St Martin, presented the church with rich gifts out of the spoils taken from
                    Alaric, confirmed and extended its right of sanctuary, and accepted for himself
                    and his successors the title of canon of St Martin. The basilica, built under
                    Bishop St Perpetuus from 472 to 477, was the largest and finest church of
                    France, and one of the most important built in the West during the decline of
                    the Roman empire; it is said by St Gregory of Tours to have been 160 feet long,
                    60 wide, and 45 high. It seems to have been one of the first which had an
                    ambulatory round the choir. Tours grew rapidly in prosperity under the
                    Merovingians, but abuse of the right of sanctuary led to great disorder, and the
                    church itself became a hotbed of crime. Charlemagne re-established discipline in
                    the disorganized monastery and set over it the learned Alcuin, who established
                    at Tours one of the oldest public schools of Christian philosophy and theology.
                    The abbey was made into a collegiate church in the 11th century, and was for a
                    time affiliated to Cluny, but soon came under the direct rule of Rome, and for
                    long had bishops of its own. The suburb in which the monastery was situated
                    became as important as Tours itself under the name of Martinopolis. The Normans,
                    attracted by its riches, pillaged it in 853 and 903. Strong walls were erected
                    from 906 to 910, and in the 12th century the name was changed to that of
                    Châteauneuf. Philip Augustus abolished the disorderly commune in 1212, but the
                    innumerable offerings of princes, lords, and pilgrims maintained the prosperity
                    of the town all through the Middle Ages. A 13th-century writer speaks with
                    enthusiasm of the wealth and luxury of the inhabitants, of the beauty and
                    chastity of the women, and of the rich shrine of the saint. A third church,
                    replacing one which had been built after the burning of that of St Perpetuus in
                    997, was begun in 1175, and finished in the 13th century. It was 374 feet long
                    and 85 feet high, and had five towers, of which only two remain. The rest of the
                    church, sold to speculators after the Revolution, disappeared under the first
                    empire. Of the monastic buildings, only a beautiful inclosed gallery, built by
                    Bastien François, nephew of Michel Colomb, in the time of the Renaissance,
                    remains, but the streets which formerly belonged to Châteauneuf show many
                    interesting relics of ecclesiastical and civil architecture. About 1130
                    Archbishop Hildevert built a cathedral in the old Roman town itself, on the
                    ruins of those successively erected by Litorius and Gregory of Tours. This was
                    burnt in 1166 during the quarrel between Louis VII. of France and Henry II. of
                    England, the latter being lord of Tours and count of Anjou. The work was resumed
                    in 1175, but not finished till 1547. Part of the towers belong to the 12th
                    century; the choir to the 13th; the transept and first bays of the nave to the
                    14th; the remaining bays, the cloister on the north, and the fine façade to the
                    15th; and the two Renaissance towers (217 feet and 223 feet) to the 16th. The
                    building is nevertheless remarkable for the harmony and regularity of its
                    construction; specially noteworthy details are the triple western portal, the
                    upper staircase of the north tower, a Renaissance staircase in the cloister, the
                    old woodwork in chestnut-wood, and the splendid glass of the 13th, 14th, and
                    15th centuries. A pretty little mausoleum, built in 1506 by Jean Juste, is the
                    burial-place of three young sons of Charles <pb break="no"

                    the cathedral, with an interesting chapel of the 12th century, and an outside
                    pulpit of the 16th. During the 10th century the Benedictine abbey of St Julien
                    was re-established by Archbishop Théotolon, and a Romanesque church built, of
                    which the great square tower still remains. St Julien has a fine nave and double
                    aisles; the straight terminal wall has two 16th-century apses attached. There
                    are some paintings of the 12th century under the tower.</p>
                <p>The magnificence of Tours declined in the 14th century; it was then united to
                    Châteauneuf by a common wall, of which an elegant round tower (the Tour de
                    Guise) remains near the quay, and both towns were put under the same government.
                    The numerous and long-continued visits of Charles VII., Louis XI., and Charles
                    VIII. in Touraine during the 15th century favoured the commerce and industry of
                    the town, then peopled by 75,000 inhabitants. To the flourishing school of art
                    which existed at the Renaissance are due several private houses, a fountain, and
                    the church of Notre Dame La Riche, with splendid windows by Pinaigrier. An
                    unimportant building, part of a modern chateau, is all that remains of the royal
                    residence and magnificent gardens of Plessis-lés-Tours, where Louis XL shut
                    himself up and died, the states in 1506 proclaimed Louis XII. the father of his
                    people, and Henry III. and Henry of Navarre united in 1589 against the League.
                    From that year Tours was deserted by the kings of France. A fine bridge of
                    fifteen arches was built across the Loire from 1765 to 1777 by Bayeux. The chief
                    modern buildings are the theatre, the church of St Joseph, the railway station,
                    and a museum with collections of antiquities, pictures, pottery, and mineralogy.
                    There are also antiquities in the museum of the archaeological society of
                    Indre-et-Loire. The gardens and a remarkable portal of the archbishop’s palace,
                    a magnificent iron gate of the 18th century in the prefecture, once the convent
                    of the Visitation, and the general hospital (1200 beds) should also be
                    mentioned. In 1870 Tours was the seat of the government of the national defence.
                    Tours is the birthplace of the heretic Berengarius, the two marshals Boucicaut,
                    the novelist Honoré de Balzac, the poet Destouches, the painters Fouquet and
                    Clouet, and Madame de la Vallière.</p>
