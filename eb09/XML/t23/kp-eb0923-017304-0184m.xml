                    Dyck, was born in Antwerp on 15th December 1610. His father, David Teniers the
                    elder (1582-1649), whose style he followed with a vastly superior power of
                    conception, had been a pupil of Elsheimer in Rome and of Rubens in Antwerp.
                    Besides these influences, we can also distinctly trace that of Adrian Brouwer at
                    the outset of his career. Although the young painter’s general system often
                    reminds us of Rubens, several of his works also betray a vivid recollection of
                    Brouwer in type as well as general arrangement. There is no evidence, however,
                    that either Rubens or Brouwer interfered in any way with Teniers’s education,
                    and Smith may be correct in supposing that the admiration which Brouwer’s
                    pictures at one time excited alone tempted the younger artist to imitate them.
                    The only trace of personal relations having existed between Teniers and Rubens
                    is the fact that the ward of the latter, Anne Breughel, the daughter of John
                    (Velvet) Breughel, married Teniers in 1637. Admitted as a “master” in the guild
                    of St Luke in 1632, Teniers had even before this made the public acquainted with
                    his works. The Berlin museum possesses a group of ladies and gentlemen dated
                    1630. No special signature positively distinguishes these first productions from
                    those of his father, and we do not think it correct to admit with some writers
                    that he first painted religious subjects. Dr Bode, in a most remarkable study of
                    Brouwer and his works, expresses the opinion that Teniers’s earliest pictures
                    are those found under the signature “Tenier” (with the omission of the final s).
                    Tenier is in reality a Flemish version of a thoroughly Walloon name, “Taisnier,”
                    which the painter’s grandfather, a mercer, brought with him when he came from
                    Ath in 1558, and Bode’s supposition is greatly strengthened by the circumstance
                    that not only David the elder but his brother Abraham and his four sons were all
                    inscribed as “Tenier” in the ledgers of the Antwerp guild of St Luke. Some
                    really first-rate works—the Prodigal Son and a group of Topers in the Munich
                    gallery, as well as a party of gentlemen and ladies at dinner, termed the Five
                    Senses, in the <pb break="no"

                    remarkable instances of the perfection attained by the artist when he may be
                    supposed to have been scarcely twenty. His touch is of the rarest delicacy, his
                    colour at once gay and harmonious. Both Waagen and Smith express the opinion
                    that the works painted from 1645 to 1650 speak most highly of the master’s
                    abilities. We may venture to add that a considerable number of earlier
                    productions would have been sufficient to immortalize his name. He was little
                    over thirty when the Antwerp guild of St George enabled him to paint the
                    marvellous picture which ultimately found its way to the Hermitage Gallery in St
                    Petersburg,—the Jubilee Meeting of the Civic Guards, in honour of their old
                    commander, Godfrey Sneyders. Correct to the minutest detail, yet striking in
                    effect, the scene, under the rays of a glorious sunshine, displays an
                    astonishing amount of acquired knowledge and natural good taste. This painting,
                    one of forty among many of the master’s earlier and later productions,<note

                    bishop of Ghent, Anthony Triist, with his brother Francis, a Franciscan
                    monk.</p></note> leads us to mention another work of the same year (1643), now
                    in the National Gallery, London (No. 952), an equally beautiful repetition of
                    which, dated 1646, belongs to the duke of Bedford. A hundred and fifty figures
                    are resting after a pilgrimage to some holy shrine or some miraculous well. The
                    hungry travellers are waiting for the meal which is being prepared for them in
                    several huge caldrons. Truth in physiognomy, distribution of groups, the
                    beautiful effect of light and shade, command our warmest admiration. A work like
                    this, says Waagen, stamps its author as the greatest among painters of his
                    class. That, however, a subject of the kind should have bem accepted as a
                    “feast” (see the National Gallery <hi rend="italic">Ca</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">alogue')</hi> may tend to prove how
                    little, from the first, Teniers thought of dramatizing. Frankness in expression
                    and freedom in attitude certainly guided his preference in the choice of a
                    model, and we may even suppose him to have occasionally exaggerated both. He
                    seems anxious to have it known that, far from indulging in the coarse amusements
                    of the boors he is fond of painting, he himself lives in good style, looks like
                    a gentleman, and behaves as such. He never seems tired of showing the turrets of
                    his chateau of Perck, and in the midst of rustic merry-makings we often see his
                    family and himself received cap in hand by the joyous peasants. We may also
                    observe that he has a certain number of favourite models, the constant
                    recurrence of which is a special feature of his works. We even meet them in a
                    series of life-size portrait-like figures in the Doria Pamphili Gallery in
                    Rome,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Under the name of
                    Weeninx.</p></note> as well as in a picture belonging to Mr H. R. Hughes, and
                    the man here represented as a fishmonger is unmistakably the painter’s brother,
                    Abraham Teniers, judging from the portrait Edelinck has left us of this
                    artist.</p>
                <p>Teniers was chosen by the common council of Antwerp to preside over the guild of
                    painters in 1644. The archduke Leopold William, who had assumed the government
                    of the Spanish Netherlands, being a great lover of art, employed Teniers not
                    only as a painter but as keeper of the collection of pictures he was then
                    forming. With the rank and title of “ayuda de camara,” Teniers took up his abode
                    in Brussels shortly after 1647. Immense sums were spent in the acquisition of
                    paintings for the archduke. A number of valuable works of the Italian masters,
                    now in the Belvedere in Vienna, came from Leopold’s gallery after having
                    belonged to Charles I. and the duke of Buckingham. De Bie (1661) states that
                    Teniers was some time in London, collecting pictures for the duke of
                    Fuensaldana, then acting as Leopold’s lieutenant in the Netherlands. Paintings
                    in</p>
                <p>Madrid, Munich, Vienna, and Brussels have enabled art critics to form an opinion
                    of what the imperial residence was at the time of Leopold, who is represented as
                    conducted by Teniers and admiring some recent acquisition. No picture in the
                    gallery is omitted, every one being inscribed with a number and the name of its
                    author, so that the <hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi> of these paintings might
                    serve as an illustrated inventory of the collection.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was not until recently that the MS.
                    inventory of this collection was discovered among the papers of the prince of
                    Schwartzenberg in Vienna. It was published in 1883 by Adolf Berger. In 1658
                    Teniers published 243 etchings after the best Italian works of Leopold William’s
                    collection, which, with the portraits of the archduke and Teniers, were brought
                    together as a volume in 1660, under the title <hi rend="italic">El Teatro de
                    Pinturas.</hi></p></note> Still more interesting is a canvas, now in the Munich
                    gallery, where we see Teniers at work in a room of the palace, with an old
                    peasant as a model and several gentlemen looking on. When Leopold returned to
                    Vienna, Teniers’s task ceased; in fact, the pictures also travelled to Austria,
                    and a Flemish priest, himself a first-rate flower painter, Van der Baren, became
                    keeper of the archducal gallery. Teniers nevertheless remained in high favour
                    with the new governorgeneral, Don Juan, a natural son of Philip IV. The prince
                    was his pupil, and De Bie tells us he took the likeness of the painter’s son.
                    Honoured as one of the greatest painters in Europe, Teniers seems to have made
                    himself extremely miserable through his aristocratic leanings. Shortly after the
                    death of his wife in 1656 he married Isabella de Fren, daughter of the secretary
                    of the council of Brabant, and strove his utmost to prove his right to armorial
                    bearings. In a petition to the king he reminded him that the honour of
                    knighthood had been bestowed upon Rubens and Van Dyck. The king at last declared
                    his readiness to grant the request, but on the express condition that Teniers
                    should give up selling his pictures. The, condition was not complied with; but
                    it may perhaps account for the master’s activity in favouι∙ of the foundation in
                    Antwerp of an academy of fine arts to which artists alone should be admitted,
                    whereas the venerable guild of St Luke made no difference between art and
                    handicraft: carvers, gilders, bookbinders, stood on an even footing with
                    painters and sculptors, however great their talent.<note anchored="true"

                    1663, Teniers came from Brussels with the royal charter of the academy, the
                    existence of which was due entirely to his personal initiative.</p>
                <p>Teniers died in Brussels on 25th April 1690.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    A picture in the Munich gallery (No. 906), dated 1680, represents him as an
                    alchemist, oppressed with a burden of age beyond his years. From this date we
                    hear more of his doings as a picture-dealer than as a painter, which most
                    probably gave birth to the legend of his having given himself out as deceased in
                    order to get higher prices for his works. David, his eldest son, a painter of
                    talent and reputation, died in 1685. One of this third Teniers’s pictures—St
                    Dominic Kneeling before the Blessed Virgin, dated 1666—is still to be found in
                    the church at Perck. As well as his father, he contributed many patterns to the
                    celebrated Brussels tapestry looms. Cornelia, the painter’s daughter, married
                    John Erasmus Quellin, a well-known artist (1634-1715).</p>
                <p>Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Catalogue Raisonné</hi> gives descriptions of over 700
                    paintings accepted as original productions of Teniers. Few artists ever worked
                    with greater ease, and some of his smaller pictures—landscapes with figures—have
                    been termed “afternoons,” not from their subjects, but from the time spent in
                    producing them. The museums in Madrid, St Petersburg, Vienna, Munich, Dresden,
                    Paris, London, and Brussels have more than 200 pictures by Teniers. In the
                    United Kingdom 150 may be found in private hands, and many other examples are to
                    be met with in private collections throughout Europe. Although the spirit of
                    many of these works <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n186/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0186-0175"/> is as a whole marvellous, their conscientiousness
                    must be regarded as questionable. Especially in the later productions we often
                    detect a lack of earnestness and of the calm and concentrated study of nature
                    which alone prevent expression from degenerating into grimace in situations like
                    those generally depicted by Teniers. His education, and still more his real and
                    assumed position in society, to a great degree account for this. Brouwer knew
                    more of taverns; Ostade was more thoroughly at home in cottages and humble
                    dwellings; Teniers throughout triumphs in broad daylight, and, though many of
                    his interiors may be justly termed masterpieces, they seldom equal his open-air
                    scenes, where he has, without constraint, given full play to the bright
                    resources of his luminous palette. In this respect, as in many others, he almost
                    invariably suggests comparisons with Watteau. Equally sparkling and equally
                    joyous, both seem to live in an almost ideal world, where toil, disease, and
                    poverty may exist, but to be soon forgotten, and where sunshine seems
                    everlasting. But his subjects taken from the Gospels or sacred legend are
                    absurd. An admirable picture in the Louvre shows Peter Denying his Master, next
                    to a table where soldiers are smoking and having a game at cards. He likes going
                    back to subjects illustrated two centuries before by Jerome Bosch—the Temptation
                    of St Anthony, the Rich Man in Hell, incantations, and witches—for the simple
                    purpose of assembling the most comic apparitions. His villagers drink, play
                    bowls, dance, and sing; they seldom quarrel or fight, and, if they do, seem to
                    be shamming. His powers certainly declined with advancing age; the works of 1654
                    begin to look hasty. But this much may be said of Teniers, that no other painter
                    shows a more enviable ability to render a conception to his own and other
                    people’s satisfaction. His works have a technical freshness, a
                    straightforwardness in means and intent, which make the study of them most
                    delightful; as Sir Joshua Reynolds says, they are worthy of the closest
                    attention of any painter who desires to excel in the mechanical knowledge of his
                    art.</p>
                <p>As an etcher Teniers compares very unfavourably with Ostade, Cornells, Bega, and
                    Dusart. More than 500 plates were made from his pictures; and, if it be true
                    that Louis XIV. judged his “baboons” <hi rend="italic">{magots)</hi> unworthy of
                    a place in the royal collections, they found admirable engravers in France — Le
                    Bas and his scholars—and passionate admirers. The duke of Bedford’s admirable
                    specimen was sold for 18,030 livres (£1860) in 1768. The Prodigal Son, now in
                    the Louvre, fetched 30,000 livres (£3095) in 1776. Smith’s highest estimates
                    have long since been greatly exceeded. The Archers in St Petersburg he gives as
                    worth £2000. The Belgian Government gave £5000 in 1867 for the Village Pastoral
                    of 1652, which is now in the Brussels museum; and a picture of the Prodigal Son,
                    scarcely 16 by 28 inches, fetched £5280 in 1876.</p>
                <p>Although Van Tilborgh, who was a scholar of Teniers in Brussels, followed his
                    style with some success, and later painters often excelled in figure-painting on
                    a small scale, Teniers cannot be said to have formed a school. Properly
                    speaking, he is the last representative of the great Flemish traditions of the
                    17th century.</p>
