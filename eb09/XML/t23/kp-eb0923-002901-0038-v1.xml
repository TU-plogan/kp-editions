                    (1795-1854), was at once eminent as a lawyer, as a writer, and as a member of a
                    brilliant and polished society. He had the faculty of winning friendships; so
                    sympathetic indeed was his nature that he unconsciously biassed many of the most
                    acute among his acquaintances towards an estimate of his genius as an
                    author—more especially as a dramatist—hardly commensurate with what more
                    impartial criticism has decided to be his just meed of praise. But, though even
                    his most excellent work in literature has now ceased to be generally cared for,
                    his poetry must always be interesting to the literary student.</p>
                <p>The son of a brewer in good circumstances, Talfourd was born on January 26, 1795,
                    at Doxey, near Stafford (some accounts mention Reading). He received his early
                    education, first at an institution near Hendon, and later at the Reading
                    grammar-school under Dr Valpy. Here, it is said, he acquired his taste for
                    dramatic poetry, presumably under the guidance of Dr Valpy. At the age of
                    eighteen the lad was sent to London to study law under Mr Chitty, the special
                    pleader. Early in 1821 he joined the Oxford circuit, having been called to the
                    bar at the Middle Temple in February of that year. When, fourteen years later,
                    he was created a serjeant-at-law, and when again he in 1849 succeeded Mr Justice
                    Coltman as judge of the Court of Common Pleas, he attained these distinctions
                    more perhaps for the zeal and laborious care which he invariably displayed in
                    his conduct of the cases confided to him than on account of any brilliance of
                    forensic talent or of any marked intellectual subtlety. A parliamentary life had
                    always had an attraction for him, and at the general election in 1835 he was
                    returned for Reading. This seat he retained for close upon six years, and he was
                    again returned in 1847. In the House of Commons he was no mere ornamental
                    member. Those efforts of his which have most interest for us of later date were
                    made on behalf of the rights of authors, for whose benefit he introduced the
                    International Copyright Bill; his speech on this subject was considered the most
                    telling made in the House during that session. The bill met with strong
                    opposition, but Talfourd had the satisfaction of seeing it ultimately pass into
                    law in 1842, albeit in a greatly modified form.</p>
                <p>At the period of his elevation to the bench he was created a knight, and
                    thenceforward his life was, in the intervals of his professional labours,
                    devoted to scholarly and literary pursuits. From his school days he had
                    entertained dreams of attaining eminence as a writer; and to the last he
                    remained a diligent student of literature, ancient and modern. During his early
                    years in London Talfourd found himself forced to depend—in great measure, at
                    least —upon his literary exertions. He was at this period on the staff of the
                        <hi rend="italic">London Magazine,</hi> and was an occasional contributor to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi>
                    reviews, the <hi rend="italic">Neιv Monthly Magazine,</hi> and other
                    periodicals; while, on joining the western circuit, he acted as law reporter to
                        <hi rend="italic">The Times.</hi> His legal writings on matters germane to
                    literature are excellent expositions, animated by a lucid and sufficiently
                    telling, if not highly polished, style. Among the best of these are his article
                    “On the Principle of Advocacy in the Practice of the Bar” (in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Law Magazine,</hi> January 1846); his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Proposed New Laτv of Copyright of the Highest Importance to Authors</hi>
                    (1838); <hi rend="italic">Three Speeches delivered in the House of Commons in
                        Favour of an Extension of Copyright (18 IQ);</hi> and his famous <hi
                        rend="italic">Speech for the Defendant in the Prosecution, the Queen</hi> V.
                        <hi rend="italic">Moxon, for the Publication of Shelley's Poetical
                        Works</hi> (1841).</p>
                <p>But Talfourd cannot be said to have gained any position among men of letters
                    until the production of his tragedy <hi rend="italic">Ion,</hi> which was
                    privately printed in 1835, and produced in the following year at Covent Garden
                    theatre. The tragedy was also well received in America, and it met with the
                    honour of reproduction at Sadler’s Wells in December 1861. This dramatic poem,
                    its author’s masterpiece, turns upon the voluntary sacrifice of Ion, king of
                    Argos, in response to the Delphic oracle, which had declared that only with the
                    extinction of the reigning family could the prevailing pestilence incurred by
                    the deeds of that family be removed. As a poem <hi rend="italic">Ion</hi> has
                    many high qualities. The blank verse, if lacking the highest excellence, is
                    smooth and musical, and the lines are frequently informed with the spirit of
                    genuine poetry; the character of the high-souleΛ son of the Argive king is
                    finely developed, and the reader is affected throughout by that same sense of
                    the relentless working and potency of destiny which so markedly distinguishes
                    the writings of the Greek dramatists.</p>
                <p>Two years later, at the Haymarket theatre, <hi rend="italic">The Athenian
                        Captive</hi> was acted with moderate success. In 1839 <hi rend="italic"
                        >Glencoe, or the Fate of the Macdonalds,</hi> was privately printed, and in
                    1840 it was produced at the Haymarket; but this home drama is indubitably much
                    inferior to his two classicplays. <hi rend="italic">The Castilian</hi> (1853)
                    did not excite a tenth part of the interest called forth by <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ion.</hi> Before this he had produced various prose writings other than
                    those already referred to,—among them his “History of Greek Literature,” in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Metropolitana.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the honour of knighthood and his various legal distinctions, Talfourd
                    held the honorary degree of D.C.L. from the university of Oxford. He died in
                    court during the performance of his judicial duties, at Stafford, on March 13,
                    1854.</p>
                <p>In addition to the writings above-mentioned, Talfourd was the author of <hi
                        rend="italic">The Letters of Clearies Lamb, with a Sketch of his Life</hi>
                    (1837); <hi rend="italic">Recollections of a First Visit to the Alps</hi>
                    (1841); <hi rend="italic">Vacation Rambles and Thoughts,</hi> comprising
                    recollections of three Continental tours in the vacations of 1841, 1842, and
                    1843 (2 vols., 1844); and <hi rend="italic">Final Memorials of Charles Lamb</hi>
                    (1849-50).</p>
