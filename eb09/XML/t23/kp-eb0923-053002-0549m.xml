                <p><label type="entry">TREATIES</label>. 1. A treaty is a contract between two or
                    more states. The term “tractatus,” and its derivatives, though of occasional
                    occurrence in this sense from the 13th century onwards, only began to be
                    commonly so employed, in lieu of the older technical terms “conventio publica,”
                    or “foedus,” from the end of the 17 th century. In the language of modern
                    diplomacy the term “treaty” is restricted to the more important international
                    agreements, especially to those which are the work of a congress, while
                    agreements dealing with subordinate questions are described by the more general
                    term “convention.’’ The present article will disregard this distinction.</p>
                <p>2. The making and the observance of treaties is necessarily a very early
                    phenomenon in the history of civilization, and the theory of treaties was one of
                    the first departments of international law to attract attention. Treaties are
                    recorded on the monuments of Egypt and Assyria; they occur in the Old Testament
                    Scriptures; and questions arising under σ <hi rend="italic">υvθῆ</hi> και and
                    “foedera” occupy much space in the Greek and Roman historians.<note

                <p>3. Treaties have been classified on many principles, of which it will suffice to
                    mention the more important. A “personal treaty,” having reference to dynastic
                    interests, is contrasted with a “real treaty,” which binds the nation
                    irrespectively of constitutional changes; treaties creating outstanding
                    obligations are opposed to “transitory conventions,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> for cession of territory, recognition of independence, and the like,
                    which operate irrevocably once for all, leaving nothing more to be done by the
                    contracting parties; and treaties in the nature of a definite transaction <hi
                    rend="italic">(Rechtsgeschäft)</hi> are opposed to those which aim at
                    establishing a general rule of conduct <hi rend="italic">(Rechtssatz).</hi> With
                    reference to their objects, treaties may perhaps be conveniently classified as
                    (1) political, including treaties of peace, of alliance, of cession, of
                    boundary, for creation of international servitudes, of neutralization, of
                    guarantee, of submission to arbitration; (2) commercial, including consular and
                    fishery conventions, and slave trade and navigation treaties; (3) confederations
                    for special social objects, such as the Zollverein, the Latin monetary union,
                    and the still wider unions with reference to posts, telegraphs, submarine
                    cables, and weights and measures; (4) relating to criminal justice, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> to extradition and arrest of fugitive seamen; (5)
                    relating to civil justice, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> to the protection of
                    trade-mark and copyright, to the execution of foreign judgments, to the
                    reception of evidence, and to actions by and against foreigners; (6) providing
                    general rules for the conduct of warfare, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    declaration of Paris and the convention of Geneva. It must be remarked that it
                    is not always possible to assign a treaty wholly to one or other of the above
                    classes, since many treaties contain in combination clauses referable to several
                    of them.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n550/mode/1up"

                <p>4. The analogy between treaty-making and legislation is striking when a congress
                    agrees upon general principles which are afterwards accepted by a large number
                    of states, as, for instance, in the case of the Geneva convention for improving
                    the treatment of the wounded. Many political treaties containing “transitory”
                    conventions, with reference to recognition, boundary, or cession, become, as it
                    were, the title-deeds of the nations to which they relate.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Sir Edward
                    Hertslet’s very useful collection entitled <hi rend="italic">The Map of Europe
                    by Treaty,</hi> 1875.</p></note> But the closest analogy of a treaty is to. a
                    contract in private law, as will appear from the immediately following
                    paragraphs.</p>
                <p>5. The making of a valid treaty implies several re quisites. (1) It must be made
                    between competent parties, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> sovereign states. A
                    “concordat,” to which the pope, as a spiritual authority, is one of the parties,
                    is therefore not a treaty, nor is a convention between a state and an
                    individual, nor a convention between the rulers of two states with reference to
                    their private affairs. Semisovereign states, such as San Marino or Egypt, may
                    make conventions upon topics within their limited competence. It was formerly
                    alleged that an infidel state could not be a party to a treaty. The question
                    where the treatymaking power resides in a given state is answered by the
                    municipal law of that state. It usually resides in the executive, though
                    sometimes, as in the United States, it is shared by the legislature, or by a
                    branch of it. (2) There must be an expression of agreement. This is not (as in
                    private law) rendered voidable by duress; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    cession of a province, though extorted by overwhelming force, is nevertheless
                    unimpeachable. Duress to the individual negotiator would, however, vitiate the
                    effect of his signature. (3) From the nature of the case, the agreement of
                    states, other than those the government of which is autocratic, must be
                    signified by means of agents, whose authority is either express, as in the case
                    of plenipotentiaries, or implied, as in the case of, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> military and naval commanders for matters, such as truces,
                    capitulations, and cartels, which are necessarily confided to their discretion.
                    When an agent acts in excess of his implied authority he is said to make no
                    treaty, but a mere “sponsion,” which, unless adopted by his Government, does not
                    bind it, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the affair of the Caudine Forks (Livy, ix.
                    5) and the convention of Closter Seven in 1757. (4) Unlike a contract in private
                    law, a treaty, even though made in pursuance of a full power, is, according to
                    modern views, of no effect till it is ratified. (5) No special form is necessary
                    for a treaty, which in theory may be made without writing. It need not even
                    appear on the face of it to be a contract between the parties, but may take the
                    form of a joint declaration, or of an exchange of notes. Latin was at one time
                    the language usually employed in treaties, and continued to be so employed to a
                    late date by the emperor and the pope. Treaties to which several European powers
                    of different nationalities are parties are now usually drawn up in French (the
                    use of which became general in the time of Louis XIV.), but the final act of the
                    congress of Vienna contains a protest against the use of this language being
                    considered obligatory. A great European treaty usually commences “In the name of
                    the Most Holy and Indivisible Trinity,” or, if the Porte is a party, “In the
                    name of Almighty God.” (6) It is sometimes said that a treaty must have a lawful
                    object, but the danger of accepting such a statement is apparent from the use
                    which has been made of it by writers who deny the validity of any cession of
                    national territory, or even go so far as to lay down, with Fiore, that “all
                    should be regarded as void which are in any way opposed to the development of
                    the free activity of a nation, or which hinder the exercise of its natural
                    rights.” (7) The making of a treaty is some times accompanied by acts intended
                    to secure its better performance. The taking of oaths, the assigning of
                    “conservatores pacis,” and the giving of hostages are now obsolete, but revenue
                    is mortgaged, territory is pledged, and treaties of guarantee are entered into
                    for this purpose.</p>
                <p>6. A “transitory convention” operates at once, leaving no duties to be
                    subsequently performed, but with reference to conventions of other kinds
                    questions arise as to the duration of the obligation created by them, in other
                    words, as to the moment at which those obligations come to an end. This may
                    occur by the dissolution of one of the contracting states, by the object-matter
                    of the agreement ceasing to exist, by full performance, by performance becoming
                    impossible, by lapse of the time for which the agreement was made, by <hi
                    rend="italic">contrarius consensus</hi> or mutual release, by “denunciation” by
                    one party under a power reserved in the treaty. By a breach on either side the
                    treaty usually becomes, not void, but voidable. A further cause of the
                    termination of treaty obligations is a total change of circumstances, since a
                    clause “rebus sic stantibus” is said to be a tacit condition in every
                    treaty.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Bynkershoek, <hi rend="italic">Quaest. Jur. Pub.,</hi>
                    ii. c. 10.</p></note> Such a contention can only be very cautiously admitted. It
                    has been put forward by Russia in justification of her repudiation of the
                    clauses of the treaty of Paris neutralizing the Black Sea, and of her
                    engagements as to Batoum contained in the treaty of Berlin. The London protocol
                    of 1871, with a view to prevent such abuses, lays down, perhaps a little too
                    broadly, “that it is an essential principle of the law of nations that no power
                    can liberate itself from the engagements of a treaty, nor modify the
                    stipulations thereof, unless with the consent of the contracting powers, by
                    means of an amicable arrangement.” Treaties are in most cases suspended, if not
                    terminated, by the outbreak of a war between the contracting parties, and are
                    therefore usually revived in express terms in the treaty of peace.</p>
                <p>7. The rules for the interpretation of treaties are not so different from those
                    applicable to contracts in private law as to need here a separate
                    discussion.</p>
                <p>8. Collections of treaties are either (i.) general or (ii.) national.</p>
                <p>(i.) The first to publish a general collection of treaties was Leibnitz, whose
                    <hi rend="italic">Codex Juris Gentium,</hi> containing documents from 1097 to
                    1497, “ea quae sola inter liberos populos legum sunt loco,” appeared in 1693,
                    and was followed in 1700 by the <hi rend="italic">Mantissa.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Corps Universel Diplomatique du Droit des Gens</hi> of Dumont,
                    continued by Barbeyrac and Rousset in thirteen folio volumes, containing
                    treaties from 315 A.D. to 1730, was published in 1726-39. Wenck’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus Juris Gentium Recentissimi,</hi> 3 vols. 8vo, 1781-95,
                    contains treaties from 1735 to 1772. The 8vo <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi> of
                    G. F. de Martens, continued by C. de Martens, Saalfeld, Murhard, Samwer, Hopf,
                    and Stoerk, commenced in 1791 with treaties of 1761, and is still in progress.
                    The series in 1887 extended to sixty-four volumes. See also the following
                    periodical publications:— <hi rend="italic">Das Staatsarchiv, Sammlung der

                    Calvo for “l’Amérique Latine,” 1862-69; De Clercq for France, 1864-86; De Garcia

                    for Turkey; F. de Martens for Russia, 1874-85; Mayers for China, 1877. The
                    official publication for Italy begins in 1864, for Spain in 1843, for Denmark in
                    1874. The treaties of Japan were published by authority in 1884. Those of the
                    United States are contained in the <hi rend="italic">Statutes at Larae</hi> of

                    1873. In England no treaties were published before the 17th century, such
                    matters being thought “not fit to be made vulgar.” The treaty of 1604 with Spain
                    was, however, published by authority, as were many of the treaties of the Stuart
                    kings. Rymer’s <hi rend="italic">Foedera</hi> was published, under the orders of
                    the Government, in twenty volumes, from 1704 to 1732. Treaties are officially
                    published at the present day in the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette,</hi> and
                    are also presented to parliament, but for methodical collections of treaties
                    made by Great Britain we are indebted to private enterprise, which produced
                    three volumes in 1710-13, republished with a fourth volume in 1732. Other three
                    volumes appeared in 1772-81, the collection commonly known as that of C.
                    Jenkinson (3 vols.) in 1785, and that of Chalmers (2 vols.) in 1795. J.
                    Macgregor published (1841-44) eight volumes of commercial treaties, but the
                    great collection of the commercial treaties of Great Britain is that of L.
                    Hertslet, librarian of the Foreign Office, continued by his son and successor in
                    office, Sir Edward Hertslet, entitled <hi rend="italic">A Complete Collection of

                    volumes, which appeared at Calcutta in 1862-66.</p>
                <p>9. It may be worth while to add a list of some of the more important treaties,
                    now wholly or partially in force, especially those to which Great Britain is a
                    party, classified according to their objects, in the order suggested in
                    paragraph 3.</p>
                <p>(i.) The principal treaties affecting the distribution of territory between the
                    various states of Central Europe are those of Westphalia (Osnabrück and
                    Münster), 1648; Utrecht, 1713; Paris and Hubertsburg, 1763; for the partition of
                    Poland, 1772, 1793; Vienna, 1815; London, for the separation of Belgium from the
                    Netherlands, 1831, 1839; Zurich, for the cession of a portion of Lombardy to
                    Sardinia, 1859; Vienna, as to Schleswig-Holstein, 1864; Prague, whereby the
                    German Confederation was dissolved, Austria recognizing the new North German
                    Confederation, transferring to Prussia her rights over Schleswig-Holstein, and
                    ceding the remainder of Lombardy to Italy, 1866; Frankfort, between France and
                    the new German empire, 1871. The disintegration of the Ottoman empire has been
                    regulated by the great powers, or some of them, in the treaties of London, 1832,
                    1863, 1864, and of Constantinople, 1881, with reference to Greece; and by the
                    treaties of Paris, 1856; London, 1871; Berlin, 1878; London, 1883, with
                    reference to Montenegro, Roumania, Servia, Bulgaria, and the navigation of the
                    Danube. The encroachments of Russia upon Turkey, previous to the Crimean War,
                    are registered in a series of treaties beginning with that of Kutchuk-Kainardji,
                    1774, and ending with that of Adrianople in 1829. The independence of the United
                    States of America was acknowledged by Great Britain in the treaty of peace
                    signed at Paris in 1783. The boundary between the United States and the British
                    possessions is regulated in details by the treaties of Washington of 1842, 1846,
                    1871. Switzerland, Belgium, Corfu and Paxo, and Luxemburg are respectively
                    neutralized by the treaties of Vienna, 1815, and of London, 1839, 1864, 1867. À
                    list of treaties of guarantee to which Great Britain is a party, and which are
                    supposed to be still in force, beginning with a treaty made with Portugal in
                    1373, was presented to parliament in 1859.</p>
                <p>(ii.) For the innumerable conventions to which Great Britain is a party as to
                    commerce, consular jurisdiction, fisheries, and the slave trade, it must suffice
                    to refer to the exhaustive and skilfully devised index to Hertslet’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Commercial Treaties,</hi> forming volume xvi., 1885.</p>
                <p>(iii.) The social intercourse of the world is facilitated by conventions, such as
                    those establishing the Latin monetary union, 1865; the international telegraphic
                    union, 1865; the universal postal union, 1874; the international bureau of
                    weights and measures, 1875; and providing for the protection of submarine cables
                    in time of peace, 1884. Such treaties are somewhat misleadingly spoken of by
                    recent writers (L. von Stein and F. de Martens) as constituting a “droit
                    administratif international.”</p>
                <p>(iv.) The following are the now operative treaties of extradition to which Great
                    Britain is a party:—with the United States, 1842; Brazil and Germany, 1872;
                    Austria, Denmark, Italy, Norway and Sweden, 1873; Hayti and Netherlands, 1874;
                    Belgium and France, 1876; Spain, Portugal (as to India only), 1878; Tonga, 1879;
                    Luxemburg, Equador, and Switzerland, 1880; Salvador, 1881; Uruguay, 1884;
                    Guatemala, 1885; Russia, 1886. It will be observed that all these, except the
                    treaty with the United States, are subsequent to and governed by the provisions
                    of 33 and 34 Vict. c. 52, “The Extradition Act, 1870.” Before the passing of
                    this general Act, it had been necessary to pass a special Act for giving effect
                    to each treaty of extradition. The most complete collection of treaties of
                    extradition is that ofF. J. Kirchner, <hi rend="italic">L</hi> ' <hi
                    rend="italic">Extradition, Recueil, &amp;c.,</hi> London, 1883.</p>
                <p>(v.) General conventions, to which most of the European states are parties, were
                    signed in 1883 at Paris for the protection of industrial, and in 1886 at Bern
                    for the protection of literary and artistic, property.</p>
                <p>(vi.) Certain bodies of rules intended to mitigate the horrors of war have
                    received the adhesion of most civilized states. Thus the declaration of Paris,
                    1856 (to which, however, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, Columbia,
                    Bolivia, and Uruguay have declined to accede), prohibits the use of privateers
                    and protects the commerce of neutrals; the Geneva convention, 1864, gives a
                    neutral character to surgeons and hospitals; and the St Petersburg declaration,
                    1868, prohibits the employment of explosive bullets weighing less than 400
                    grammes.</p>
                <p>It were greatly to be wished that the official publication of treaties could be
                    rendered more speedy and more methodical than it now is. The labours of the
                    publicist would also be much lightened were it possible to consolidate the
                    various general collections of diplomatic acts into a new <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corps Diplomatique Universel,</hi> well furnished with cross references, and
                    with brief annotations showing how far each treaty is supposed to be still in
                    force.</p>
