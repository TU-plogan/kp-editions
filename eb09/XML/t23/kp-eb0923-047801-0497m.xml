                    usually to the surface of the body. It is often understood as a sensation of
                    contact as distinguished from pressure, but it is evident that, however gentle
                    be the contact, a certain amount of pressure always exists between the sensitive
                    surface and the body touched. Mere contact in such circumstances is gentle
                    pressure; a greater amount of force causes a feeling of resistance or of
                    pressure referred to the skin; a still greater amount causes a feeling of
                    muscular resistance, as when a weight is supported on the palm of the hand;
                    whilst, finally, the pressure may be so great as to cause a feeling of pain. The
                    force may not be exerted vertically on the sensory surface, but in the opposite
                    direction, as when a hair on a sensory surface is pulled or twisted. Touch is
                    therefore the sense by which mechanical force is appreciated, and it presents a
                    strong resemblance to hearing, in which the sensation is excited by intermittent
                    pressures on the auditory organ. In addition to feelings of contact or pressure
                    referred to the sensory surface, contact may give rise to a sensation of
                    temperature, according as the thing touched feels hot or cold. These sensations
                    of contact, pressure, or temperature are usually referred to the skin or
                    integument covering the body, but they are experienced to a greater or less
                    extent when any serous or mucous surface is touched. The skin being the chief
                    sensory surface of touch, it is there that the sense is most highly developed,
                    both as to delicacy in detecting minute pressures and as to the character of the
                    surface touched. Tactile impressions, properly so called, are absent from
                    internal mucous surfaces, as has been proved in men having gastric, intestinal,
                    and urinary fistulae. In these cases, touching the mucous surface caused pain,
                    and not a sensation of touch.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Organs of Touch.—Comparative Sketch.—</hi> The organs of touch
                    present many varieties of form, from a simple filament of sensitive protoplasm
                    to a highly complex end-organ connected with the commencement of a sensory
                    nerve-fibre. The bodies of the lowest organisms are formed of contractile
                    protoplasm, and mechanical contact with any resisting substances causes a change
                    of form. Here is the simplest kind of touch—a response on the part of any
                    portion of the surface of the body to a mechanical stimulus. The pseudopodia of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Rhizopoda</hi> are also organs of touch, and probably the
                    cilia, the flagellae, and the short rod-like bodies seen on many <hi
                    rend="italic">Infusoria</hi> belong to the same class of sensory organs. Among
                    the <hi rend="italic">Coelentera</hi> (hydroid polyps, tubularians, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hydromedusae, Medusae, Anthozoa</hi> or sea-anemones) tentacles
                    are found, usually arranged in circles around the mouth or on portions of the
                    body engaged in locomotion, as on the margins of the umbrella of <hi
                    rend="italic">Medusae.</hi> These have a large amount of sensibility, and serve
                    as organs of touch. In some also there are stiff hairs on the tentacles and
                    around the mouth, more differentiated tactile organs. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vermes</hi> show organs of touch in the form of modified cells of the
                    integument, connected with sensory nerves. These cells often assume the form of
                    stiff rods projected from the surface (tactile setae). Such are often found over
                    the whole body of <hi rend="italic">Turbellaria</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nemertina,</hi> on the tentacles of <hi rend="italic">Bryozoa,</hi> on the head
                    segment of <hi rend="italic">Lumbricidae,</hi> and on the tentacles and antennae
                    of <hi rend="italic">Chaetopoda.</hi> In the latter group of animals tactile
                    organs are also found in ring-like arrangements, called cirrhi, on the
                    foot-stumps or parapodia. In some <hi rend="italic">Hirudinea</hi> (leeches)
                    complicated tactile rods are embedded in cup-shaped organs scattered over the
                    body. Large prominences of the cuticle, called tactile papillae, are also found
                    in many of the <hi rend="italic">Vermes</hi> near the oral and genital orifices.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Echinodermata</hi> have also special parts devoted to
                    touch, and these show their highest differentiation in the tentacles of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Holothuroida. Arthropoda</hi> show tactile organs in the form
                    usually of rod-like bodies projecting from the surface of the appendages and
                    chiefly connected with nerves passing to ganglionic cells. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crustacea</hi> such organs are found on the antennae and other appendages, and
                    on the antennae in <hi rend="italic">Myriapoda</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insecta.</hi> In the latter they are also found on the tarsal joints of the
                    feet. The appearance of these rod-like bodies is seen in fig. 1.</p>
                <p>Ciliated tentacular processes exist in the larva of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brachiopoda</hi> which are probably touch organs, but there are no definite
                    organs of this kind in the adult form. The <hi rend="italic">Mollusca</hi> have
                    the sense of touch widely diffused. All the soft parts of the body are capable
                    of feeling when touched, and in various situations there are fine hair-like
                    prolongations from cells. These are supplied with nerves, and are touch organs.
                    Such are found on the edge of the mantle in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lamellibranchiata,</hi> where they may be in rows; they also exist on the
                    siphons, and “they serve to watch over the particles that get into the mantle
                    cavity with the water” (Gegenbaur). Processes of a tactile kind are also found
                    on the epipodium, the edge of the mantle, and the cephalic tentacles in many <hi
                    rend="italic">Gasteropoda,</hi> and on the dorsal tufts of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nudibranchiata.</hi> Here and there also there are enlargements of the
                    integument covered with cilia and supplied by a nerve which have been regarded
                    as touch organs, but are by some supposed to be connected with smell (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Smell).</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> have cells
                    with long filamentous processes in the integument, which are probably tactile in
                    function.</p>
                <p>In the great majority of fishes touch is limited to the lips, to parts of the
                    fins, and to special organs called barbels. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyprinoids</hi> there is a fold of skin bordering the mouth which is highly
                    tactile. The lip of the sturgeon is covered with numerous papillae; the sucking
                    lip of the lamprey is papillose and highly sensitive. The fins are in many
                    fishes modified to serve as organs of touch. Thus the gurnards <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Triglidae)</hi> have three soft flexible rays detached from the fin, and “the
                    filiform radial appendages of the <hi rend="italic">Polynemidae,</hi> the
                    prolonged ventral fins of <hi rend="italic">Osphromenus, Trichogaster,</hi> and
                    other Labyrinthibranchs, and of the <hi rend="italic">Ophidiidae,"</hi> are
                    examples of this class of organs (Owen). The barbels are long slender processes
                    of skin, either single or in pairs, found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siluridae,</hi> loaches, barbels, cods, sturgeons, and in the parasitic <hi
                    rend="italic">Myxinidae.</hi> The nerves for the barbels come from the fifth
                    pair of cranial nerves. “A cod, blind by absence or destruction of both
                    eyeballs, has been captured in good condition, and it may be supposed to have
                    found its food by exploring with the symphysial barbule, as well as by the sense
                    of smell” (Owen). Bodies somewhat similar to the Pacinian corpuscles (to be
                    afterwards described) were discovered by Savi in 1844 in the torpedo; they are
                    arranged in linear series on the anterior part of the mouth and nostrils, and
                    over the fore part of the electrical organs. Each is composed of two capsules,
                    one connected with the other, and containing a gran <hi rend="underline"
                    >ula</hi> r substance in which the nerve end is embedded. Peculiar mucous glands
                    are also found outside the electrical organs of the torpedo which are believed
                    to minister to touch. Similar organs exist in sharks, and John Hunter dissected
                    the snout of the spotted dog-fish <hi rend="italic">(Scyllium)</hi> “to show the
                    manner of the nerves ramifying, <pb break="no"

                    each ultimate nerve appearing to terminate in the bottom of a tube or duct, the
                    sides of which secrete and convey a thick mucus to the skin.” These
                    “nervo-mucous” organs are found in the sides and under part of the head and on
                    the fore part of the trunk.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Reptilia</hi> do not
                    show any special organs of touch. The lips of tadpoles have tactile papillae.
                    Some snakes have a pair of tentacles on the snout, but the tongue is probably
                    the chief organ of touch in most serpents and lizards. All reptiles possessing
                    climbing powers have the sense of touch highly developed in the feet.</p>
                <p>Birds have epithelial papillae on the soles of the toes that are no doubt
                    tactile. These are of great length in the capercailzie (<hi rend="italic">Tetrax
                    urogallus),</hi> “enabling it to grasp with more security the frosted branches
                    of the Norwegian pine trees” (Owen). It has been suggested that the delicate
                    “papillose” digits of the smaller birds assist them in nest-building by having
                    the sense of touch highly developed. Around the root of the bill in many birds
                    there are special tactile organs, assisting the bird to use it as a kind of
                    sensitive probe for the detection in soft ground of the worms, grubs, and slugs
                    that constitute its food. Special bodies of this kind have been detected in the
                    beak and tongue of the duck and goose, called the tactile corpuscles of Merkel,
                    or the corpuscles of Grandry (fig. 2). Similar bodies have been found in the
                    epidermis of man and mammals, in the outer root-sheath of tactile hairs or
                    feelers. They consist of small bodies composed of a capsule enclosing two or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fig.</hi> 2. —Tactile Corpuscles from duck's tongue. more
                    flattened nucleated <hi rend="italic">n</hi>, nerve.</p>
                <p>cells, piled in a row. Each corpuscle is separated from the others by a
                    transparent protoplasmic disk. Nerve fibres terminate either in the cells
                    (Merkel) or in the protoplasmic intercellular matter (Ranvier, Hesse,
                    Izquierdo). Another form of end-organ has been described by Herbst as existing
                    in the mucous membrane of the duck’s tongue. These corpuscles of Herbst are like
                    small Pacinian corpuscles with thin and very close lamellae. Developments of
                    integument devoid of feathers, such as the “wattles” of the cock, the
                    “caruncles” of the vulture and turkey, are not tactile in their function.</p>
                <p>In the great majority of <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> the general surface of
                    the skin shows sensitiveness, and this is developed to a high degree on certain
                    parts, such as the lips, the end of a teat, and the generative organs. Where
                    touch is highly developed, the skin, more especially the epidermis, is thin and
                    devoid of hair. In the Monkeys tactile papillae are found in the skin of the
                    fingers and palms, and in the skin of the prehensile tails of various species
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ateles).</hi> Such papillae also abound in the naked skin of
                    the nose or snout, as in the shrew, mole, pig, tapir, and elephant. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ornithorhynchus</hi> the skin covering the mandibles is tactile
                    (Owen). In many animals certain hairs acquire great size, length, and stiffness.
                    These constitute the vibrissae, or whiskers. Each large hair grows from a firm
                    capsule sunk deep in the true skin, and the hair bulb is supplied with sensory
                    nerve filaments. In the walrus the capsule is cartilaginous in texture. The
                    marine <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> have strong vibrissae which “act as a
                    staff, in a wayanalogous to that held and applied by the hand of a blind man”
                    (Owen). Each species has hairs of this kind developed on the eyebrows, lips, or
                    cheeks, to suit a particular mode of existence, as, for example, the long fine
                    whiskers of the night-prowling felines, and in the aye-aye, a monkey having
                    nocturnal habits. In the <hi rend="italic">Ungulata</hi> the hoofs need no
                    delicacy of touch as regards the discrimination of minute points. Such animals,
                    however, have broad, massive sensations of touch, enabling them to appreciate
                    the firmness of the soil on which they tread, and under the hoof we find highly
                    vascular and sensitive lamellae or papillae, contributing no doubt, not only to
                    the growth of the hoof, but also to its sensitiveness. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cetacea</hi> have numerous papillae in the skin, regarding which John Hunter
                    remarks: “These villi are soft and pliable; they float in water; and each is
                    longer or shorter according to the size of the animal. In the spermaceti whale
                    they are about a quarter of an inch long; in the grampus, bottlenose, much
                    shorter; in all they are extremely vascular; they are sheathed in corresponding
                    hollows of the epiderm.” In some whales the skin is thrown into numerous
                    longitudinal plaits on the under and fore part of the body <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Balaenoptera).</hi> Prof. Owen remarks regarding these: “It is peculiar to the
                    swifter swimming whales that pursue mackerel and herring, and may serve to warn
                    them of shoals, by appreciation of an impulse of the water rebounding therefrom,
                    and so conveying a sense of the propinquity of sunken rocks or sand-banks.
                    Sensitiveness to the movements of the ambient ocean is indicated by certain
                    observed phenomena. The whale-fishers aver that when a straggler is attacked its
                    fellows will bear down from some miles’ distance, as if to its assistance; and
                    it may be that they are attracted by perception of the vibration of the water
                    caused by the struggles of the harpooned whale or cachalot” (Owen’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Comparative Anatomy,</hi> vol. iii. p. 189). Bats have the sense
                    of touch strongly developed in the wings and external ears, and in some species
                    in the flaps of skin found near the nose. These “nose-leaves” and expanded ears
                    frequently show vibratile movements, like the antennae of insects, enabling the
                    animal to detect slight atmospheric impulses. In the vampires <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Desmodi)</hi> and fruit-eating bats <hi rend="italic">(Pteropi)</hi> the
                    auricular and nasal appendages are small; ‘ ‘ such sensitive tactile guides or
                    warners in flight are only needed in the bats of active food, which must follow
                    in swift evolutions, like the swallows, but in gloom, the volatile insects that
                    people the summer air at dawn or dusk” (Owen). There is little doubt that many
                    special forms of tactile organs will be found in animals using the nose or feet
                    for burrowing. A peculiar endorgan has been found in the nose of the mole, while
                    there are “endcapsules” in the tongue of the elephant and ‘ ‘ nerve rings” in
                    the ears of the mouse.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">End-Organs of Touch in Man.—</hi> In man three special forms of
                    tactile end-organs have been described, and can be readily demonstrated.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">The End-Bulbs of Krause.—</hi> These are oval or rounded
                    bodies, from <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 360</hi> to
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 170</hi> of an inch long.
                    Each consists of a delicate capsule, composed of nucleated connective tissue
                    enclosing numerous minute cells. On tracing the nerve fibre, it is found that
                    the nerve sheath is continuous with the capsule, whilst the axis cylinder of the
                    nerve divides into branches which lose themselves among the cells. Waldeyer and
                    Longworth state that the nerve fibrils terminate in the cells, thus making these
                    bodies similar to the cells described by Merkel <hi rend="italic">(ut
                    supra).</hi> See fig. 5. These bodies are found in the deeper layers of the
                    conjunctiva, margins of the lips, nasal mucous membrane, epiglottis, fungiform
                    and circumvallate papillae of the tongue, glans penis and clitoris, mucous
                    membrane of the rectum of man, and they have also been found on the under
                    surface of the “toes of the guinea-pig, ear and body of the mouse, and in the
                    wing of the bat” (Landois and Stirling). In the genital organs aggregations of
                    end-bulbs occur, known as the “genital corpuscles of Krause” (fig. 4). In the

                    are oval bodies, about of an inch long by of an inch in breadth. Each consists
                    of a series of layers of connective tissue arranged transversely, and containing
                    in the centre granular matter with nuclei (fig. 7). One, two, or three nerve
                    fibres pass to the lower end of the corpuscle, wind transversely around it, lose

                    corpuscle, where the axis cylinders, dividing, end in some way unknown. The
                    corpuscles do not contain any soft core, but are apparently built up of
                    irregular septae of connective tissue, in the meshes of which the nerve fibrils
                    end in expansions similar to Merkel’s cells. Dr Thin describes simple and
                    compound corpuscles according to the number of nerve fibres entering them. These
                    bodies are found abundantly in the palm of the hand and sole of the foot, where
                    there may be as many as 21 to every square millimetre (1 mm. = <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 25</hi> inch). They are not
                    so numerous on the back of the hand or foot, mamma, lips, and tip of the tongue,
                    and they are rare in the genital organs. “Kollmann describes three special
                    tactile areas in the hand :—(1) the tips of the fingers, with 24 touch
                    corpuscles in a length of 10 mm.; (2) the three eminences lying on the palm
                    behind the slits between the fingers, with 5∙4-2∙7 touch-corpuscles in the same
                    length; and (3) the ball of the thumb and little finger, with 3∙1-3∙5 touch
                    corpuscles. The first two areas also contain many of the corpuscles of Vater or
                    Pacini, whilst in the latter these corpuscles are fewer and scattered. In the
                    other parts of the hand the nervous endorgans are much less developed” (Landois
                    and Stirling).</p>
                <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">The Corpuscles of Vater or Pacini.—</hi> These, first
                    described by Vater so long ago as 1741, are small oval bodies, quite visible to
                    the naked eye, from to of an inch long and to of an inch in breadth, attached to
                    the nerves of the hands and feet. They can be readily demonstrated in the
                    mesentery of the cat (fig. 8). Each corpuscle consists of 40 to 50 lamellae or
                    coats, like the folds of an onion, thinner and closer together on approaching
                    the centre. Each lamella is formed of an elastic material mixed with delicate
                    connective tissue fibres, and the inner surface of each is lined by a single
                    continuous layer of endothelial cells. A double-contoured nerve fibre passes to
                    each. The white substance of Schwann becomes continuous with the lamellae,
                    whilst the axis cylinder passes into the body, and ends in a small knob or in a
                    plexus. Sometimes a bloodvessel also penetrates the Pacinian body, entering
                    along with the nerve. Such bodies are found in the subcutaneous tissue on the
                    nerves of the fingers and toes, near joints, attached to the nerves of the
                    abdominal plexuses of the sympathetic, on the coccygeal gland, on the dorsum of
                    the penis and clitoris, in the meso-colon, in the course of the intercostal and
                    periosteal nerves, and in the capsules of lymphatic glands (William
                    Stirling).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physiology of Touch in Man.—</hi> Such are the special
                    endorgans of touch. It has also been ascertained that many sensory nerves end in
                    a plexus or network, the ultimate fibrils being connected with the cells of the
                    particular tissue in which they are found. Thus they exist in the cornea of the
                    eye, and at the junctions of tendons with muscles. In the latter situation
                    “flattened end-flakes or plates” and “elongated oval end-bulbs” have also been
                    found (Sachs, Rollett, Golgi). A consideration of these various types of
                    structure show that they facilitate intermittent pressure being made on the
                    nerve endings. They are all, as it were, elastic cushions into which the nerve
                    endings penetrate, so that the slight variation of pressure will be transmitted
                    to the nerve. Probably also they serve to break the force of a sudden shock on
                    the nerve endings.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sensitiveness and Sense of Locality.—</hi> The degree of
                    sensitiveness of the skin is determined by finding the smallest distance at
                    which the two points of a pair of compasses can be felt. This method, first
                    followed by Weber, is employed by physicians in the diagnosis of nervous
                    affections involving the sensitiveness of the skin. The following table shows
                    the sensitiveness in millimetres for an adult, whilst the corresponding numbers
                    for a boy 12 years of age are given within brackets (Landois and Stirling, after
                    Weber): Millimetres.</p>

                <p>These investigations show not only that the skin is sensitive, but that one is
                    able with great precision to distinguish the part touched. This latter power is
                    usually called the <hi rend="italic">sense of locality,</hi> and it is
                    influenced by various conditions. The greater the number of sensory nerves in a
                    given area of skin the greater is the degree of accuracy in distinguishing
                    different points. Contrast in this way the tip of the finger and the back of the
                    hand. Sensitiveness increases from the joints towards the extremities, and, as
                    pointed out by Vierordt, sensitiveness is great in parts of the body that are
                    actively moved. The sensibility of the limbs is finer in.</p>

                    flexor surface of the upper limb and ¼ on the extensor surface (Landois). It is
                    doubtful if exercise improves sensitiveness, as Francis Galton found that the
                    performances of blind boys were not superior to those of other boys, and he says
                    that “the guidance of the blind depends mainly on the multitude of collateral
                    indications, to which they give much heed, and not their superiority to any one
                    of them.” When the skin is moistened with indifferent fluids sensibility is
                    increased. Suslowa made the curious discovery that, if the area between two
                    points distinctly felt be tickled or be stimulated by a weak electric current,
                    the impressions are fused. Stretching the skin, and baths in water containing
                    carbonic acid or common salt, increase the power of localizing tactile
                    impressions. In experimenting with the compasses, it will be found that a
                    smaller distance can be distinguished if one proceeds from greater to smaller
                    distances than in the reverse direction. A smaller distance can also be detected
                    when the points of the compasses are placed one after the other on the skin than
                    when they are placed simultaneously. If the points of the compasses are
                    unequally heated, the sensation of two contacts becomes confused. An anaemic

                    hydrate of chloral blunt sensibility. The only active substance said to increase

                    rend="italic">sense of pressure,</hi> has been determined by various methods.
                    Two different weights are placed on the part, and the smallest difference in
                    weight that can be perceived is noted. Weber placed small weights directly on
                    the skin; Aubert and Kammler loaded small plates; Dohrn made use of a balance,
                    having a blunt point at one end of the beam, resting on the skin, whilst weights
                    were placed on the other end of the beam to equalize the pressure; Eulenberg
                    invented an instrument like a spiral spring paper-clip or balance (the
                    baraesthesiometer), having an index showing the pressure in grammes; Goltz
                    employed an india-rubber tube filled with water, and this, “to ensure a constant
                    surface of contact, bent at one spot over a piece of cork, is touched at that
                    spot by the cutaneous part to be examined, and, by rhythmically exerted
                    pressure, waves analogous to those of the arterial pulse are produced in the
                    tube” (Hermann); and Landois invented a mercurial balance, enabling him to make
                    rapid variations in the weight without giving rise to any shock (figured in
                    Landois and Stirling’s <hi rend="italic">Physiology,</hi> p. 1155). These
                    methods have given the following general results. (1) The greatest acuteness is
                    on the forehead, temples, and back of the hand and forearm, which detect a
                    pressure of ∙002 gramme; fingers detect ∙005 to ∙015 gramme; the chin, abdomen,
                    and nose ∙04 to ∙05 gramme. (2) Goltz’s method gives the same general results as
                    Weber’s experiment with the compasses, with the exception that the tip of the
                    tongue has its sensation of pressure much lower in the scale than its sensation
                    of touch. (3) Eulenberg found the following gradations in the fineness of the
                    pressure sense:—the forehead, lips, back of the cheeks, and temples appreciate
                    differences of to (200: 205 to 300: 310 grammes). The back of the last phalanx
                    of the fingers, the forearm, hand, 1st and 2d phalanges, the palmar surface of
                    the hand, forearm, and upper arm distinguish differences of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 20</hi> (200: 220 to 200: 210
                    grammes). The front of the leg and thigh is similar to the forearm. Then follow
                    the back of the foot and toes, the sole of the foot, and the back of the leg and
                    thigh. Dohrn placed a weight of 1 gramme on the skin, and then determined the
                    east additional weight that could be detected, with this result:— 3d phalanx of
                    finger, ∙499 gramme; back of the foot, ∙5 gramme; 2d phalanx, ∙771 gramme; 1st
                    phalanx, ∙82 gramme; leg, 1 gramme; back of hand, 1T56 grammes; palm, 1∙108
                    grammes; patella, 1∙5 grammes; forearm, 1∙99 grammes; umbilicus, 3∙5 grammes;
                    and back, 3∙8 grammes (Landois and Stirling). (4) In passing from light to
                    heavier weights, the acuteness increases at once, a maximum is reached, and then
                    with heavy weights the power of distinguishing the differences diminishes
                    (Hering, Biedermann). (5) A sensation of pressure after the weights have been
                    removed may be noticed <hi rend="italic">(after-pressure sensation),</hi>
                    especially if the weight be considerable. (6) Valentine noticed that, if the
                    finger were held against a blunt-toothed wheel, and the wheel were rotated with
                    a certain rapidity, he felt a <hi rend="italic">smooth</hi> margin. This was
                    experienced when the intervals of time between the contacts of successive teeth
                    were less than from <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    480</hi> to <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 610</hi> of a
                    second. The same experiment can be readily made by holding the finger over the
                    holes in one of the outermost circles of a large syren rotating quickly: the
                    sensations of individual holes become fused, so as to give rise to a feeling of
                    touching a slit. (7) Vibrations of strings are detected even when the number is
                    about 1500 per second; above this the sensation of vibration ceases. By
                    attaching bristles to the prongs of tuning forks, and bringing these into
                    contact with the lip or tongue, sensations of a very acute character are
                    experienced, which are most intense when the forks vibrate from 600 to 1500 per
                    second.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Information from Tactile Impressions.—</hi> These enable us to
                    come to the following conclusions. (1) We note the existence of something
                    touching the sensory surface. (2) From the intensity of the sensation we
                    determine the weight, tension, or intensity of the pressure. This sensation is
                    in the first instance referred to the skin, but after the pressure has reached a
                    certain amount muscular sensations are also experienced—the so-called muscular
                    sense. (3) The locality of the part touched is at once determined, and from this
                    the probable position of the touching body. Like the visual field, to which all
                    retinal impressions are referred, point for point, there is a tactile field, to
                    which all points on the skin surface may be referred. (4) By touching a body at
                    various points, from the difference of pressure and from a comparison of the
                    positions of various points in the tactile field we judge of the configuration
                    of the body. A number of “tactile pictures” are obtained by passing the skin
                    over the touched body, and the shape of the body is further determined by a
                    knowledge of the muscular movements necessary to bring the cutaneous surface
                    into contact with different portions of it. If there is abnormal displacement of
                    position, a false conception may arise as to the shape of the body. Thus, if a
                    small marble or a pea be placed between the index and middle finger so as to
                    touch (with the palm downwards) the outer side of the index finger and the inner
                    side of the middle finger, a sensation of touching <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                    round body is experienced; but if the fingers be crossed, so that the marble
                    touches the inner side of the index finger and the outer side of the middle
                    finger, there will be a feeling of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> round bodies,
                    because in these circumstances there is added to the feelings of contact a
                    feeling of distortion (or of muscular action) like what would take place if the
                    fingers, for purposes of touch, were placed in that abnormal position. Again, as
                    showing that our knowledge of the tactile field is precise, there is the
                    well-known fact that when a piece of skin is transplanted from the forehead to
                    the nose, in the operation for removing a deformity of the nose arising from
                    lupus or other ulcerative disease, the patient feels the new nasal part as if it
                    were his forehead, and he may have the curious sensation of a nasal instead of a
                    frontal headache. (5) From the number of points touched we judge as to the
                    smoothness or roughness of a body. A body having a uniformly level surface, like
                    a billiard ball, is smooth; a body having points irregular in size and number in
                    a given area is rough; and if the points are very close together it gives rise
                    to a sensation, like that of the pile of velvet, almost intolerable to some
                    individuals. Again, if the pressure is so uniform as not to be felt, as when the
                    body is immersed in water (paradoxical as this may seem, it is the case that the
                    sensation of contact is felt only at the limit of the fluid), we experience the
                    sensation of being in contact with a fluid. (6) Lastly, it would appear that
                    touch is always the result of variation of pressure. No portion of the body when
                    touching anything can be regarded as absolutely motionless, and the slight
                    oscillations of the sensory surface, and in many cases of the body touched,
                    produce those variations of pressure on which touch depends.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theories as to Touch.—</hi> To explain the phenomenon of the
                    tactile field, and more especially the remarkable variations of tactile
                    sensibility above described, various theories have been advanced. (1) The one
                    most generally known is that of E. H. Weber, as modified or restated by Lotze,
                    Meissner, Czermak, and others. It assumes that, whilst we refer every tactile
                    sensation to a certain position in the tactile field, we do not refer it merely
                    to a point, but to a circular or oval area on the skin, called a circle of
                    sensibility. Further, it is assumed that if two such circles touch or overlap
                    they cannot be individually perceived, and that they can only be so individually
                    perceived when one or more circles of sensibility intervene, or, in other words,
                    when there is a “non-irritated sensory element” between the two points touched
                    (figs. 10 and 11).</p>
                <p>Each circle of sensibility may be supposed to be innervated by a distinct fibre.
                    Thus, suppose the sensitive surface of the skin to be diagrammatically
                    represented as in figs. 10 and 11, each square would be a “circle of
                    sensibility.” In more sensitive regions the squares would be smaller and the
                    number of nerve terminations greater than in less sensitive regions. In fig. 10
                    the area contains nine “circles” and has nine nerve terminations, whilst in fig.
                    11, although the total area is the same, there are thirty-six “circles” and
                    thirty-six nerve filaments. If the points of the compasses be placed at <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> in fig. 10 the sensation will
                    be that of one point; there would also be a sensation of one point if they were
                    placed at <hi rend="italic">c</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n501/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0501-0482"/> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi>; but if the points
                    touch <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> there will be a
                    double sensation, because the "circle” <hi rend="italic">d</hi> intervenes.
                    Again, in fig. 11, where the “circles” are much smaller and more numerous, the
                    minimum distance at which two sensations are experienced is much less than in
                    fig. 10, for this would happen when the compasses touch <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> It will also be observed that the same distance
                    <hi rend="italic">d e</hi> in fig. 10 would give a single sensation, whilst it
                    would give a double sensation in fig. 11. But <hi rend="italic">c e</hi> in fig.
                    10 gives a double sensation, and yet the same distance would give a single
                    sensation if the points of the compasses touched adjoining “circles.” A “circle
                    of sensibility,” however, cannot be regarded as an anatomical magnitude or
                    “cutaneous sensory unit,” or, in other words, the area of distribution of a
                    single nerve-fibre. The extent of any such hypothetical circle can be altered by
                    practice and attention, and we may therefore assume that the circles overlap,
                    and that even the same area of skin receives numerous nervefilaments, and that
                    consequently, when a body is touched, it excites at once many filaments. This is
                    illustrated by fig. 12.</p>
                <p>It will be seen that each area receives a certain number of nerve fibres and each
                    nerve fibre supplies fibrils that cross the fibrils of adjoining nerves. If the
                    point of the compass touch at <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, it will irritate all the
                    fibres from 1 to 7, but these will not be excited with equal intensity; the
                    excitation will be at a maximum at 4, more feeble for 3 and 5, and still more
                    feeble for 2 and 6; so that the intensity of the excitation may be represented
                    by the curve above <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> In this case the sensation will be
                    that of one point, because all the fibrils have been excited. If the other point
                    of the compass be placed at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> there will be an
                    intermediary region not excited, and two points will be felt. Suppose now the
                    second point of the compasses is moved to c, all the fibrils between the two
                    points <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> are excited, and
                    there is likely a sensation of single contact; but the excitation of the fibrils
                    7 and 8 is very feeble, and it is possible, by attention and practice, to leave
                    these out, and then there will be a sensation of two contacts (Beaunis). This
                    mechanical theory has no anatomical basis, except it be the statement made by
                    Krause that the distance of the two points of the compasses at which two points
                    are felt includes in the mean 12 tactile corpuscles. Whilst attention has been
                    mainly directed to the skin as the locality where an anatomical explanation is
                    to be sought for, it must not be forgotten that processes may be in operation in
                    the nerve centres. It is well known that irradiation of nervous impulses occur
                    in the nerve centres (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Physiology,</hi> vol. xix. p.
                    29), and it is not unlikely that, when a nervous impression reaches the brain
                    from a particular area of skin, this may be diffused to neighbouring
                    nerve-cells, exciting these, and that then the effect on these cells, in
                    accordance with the law that sensations in nerve centres are referred to the
                    origins in the periphery of the sensory nerve fibres reaching them, will be
                    referred to adjoining areas of skin, or, in other words, to adjoining points in
                    the tactile field.</p>
                <p>Wundt has propounded a psycho-physiological theory that every part of the skin
                    with tactile sensibility always conveys an impression of the locality of the
                    sensation. Each area of skin has a “local colour,” and this diminishes from area
                    to area. The gradation is sudden where the sense of locality is acute and
                    gradual where it is obtuse. “A circle of sensation is an area where the local
                    colour changes so little that two separate impressions fuse into one” (Landois).
                    Practice enables one to notice the changes of local colour, and thus more and
                    more accurately to discriminate points closer and closer together. This theory
                    does not appear to explain anything; it simply restates the phenomena for which
                    an explanation is desired.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sensations of Temperature.</hi> —The skin is not merely the
                    seat of tactile impressions, but also of impressions of temperature. This
                    depends on thermic irritation of the terminal organs, as proved by the following
                    experiment of E. H. Weber:—“If the elbow be dipped into a very cold fluid, the
                    cold is only felt at the immersed part of the body (where the fibres terminate);
                    pain, however, is felt in the terminal organs of the ulnar nerve, namely, in the
                    finger points; this pain, at the same time, deadens the local sensation of
                    cold.” If the sensation of cold were due to the irritation of a specific-nerve
                    fibre, the sensation of cold would be referred to the tips of the fingers. When
                    any part of the skin is above its normal mean temperature, warmth is felt; in
                    the opposite case, cold. The normal mean temperature of a given area varies
                    according to the distribution of hot blood in it and to the activity of
                    nutritive changes occurring in it. When the skin is brought into contact with a
                    good conductor of heat there is a sensation of cold. A sensation of heat is
                    experienced when heat is carried to the skin in any way. The following are the
                    chief facts that have been ascertained regarding the temperature sense. (1) E.
                    H. Weber found that, with a skin temperature of from 15°∙5 C. to 35° C., the
                    tips of the fingers can distinguish a difference of ∙25° C. to ∙2° C.
                    Temperatures just below that of the blood (33° C.͟ <hi rend="underline">2</hi>
                    7° C.) are distinguished by the most sensitive parts, even to ∙05° C. (2) The
                    thermal sense varies in different regions as follows :— tip of tongue, eyelids,
                    cheeks, lips, neck, belly. The “perceptible minimum” was found to be, in degrees
                    C. :—breast, ∙4°; back, ∙9°; back of hand, ∙3°; palm, ∙4°; arm, ∙2°; back of
                    foot, ∙4°; thigh, ∙5°; leg, ∙6° to ∙2°; cheek, ∙4°; temple, ∙3°. (3) If two
                    different temperatures are applied side by side and simultaneously, the
                    impressions often fuse, especially if the areas are close together. (4) Practice
                    is said to improve the thermal sense. (5) Sensations of heat and cold may
                    curiously alternate; thus “when the skin is dipped first into water at 10° C. we
                    feel cold, and if it be then dipped into water at 16° C. we have at first a
                    feeling of warmth, but soon again of cold” (Landois). (6) The same temperature
                    applied to a large area is not appreciated in the same way as when applied to a
                    small one; thus “the whole hand when placed in water at 29° ∙5 C. feels warmer
                    than when a finger is dipped into water at 32° C.</p>
                <p>There is every reason to hold that there are different nerve fibres and different
                    central organs for the tactile and thermal sensations, but nothing definite is
                    known. The one sensation undoubtedly affects the other. Thus the minimum
                    distance at which two compass points are felt is diminished when one point is
                    warmer than the other. Again, a colder weight is felt as heavier, “so that the
                    apparent difference of pressure becomes greater when the heavier weight is at
                    the same time colder, and less when the lighter weight is colder, and difference
                    of pressure is felt with equal weights of unequal temperature” (E. H. Weber).
                    Great sensibility to differences of temperature is noticed after removal,
                    alteration by vesicants, or destruction of the epidermis, and in the skin
                    affection called herpes zoster. The same occurs in some cases of locomotor
                    ataxy. Removal of the epidermis, as a rule, increases tactile sensibility and
                    the sense of locality. Increased tactile sensibility is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >hyperpselaphesia,</hi> and is a rare phenomenon in nervous diseases. Paralysis
                    of the tactile sense is called <hi rend="italic">hypopselaphiesia,</hi> whilst
                    its entire loss is <hi rend="italic">apselaphesia.</hi> Brown-Séquard mentions a
                    case in which contact of two points gave rise to a sense of a third point of
                    contact. Certain conditions of the nerve centres affect the senses both of touch
                    and temperature. Under the influence of morphia the person may feel abnormally
                    enlarged or diminished in size. As a rule the senses are affected
                    simultaneously, but cases occur where one may be affected more than the other.
                    Herzen states that “limbs which are sleeping” feel heat and not cold
                    (Landois).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pain.</hi> —In addition to sensations of touch and of
                    temperature referred to the skin, there is still a third kind of sensation
                    unlike either, namely, pain. This sensation cannot be supposed to be excited by
                    irritations of the end-organs of touch, or of specific thermal end-organs (if
                    there be such), but rather to irritation of ordinary sensory nerves, and there
                    is every reason to believe that painful impressions make their way to the brain
                    along spinal tracks in the spinal cord. If we consider our mental condition as
                    regards sensation at any moment, we notice numerous sensations more or less
                    definite, not referred directly to the surface, nor to external objects, such as
                    a feeling of general comfort, free or impeded breathing, hunger, thirst,
                    malaise, horror, fatigue, and pain. These are all caused by the irritation of
                    ordinary sensory nerves in different localities, and if the irritation of such
                    nerves, by chemical, thermal, mechanical, or nutritional stimuli, passes beyond
                    a certain maximum point of intensity the result is pain. Irritation of a nerve,
                    in accordance with the law of “peripheral reference of sensation,” will cause
                    pain. Sometimes the irritation applied to the trunk of a sensory nerve may be so
                    intense as to destroy its normal function, and loss of sensation or anaesthesia
                    results. If then the stimulus be increased further, pain is excited which is
                    referred to the end of the nerve, with the result of producing what has been
                    called <hi rend="italic">anaesthesia dolorosa.</hi> Pains frequently cannot be
                    distinctly located, probably owing to the fact of irradiation in the nerve
                    centres and subsequent reference to areas of the body which are not really the
                    seat of irritations. The intensity of pain depends on the degree of excitability
                    of the sensory nerves, whilst its massiveness depends on the number of nerve
                    fibres affected. The quality of the pain is probably produced by the kind of
                    irritation of the nerve, as affected by the structure of the part and the
                    greater or less continuance of severe pressure. Thus there are piercing,
                    cutting, boring, burning, throbbing, pressing, gnawing, dull, and acute
                    varieties of pain. Sometimes the excitability of the cutaneous nerves is so
                    great that a breath of air or a delicate touch may give rise to suffering. This
                    <hi rend="italic">hyperalgia</hi> is found in inflammatory affections of the
                    skin. In <hi rend="italic">neuralgia</hi> the pain is characterized by its
                    character of shooting along the course of the nerve and by <pb break="no"

                    there are disordered sensations referred to the skin, such as alternations of
                    heat and cold, burning, creeping, itching, and a feeling as if insects were
                    crawling on the surface (formication). This condition is termed <hi
                    rend="italic">paralgia.</hi> The term <hi rend="italic">hypalgia</hi> is applied
                    to a diminution and <hi rend="italic">analgia</hi> to paralysis of pain, as is
                    produced by anaesthetics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Muscular Sense.</hi> —The sensory impressions considered in
                    this article are closely related to the so-called muscular sense, or that sense
                    or feeling by which we are aware of the state of the muscles of a limb as
                    regards contraction or relaxation. Some have held that the muscular sense is
                    really due to greater or less stretching of the skin and therefore to irritation
                    of the nerves of that organ. That this is not the case is evident from the fact
                    that disordered movements indicating perversion or loss of this sense are not
                    affected by removal of the skin (Claude Bernard). Further, cases in the human
                    being have been noticed where there was an entire loss of cutaneous sensibility
                    whilst the muscular sense was unimpaired. It is also known that muscles possess
                    sensory nerves, giving rise, in certain circumstances, to fatigue, and, when
                    strongly irritated, to the pain of cramp. Muscular sensations are really excited
                    by irritation of sensory nerves passing from the muscles themselves. We are thus
                    made conscious of whether or not the muscles are contracted, and of the amount
                    of contraction necessary to overcome resistance, and this knowledge enables us
                    to judge of the amount of voluntary impulse. Loss or diminution of the muscular
                    sense is seen in chorea and especially in locomotor ataxy. Increase of it is
                    rare, but it is seen in the curious affection called anxietas tibiarum, “a
                    painful condition of unrest, which leads to a continual change in the position
                    of the limbs” (Landois). See also <hi rend="smallcaps">Physiology.</hi> (J. G.
