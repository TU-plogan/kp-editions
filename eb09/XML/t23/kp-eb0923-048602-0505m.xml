                    (1704-1788), the renowned pastellist, was born at St Quentin on the 5th
                    September 1704. On leaving Picardy for Paris he entered the studio of an artist
                    named Du Pouche, and then that of Spoéde,—an upright man, but a poor master,
                    rector of the Academy of St Luke, who still continued, in the teeth of the Royal
                    Academy, the traditions of the old guild of the master-painters of Paris. This
                    possibly contributed to the adoption by De la Tour of a line of work foreign to
                    that imposed by an academical training; for pastels, though occasionally used,
                    were not a principal and distinct branch of work until 1720, when Rosalba
                    Carriera brought them into fashion with the Parisian world. In 1737 De la Tour
                    exhibited the first of that splendid series of a hundred and fifty portraits
                    which formed the glory of the Salon for the succeeding thirty-seven years. In
                    1746 he was received by the Academy; and in 1751, the following year to that in
                    which he received the title of painter to the king, he was promoted by that body
                    to the grade of councillor. His work had the rare merit to satisfy at once both
                    the taste of his fashionable models and the judgment of his brother artists. His

                    that flattery behind the just and striking likeness which, says Mariette, he
                    hardly ever missed. His portraits of Rousseau, of Voltaire, of Louis XV., of his
                    queen, of the dauphin and dauphiness, are at once documents and masterpieces
                    unsurpassed except by his life-size portrait of Madame de Pompadour, which,
                    exhibited at the Salon of 1755, is still the chief ornament of the cabinet of
                    pastels in the Louvre. It is and will probably always be the most perfect model
                    of this class of work as long as time and damp spare the fragile dust to which
                    it owes its beauty. The museum of St Quentin, however, also possesses a
                    magnificent collection of works which at his death were in his own hands. De la
                    Tour retired to St Quentin at the age of 80, and there he died on 17th February
                    1788. The riches amassed during his long life were freely bestowed by him in
                    great part before his death; he founded prizes at the school of fine arts in
                    Paris and for the town of Amiens, and endowed St Quentin with a great number of
                    useful and charitable institutions. He never married, but lived on terms of warm
                    affection with his brother (who survived him, and left to the town the drawings
                    now in the museum); and his relations to Mdlle. Fel, the celebrated singer, were
                    distinguished by a strength and depth of feeling not common to the loves of the
                    18th century.</p>
