                    (1676-1734), historical painter, was born at Melcombe Regis, Dorset, in 1676,
                    coming of an ancient but impoverished county family. His father died while he
                    was young, but he was befriended by his maternal uncle, the celebrated Dr
                    Sydenham, and apprenticed to Thomas Highmore, sergeant-painter to King William
                    III., a connexion of the Thornhill family. Little is known regarding his early
                    career. About 1715 he visited Holland, Flanders, and France; and, having
                    obtained the patronage of Queen Anne, he was in 1719-20 appointed her
                    serjeant-painter in succession to Highmore, and was ordered to decorate the
                    interior of the dome of St Paul’s with a series of eight designs, in chiaroscuro
                    heightened with gold, illustrative of the life of that apostle,—a commission for
                    which Louis Laguerre had previously been selected by the commissioners for the
                    repair of the cathedral. He also designed and decorated the saloon and hall of
                    Moor Park, Herts, and painted the great hall at Blenheim, the princesses?
                    apartments at Hampton Court, the hall and staircase of the Southsea Company, the
                    chapel at Wimpole, the staircase at Easton-Neston, Northamptonshire, and the
                    hall at Greenwich Hospital, usually considered his most important and successful
                    work, upon which he was engaged from 1708 to 1727. Among his easel pictures are
                    the altar-pieces of All Souls and Queen’s College chapels, Oxford, and that in
                    Melcombe Regis church; and he executed such portrait subjects as that of Sir
                    Isaac Newton, in Trinity College, Cambridge, and the picture of the House of
                    Commons in 1730, now in the possession of the earl of Hardwicke, in which he was
                    assisted by Hogarth, who married Jane, his only daughter. He also produced a few
                    etchings in a slight and sketchy but effective manner, and executed careful
                    full-size copies of Raphael’s cartoons, which now belong to the Royal Academy.
                    About 1724 he drew up a proposal for the establishment of a royal academy of the
                    arts, and his scheme had the support of the lord treasurer Halifax, but
                    Government declined to furnish the needful funds. Thornhill then opened a
                    drawingschool in his own house in James Street, Covent Garden, where instruction
                    continued to be given till the time of his death. He acquired a considerable
                    fortune by his art, and was enabled to repurchase his family estate of
                    Thornhill, Dorsetshire. In 1715 he was knighted by George L, and in 1719 he
                    represented Melcombe Regis in parliament, a borough for which Sir Christopher
                    Wren had previously been member. Having been removed from his office by some
                    court intrigue, and suffering from broken health and repeated attacks of gout,
                    he retired to his country seat, where he died on the 4th of May 1734. His son
                    James was also an artist. He succeeded his father as serjeant-painter to George
                    IL, and was appointed “painter to the navy.”</p>

                    assisted by Thomas Gibson; and, ignorant of the great monumental art of Italy,

                    that, in the departments of art which he chose for his own, he was the best
                    native painter of his time.</p>
