                    happily veiled under the title of a “Turkey merchant.” He was born in Newport
                    Street, Long Acre, Westminster, on 25th June 1736. Some portion of his school
                    days was passed, when he was about seven years old, in “an academy in Soho
                    Square,” and when three years older he went to a school in a Kentish village.
                    For a time (1744-46) he was at Westminster School, but the greater part of his
                    education was got at Eton, and then under private tuition, first at Sevenoaks in
                    Kent (1753) and then at Ravenstone in Northamptonshire. In 1755 he was entered
                    at St John’s College, Cambridge, and took his degree of B.A. in 1758, as last
                    but one of the senior optimes, Beadon, his life-long friend, afterwards bishop
                    of Bath and Wells, being among the wranglers in the same year. Strange to say,
                    the object of all this care and expense found himself doomed to the drudgery of
                    ushership at a boarding school at Blackheath, and the pleasures of his lot were
                    not enhanced by his father’s strongly expressed desire that he should take
                    orders in the Church of England. A strange vacillation marked his career at this
                    period, a vacillation probably due to a constant struggle between his own
                    inclination and the wishes of his father. He was admitted to the diaconate of
                    the church, and almost at the same time was entered at the Inner Temple. He
                    studied for the bar for some time, mostly in the company of Dunning and Kenyon,
                    and then was ordained as a priest of the national church by the bishop of
                    Salisbury. After this event his father obtained for him the next presentation to
                    the small vicarage of New Brentford, to which Horne was duly admitted, and he
                    retained its scanty profits until 1773. During a part of this time he was absent
                    on a tour in France, acting as the bear-leader of a son of the miser Elwes. To
                    his credit be it said that while he resided at Brentford he discharged with
                    exemplary regularity all the duties of his profession, and that, reviving a
                    practice of the previous century, he studied medicine for the benefit of his
                    poorer parishioners. Under the excitement created by the actions of Wilkes and
                    the blunders of his ministerial opponents, Horne plunged into politics with
                    consuming zeal. The newspapers abounded with his productions, but his chief
                    effort was a scathing pamphlet on Lords Bute and Mansfield, setting out the
                    “petition of an Englishman.” In 1765 he again went abroad as tutor, and on this
                    occasion he escorted to Italy the son of a Mr Taylor, who lived near his
                    Middlesex parish, a young man subject to fits of insanity. It was w hile passing
                    through Paris on this tour that he made the personal acquaintance of Wilkes, and
                    it was ∙while at Montpellier, in January 1766, that a letter addressed by Horne
                    to Wilkes laid the seeds of that personal antipathy which afterwards grew so
                    rapidly. In the summer of 1767 the travelled parson landed again on English
                    soil, and, in spite of his latent distrust of the so-called “patriot,” his
                    exertions quickly obtained for Wilkes that seat for the county of Middlesex
                    which ensured his fortune. Horne was deeply concerned in all the proceedings of
                    the corporation of London in support of the popular cause, and he advised, if he
                    did not actually draw up, the celebrated speech which Aiderman Beckford
                    addressed to his sovereign. As an incidental act in this struggle with the court
                    and the majority of the House of Commons, Horne involved himself in a dispute
                    with George Onslow, the member for Surrey, which culminated in a civil action,
                    ultimately decided in Horne’s favour, and in the loss by his opponent of his
                    seat in parliament. An influential association, called “the Society for
                    Supporting the Bill of Rights,” was founded, mainly through the exertions of
                    Horne, in 1769, but the members were soon divided into two opposite camps of the
                    thick and thin partisans of Wilkes and of those who refused to be labelled by
                    the name of any combatant, and in 1770 Horne and Wilkes broke out into open
                    warfare. Into this controversy, carried on with that unflagging zeal which
                    always springs from personal hatred, none will now care to enter; it benefited
                    the fortunes of neither of the combatants, and it damaged the success of the
                    cause for which they had both laboured energetically. In 1771 Horne obtained at
                    Cambridge, though not without some opposition from members of both the political
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n464/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0464-0445"/> parties, his degree of M.A., and in the same year
                    he embarked on a more laborious and costly undertaking, that of vindicating the
                    right of printing an account of the debates in parliament, in which, after a
                    protracted struggle between the ministerial majority and the civic authorities,
                    the right was definitely established. The energies of the indefatigable parson
                    knew no bounds. In the same year (1771) he crossed swords with Junius, and ended
                    in disarming his masked antagonist. It is a curious corollary to this
                    controversy that more than one speculator has identified him with Junius. Horne
                    had now passed more than half the allotted span of 1ife, and his only fixed
                    income consisted of those scanty emoluments attached to a position which galled
                    him daily. He resigned his benefice, and betook himself to the study of the law
                    and to his studies in philology. An accidental circumstance, however, occurred
                    at this moment which largely affected his future. His friend Mr William Tooke
                    had purchased a considerable estate south of the town of Croydon in Surrey, part
                    of which seems to have consisted of Purley Lodge in Coulsdon. The possession of
                    this property brought about frequent disputes with an adjoining landowner, and,
                    after many actions in the law courts, the friends of Mr Tooke’s opponent
                    endeavoured to obtain, by a bill forced through the Houses of Parliament, the
                    privileges which the law had not assigned to him. Horne thereupon, by a bold
                    libel on the Speaker, drew public attention to the case, and, although he
                    himself was placed for a time in the custody of the sergeant-at-arms, the
                    clauses which were injurious to the interests of Mr Tooke were eliminated from
                    the bill through the publicity which his conduct had given to the matter. Mr
                    Tooke’s gratitude knew no bounds; he declared his intention of making his friend
                    the heir to his fortune, and, if the design was never carried into effect, Horne
                    derived from the generous old man during his lifetime large gifts of money. No
                    sooner had this matter been happily settled than Horne found himself involved in
                    a more serious trouble than any that had yet befallen him. For his conduct in
                    signing the advertisement soliciting subscriptions for the relief of the
                    relatives of the Americans murdered by the king’s troops at Lexington and
                    Concord, he was tried at the Guildhall in July 1777 before Lord Mansfield, found
                    guilty, and committed to the King’s Bench prison in St George’s Fields, from
                    which he only emerged after a year’s durance, and after a loss, in fine and
                    costs, amounting to £1200. Soon after his deliverance, as he had thrown off, as
                    he thought, his clerical gown, he applied to be called to the bar, but his
                    application was negatived on the ground that his orders in the church were
                    indelible. To return to the church was now impossible; and Horne tried his
                    fortune, but without success, in farming some land in Huntingdonshire. Two
                    tracts which were penned by him, one before and the other after this failure in
                    practical life, exercised great influence in the country. One of them,
                    criticizing the measures of Lord North’s ministry, passed through numerous
                    editions; the other set out a scheme of reform which he afterwards withdrew in
                    favour of that advocated by Pitt. On his return from his voluntary banishment in
                    Huntingdonshire, he became once more a frequent guest at Mr Tooke’s house of
                    Purley, and in 1782 assumed the name of Horne Tooke, which is now invariably
                    assigned to him. In 1786 Horne Tooke conferred perpetual fame upon his
                    benefactor’s country house by adopting as a second title of his elaborate
                    philological treatise of *Eτrεα <hi rend="italic">Πτερό</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >εντa,</hi> the more popular though misleading title of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Diversions of Purley.</hi> The treatise at once attracted attention in England
                    and the Continent, was universally read by the vulgar as well as the learned,
                    and, while its conclusions, if not always carrying conviction to the erudite,
                    were deemed by them worthy of consideration as proceeding from a mind of
                    extensive learning and singular acuteness, the fame given to Purley by the
                    choice of the title gratified its owner. The first part was published in 1786,
                    the second in 1805. The best edition is that which was published in 1829, under
                    the editorship of Richard Taylor, with the additions written in the author’s
                    interleaved copy.</p>
                <p>Between 1782 and 1790 Tooke gave his support to Pitt, and in the election for
                    Westminster, a constituency in which Fox was vitally interested, he threw all
                    his energies into the ministerial cause. With Fox he was never on terms of
                    friendship, and Samuel Rogers, in his <hi rend="italic">Table Talk,</hi> asserts
                    that their antipathy was so pronounced that at a dinner party given by a
                    prominent Whig not the slightest notice was taken by Fox of the presence of
                    Horne Tooke. It was after the election of Westminster in 1788 that Tooke
                    depicted the two rival statesmen in his celebrated pamphlet of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Two Pair of Portraits.</hi> At the general election of 1790 he came forward as
                    a candidate for that distinguished constituency, in opposition to Fox and Lord
                    Hood, but was defeated; and, though he again sought the suffrages of its voters
                    in 1796, and his speeches at the hustings were never exceeded in ability, he was
                    again at the bottom of the poll. Meantime the excesses of the French republicans
                    had unhinged the minds of all sections of society in England, and the actions of
                    the Tory ministry faithfully represented the feelings of the country. Horne
                    Tooke was arrested early on the morning of 16 th May 1794, and conveyed to the
                    Tower. His trial for high treason lasted for six days (October 17-23) and ended
                    in his acquittal, the jury only requiring the short space of eight minutes to
                    settle their verdict. The evidence which the crown could adduce in support of
                    the charge proved to be of the slightest description, and the demeanour of the
                    accused throughout the proceedings furnished abundant proofs of the resolution
                    of his mind and the force of his abilities. His public life after this event was
                    only distinguished by one act of importance. Through the influence of Lord
                    Camelford, the fighting peer, he was returned to parliament in 1801 for the
                    pocket borough of Old Sarum. No sooner was he returned to the House of Commons
                    than Lord Temple endeavoured to secure his exclusion on the ground that he had
                    taken orders in the church, and one of Gillray’s caricatures delineates the two
                    politicans, Temple and Camelford, playing at battledore and shuttlecock, with
                    Horne Tooke as the shuttlecock. The ministry of Addington would not support this
                    suggestion, but a bill was at once introduced by them and carried into law,
                    which rendered all persons in holy orders ineligible to sit in the House of
                    Commons. The parliamentary life of the member for Old Sarum was preserved
                    through one parliament, but at its expiration he was excluded for ever.</p>
                <p>The last years of Tooke’s life were spent in retirement in a house on the west
                    side of Wimbledon Common, and there he was visited by the leading members of the
                    party of progress. The traditions of his Sunday parties have lasted unimpaired
                    to this day, and the most pleasant pages penned by his biographer describe the
                    politicians and the men of letters who gathered round his hospitable board. His
                    conversational powers rivalled those of Dr Johnson; and, if more of his sayings
                    have not been chronicled for the benefit of posterity, the defect is due to the
                    absence of a Boswell. Through the liberality of his friends, his last days were
                    freed from the pressure of poverty, and he was enabled to place his illegitimate
                    son in a position which soon brought him wealth, and to leave a competency to
                    his two illegitimate daughters. Hlness seized him early in 1810, and for the
                    next two years his sufferings were acute. He died in his house at Wimbledon on
                    18th March 1812, and his body <pb break="no"

                    tomb which he had prepared in the garden attached to his house at Wimbledon
                    being found unsuitable for the interment. An altar-tomb still stands to his
                    memory in Ealing churchyard. A catalogue of his library was printed in 1813.</p>
