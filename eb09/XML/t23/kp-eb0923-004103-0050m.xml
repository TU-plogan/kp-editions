                    Damila—have been finally discussed by Bishop Caldwell in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages</hi> (2d ed., 1875, p. 10 <hi

                    identification was first suggested by Dr Graul <hi rend="italic">{Peise nach

                    rend="italic">{Malayâlma Dictionary,</hi> 1872, s.v.). It should, however, be
                    mentioned that the former prefers now to take the word Tamil to be a corruption
                    of <hi rend="italic">tenmol·i,</hi> southern speech, in contradistinction to <hi
                    rend="italic">vadugu,</hi> the northern, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Telugu
                    language. As in the case of the Kafir, Turkish, Tagala, and other typical
                    languages, the term Tamulic or Tamulian has occasionally been employed as the
                    designation of the whole class of Dravidian peoples and languages, of which it
                    is only the most prominent member. The presentarticle deals with Tamil in its
                    restricted sense only.</p>
                <p>The Tamils, taken as the type and representatives of the Dravidian race, do not
                    now, owing to early intermixture with the Aryan immigrants, materially differ in
                    physical character from the other curly-haired indigenous population of India.
                    They were at one time, on the ground of the general structure of their language,
                    classed with the Mongoloid (Turanian, Scythian) and even the Australian races,
                    but that classification is rejected by all the leading ethnologists. They form,
                    in fact, with the other members of the group, a separate and distinct family,
                    which is of the dolichocephalic class, and comes near the Indo-European or Aryan
                    type; while there are scattered remnants of a still earlier population of India
                    (Mundas, Kolarians), whose race characteristics, however, do not so essentially
                    differ from those of the Dravidians as to con stitute them a class by
                    themselves. The Tamils proper are smaller and weaker-built than the Europeans,
                    though more graceful in shape. Their physical appearance is described as follows
                    :—a pointed and frequently hooked pyramidal nose, with conspicuous nares, more
                    long than round; a marked sinking in of the orbital line, producing a strongly
                    defined orbital ridge; hair and eyes black; the latter, varying from small to
                    middle-sized, have a peculiar sparkle and a look of calculation: mouth large,
                    lips thick <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n51/mode/1up"

                    lateral expansion greater than in the Aryan and less than in the Turanian type,
                    giving to the middle part of the face a marked development and breadth, and to
                    the general contour an obtuse oval shape, somewhat bulging at the sides;
                    forehead well-formed, but receding, inclining to flattish, and seldom high;
                    occiput somewhat projecting; beard considerable, and often strong; colour of
                    skin very dark, frequently approaching to black <hi rend="italic">{Manual of the

                    Languages,</hi> 1875, pp. 558-79). The Tamils have many estimable
                    qualities,—frugality, patience, endurance, politeness,—and they are credited
                    with astounding memories; their worst vices are said to be lying and
                    lasciviousness. Of all the South-Indian tribes they are the least sedentary and
                    the most enterprising. Wherever money is to be earned, there will Tamils be
                    found, either as merchants or in the lower capacity of domestic servants and
                    labourers. The tea and coffee districts of Ceylon are peopled by about 800,000;
                    Tamils serve as coolies in the Mauritius and the West Indies. In Burmah, the
                    Straits, and Siam the so-called Klings are all Tamils (Graul, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reise nach Ostindien,</hi> Leipsic, 1855, vol. iv. pp. 113-212).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Language.—</hi> The area over ∙which Tamil is spoken extends
                    from a few miles north of the city of Madras to the extreme south of the eastern
                    side of the peninsula, throughout the country below the Ghâts, from Pulicat to
                    Cape Comorin, and from the Ghâts to the Bay of Bengal, including also the
                    southern portion of Travancore on the western side of the Ghâts and the northern
                    part of Ceylon. According to the census of 1881, the number of Tamil-speaking
                    people throughout the province was 12,413,517, inclusive of 21,992 Yerkalas,
                    3843 Kurumbas, and 287 Irulas, three tribes speaking rude dialects of the
                    language. To these should be added about 160,000 in the French possessions. But,
                    as of all the Dravidian languages the Tamil shows the greatest tendency to
                    spread, its area becomes ever larger, encroaching on that of the contiguous
                    languages. Tamil is a sister of Malayâlma, Telugu, Canarese, Tulu, Kudagu, Toda,
                    Kôta, Gond, Khond (Ku), Urâon, Râjmahâl, Keikâdi, and Brahui, the nine
                    last-named being uncultivated tongues; and, as it is the oldest, richest, and
                    most highly organized of the Dravidian languages, it may be looked upon as
                    typical of the family to which it belongs. The one nearest akin to it is
                    Malayâlma, which originally appears to have been simply a dialect of Tamil, but
                    differs from it now both in pronunciation and in idiom, in the retention of
                    Old-Tamil forms obsolete in the modern language, and in having discarded all
                    personal terminations in the verb, the person being always indicated by the
                    pronoun (F. W. Ellis, <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the Malayâlma
                    Language,</hi> p. 2; Gundert, <hi rend="italic">Malayâlma Dictionary,</hi>
                    Introd.; Caldwell, <hi rend="italic">Comparative Gr.,</hi> Introd., p. 23;
                    Burnell, <hi rend="italic">Specimens of South Indian Dialects,</hi> No. 2, p.
                    13). Also, the proportion of Sanskrit words in Malayâlma is greater, while in
                    Tamil it is less, than in any other Dravidian tongue. This divergence between
                    the two languages cannot be traced farther back than about the 10th century;
                    for, as it appears from the Cochin and Travancore inscriptions, previous to that
                    period both languages were still substantially identical; whereas in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Râmachamtam,</hi> the oldest poem in Malayâlma, composed probably
                    in the 13th century, at any rate long before the arrival of the Portuguese and
                    the introduction of the modern character, we see that language already formed.
                    The modern Tamil <hi rend="italic">characters</hi> originated “in a Brahmanical
                    adaptation of the old Grantha letters corresponding to the so-called
                    Vatteluttu,” or round-hand, an alphabet once in vogue throughout the whole of
                    the Pândyan kingdom, as well as in the South Malabar and Coimbatore districts,
                    and still sparsely used for drawing up conveyances and other legal instruments
                    (F. W. Ellis, <hi rend="italic">Dissertation,</hi> p. 3). It is also used by the
                    Mâppilas in Tellicherry. The origin of the Vatteluttu itself is still a
                    controverted question. The late Dr Burnell, the greatest authority on the
                    subject, has stated his reasons for tracing that character through the Pehlevi
                    to a Semitic source <hi rend="italic">{Elements of South Indian
                    Palaeography,</hi> 2d ed., 1878, pp. 47-52, and plates xvii. and xxxii.). In the
                    8th century the Vatteluttu existed side by side and together with the Grantha,
                    an ancient alphabet still used throughout the Tamil country in writing Sanskrit.
                    During the four or five centuries after the conquest of Madura by the Cholas in
                    the 11 th it was gradually superseded in the Tamil country by the modern Tamil,
                    while in Malabar it continued in general use down to the end of the 17th
                    century. But the earliest works of Tamil literature, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tolkap&gt;piyam</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Rural,</hi> were
                    still written in it. The modern Tamil characters, which have but little changed
                    for the last 500 years, differ from all the other modern Dravidian alphabets
                    both in shape and in their phonetic value. Their angular form is said to be due
                    to the widespread practice of writing with the style resting on the <hi
                    rend="italic">end</hi> of the left thumb-nail, while the other alphabets are
                    written with the style resting on the left side of the thumb.</p>
                <p>The Tamil alphabet is sufficiently well adapted for the expression of the twelve
                    vowels of the language (a, <hi rend="italic">A, i, î, u,Û, e, ê, ο, 6, ei,
                    au),</hi> —the occasional sounds of ö and ü, both short and long, being covered
                    by the signs for <hi rend="italic">e, ê, i, Î</hi>; but it is utterly inadequate
                    for the proper expression of the consonants, inasmuch as the one character <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> has to do duty also for <hi rend="italic">kh, g, gh,</hi>
                    and similarly each of the other surd consonants <hi rend="italic">eh, t, t,
                    p</hi> represents also the remaining three letters of its respective class. The
                    letter <hi rend="italic">k</hi> has, besides, occasionally the sound of <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eh</hi> that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >s.</hi> Each of the five consonants <hi rend="italic">k, eh, t, t, p</hi> has
                    its own nasal. In addition to the four semivowels, the Tamil possesses a
                    cerebral <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> and has, in
                    common with the Malayâlma, retained a liquid <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> once
                    peculiar to all the Dravidian languages, the sound of which is so difficult to
                    fix graphically, and varies so much in different districts, that it has been
                    rendered in a dozen different ways (Λ∕αnuαZ o∕ <hi rend="italic">the
                    Administration of the Madras Presidency,</hi> vol. ii. p. 20 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.).</hi> Fr. Müller is probably correct in approximating it to that of the
                    Bohemian r. There is, lastly, a peculiar <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> differing in
                    function but not in pronunciation from the dental <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> The
                    three sibilants and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> of Sanskrit have no place in the
                    Tamil alphabet; but <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> often does duty as a sibilant in
                    writing foreign words, and the four corresponding letters as well as J and. <hi
                    rend="italic">ksh</hi> of the Grantha alphabet are now frequently called to aid.
                    It is obvious that many of the Sanskrit words imported into Tamil at various
                    periods (Caldwell, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.,</hi> Introd., pp. 86 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi>) have, in consequence of the incongruity of the Sanskrit
                    and Tamil notation of their respective phonetic systems, assumed disguises under
                    which the original is scarcely recognizable: examples are <hi rend="italic"
                    >ulagu</hi> (loka), <hi rend="italic">uruνam</hi> (râpa), <hi rend="italic"
                    >arukken</hi> (arka), <hi rend="italic">arputam</hi> (adbhutam), <hi
                    rend="italic">naichadtiram</hi> (nakshatram), <hi rend="italic">irudi</hi>
                    (rishi), <hi rend="italic">tick am</hi> (dirgha), <hi rend="italic">arasen</hi>
                    (râjan). Besides the Sanskrit ingredients, which appear but sparsely in the old
                    poetry, Tamil has borrowed from Hindustani, Arabic, and Persian a large number
                    of revenue, political, and judicial terms, and more recently a good many English
                    words have crept in, such as <hi rend="italic">tiratti,</hi> treaty, <hi
                    rend="italic">patlar,</hi> butler, <hi rend="italic">Akt,</hi> act, <hi
                    rend="italic">kulôb,</hi> club, <hi rend="italic">kavarnar,</hi> governor, <hi
                    rend="italic">pinnalk6(lu,</hi> penal code, <hi rend="italic">slkku,</hi> sick,
                    <hi rend="italic">mejastirattu,</hi> magistrate. But, as compared with its
                    literary sister languages, it has preserved its Dravidian character singularly
                    free from foreign influence. Of Tamil words which have found a permanent home in
                    English may be mentioned curry <hi rend="italic">{kari),</hi> mulligatawny
                    (wιι7αgu, pepper, and <hi rend="italic">tannir,</hi> cool water), cheroot <hi

                <p>The laws of euphony (avoiding of hiatus, softening of initial consonants, contact
                    of final with initial consonants) are far more complicated in Tamil than in
                    Sanskrit. But, while they were rigidly adhered to in the old poetical language
                    (Sen-Tamil), there is a growing tendency to neglect them in the language of the
                    present day (Kodun-Tamil). It is true the Tamil rules totally differ from the
                    prevailing Sanskrit; still the probability is in favour of a Sanskrit influence,
                    inasmuch as they appear to follow Sanskrit models. Thus, <hi rend="italic">irul

                    former comprising words for rational beings, the latter all the rest. Only in
                    high-caste nouns a distinction between masculine and feminine is observed in the
                    singular; both haVe a common plural, which is indicated by change of a final <hi

                    >r</hi>; but the neuter plural termination <hi rend="italic">kal (gal)</hi> may
                    be superadded in every case. Certain nouns change their base termination before
                    receiving the case affixes, the latter being the same both for singular and
                    plural. They are for the acc. <hi rend="italic">ei,</hi> instr, <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">ê</hi> may also be superadded. In the old poetry there is a
                    still greater variety of affixes, while there is an option of dispensing with
                    all. Adjectives, when attributive, precede the noun and are unchangeable; when
                    predicative they follow it and receive verbal affixes. The pronouns of the 1st

                    rend="italic">u</hi> what is between the two, so the same forms beginning with
                    <hi rend="italic">e (or yd,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">ydr, dr,</hi> who?)
                    express the interrogative. The verb consists of three elements—the root
                    (generally reducible to one syllable), the tense characteristic, and the
                    personal affix. There are three original moods, the indicative, imperative, and
                    infinitive (the 2d singular imperative is generally identical with the root), as
                    -well as three original tenses, the present, past, and future. The personal
                    affixes are—sing. (1) -en; (2) <hi rend="italic">-dy,</hi> honorific -ir; (3)
                    masc. <hi rend="italic">-dn,</hi> fem. <hi rend="italic">-dl,</hi> honor, <hi
                    rend="italic">-dr,</hi> neuter <hi rend="italic">-adu</hi>; plural (1) <hi
                    rend="italic">-6m (-dm, -êm)</hi>; (2) <hi rend="italic">-irkal</hi>; (3) masc.
                    fem. -&lt;2rfcα√, neut. <hi rend="italic">-ana.</hi> These affixes serve for all
                    verbs and for each of the three tenses, except that, in the future, <hi
                    rend="italic">-adu</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-ana</hi> are replaced by <hi
                    rend="italic">-um (kkum).</hi> It is only in the formation of the tenses that
                    verbs differ, intransitive verbs generally indicating the present by <hi
                    rend="italic">-kir∙ (-kinr-),</hi> the past by <hi rend="italic">-d-, -nd-,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">-in-,</hi> and the future by <hi rend="italic">-v-
                    (-b-),</hi> and transitive verbs by the corresponding infixes, <hi rend="italic"
                    >-kkir- (-kkinr-), -it-∖(-nd-),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-pp-;</hi> but there
                    are numerous exceptions and seemingly anomalous formations. Other tenses and
                    moods are expressed with the aid of special affixes or auxiliary verbs. Causal
                    verbs are formed by various infixes <hi rend="italic">(-ppi-, -vi-, -ttu-),</hi>
                    and the passive by the auxiliary <hi rend="italic">pa&lt;lu,</hi> to fall, or by
                    <hi rend="italic">un,</hi> to eat, with a noun. The following four peculiarities
                    are characteristic of Tamil :—first, the tenseless negative form of the verb,
                    expressed by the infix <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which is elided before
                    dissimilar vow els; second, the predicative employment of two negative particles
                    <hi rend="italic">illei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">alla,</hi> the one denying
                    the existence or presence, the other denying the quality or essence; third, the
                    use of two sets of participles,—one, called adjective or relative participle,
                    which supplies the place of a relative clause, the language possessing no
                    relative pronouns, and an ordinary adverbial participle or gerund; and, fourth,
                    the practice of giving adjectives a verbal form by means of personal affixes,
                    which form may again be treated as a noun by attaching to it the declensional
                    terminations, thus: <hi rend="italic">pcriya,</hi> great; <hi rend="italic"
                    >periyôm,</hi> we are great; <hi rend="italic">periyômukku,</hi> to us who are
                    great. The old poetry abounds in verbal forms now obsolete. Adjectives, adverbs,
                    and abstract nouns are derived from verbs by certain affixes. All post-positions
                    were originally either nouns or verbal forms. <hi rend="italic">Oratio
                    indirecta</hi> is unknown in Tamil, as it is in all the othei’ Indian languages,
                    the gerund <hi rend="italic">enru&gt;</hi> being used, like iii in Sanskrit, to
                    indicate quotation. The structure of sentences is an exact counterpart of the
                    structure of words, inasmuch as that which qualifies always precedes that which
                    is qualified. Thus the attributive precedes the substantive, the substantive
                    precedes the preposition, the adverb precedes the verb, the secondary clause the
                    primary one, and the verb closes the sentence. The sentence, “Having called the
                    woman who had killed the child, he asked why she had committed such
                    infanticide,” runs in Tamil as follows :— Kulandeiyei kkonrupottavalei
                    afeippittu ni ên ippadi</p>
                <p>The child her who had killed having caused to be called, “Thou why thus ppatta
                    sisu-v-atti seydây ênru kêttân.</p>
                <p>made child-murder didst?” having said he asked.</p>
                <p>Much as the similarity of the structure of the Tamil and its sister languages to
                    that of the Ugro-Tartar class may have proved suggestive of the assumption of a
                    family affinity between the two classes, such an affinity, if it exist, must be
                    held to be at least very distant, inasmuch as the assumption receives but the
                    faintest shade of support from an intercomparison of the radical and least
                    variable portion of the respective languages.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literature.—</hi> The early existence, in southern India, of
                    peoples, localities, animals, and products the names of which, as mentioned in
                    the Old Testament and in Greek and Roman writers, have been identified with
                    corresponding Dravidian terms goes far to prove the high antiquity, if not of
                    the Tamil language, at least of some form of Dravidian speech (Caldwell, <hi
                    rend="italic">loc. cit.,</hi> Introd., pp. 81- 106; <hi rend="italic">Madras
                    District Manual,</hi> i., Introd., p. 134 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> But
                    practically the earliest extant records of the Tamil language do not ascend
                    higher than the middle of the 8th century of the Christian era, the grant in
                    possession of the Israelites at Cochin being assigned by the late Dr Burnell to
                    about 750 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> a period when Malayâlma did not exist
                    yet as a separate language. There is every probability that about the same time
                    a number of Tamil works sprung up, which are mentioned by a writer in the 11th
                    century as representing the old literature (Burnell, <hi rend="italic">loc.
                    cit.,</hi> p. 127, note). The earlier of these may have been Saiva books; the
                    more prominent of the others were decidedly Jaina. Though traces of a north
                    Indian influence are palpable in all of them that have come down to us (see, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> F. W. Ellis’s notes to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rural),</hi> we can at the same time perceive, as we must certainly appreciate,
                    the desire of the authors to oppose the influence of Brahmanical writings, and
                    create a literature that should rival Sanskrit books and appeal to the
                    sentiments of the people at large. But the refinement of the poetical language,
                    as adapted to the genius of Tamil, has been carried to greater excess than in
                    Sanskrit; and this artificial character of the so-called High-Tamil is evident
                    from a comparison with the old inscriptions, which are a reflex of the language
                    of the people, and clearly show that Tamil has not undergone any essential
                    change these 800 years (Burnell, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.,</hi> p. 142). The
                    rules of High-Tamil appear to have been fixed at a very early date. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Tolkdppiyam,</hi> the oldest extant Tamil grammar, is assigned by
                    Dr Burnell <hi rend="italic">(On the Aindra School of Sanskrit Grammarians,</hi>
                    pp. 8, 55) to the 8th century (best edition by C. Y. Tâmodaram Pillei, Madras,
                    1885). The <hi rend="italic">Vîrasoliyam,</hi> another grammar, is of the 11th
                    century. Both have been superseded by the <hi rend="italic">Nannul,</hi> of the
                    15th century, which has exercised the skill of numerous commentators, and
                    continues to be the leading native authority (English editions in Pope’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Third Tamil Grammar,</hi> and an abridgment by Lazarus, 1884). The
                    period of the prevalence of the Jainas in the Panclya kingdom, from the 9th or
                    10th to the 13th century, is justly termed the Augustan age of Tamil literature.
                    To its earlier days is assigned the <hi rend="italic">Ndladiyar,</hi> an ethical
                    poem on the three objects of existence, which is supposed to have preceded the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rural</hi> of Tiruvalluvan, the finest poetical production in
                    the whole range of Tamil composition. Tradition, in keeping with the spirit of
                    antagonism to Brahmanical influence, says that its author was a pariah priest.
                    It consists of 1330 stanzas on virtue, wealth, and pleasure. It has often been
                    edited, translated, and commented upon; see the introduction to the excellent
                    edition, just published, by the Rev. Dr Pope, in which also a comprehensive
                    account of the peculiarities of High-Tamil will be found. To the Avvei, or
                    Matron, a reputed sister of Tiruvalluvan, but probably of a later date, two
                    shorter moral poems, called <hi rend="italic">Λttisddi</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ronreiveyndan,</hi> are ascribed, which are still read in all
                    Tamil schools. <hi rend="italic">Chintdmani,</hi> an epic of upwards of 3000
                    stanzas, which celebrates the exploits of a King Jιvakan, also belongs to that
                    early Jain period, and so does the <hi rend="italic">Divαkaram,</hi> the oldest
                    dictionary of classical Tamil. The former is one of the finest poems in the
                    language; but no more than the first and part of the third of its thirteen books
                    have been edited and translated. Kamban’s <hi rend="italic">Rdmayanam</hi>
                    (about 1100 A.D.) is the only other Tamil epic -which comes up to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chintdmani</hi> in poetical beauty. The most brilliant of the
                    poetical productions which appeared in the period of the Saiva revival (13th and
                    14th centuries) are two collections of hymns addressed to Siva, the one called
                    <hi rend="italic">Tiruvasakam,</hi> by Mânikka-Vâsakan, and a later and larger
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n53/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0053-0044"/> one called <hi rend="italic">Tîvdram,</hi> by
                    Sambandhan and two other devotees, Sundaran and Appan. Both these collections
                    have been printed, the former in one, the latter in five volumes. They are
                    rivalled both in religious fervour and in poetical merit by a contemporaneous
                    collection of Vaishnava hymns, the <hi rend="italic">Nâlâyira-prabandham</hi>
                    (also printed at Madras). The third section of it, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tiruvâyrnolj,</hi> or “Words of the Sacred Mouth,” has lately been published in
                    Telugu characters, with ample commentaries, in ten quartos (Madras, 1875-76).
                    After a period of literary torpor, which lasted nearly two centuries, King
                    Vallabha Deva, better known by his assumed name Ativîrarâma Pândiyan (second
                    half of the 16th century), endeavoured to revive the love of poetry by
                    compositions of his own, the most celebrated of which are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Neid,adam,</hi> a somewhat extravagant imitation of Sri Harsha’s Sanskrit <hi
                    rend="italic">Nαishαdkam,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Veppivêpkci,</hi> a
                    collection of sententious maxims. Though he had numerous followers, who made
                    this revival the most prolific in the whole history of Tamil literature, none of
                    the compositions of every kind, mainly translations and bombastic imitations of
                    Sanskrit models, have attained to any fame. An exceptional place, however, is
                    occupied by certain Tamil sectarians called <hi rend="italic">sittar (i.e.,
                    siddhas</hi> or sages), whose mystical poems, especially those contained in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sivavdkyam,</hi> are said to be of singular beauty. Two poems
                    of high merit, composed at the end of the 17th century, also deserve favourable
                    notice—the <hi rend="italic">Nitineri-vilakkam,</hi> an ethical treatise by
                    Kumâragurupara Desikan, and the <hi rend="italic">Prabhulingalllei,</hi> a
                    translation from the Canarese of a famous text-book of the Vira-Saiva sect. See
                    the analysis in W. Taylor’s <hi rend="italic">Catalogue,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    837-47.</p>
                <p>The modern period, which may be said to date from the beginning of the last
                    century, is ushered in by two great poets, one native and the other foreign.
                    Tâyumânavan, a philosopher of the pantheistic school, composed 1453 stanzas <hi
                    rend="italic">{ρddαl)</hi> which have a high reputation for sublimity both of
                    sentiment and style; and the Italian Jesuit Joseph Beschi (d. 1742), under the
                    name Vîramâmuni, elaborated, on the model of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chintâmani,</hi> a religious epic <hi rend="italic">Têmbâvani,</hi> which,
                    though marred by blemishes of taste, is classed by native critics among the best
                    productions of their literature. It treats of the history of St Joseph, and has
                    been printed at Pondicherry in three volumes, with a full analysis. English
                    influence has here, as in Bengal and elsewhere in India, greatly tended to
                    create a healthier tone in literature both as to style and sentiment. As one of
                    the best Tamil translations of English books in respect of diction and idiom may
                    be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Bâlavyâpâ-rikal,</hi> or “Little Merchants,”
                    published by the Vernacular Text Society, Madras. P. Percival’s collection of
                    <hi rend="italic">Tamil proverbs</hi> (3d ed., 1875) should also be mentioned.
                    The copper-plate grants, commonly called <hi rend="italic">sâsanams,</hi> and
                    stone inscriptions in Tamil, many of which have been copied and translated <hi

                    Madras,</hi> vols, i., ii.), are the only authentic historical records. (See
                    also Sir Walter Elliot’s contribution to the <hi rend="italic">International
                    Numismata Orientalia,</hi> vol. iii. pt. 2.) As early as the time of the Chinese
                    traveller Hwen Tsang, books were written in southern India on talipot leaves,
                    and Albiruni mentions this custom as quite prevalent in his time (1031). It has
                    not died out even at the present day, though paper imported from Portugal has,
                    during the last three centuries, occasionally been used. Madras is now the
                    largest depository of Tamil palm-leaf MSS., which have been described in
                    Wilson’s <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Mackenzie Collection</hi> (Calcutta,
                    1828, 2 vols.), W. Taylor’s <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> (Madras, 1857, 3
                    vols.), and Condaswamy Iyer’s <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> (vol. i., Madras,
                    1861). The art of printing, however, which was introduced in southern India at
                    an early date, while it has tended to the preservation of many valuable
                    productions of the ancient literature, has also been the means of perpetuating
                    and circulating a deal of literary rubbish and lasciviousness which would much
                    better have remained in the comparatively safe obscurity of manuscript. Dr
                    Burnell has a note in his <hi rend="italic">Elements of South Indian
                    Paleography</hi> (2d ed., p. 44), from which it appears that in 1578 Tamil types
                    were cut by Father Joäo de Faria, and that a hundred years later a Tamil and
                    Portuguese dictionary was published at Àmbalakkâdu. At present the number of
                    Tamil books (inclusive of newspapers) printed annually far exceeds that of the
                    other Dravidian vernaculars put together. The earliest Tamil version of the New
                    Testament was commenced by the Dutch in Ceylon in 1688; Fabricius’s translation
                    appeared at Tranquebar in 1715. Since then many new translations of the whole
                    Bible have been printed, and some of them have passed through several editions.
                    The German missionary B. Ziegenbalg was the first to make the study of Tamil
                    possible in Europe by the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Grammatica
                    Damulica,</hi> which appeared at Halle in 1716. Some time later the Jesuit
                    father Beschi devoted much time and labour to the composition of grammars both
                    of the vulgar and the poetical dialect. The former is treated in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Grammatica Latino-Tamulica,</hi> which was written in 1728, but
                    was not printed till eleven years later (Tranquebar, 1739). It was twice
                    reprinted, and two English translations have been published (1831, 1848). His
                    <hi rend="italic">Sen-Tamil Grammar,</hi> accessible since 1822 in an English
                    translation by Dr Babington, was printed from his own MS. <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Clavis humaniorum litterarum sublimioris Tamulici idiomatis)</hi> at
                    Tranquebar in 1878. This work is especially valuable, as the greater portion of
                    it consists of a learned and exhaustive treatise on Tamil prosody and rhetoric.
                    (See, on his other works, GrauΓs <hi rend="italic">R,eise,</hi> vol. iv. p.
                    327.) There are also grammars by Anderson, Rhenius, Graul (in vol. ii. of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Tamulica,</hi> Leipsic, 1855), Lazarus (Madras,
                    1878), Pope (4th edition in three parts, London, 1883-5), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grammaire Française-Tamoule,</hi> by the Abbé Dupuis, Pondicherri, 1863. The
                    last two are by far the best. The India Office library possesses a MS.
                    dictionary and grammar “par le Rév. Père Dominique” (Pondicherri, 1843), and a
                    copy of a MS. Tamil-Latin dictionary by the celebrated missionary Schwarz, in
                    which 9000 words are explained. About the like number of words are given in the
                    dictionary of Fabricius and Breithaupt (Madras, 1779 and 1809). Rottler’s
                    dictionary, the publication of which was commenced in 1834, is a far more
                    ambitious work. But neither it nor Winslow’s (1862) come up to the standard of
                    Tamil scholarship; the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Tamoul-Français,</hi>
                    which appeared at Pondicherri in 2 vols. (1855— 62), is superior to both, just
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Didionarium Latino-Gallico-Tamulicum {ibid.,</hi> 1846)
                    excels the various English-Tamil dictionaries which have been published at
