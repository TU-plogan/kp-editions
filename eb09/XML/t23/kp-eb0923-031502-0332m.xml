                    <hi rend="italic">noblesse Tepee,</hi> though he gives no particulars except of
                    those who had for some generations been <hi rend="italic">noblesse de robe.</hi>
                    He and his were closely connected by birth, marriage, and friendship with
                    several of those great legal families—the Harlays, the Huraults, the Brularts,
                    the Lamoignons, and others—which for many generations furnished France with by
                    far her most valuable class of public men. The historian’s father was Christophe
                    de Thou, first president of the parlement of Paris, a man whose strong legal and
                    religious prejudices against the Huguenots have rather obscured, in the eyes of
                    historians, his undoubted ability and probity. Christophe’s brothers, Adrien and
                    Nicolas, were both men of mark, the former being also a lawyer, and the latter
                    ultimately becoming bishop of Chartres, in which capacity he “instructed” Henry
                    IV. at his conversion. De Thou’s mother was Jacqueline Tuleu, dame de Céli. He
                    was a delicate child, and seems by his own account to have been rather neglected
                    by his parents; perhaps it was for this reason that, though he grew stronger
                    with age, he was destined for the church. He took minor orders, and obtained
                    some benefices. It was, however, to the legal side of the ecclesiastical
                    profession that he was devoted, and, after being at school at the Collège de
                    Bourgogne, he studied law at Orleans, Bourges, and Valence, being at the last
                    two places under the tuition of jurists no less celebrated than Hotman and
                    Cujas. It was not, however, till he approached middle life that he definitely
                    renounced the clerical profession, married, and accepted lay offices. Meanwhile
                    he had travelled much and discharged important duties. In 1573, that he might
                    profit by seeing foreign parts, he was attached to the suite of Paul de Foix,
                    who was sent on a circular mission of compliment to the Italian princes, and
                    with him De Thou visited Turin, Milan, Mantua, Venice, Rome, Florence, and many
                    minor places. On his return he studied for four years, travelling to the
                    Netherlands in the interval, and in 1579 to Germany. Two years later he was
                    appointed to a royal commission in Guienne, and made the acquaintance of Henry
                    of Navarre and of Montaigne. He had already become the friend of most of the
                    eminent men of letters of the time, from Ronsard downwards, and was particularly
                    intimate with Pierre Pithou, the soul of the future <hi rend="italic">Satire
                    Menippée.</hi> De Thou, by all his sympathies, belonged to that later and better
                    phase of the <hi rend="italic">politique</hi> party which devoted itself to the
                    maintenance of royalty as the one hope of France; and, when Henry III. was
                    driven from his capital by the violence of the Guises and the League, De Thou
                    followed him to Blois. After his renunciation of orders, he had been made,
                    first, master of requests, and then president à <hi rend="italic">mortier,</hi>
                    which was the highest dignity he ever attained. After the death of Henry III. he
                    attached himself closely to his successor, and in 1593 was appointed (he was a
                    great bibliophile) <hi rend="italic">grand</hi><hi rend="italic">maître</hi> of
                    the royal library, in succession to Amyot, the translator of Plutarch and
                    Longus. It was in this same year that he began his history, the composition of
                    which was interrupted, not only by his regular official duties, but by frequent
                    diplomatic missions at home and abroad. His most important employment of all was
                    on the commission which, in face of the greatest difficulties on both sides,
                    successfully carried through the negotiations for the edict of Nantes. Nor were
                    his duties as a diplomatist intermitted by the death of Henry IV., though the
                    Government of Marie de’ Medici refused him the place of <hi rend="italic"
                    >premier president</hi>-which he desired, and hurt his feelings by appointing
                    him instead a member of the financial commission which succeeded Sully. This
                    appointment he rather strangely chose to think a degradation. It is, however,
                    absurd to say that the affair, which he survived six years, had anything to do
                    with his death. That, as far as it was hastened by any mental affliction, seems
                    to have been rather due to grief at the death of his second wife, Gasparde de La
                    Châtre, of whom and of his sons and daughters by her (his first marriage with
                    Marie de Barbançon had been childless) he was extremely fond. His eldest son,
                    François Auguste, was the friend of Cinq Mars, and shared his downfall and fate.
                    But this was a quarter of a century after De Thou’s own death, which happened on
                    May 7, 1617.</p>
                <p>Although a distinguished ornament of France, De Thou has nothing to do, properly
                    speaking, with French literature. Besides minor works in Latin (a poem on
                    hawking, some paraphrases of the Bible, &amp;c. ), he wrote also in Latin the
                    great history which has made his name known. Entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historiae</hi><hi rend="italic">Sui Temporis,</hi> it begins shortly before the
                    author's birth (in 1546), and extends to 1607, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n333/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0333-0316"/> ten years before his death. The first part, in
                    eighteen books, was published in 1604; the second, third, and fourth appeared in
                    1606 and the two following years. The last part, which makes a total of 138
                    books, did not appear till 1620, under the care of the author’s friends Rigault
                    and Dupuy, whom he had named his literary executors. The first named likewise
                    put final touches to De Thou’s autobiography, which, also written in Latin,
                    appears in French in most collections of French memoirs. It contains minute
                    details of the author’s life down to 1607, mixed with rather miscellaneous
                    descriptions of interesting places which he had visited (such as Mont St Michel,
                    an eagle’s eyrie in Dauphiné, &amp;c. ); and its composition is said to have
                    been partly determined by the obloquy cast by bigoted adherents of the papacy on
                    the <hi rend="italic">History.</hi> De Thou was indeed obnoxious to these on
                    many grounds. He had helped to negotiate the edict of Nantes; he had opposed the
                    acknowledgment in France of the decrees of Trent; he had been a steady
                    Anti-Leaguer; and he was accused of speaking in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi> itself of Protestants and Protestantism, not merely with criminal
                    mildness, but with something like sympathy. It is needless to say that these
                    blots in the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> have seemed beauties to later and
                    more dispassionate students. There is no doubt that the charges of partiality on
                    minor and mostly personal points are either disprovable or unimportant; and the
                    whole seems to be as fair and as carefully accurate as at such a time was
                    possible. On the other hand, the work is undoubtedly planned and executed on
                    much too large a scale, and the inclusion of events in foreign countries, on
                    which the author was often but ill-informed, has not improved it. But it is
                    clearly and on the whole excellently written, and will always be, as far as any
                    general contemporary history can be so called, the great authority for at least
                    the French part of its subject and period. It was first published as a whole
                    when, as above mentioned, the last part appeared in 1620, and it was several
                    times reprinted. More than a hundred years later, in 1733, an Englishman, Samuel
                    Buckley, working in part on the materials of Thomas Carte, produced at London
                    what is recognized as the standard edition of the original, in 7 vols, folio.
                    The standard French translation was made immediately afterwards by a group of
                    literary men, the best knoλvn of whom were the Abbé Desfontaines and Prévost,
                    the author of <hi rend="italic">Manon</hi><hi rend="italic">Lescaut.</hi> A
                    choice copy of the first edition of the first part, with the arms of Henry IV.
                    on the binding, is in the British Museum library.</p>
