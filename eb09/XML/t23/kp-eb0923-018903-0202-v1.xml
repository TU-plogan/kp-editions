                    name still most commonly given to the whole group throughout Britain from their
                    long wings, forked tail, and marine habit. In Willughby’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ornithologia</hi> (1676), however, the word Tern is used for more than one
                    species, and, though it does not appear in the older English dictionaries, it
                    may well have been from early times as general a name as it is now.</p>
                <p>Setting aside those which are but occasional visitors to the British Islands, six
                    species of Terns may be regarded as indigenous, though of them one has ceased
                    from ordinarily breeding in the United Kingdom, while a second has become so
                    rare and regularly appears in so few places that mention of them must for
                    prudence sake be avoided. This last is the beautiful Roseate Tern, <hi
                        rend="italic">Sterna dοugalli;</hi> the other is the Black Tern, <hi
                        rend="italic">Hydrochelidon nigra,</hi> belonging to a genus in which the
                    toes are only half-webbed, of small size and dark leaden grey plumage. It is
                    without doubt the <hi rend="italic">Sterna</hi> of Turner, and in former days
                    was abundant in many parts of the fen country,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was known there as Carr-Swallow,
                            Carr-Crow (corrupted into “Scarecrow ”), and Blue Dar <hi rend="italic"
                                >(qu.</hi> = Daw ?).</p></note> to say nothing of other districts.
                    Though nearly all its ancient abodes have been drained, and for its purposes
                    sterilized these many years past, not a spring comes but it shows itself in
                    small companies in the eastern counties of England, evidently seeking a
                    breedingplace. All around the coast the diminution in the numbers of the
                    remaining species of Terns within the last 50 years is no less deplorable than
                    demonstrable.</p>
                <p>The Sandwich Tern, <hi rend="italic">S. sandvicensis</hi> or £ <hi rend="italic"
                        >cantiaca—</hi> named from the place of its discovery, though it has long
                    since ceased to inhabit that neighbourhood—is the largest of the British
                    species, equalling in size the smaller Gulls and having a dark-coloured bill
                    tipped with yellow, and dark legs. Through persecution it has been exterminated
                    in all its southern haunts, and is become much scarcer in those to which it
                    still resorts. It was, however, never so abundant as its smaller congeners, the
                    so-called Common and the Arctic Tern, —two species that are so nearly alike as
                    to be beyond discrimination on the wing by an ordinary observer, and even in the
                    hand require a somewhat close examination.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Linnaeus’s diagnosis of his <hi rend="italic">Sterna
                                hirundο</hi> points to his having had an “Arctic” Tern before him;
                            but it is certain that he did not suspect that specific appellation
                            (already used by other writers for the ‘ ‘ Common” Tern) to cover a
                            second species. Some modern authorities disregard his name as being
                            insufficiently definite, and much is to be said for this view of the
                            case. Undoubtedly ‘ <hi rend="italic">himndo”</hi> has now been used so
                            indiscriminately for one species or the other as to cause confusion,
                            which is perhaps best avoided by adopting the epithets of Nau mann <hi
                                rend="italic">(Isis,</hi> 1819, pp. 1847, 1848), who, acting on and
                            confirming the discovery of Nitzsch (who first detected the specific
                            difference), called the southern species »S', <hi rend="italic"

                            notwithstanding.</p></note> The former of these has the more southern
                    range, and often affects inland situations, while the latter, though by no means
                    limited to the Arctic circle, is widely distributed over the north and mostly
                    resorts to the seacoast. Yet there are localities where, as on the Farne
                    Islands, both meet and breed, without occupying stations apart. The minute
                    diagnosis of these two species cannot be briefly given. It must suffice here to
                    state that the most certain difference, as it is the most easily recognizable,
                    is to be found in the tarsus, which in the Arctic Tem is a quarter of an inch
                    shorter than in its kinsman. The remaining native species is the Lesser Tern,
                        <hi rend="italic">S. minuta,</hi> one of the smallest of the genus and
                    readily to be distinguished by its permanently white forehead. All the species
                    already mentioned, except the Black Tern, have much the same general coloration—
                    the adults in summer plumage wearing a black cap and having the upper parts of
                    the body and wings of a more or less pale grey, while they are mostly lighter
                    beneath. They generally breed in association, often in the closest
                    proximity—their nests, containing 3 eggs at most, being made on the shingle or
                    among herbage. The young are hatched clothed in variegated down, and remain in
                    the nest for some time. At this season the parents are almost regardless of
                    human presence and expose themselves freely.</p>
                <p>At least half-a-dozen other species have been recorded as occurring in British
                    waters, and among them the Caspian Tern, <hi rend="italic">S. caspia</hi><hi
                        rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> which is one of the largest of the genus and
                    of wide distribution, though not breeding nearer to the shores of England than
                    on Sylt and its neighbouring islands, which still afford lodging for a few
                    pairs. Another, the Gull-billed Tern, <hi rend="italic">S. anglica,</hi> has
                    also been not unfrequently shot in England. All these species are now
                    recognized, though the contrary was once maintained, as inhabitants of North
                    America, and many go much further.</p>
                <p>An excellent synopsis of the Sub-family <hi rend="italic">Sterninae</hi> has been
                    given by Mr Howard Saunders in the Zoological <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi>
                    (1876, pp. 638-672). He recognizes 5 genera, <hi rend="italic"
                        >—Hydrochelidon</hi> (with 3 species), <hi rend="italic">Sterna</hi> (with
                    38), <hi rend="italic">Naenia,</hi> a very aberrant form consisting of but one
                    species, the Inca Tern, peculiar to the western coast of South America, and <hi
                        rend="italic">Gygis,</hi> composed of 2 species of purely white birds and
                    restricted to the southern hemisphere; his fifth genus is <hi rend="italic"
                        >Anous,</hi> to which belong the various species of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Noddy</hi> (vol. xvii. p. 531). Often confounded with these last are the
                    two species called in books Sooty Terns (N. <hi rend="italic">fuliginosa</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">S. anaestheta),</hi> but by sailors “Egg-birds” or
                    “Wideawakes” from their cry. These crowd at certain seasons in innumerable
                    multitude to certain islands within the tropics, where they breed, and the
                    wonderful assemblage at present known as “Wide-awake fair” on the island of
                    Ascension has been more or less fully described from very ancient times. Dampier
                    in his voyage to New Holland in 1699 particularly described and figured the
                    Sooty Tern <hi rend="italic">( Voyages,</hi> iii. p. 142), discriminating it
                    from the Noddy, from, which it had not before been distinguished. <hi
