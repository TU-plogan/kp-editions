                    large scale, and possesses all the essential characters of the genus as defined
                    in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> (vol. xv. p. 434). It belongs
                    to the section in which the pupil of the eye contracts under the stimulus of
                    light into a round spot and not a vertical slit, and in which the hyoid bone is

                    instead of by a continuous chain of bones. In these points it agrees with the
                    lion and the leopard and differs from the common cat. Almost everything that is
                    said in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Lion</hi> (vol. xiv. pp. 680-681) of
                    the structure of the skeleton, teeth, and claws of that animal will apply
                    equally well to the tiger, the difference between the two lying mainly in the
                    skin and its coverings. There are, however, slight distinctions in the
                    proportionate size of the lower teeth, the general form of the cranium, and the
                    relative length of the nasal bones and ascending processes of the <hi
                    rend="underline">maxi 11</hi> a,ries by which the skull of the lion and tiger
                    can be easily discriminated by the practised observer.</p>
                <p>Although examples of both species present considerable variations in size, and
                    reliance cannot always be placed upon alleged dimensions, especially when taken
                    from skins stripped from the body, it seems well ascertained that the length of
                    the largest-sized Bengal tiger may exceed that of any lion. Larger specimens are
                    certainly recorded, but 10 feet from the tip of the nose to the end of the tail
                    is, according to Jerdon, an unusual length for a large male tiger. The female is
                    somewhat smaller and has a 1ighter and narrower head. The tiger has no mane, but
                    in old males the hair of the cheeks is rather long and spreading. The ground
                    colour of the upper and outer parts of the head, body, limbs, and tail is a
                    bright rufous fawn, and these parts are beautifully marked with transverse
                    stripes of a dark, almost black colour. The markings vary much in different
                    individuals, and even on the two sides of the same individual. The under parts
                    of the body, the inside of the limbs, the cheeks, and a large spot over each eye
                    are nearly white. The tigers which inhabit hotter regions, as Bengal and the
                    south Asiatic islands, have shorter and smoother hair, and are more richly
                    coloured and distinctly striped than those of northern China and Siberia, in
                    which the fur is longer, softer, and lighter coloured.</p>
                <p>The tiger is exclusively Asiatic, but has a very wide range in that continent,
                    having been found in almost all suitable 1ocalities south of a line drawn from
                    the river Euphrates, passing along the southern shores of the Caspian and Sea of
                    Aral by Lake Baikal to the Sea of Okhotsk. Its most northern range is the
                    territory of the Amur, its most southern the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Bali.
                    Westward it reaches to Turkish Georgia and eastward to the island of Saghalin.
                    It is absent, however, from the great elevated plateau of Central Asia, nor does
                    it inhabit Ceylon, Borneo, or the other islands of the Indo-Malayan Archipelago,
                    except those named.</p>
                <p>The principal food of the tiger in India is cattle, deer, wild hog, and pea-fowl,
                    and occasionally human beings. The regular “man-eater” is generally an old tiger
                    whose vigour is passed, and whose teeth are worn and defective; it takes up its
                    abode in the neighbourhood of a village, the population of which it finds an
                    easier prey than the larger or wilder animals named above. Though chiefly
                    affecting grassy plains or swamps, it is also found in forests, and seems to be
                    fond of haunting the neighbourhood of old ruins. As a rule, tigers do not climb
                    trees; but when pressed by fear, as during an inundation, they have been known
                    to do so. They take to the water readily and are good swimmers. The tigers of
                    the Sundarbans (Ganges delta) continually swim from one island to the other to
                    change their hunting-grounds for deer. The following extract from Sir J.
                    Fayrer’s <hi rend="italic">Royal Tiger of Bengal</hi> (1875) may complete this
                    notice of the tiger’s habits.</p>
                <p>“The tigress gives birth to from two to five, even six cubs; but three is a
                    frequent number. She is a most affectionate and attached mother, and generally
                    guards and trains her young with the most watchful solicitude. They remain with
                    her until nearly full-grown, or about the second year, when they are able to
                    kill for themselves and begin life on their own account. Whilst they remain with
                    her she is peculiarly vicious and aggressive, defending them with the greatest
                    courage and energy, and when robbed of them is terrible in her rage; but she has
                    been known to desert them when pressed, and even to eat them when starved. As
                    soon as they begin to require other food than her milk, she kills for them,
                    teaching them to do so for themselves by practising on small animals, such as
                    deer and young calves or pigs. At these times she is wanton and extravagant in
                    her cruelty, killing apparently for the gratification of her ferocious and
                    bloodthirsty nature, and perhaps to excite and instruct the young ones, and it
                    is not until they are thoroughly capable of killing their own food that she
                    separates from them. The young tigers are far more destructive than the old.
                    They will kill three or four cows at a time, whilst the older and more
                    experienced rarely kill more than one, and this at intervals of from three or
                    four days to a week. For this purpose the tiger will leave its retreat in the
                    dense jungle, proceed to the neighbourhood of a village or gowrie, where cattle
                    feed, and during the night will steal on and strike down a bullock, drag it into
                    a secluded place, and then remain near the “murrie,” or “kill,” for several
                    days, until it has eaten it, when it will proceed in search of a further supply,
                    and, having found good hunting ground in the vicinity of a village or gowrie,
                    continue its ravages, destroying one or two cows or buffaloes a week. It is very
                    fond of the ordinary domestic cattle, which in the plains of India are generally
                    weak, half-starved, under-sized creatures. One of these is easily struck down
                    and carried or dragged off. The smaller buffaloes are also easily disposed of;
                    but the buffalo bulls, and especially the wild ones, are formidable antagonists,
                    and have often been known to beat the tiger off, and even to wound him
                    seriously.” (W. H. F.)</p>
