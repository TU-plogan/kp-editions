                    of the sixteen compartimenti of the kingdom of Italy, contains eight provinces—
                    Arezzo, Florence, Grosseto, Leghorn, Lucca, Massa-Carrara, Pisa, and Siena—and
                    has an area of 9287 square miles, with a population of 2,208,869 in 1881. In
                    1859, immediately before it united with the kingdom of Sardinia, the grand-duchy
                    of Tuscany, exclusive of Massa-Carrara, which then belonged to Modena, but
                    including the islands of Gorgona, Elba, Pianosa, Formica, Montecristo, Giglio,
                    and Gianutra, as well as the duchy of Lucca (united to it <pb break="no"

                    population of 1,806,940. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Italy,</hi> vol. xiii. pp.
                    489-490.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Etruria</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>) was finally
                    annexed to Rome in 351 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rome),</hi> and constituted the seventh of the eleven regions into which Italy
                    was, for administrative purposes, divided by Augustus. Under Constantine it was
                    united into one province with Umbria, an arrangement which subsisted until at
                    least 400, as the <hi rend="italic">Notitia</hi> speaks of a “consularis Tusciae
                    et Umbriae.” In Ammianus Marcellinus there is implied a distinction between
                    “Tuscia suburbicaria” and “Tuscia annonaria,” the latter being that portion
                    which lies to the north of the Arno. After the fall of the Western empire
                    Tuscia, with other provinces of Italy, came successively under the sway of
                    Herulians, Ostrogoths, and Greek and Lombard dukes. Under the last-named,
                    “Tuscia Langobardorum,” comprising the districts of Viterbo, Corneto, and
                    Bolsena, was distinguished from “Tuscia Regni,” which lay more to the north.
                    Under Charlemagne the name of Tuscia or Toscana became restricted to the latter
                    only. One of the earliest of the Frankish marquises was Boniface, either first
                    or second of that name, who about 828 fought with success against the Saracens
                    in Africa. Adalbert I., who succeeded him, in 878 espoused the cause of Carloman
                    as against his brother Louis III. of France, and suffered excommunication and
                    imprisonment in consequence. Adalbert II. (the Rich), who married the ambitious
                    Bertha, daughter of Lothair, king of Lorraine, took a prominent part in the
                    politics of his day. A subsequent marquis, Hugo (the Great), became also duke of
                    Spoleto in 989. The male line of marquises ended with Boniface II. (or III.),
                    who was murdered in 1052. His widow, Beatrice, in 1055 married Godfrey, duke of
                    Lorraine, and governed the country till her death in 1076, when she was
                    succeeded by <hi rend="smallcaps">Matilda</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.</hi>), her
                    only child by her first husband. Matilda died in 1114 without issue, bequeathing
                    all her extensive possessions to the church. The consequent struggle between the
                    popes, who claimed the inheritance, and the emperors, who maintained that the
                    countess had no right to dispose of imperial fiefs, enabled the principal cities
                    of Tuscany gradually to assert their independence and govern themselves under
                    consuls and elders of their own selection. The most important of these Tuscan
                    republics or self-governed communes were Florence, Pisa, Siena, Arezzo, Pistoia,
                    and Lucca. Some account of the manner in which they were all gradually absorbed
                    by Florence will be found under <hi rend="smallcaps">Florence</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Medici.</hi> The title of grand-duke of Tuscany was conferred
                    on Cosmo de’ Medici by Pius V. in 1567, and the emperor (Maximilian II.), after
                    withholding his consent for some years, ultimately confirmed it to Cosmo’s
                    successor in 1576. In 1735, in view of the childlessness of Giovan Gastone, the
                    last of the Medici, the succession of Francis, duke of Lorraine, afterwards
                    emperor F rancis I., was arranged for by treaty. In 1765 he was succeeded as
                    grand-duke by his second son Leopold (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Leopold</hi>
                    II.), who, on becoming emperor in 1790, handed Tuscany over to his second son
                    Ferdinand, third grand-duke of the name. The duchy was occupied by the French in
                    1799, ceded to Louis, prince of Parma, by the convention of Madrid in 1801, and
                    annexed to the French empire in 1808. Ferdinand, however, was reinstated in
                    1814, and on his death in 1824 was succeeded by his son Leopold, second
                    grand-duke of the name, who was deposed by the constituent assembly on 16th
                    August 1860. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Italy.</hi></p>
