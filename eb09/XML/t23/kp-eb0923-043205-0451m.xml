                    >Yedo,</hi> the present capital of the empire of Japan, is situated in 35° 4Γ N.
                    lat. and 139° 46' E. long., at the head of the bay of the same name, on the
                    south-east coast of Hondo (mainland), the largest of the group of Japanese
                    islands. It is connected with the seaport of Yokohama by a railway 18 miles in
                    length. The bay of Tokio is shallow, and therefore not well suited for the
                    navigation of large vessels. The wide river Sumida, also called Ôkawa (“great
                    river”) near its mouth, runs through the town. For administrative purposes Tokio
                    proper is divided into fifteen <hi rend="italic">ku</hi> (districts), of which
                    thirteen lie to the west and two to the east of the Sumida. Each ku is presided
                    over by an official appointed by the Government, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ku-chio</hi> (chief of the ku), and an assembly (Ku-Kwai) for local
                    administrative purposes is elected every four years by the inhabitants. These ku
                    and <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n452/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0452-0433"/> six <hi rend="italic">gun</hi> (suburban
                    districts) collectively form the Tokio-Fu, and are under the general
                    superintendence of <hi rend="italic">fjoe, fu-chiji</hi> (governor). Matters
                    affecting the interests of the whole fu are discussed by an assembly (Fu-Kwai)
                    composed of representatives from all the ku and gun. Order is maintained by a
                    well-organized body of police (3648 men in 1885) under the command of a <hi
                    rend="italic">keishisokan</hi> (chief commissioner), who, like the fu-chiji, is
                    responsible to the central Government. Since the establishment of this system
                    crime has very materially decreased. There is also a fire brigade of 2000 men,
                    which is connected with the police system, and renders effective service in
                    checking the spread of the fires to which the town is peculiarly liable.
                    Buildings of brick and stone have lately been erected in many parts of the town.
                    The fifteen ku which form Tokio proper cover an area of 4 ’ 01 square <hi
                    rend="italic">ri,</hi> and the six gun 27'94 square ri, the whole fu thus
                    extending to about 32 square ri (about 190 square miles). The greater part of
                    the town is flat, particularly near the Sumida, and is intersected by numerous
                    moats and canals, which, with the bridges crossing them, form a distinctive
                    feature. There are hills varying in height from 50 to 100 feet in the six
                    districts of</p>
                <p>Kongo, Koishikawa, Ushigome, Yotsuya, Akasaka, Azabu, and in part of Shiba. The
                    numerous residences of the old daimios were the chief characteristics of the
                    town, especially in the Kôjimachi-ku. Many of these have been de-mólished and
                    Government offices erected on their sites; some have given place to new streets
                    and houses; others, having survived the downfall of the shogunate, still remain
                    surrounded by large gardens, which are celebrated for their elaborate rock-work,
                    artificial lakes, and magnificent trees. Nearly in the centre of the
                    Kôjimachi-ku, on an eminence, surrounded by moats, stood the residence of the
                    shoguns, which was burnt down in 1872. An imperial palace is now in course of
                    construction on this site. Outer moats connected with those already mentioned
                    enclose the whole Kôjimachi-ku and a greater portion of Kanda-ku; one of the
                    moats terminates at the Sumida. The Nihonbashi, Kiobashi, and Kanda-ku, through
                    which the Ö-dori (main street) passes, are the business quarters of the town.
                    The Nihonbashi (Bridge of Japan), in the ku of the same name, also in the
                    Õ-dori, is the centre from which all distances are calculated. Nearly all the
                    principal buildings of the city—such as the Gwaimushô (Foreign Office), the
                    Nai-mushô (Home Office), the Okurashô (Ministry of Finance), the Monbushô
                    (Ministry of Education), and other Government offices, &lt;fcc.—are situated in
                    those four ku. Among the parks, those of Shiba and Uyeno rank first in size and
                    beauty, the latter containing a large sheet of water. In 1868, when the imperial
                    army entered the city, a body of men called the shogitai, loyal to the cause of
                    Tokugawa, here made a last stand, and during the fighting the magnificent temple
                    of Tôyesau, on the hills of Uyeno, was burnt down. This park, as also the
                    Mukojima (the embankment of the Sumida), and the Asukayama park, which is at
                    some distance north-west of Uyeno, are celebrated for their sakura trees
                    (species of cherry), which, when in full bloom, attract crowds of all classes.
                    The famous temple of Kwannon (goddess of mercy) is in the Asakusa park, in which
                    a continual fair is held, with the usual accompaniments of booths, shows,
                    tea-houses, &amp;c. The districts of Fukagawa and Honjô lie on the east bank of
                    the river, and are connected with the rest of the town by five wooden bridges of
                    considerable length; they are intersected by numerous canals, and the streets
                    there are regularly laid out. The means of communication are imperfect; the
                    streets of Tokio are in general irregular, and many are so narrow that they are
                    unsuitable for carriages. The <hi rend="italic">jinrikisha,</hi> a kind of
                    chaise drawn by one or in some cases by two or more men, supplies their place to
                    a great extent. The introduction of tramways in some parts of the town has had
                    the good effect of diminishing the number of second-rate carriages drawn by
                    miserable horses.</p>
                <p>There are no reliable data as to the population of Yedo during the shogunate (see
                    below). Owing to the influx caused by the periodical visits of the daimios with
                    their numerous attendants, it probably exceeded one million during the early
                    part of the present century. At the abolition of the shogunate there was a
                    marked decrease, but the returns of recent years (1,121,560 in 1881; 1,173,603
                    in 1883; 1,300,073 in 1885) indicate a rapid increase. Of the 1,519,781 who
                    constituted the population in 1886, 1,211,357 are to be classed as belonging to
                    the town proper, and 308,424 to the six suburban districts. The sanitary
                    condition of the city leaves much to be desired, but extensive improvements are
                    now being carried out. The general health, however, is good, and the enforcement
                    of vaccination has virtually stamped out the scourge of small-pox. The deaths
                    from cholera are occasionally very numerous, especially among the lower
                    classes.</p>
                <p>A well-organized system of education exists, under the supervision of the
                    ministry of education. In 1885 there were in the Tokio-Fu 658 public and private
                    elementary schools, with 1563 teachers,—the cost of maintaining public schools
                    being 145,152 yen (Japanese dollars). In the same year the boys and girls of
                    school age numbered 172,653, of whom 77,001 attended schools recognized by the
                    Government. Kindergartens on the European system have been introduced. There are
                    also the <hi rend="italic">shihangakko</hi> (normal schools), the <hi
                    rend="italic">chugakkο</hi> (middle schools), and schools, both Government and
                    private, for special branches. In the district of Hongo is the imperial
                    university, subdivided into the four branches of law, science, medicine, and
                    literature. Many of the students attain a high degree of proficiency.</p>
                <p>No mention is made of Tokio in Japanese history before the end of the 12th
                    century. It appears to have assumed no importance till about 1457, when Ota
                    Dokwan, a general in the service of Uyesugi Sadamasa, governor of Kamakura,
                    built a castle there. About thirty years later the town fell into the hands of
                    Hôjô of Odawara, and subsequently, on his overthrow by Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu,
                    the castle was granted to the latter, who was the founder of the shogun house of
                    Tokugawa. In 1590 Iyeyasu made his formal entry into the castle of Yedo, the
                    extent of which he greatly enlarged. From this date the real importance of Yedo
                    commenced. The family of the Tokugawas furnished the shoguns (or tycoons) of
                    Japan for nearly three hundred years, and these resided during that period at
                    Yedo. Under them the town was vastly extended, land was reclaimed from the bay,
                    canals were constructed, and a water supply introduced. The shoguns compelled
                    the daimios (feudal lords) to reside at Yedo with their numerous retinues
                    during<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n453/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0453-0434"/> a considerable portion of their lives, and thus
                    the prosperity of the town rapidly increased. At the restoration of the supreme
                    authority of the emperor in 1868 the shogunate was abolished, and the population
                    of Yedo speedily decreased. A fresh vitality was again imparted by the transfer
                    of the court from Kioto, and the town then received its present name Tokio
                    (eastern capital). It has since been the seat of the imperial Government, and
                    may be considered the centre of the political, commercial, and literary activity
                    of Japan. It is the channel through which the stream of European civilization
                    pours into the country, and all recent progress has there taken its rise. (R. S.
